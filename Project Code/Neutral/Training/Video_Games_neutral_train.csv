"If you fell in love with Final Fantasy VII, like I did, and are so hungry for more that you are considering this game, I beg of you, don't do it. It is nothing like the aforementioned masterpiece. The story was slow to get going, which I was sympathetic to, since it was like that in FF VII too, but after hours it was still lame. For one thing, you have a ""military ranking"", and it goes down when you explore the towns! I mean come on, the whole point of an RPG is exploring! But that is not the worst part. The magic system has been redone, and it's HORRIBLE. Instead of the product-of-genius Materia system in FF VII, they have the ""draw system"". You have to collect magic spells, and use them, like petty items! This is, by far, the worst idea ever.

 And then there were the characters. After falling under the spell of Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth and all the rest, I felt like hiding under my blankets and sobbing after meeting Squall, Rinoa and the other lame characters. Their dialogue is lifeless and cheesy, and I didn't feel attached to them at all.

Although it's a small complaint, I must mention the graphics. The cutscenes are amazing and far better than FF VII's, but everything else is awful. The blocky, toon-like models of FF VII have been tossed out, replaced by characters that try to shove in the detail of real humans in tiny little models. The result? Stiffly animated, bland graphics.

Overall, do not buy this game. Buy Tales of Symphonia, Chrono Cross...anything. Please, do not waste your money. These are the parting words of a weeping gamer. Thank you.",2.0
"as you might have heard, this game was downright terrible. the only thing that kept me going was the story. in my personal opinion, the story is very exceptional and the many months of work they put into it paid off. before starting, i would like to comment that i was very excited to get this game after the two-in-a-row masterpieces final fantasy 6 and 7, and for the fact that it was created by squaresoft, but i was extremely disappointed after about one hour of gameplay. now onto the review...
STORY: 9/10
as you have most likely heard, people say that this storyline is based on the theme of love, when in many people's opinion (my own included), this game is anything BUT love. the only thing close to love that happens is **SPOILER**rinoa and squall kiss at the ending**END SPOILER**
which really isn't all that loveable in my opinion.
similar to final fantasy VII, the setting is in the future (irritating downside, as insanely advanced technology is not that fantasy-like), but this is a mediocre downside of the game
The story goes pretty much like this: an evil sorceress is on the verge of enslavement of the world and a resistance to defeat this woman called Garden trains military soldiers called SeeDs to battle against her and her troops. pretty lame sounding, as seed and garden are really actually one of those ideas that a first grader could come up with in about 5 minutes, but the story actually picks up at about disk three (yes it is pretty slow).
SOUND AND MUSIC 6.5/10
the sound is really quite good in this game. squall's sword slashes when hitting a target, quistis's whip cracks when snapping at a target, and Zell's mighty fists make smacking noises when hitting a target.
such as final fantasy VII, the music in here is not that well conceived and memorable such as the earlier final fantasys. the boss music is sort of catchy (once again such as final fantasy VII), but the rest of the music is rather annoying.
GAMEPLAY 2/10
the single thing that totally MAULS this game is the gameplay. the battling is terribly tedious, and the magic system is completely raped of its glory. instead of learning magic abilities, now you waste time ""drawing"" magic from enemies. another terrible mistake squaresoft made while making this game.
a new addition to the gameplay is the Guardian Forces (GF) which are pretty much summons just in a stupid term. these guardian forces are pretty much the only thing that will keep you alive in this game, as you need them to enhance health, strength, and so on, which i will get to in a moment. the guardian forces are the main attack force, and with these forces there is barely any need for the ""attack"" command (other than Zell's Duel limit break). The animations for guardian forces are well animated, but EXTREMELY long and tedious.
Limit breaks are the only other useful thing in this game, but unfortunately, they can only be accessed when you are in life-threatening situation, completely aboliting the well-conceived limit break bar.
MENUS AND PUT-TOGETHERS 1/10
this is terribly time-consuming and irritating. the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game. gladly, squaresoft got rid of the horrid materia system and added on the god-how-could-this-get-any-worse junction system. this system takes about a half of an hour just to understand, and then you spend even more precious hours of your life drawing magic upgrading it so a boss cannot kill you in just one blow. for example, you have to spend about an hour drawing 100 lifes from an enemy just so you can raise your health a couple thousand points.
then after this boring proccess you must draw 100 Tornados in order to raise your attack power (I am almost completely CERTAIN this process is required to defeat the final boss)
The second complete worst part of this game is the following: THERE IS NO LONGER AN EQUIP OPTION! what happened to equipping weapons and armor? there is a way to upgrade your weapon, but that consumes serious time and involves ridiculous side-quests that are extremely boring. don't even bother going through the stress of completing these quests
a ridiculous thing they did in this game is that the characters level up with you, so you can finish the game at level 8 or so (as leveling up is not necessary and bosses give you NO experience points{I completed it at level 7 or 8})
GRAPHICS 9.5/10
The best part of the game, the graphics. The FMV scenes are superior to every other graphics i have EVER seen in my entire life-span (yes including ps2 graphics), and even during gameplay the graphics are superior (during gameplay they are worse than ps2 graphics i might add), and the only flaw in them is the pixelations, as the characters look a bit fuzzy. but that problem is solved in FFIX.
You remember the disgustingly distorted characters in FFVII? well, thank god, they are replaced with actual human-like figures that look like HUMANS at last. no more stubby oversized arms and legs with huge heads that remind me of cartoons.
there is only one thing i love about this game, and it is the ending. as i said before, the story is VERY good and is the only reason that i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. the ending is EXTREMELY good (not as good as FFVI's though) and made me feel good.
REPLAY VALUE: 0/10
as many other people have done, as soon as i finished wasting my time playing this game and finally destroyed the final boss i took out the disk from my playstation, placed it in its case, placed in on a shelf behind my other cds, and it has not been touched ever since. this game was terrible, and i wish i had my 30 hours of gameplay back. i say instead of even thinking of buying this game, look for final fantasy anthology and final fantasy 6 instead.",2.0
"Let's just get one thing out of the way, the battle system in this game is bad. Very bad. There are much too many random battles, a lot of the time you're ""drawing"" magic from enemies (a HORRIBLE idea on square's part, it makes no sense and is extremely tedious) both to use and EQUIP it to your characters. Since the power of your equipped magic is based in the number you have, and all of your enemies have an unlimited number of the magics they're able to carry, you spend a LOT (a WHOLE lot, HOURS) of time just hitting that draw button and selecting which magic to get from them. Yeah, not fun, at all. Both the equipment and magic systems are bad. The new focus on summoned monsters as equippable characters which level up and gain skills to boost your character, such as strength upgrades or upgrades to themselves which boost their damage or HP, is really not fun at all, since there's zero strategy involved. You just level up and decide which skill they'll learn after enough battles. I easily blew through the first half of this game, killing bosses in a ludicrously low number of hits. I couldn't stand the second half, it was just more of the same, and the story line became very, very stupid. A select few will actually like this sappy love story mixed with something about a summoner going to destroy the world and some other junk that I just didn't care about. The love story was actually the best part, and the rest felt like a filler. There really isn't anything to praise about this game that separates it from previous Final Fantasy games. A sub-par RPG.",2.0
"Final Fantasy 7 and 9 are wonderful examples of how an essentially linear game can be manipulated and changed into something epic and enthralling, thanks to excellent characterisation and plot. Final Fantasy 8 (and, oddly enough, FF 10) are wonderful examples of how to bore people silly while forcing them to sit through some nice-looking battles.
For those gamers who, like me, need to like a character in order to fully appreciate the game's plot, let me say this: Squall is a moody, horrible, angst-ridden Phallocrat. His supporting cast are forgettable, with the exceptions of the consummately annoying Zell Dincht and the ridiculously feeble Rinoa Heartilly. The characters in FF 8 have none of the appeal of Cloud et al from FF 7, or Zidane and the lovable half-breeds from FF 9.
For gamers who don't consider this to be so important, FF 8 still manages to nicely ruin the Final Fantasy reputation by being one of the most boring and unrewarding games in the series. Battles are innumerable and completely random, and fall into 2 categories: extremely easy and unfairly difficult. Case in point; you face Seifer's two main flunkies early on in the game, by which stage your levels are too high to build up quickly on the feeble monsters available in the college & the surrounding areas, and too low to beat these henchmen without massive amounts of luck. The result? You end up running about doing frustrating battle with low-level wildebeests for hours, and the game becomes very, very boring.
The graphics are shamefully poorly-thought out. The pre-rendered backdrops for some of the major levels (Balamb Garden, Edea's House) are bland, and have none of the charm of the cityscapes of FF 7 or the magical countryside vistas of FF 9. The character models are far too complex, and look pixellated and rough at almost all angles. Polygon pop-up didn't die out with the Sega Saturn; it's alive and well and working for Squaresoft. The pre-renders, however, are amazing, approaching the quality of early PS 2 titles in their scale and realism.
The sound is run-of-the-mill poor PlayStation fare, but the music is decent enough. Better, too, is the Magic system, where, instead of spending hours confusing yourself with Materia, you now Junction Elementals and spells. Sadly, the game relies less on Magic and more on difficult Limit Break techniques and expensive items, so this really isn't a huge plus until late in the game.
All in all, FF 8 is a VERY disappointing game, lacking the freedom of exploration of FF 7 and 9. It's a game on wheels, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but when the plot and characters are so forgettable, it becomes a major problem. Steer clear.",2.0
"And, unfortunately, those words have rarely been more true than with this game.  While the graphics are incredible, the music good, and the story - on the surface - interesting, the game suffers from a few weak points.
Primarily, the three lead characters (all of whom are playable, if only for a brief time) are insufferably annoying.  One of them is desperately in need of heavy-duty therapy (or just pulling his head out of his self-pity), his rival (only playable for a short time) is arrogant, and their shared love interest, while at first just a little ditzy, is definitely not a very nice person, when you stop and think about what she does in the game.
As a secondary concern, having played all the FF games, I have to say that this is not the best story of the bunch.  Or the best game, for that matter.  SquareSoft would have been *much* better off focusing on their 'save the world' plot in FF8, rather than the love story (which would have been better used in FF7, frankly).  For a better example of a good SquareSoft game, go for FF9, or even FFX.  Both of which feature a focal love story that's actually fairly well done, as well as the more standard 'save the world' plot Final Fantasy is known for.",2.0
"After I had beaten Final Fantasy VIII, I couldn't wait to try the next game. When I started the game, the beginning movie was cool, but when it came to the actual gameplay, it was not worth what little I payed for it. The graphics are worse than the last game, and you can barely see the figures. The plot doesn't make much sense, and it makes the game not even worth playing. The battle and menu system is so complicated, that the tutorials will make you fall asleep. What I'm wondering is how this game can have absolutely no meaning to it while thae last one was kick-butt. If you don't believe me, try the game yourself (for your own sake, rent it).",2.0
"Well, I wish I could play some of these levels! Sometimes, that's made impossible because they're so dark. I wish it would save my game, too, but it never has. There are patches available for bigger mistakes on their site. I would give anything not to watch those grating cutscenes again and again. The voices are all quite annoying and stilted, though you get the sense the Eidos guys thought the old man at the beginning might have been - he gets tiresome immediately (my child this, my child that, this is how you jump -WAIT!- this is how you jump). Lara is still a bimbo character and it's insulting to both genders, a cynical view of the audience (I wish she would stop breathing heavily!). The controls are difficult. The puzzle elements are still worthwhile, though they are a poor man's Zelda. The 16 year-old Lara was unnecessary, when she gets her backpack we're supposed to care. The likelyhood of her and the old man being in these Cambodian ruins in the daytime and running through it like a preschool adventure playset is small. They seem to toss old TR elements like climbing vines and throwing levers in all the wrong places, these elements are repeated, and there seems to be little real joy in all of it, like they toss the elements out until the game ends. The level designs are unlogical, they detract from the realism that the games used to have and added so much to it. That's why you are bothered when you die from a giant spinning spike wheel that magically floats, not because it's hard, but because you just don't believe things like that are there, it's as though the game breaks it's own rules. I feel like the levels could all have gone a lot further if they just did some heavy internet research on the areas available to play (Egypt has stars and spikes?). Overall, I feel this game was well worth my [money], but the series needs to improve or it will surely die. Undoubtedly, the first Two TR games were the best, they need to return to that, these new games feel like a...commercial spectacle. What I enjoy most about the series is the realism that there can sometimes be, and the puzzles, but mostly the scenery and locales, the action is just the backdrop to me. Buy the first 2 games before thinking about getting this.",2.0
"Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the fourth Lara Croft adventure game based entirely in Egypt. A very long and challenging game built on a nice engine with great graphics, Neat animations and neat sound effects. Good storyline and great gameplay with infinite saves. Awesome lighting effects and a creepy atmosphere. Great puzzles but a lot of annoying false paths. Very challenging gameplay but can be too challenging at times because no difficuly option. Good level design with a helpfull training level, But the hub level layout is very confusing and easy to get lost. A Lot of fun doing all the jumping but the controls are as usual very badly done, Auto aim is not perfect and the manual aiming is impossible. Enemy AI is super dumb. Tomb Raider Last Revelation well deserves 4 stars but i will give it only 2 because it does not have good key controls and a difficulty option.",2.0
"This game is way, way, way too easy because your summons kill everything in one hit.  Plus they take forever to attack, making the battles extremely long!! The graphics are great and the card game is really fun but the meat of the game, the battles, are way too long and boring.",2.0
"I got this game last year and I have only just completed it. In a technical sense, this is indeed better than the other TR games. But I do feel that it is a victim of it's own realisticness. It starts off brilliant and great to play. Especialy the moving train effect. But once you get to the 'City of the Dead' things go downhill. I mean it gets so dark that even with the monitor on full brightness and the house lights out, you still have to lightflares to see whats what. There are also not enough flares to get around with either. Sure this would be the situation in real life, but in real life you have the advantage of 3D vision to guide you. Not in a game.  Not only that, but the levels get boring towards the end aswell. It seems stupid that game programmers would spend out on high-tech graphics and creative innovations and then blanket them with an over abundance of darkness.  Apart from that though. The sound is brilliant. The movies realy fit in well. Lara looks better and (if you can see them) the graphics are great too.",2.0
"Pharaoh is a city building game (like SimCity), but set in Egypt, during the pre-dynastic period.  You start by building a settlement, addressing basic needs and continue onward.  Unlike SimCity, there are various goals to hit such as population goals.
As the game progresses, it gets harder.
Unfortunately, I found myself building and managing the population, but having to check the deities almost constantly.  Unless you hold regular festivals, constantly build shrines, the gods will grow angry and exact revenge on your civilization.  I found it to be more tedious than fun.",2.0
"When I first bought FF8, I thought that it would be fantastic. I'd read the reviews here and elsewhere, plus seen the TV commericals. However, I was sorely disapointed. The game lacks on many points.
1. Characters - These characters are perhaps the most boring of all time. Squall is a silent person who the ladies love but he just wanders around aimlessly being boring, Zell wants to fight everything, etc. It gets boring fast.
2. Story - ""The story to beat all stories?"" Um...no. Its very boring, and I mean VERY boring. It takes you a very very long time to actually understand the story. People do things that doesn't fit their character traits, people do things for no reason, etc. Overall, no.
3. Gameplay - The Junction system is very original, and I enjoyed it. However, all the battles are much too easy. All you have to do is summon a GF (which usually has 20x more HP and attack power than you) and you can kill any enemy in no time. Whats the fun in that?
The graphics are very well done, as are the FMVs. However, graphics do not make the game. If you've played FF7 and rejected it because of the ""deformed"" sprites, please, for my sake, play it some more. It is one of the best FFs out there. It wasn't that popular for nothing.
Overall, this game isn't fun. I'm a die-hard FF fan who went into it not caring how it would turn out, and even then I was disapointed. If you want good FF games, buy FF7, FF9, and/or FFAnthology, because I can assure you your time spent on these games will really be worth it.",2.0
"Final Fantasy is, and has been for a long time, Squaresoft's flagship product. All the FF products, while not having direct connections to each other, carry similar ""themes"" -- similarities of gameplay, world design, and so on that make them clearly Final Fantasy rather than something else.
With all the time and effort (not to mention money) expended on them, one would (I think justifiably) expect that the series would generally improve as time went on. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
Final Fantasy VII was a reasonably good FF game, but it was also the first Playstation FF game, and had some advantages which were, at the time, unique to it. It was incumbent upon FFVIII to give us something more -- something cooler and better. It failed.
The overall STORY isn't that bad -- the plot is decent and some of the characters interesting. However, our main character is just not generally likeable; Squall has less interesting personality than Cloud Strife of FFVII, and that's a pretty damning indictment since Cloud didn't develop much personality until some way through the game. More importantly, gameplay is if anything more of a railroading exercise than FFVII -- which, given that VII used the metaphor of a railroad from the beginning, is a sad state of affairs.
By now, Square should have recognized that flexibility of play and so on is a GOOD thing in CRPGs. Chrono Trigger remains popular enough to garner commentary even today, due in great part to its multi-ending design. Why the FF series still relies on the idea that you have no real choices and get dragged from fight to fight boggles the mind; Kewl Komputer Animation doesn't make up for the fact that they haven't added any new game techniques since the Nintendo days. Oh, they have some cute little side games -- card collecting and so on -- but the story itself isn't even captivating enough. Some of the battles can go on long enough to be boring in themselves. Oh, the animation cutscenes are pretty, and some of the music very nice -- and the past timeline sequence is, sadly, more interesting than the main one.
A disappointing effort from the people who have, in past times, produced some of the most innovative and interesting games.",2.0
"Playing Final Fantasy VIII is a lot like buying a new CD from you favorite band and realizing that they've passed their commercial peak.  I've played through every domestically released Final Fantasy game, and was drooling with anticipation about playing VIII.  Unfortunately this is one game in the series that doesn't live up to the Final Fantasy name.  I commend Square for having the guts to overhaul the traditional role playing engine by incorporating the draw and junctioning systems into this game, but unfortunately this is one of the times that the saying ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" is appropriate.  You spend so much time finding all the necessary items to refine your weapons and drawing spells that you lose track of the big picture of the game.  Of course, weapons (and to a lesser extent spells) are pointless in this game since they do almost no damage to enemies.  Too much of the game revolves around the Guardian Forces which you can endlessly use in battle giving the game a very one dimentional feel.  The best role playing games are those that require you to apropriately balance the usage of weapons vs. spells and have situations where each type of attack has its benefits and drawbacks.  Unfortunately the balance in this game is way too lopsided.  The low quality of FFVIII can really be seen when the lopsidedness is coupled with an idiotic storyline (yeah right all seven party members grew up in the same orphanage, and just HAPPENED to forget about it only to be reunited many years later by chance encounters). Sorry, but even taken with the biggest grain of salt this story needs work, and a flying garden?????  Someone please explain that one to me.  After thoroughly enjoying the storyline and Materia system of Final Fantasy VII, the overall experience of VIII was incredibly dissapointing.",2.0
"Square Soft usually out do them self with their final fantasy games. Final Fantasy VIII was boring and didn't compare to the rest of square soft's final fantasy master peices. Thought the picture was amazing and the characters did have character, the plot could have been made by a two year old. Hopefully Square Soft will learn not to create such games that are much to based on sci-fi and move towards fantasy. After all, the game is FINAL FANTASY!",2.0
"If not for Final Fantasy IX switching gears, the franchise may have died from this title. FFVII was a pure marvel and still is, but VIII lacked any good storyline and the characters weren't the least bit interesting. It's a solid piece if you want to have the entire series, let's say, pull it out once in a while to hack at it. It's hard to stay interested most of the time, although it does have some cool CG cut-scenes to do it justice, mostly, it's dull repetition and sits as a rushed follow up to FFVII and it shows. Fans, thank God for IX saving the day, X bringing in the next-generation, and XI, XII coming up. So long from the dullsville FFVIII calls Balaamb. I hope the cadets have retired...",2.0
This game is terrible compared to Final Fantasy 7.  The only better part is the graphics (which is why I give it a 2) and the stupid junction system is confusing.  I only keep this game because I'm only missing two of the FF series.  I like the MP better than the GFs because you still get the same guys like Ifrit in FF7 with MP.  I highly reccomend FF7.,2.0
The adapter puts out too much power. The power light blinks then shuts off completely. So I plugged in my worm light thinking my gbc would need/use more power to start up and hopefully even out w/ how much power the adapter was putting out and it worked! Once it got started up I unplugged the worm light and it continued to work. Just needed the worm light to get my gbc to startup. Good thing I had one!,2.0

"This looked like a promising game and I really enjoyed it ... when I could progress through it.  It was crashy/buggy on win2k.  I was halfway thru the werewolf town episode and hit a bug that no patch fixed unless I restarted the episode, which I was too[upset]to do.
Also, the way to progress is not really that intuitive.  I found myself running around an empty castle a lot trying to figure out wth I'm supposed to do next.  By far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles.  As you run down a hall, you hit a map trigger that changes your point of view; unfortunately you have no idea what view you will get.  Sometimes you will be looking ahead from behind/above your character, other times you will look at your character's face from ahead/left.  It is weird and extremely unpleasant as you can switch angles during fights accidentally and get your [rear-end]kicked.
The good stuff: The graphics are cool, not the most impressive nowadays (2003-05-06) but still neat.  Although they aren't technically superior anymore (they once were) I still like the way the game looks because the designers made the graphics so creepy.  The art on the walls, the dark woods, crypts, you go through all sorts of cool settings.
The music is creepy too, and really helps set the mood.  This is actually a scary game to play.
The main character is pretty cool.  He's the nameless Clint-Eastwood type with the gravelly voice.
All in all this game had awesome potential but was poorly executed.  Much of this could have been avoided by having 1. more predictable and sane camera angles, and 2. a strategy guide.  A lot of times I was stuck for hours and I missed some hidden place or something.  With a quick cheat I would have had a lot more fun without feeling too guilty.
I hope they come out with a Nocturne 2 that addresses these issues, I would really like to see it.",2.0
"The game has beautiful graphics and superb sound but very bad player interaction and controls.  Some of the sequences are downright scary when played at night and in the dark.  However when you realize how hard it is to aim a weapon, see the monsters or direct your motion from the clumsy third person perspective you quickly tire of the game.",2.0
"Stunning graphics coupled with very clumsy controls make this game a feast for the eyes but a major bust when it comes to engrossing game play.  In a  world dominated by such near master works as Lucas Arts' Indiana Jones and  the Infernal Machine, different is not necessarily better and the third  person perspective Nocturne offers is as creepy as the games beautifully  dark images and spine tingling story line.  I suppose the object was to  give Nocturne a cinematic edge offered by some of Hollywood's best  horror/thrillers, but cutting from place to place using numerous movie  angels as our gruff but hardly lovable anti-hero ""Stranger"" runs through  each scene (ground level, over-head, etc) trying to mow down swooping and  snarling creatures of the night, simply doesn't work here and would likely  earn any film student a solid D for effort!  With one additional option,  first person perspective (or even second person), this might have been a  great game, without it, Nocturne swiftly becomes little more than a tedious  test of your 20/20 vision and manual dexterity.  Bottom line, if you can  get it cheap (one major home electronics store recently had it on sale for  $9.99), or can borrow it from a friend, check it out for it's amazing  cutting edge eye candy.  But just like any fine work of art hanging in  some posh museum, you'll pause to consider Nocturne's brilliant textures,  along with it's use of light and shadow but eventually you'll move on to  something much more stimulating and rewarding, like an amusement park.",2.0

"After playing FA/18, I expected to see an awesome addition to the excellence achieved by USAF. FA/18 doesn't come close. The graphics seem to be equal to some shareware products, compared to USAF, and the game doesn't  capture the feeling of realism that USAF did. I guess if it had come out  before USAF, it probably would have impressed me more. It appears to be F15  reincarnated, staged in a different theatre. The carrier take offs and  landings are ok, but even the older Microprose F14 Fleet defenders' carrier  activity appeared more exciting. It's definately not what I expected to  take the stage after USAF. I was somewhat of a disappointed to me.  If  you're just dying to catapult from a carrier, at least wait several months,  this way you can pick it up in a clearance bin for $19.99.",2.0
"I started on the Final Fantasy series on FF4 and I loved it, and I was blown away by FF6. I'm not one of the New-age RPG gamers who are like ""Ooh, it has cool movies, that makes it a cool game"" I could care less about movies and great graphics which is basically all FF8 is. If you truly want a great Final Fantasy play FF6 for the Super Nintendo, or get Final Fantasy Anthology if you want the greatest FF with a couple movies with it. Where FF8 lacks is in several areas: Story, Gameplay, Character Development, etc. The graphics are astounding, and the FMVs are incredible, but those just don't make an RPG. You need a captivating story, a villain you can really hate, and most of all great characters you can attach to. FF8 had none of these. The story leads you wondering what you're doing and why, the characters are all bland and one dimensional except for Squall and Rinoa, but their development happens so fast that it completely ruins the meaning. And the Villain.... what villain? You get to see the villain at the end of the second disc, but for about 2 seconds, then you don't se her again until the end of the 4th disc. Now whats the point of a villain you have no interaction with? Now I'm not saying FF8 is a horrible game, it can be fun if you ignore the story elements and the disgusting junction system, which completely removes the need for leveling up(if you have enough magic you could have 9999 HP and deal 8000 damage at level 13). I just say that the final fantasy series has a tradition of good story, good characters, and a villain you can really hate, and ff8 has none of those. To me, it is a FF game in name only.",2.0
"I must admit that the only thing FFVIII has going for it is the amazing graphic cuts, especially the opening one.  Unfortunately it spoils the rest of the game, which in my mind is pretty much worthless.  The new junction system is confusing and pointless.  Drawing magic ... and the spells don't compare to the previous final fantasy titles.  The most annoying part in my mind was the fact that you run into enemies about every 5 steps, it's mildly fun at first but it gets really old.  The story is dull and pointless.  The characters have no personality.  It really just doesn't measure up to what the rest of the FF games are all about.  My recommendation- rent this one before you even think about spending more than 5 bucks on it, you can pretty much just watch the opening FMV scene and you've seen all the good parts.",2.0
"When I bought this game, I was overjoyed at how much fun it was, and how incredible the graphics were. I quickly realized how wrong I was about the fun part. When I am usually able to put up with bad graphics, or cumbersome controls, I just could not put up with the story or the characters in this game. While you learn to compensate for bad control over the time that you play the game, you can't fix bad play mechanics, a terrible story, or boring characters. Take the main character, for example, Squall Lionheart. The guy has about as much personality as a rock. He never acts on his emotions, and he really stinks around women. And his ""girlfriend,"" Reina (something like that). Have you ever seen a character more unfit to be in an RPG?????!!!!!!!!!! She acts like some stupid teenager just trying to get Squall to pay attention to her. And those are just th lead characters. THe rest of the characters, Selphie, an even stupider teenager ripoff, Irvine Kinneas, the only good, realistic character in the entire game, Zell, some stupid fighter with a terrible temper, Quistis, a fair character with a realistic attitude, Laguna, (I don't even know much about him,) Kiros, some guy with kitchen knives attached to his hands, and Wade, a fat guy with a spear. Sound like a good roster? Nope. And the antagonists are just boring!!!!! Edea and Seifer never incited me to hate them at all. Unlike Sephiroth (From FF7), who made me so angry I could scream. And the characters aren't the only bad part, the story is just boring. Some magical queen is trying to take over the world with the help of some fat guy and a guy with a gun attached to his sword. Pretty bad so far, correct? It gets worse. When story does not always make the game, the play mechanics do. THE DRAW AND JUNCTION SYSTEM IS TOO DARN COMPLICATED, NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS!!!!!!!!! I understand it, but I don't feel like working with it too much. And who wants to draw a spell from the correct monster every time they want to use it? I much prefer the Materia system from FF7 or the ability system from FF9. The last two faults in the game are the weapons, too hard to upgrade, and the GF system, too hard to keep the compatibilities up. With all these faults, and the only saving grace is the card game. That card game is so addictive, it's scary!! You still want the game? If you do, just reevaluate your decision before you dump your money into a terrible game.",2.0
"well, as a teen, i think this game was extremely boring, rarely do you get to do stuff, and what you do get to do i found really frustrating, too often do you fight random battles when your trying to get somewhere, and the fading between parts of the place your in gets really annoying, i would not recomend this game, unless you have lots of time, i've spent hours trying to get somewhere, and am often times bored out of my mind, i'm sure it will get better, but right now, it just sits in my game folder
hope this will be helpful",2.0
"If you are having trouble on trying to find some good RPG's, skip right past this one and go to something like Chrono Cross, Lengend of Dragoon, or  Final Fantasy 7 (much much better than FF8).  It maybe fun at first but it  can get very annoying, don't waste your time or all your allowance on this  game, go and get something else!  FF7 and CC are exsamples of great  games, FF8, PATHETIC!",2.0
"The software discs came in the mail as advertised for time required, but the 3rd disc would not install past 80%.  I've retried the installation a few times and had no success.  The disc appears new with no blemishes, scratches, marks etc.  I've visited the Blizzard website and it appears my next option is to download the entire software license from their website as a single file and transfer to my laptop via external HD or stick memory.  If that does not work I will need to order another disc set.",2.0
"I love the game: graphics, play,sounds.

I cannot however, play online, as am not connected (long story)

One MAJOR drawback I find in this game and that made me stop playing altogether (after completing the game and half of the expanded version): You CANNOT save the game and start at the same point where you stopped playing. If you do stop playing and choose (it's the only option) the ""save and exit"" button, it takes you back to town and you have to battle ALL the enemies all over again!! It is soo STUPID! I have never experienced that in any other game. I don't know, what they were thinking!

Unless you either have NO life and all you do is play for weeks until you finish the game, or leave the computer on until you finish the game (I have a laptop and that is NOT an option), you are in trouble.",2.0
"This game would have been a MASTERPIECE, had it have not been for the stupidity of blizzard. This game WOULD be extremely fun, but there is one flaw, and this one flaw ruins how much I enjoyed the game: The damn saving option. This really pissed me off. After a hard 3 hours straight of battling, you find out you have to run off to work, so you save and quit the game. After a hard 8 hours of work, you look forward to playin the pretty fun game of Diablo 2 once again. you pop the Cd in the drive, start up the game....WHAT THE HELL?? I JUST BEAT ALL THESE ENEMIES! yes that is right. After you save and quit, the enemies return. sure, its a good way to earn experience, but i think it goes a little too far when you have to defeat about 200 enemies and spend about an hour JUST to get back to where you left off on your last play. At first it's not that bad, mainly because the enemies are not that hard, and there are not many of them. but once i got to the third act, i got so frustrated i just quit the game and didn't play it for a month. This gets so frustrating and time-consuming it is unreal.
I loved the first Diablo, and right after i beat it i went out and bough diablo 2 with an expansion pack RIGHT AWAY, expecting this FANTASTIC game, and all i got was a 3 hour excitement from the first 2 acts. Now, i am going to auction it off of ebay as quick as possible, as the sight of the box i have reminds me of the mistake i made of spending a total of 40 dollars on such crap",2.0
"First things first.  This game IS fun, and it got two stars for that only.
Diablo 2 was fun for a while.  Not a long while like Neverwinter Nights, but a little while.  I didn't make it too far into the game because I lost track of the plot, and the game itself was far too repetitive.  Every battle seemed to be the same, and it was all too easy.  The battel system was just point and click, and there was no strategy to it at all.  I know, this is just supposed to be a hack and slash, but it fails even at that.
The graphics are moderately good, they are not bad but not real good either.  The sound is good, probably one of the best parts of the game.
If you want a hack and slash to be addicted to for less than a week, this is the way to go.  You'll be back.  If you want a hack and slash to play for a while, may I reccomend any of the Icewind Dale's.  If you want a hack and slash with a real good plot, try Neverwinter Nights.
I do reccomend this game, but don't go wasting your money on it right now, wait until it is in the bargain bin, so's you don't get mad when you end up geting the game and becoming sick of it in three days.",2.0
"At first it is rather amusing to beat swarms of bad guys into piles of pulp, but after the 10,573rd kill, one realizes that there seems to be little more to the game than pointing and clicking really fast.  There's lots of bad guys out there, each of which gives you the most infitinesmal amount of experience.
I get the idea that evil has taken a hold on these lands.  After you've fought corrupted porcupines, corrupted crows, corrupted supermodels(that you regrettably have to slaughter by the bushel), corrupted fly swarms, corrupted blacksmiths, corrupted vultures...  After awhile one can't but ask if the evil corrupted CHAIR is next.
After awhile of playing, the small things get you.  How can you resurrect a human skeleton from a porcupine corpse?  How can you attack a swarm of bugs with a sword?  Why does this 'special' corrupted bug swarm have an individual name and how does it drop magic items when you kill it?  Why does that 9'7 550 pound guy pop like a water balloon filled with red paint if you hit him once or twice?  This is nitpicking, but most game designs have at least some attention to detail.
And one would think the highest aspiration in the game is to kill the very lords of hell.  No!  The greatest challenge is to take on the ferocious halberd wielding cows in the 'secret' cow level!  That's when I decided to put in an end in my assault on the demonic forces.  No matter what my little character does, he has to get corrupted at the end so there can be a sequel.",2.0
"This game is BAD. BAD. BAD. You walk through endless areas mindlessly killing randomly generated enemies. It has no plot. It has no plot.
That said, I am addicted to it. It is strangely fun to see your character grow more powerful and...kill tons of randomly generated enemies.
DONT GET THIS GAME! save yourself hours of wasted time. Of course, if mindless hack and slash adventures are your thing, you would enjoy it. Otherwise, get Baldurs Gate 2. (which just happens to be the best RPG ever made)",2.0
"Let's get one thing clear: Diablo II is nowhere near as good as Diablo 1. There are more reasons for this than I can remember, but I'll try to list as many of them as possible.
First off, there's no way to save your progress through the game. All that you can do is save your character. When you reload the game, all of the bad guys are back. This gets EXTREMELY aggravating.
Second, there's just too much stuff! Remember in Diablo 1, where there were a dozen kinds of swords and like a hundred different kinds of armor, not counting the two billion magical prefixes and suffixes and all of the Unique items? Well, that's ten times as bad in D2. There's twice as many different categories of items (belts? what the...?), and there are twice as many items in each category. It doesn't stop there, either: it is now possible for nonmagic items to have prefixes as well, and many of those prefixes mean the same freaking thing! A belt can be ""poorly made,"" ""low quality,"" ""slightly lower quality,"" ""chipped,"" ""cracked,"" ""rusty,"" ""damaged,"" ""even more damaged,"" blah blah blah blah blah umpteen et cetera, and it contributes absolutely JACK FREAKING SQUAT to gameplay! Diablo 1 had 2 different potion strengths: Partial and Full, and that was all you needed, but D2 saw fit to create five different potion strengths. You get the idea.
Third, the outdoor areas are WAAY too freaking big. Even with Automap turned on, it's impossible to tell whether or not you've explored an outdoor area fully.
Fourth, the new spellcasting system just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. A Barbarian at a given level will have just as many magical abilities, AND be just as good at casting them, as a Sorceress on the same level! And how are these magical abilities acquired? Does your character learn spells by reading spellbooks, like in Diablo 1? No, they learn spells by killing things. Yup, you just go out and kill monsters, and you suddenly know how to cast fireballs. WHAT THE HECK KIND OF SENSE DOES THAT MAKE?!?
Fifth, character classes have no maximum stats. This SEVERELY WEAKENS the distinctions between the character classes, and for those hackers out there, it makes it impossible to have a ""maxed-out"" character.
Sixth, there's too much stuff! I know I've mentioned this before, but it's just wrong that you could pick up every item in the whole game and still only see a tenth of all the different combinations of non-magical items.
Seventh, there's no more Apocalypse spell. Apocalypse was a cool spell that should not have been removed.
D2 does have a few good ideas, though. Gems are very cool, but the fact that they come in five or six different quality levels, plus the fact that items can have widely varying numbers of sockets for them, only worsens the ""too much stuff"" problem. The Horadric Cube is an awesome idea, because it allows you to do really fun things. You put random things into it, and if you're lucky, they'll combine into something new! You can take 3 gems of a given type and quality, and the Cube will compress them into one gem of the next highest quality. Combine 2 packs of crossbow bolts to get one pack of arrows, or 2 packs of arrows for one pack of bolts. No one but Blizzard knows all of the possibilities. I also love the addition of ""set"" items, or in other words, unique items that power each other up as you find more from each set. Unfortunately, it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to find all of the items in any one set, leading to hours upon hours of frustrated searching. Let's see, I mentioned Gems, the Horadric Cube, set items... were there any other positive additions to D2? I can't remember any more...
Diablo 2 can be fun and playable in its own way, but compared to Diablo 1, it's just horrible. There were too many bad ideas, and too many good ideas that were badly implemented. Don't play this game unless you've gotten bored with Diablo 1.",2.0
"First of all, this game is NOT an RPG. It's just a simple point and click adventure game. The only RPG thing about this game is you can level up your character and chose from 5 stats to level up. If you want a real RPG, buy fallout. The Fallout series has over 10 stats to chose from, is much more fun, and it is a REAL RPG. This game isn't much fun online, either. And the same quests over and over and over in the single player game doesn't do much for the game, either. The monsters are all the same with just new colours. Plus the save system stinks, you have to exit the whole game to save, whoever made that funtion needs to be beat. Blizzard is going down the tube. Buy Fallout, it's 50 times better.",2.0
"I had played this game beofre and trying again and i now remeber why i threw it out the window before. First off the graphics are good, I cant complaine there,also the point and click is good, But everything else [is bad]. You have to play for hours just to save from point to point. EX.in act 3 from the one way point (where you can save) to the other you have to play for about 3 hours! If you play for and hour and decide to quit and didn't hit the next way point when you start over you have to kill all the creachers you just did for the past hour. Why cant you save annywhere and keep the creachers dead. Also in the forest you come across manny MANNY of these small creachers that swarm you (from 10-15) you don't stand a chance. Ok then you die. You end up back in town with NO gear. You have to go back to where you died (far away) touch your body to get it all back. But useually there are manny creachers there and you cant get to it. Everything is verry expencive. multiplayer my be better i did not try that. So i guess this game [is bad] in my point of view. Even though i players diablo 1 manny times and LOVED that game.",2.0
"when i first bought the game i was very excited. when i first started i thought it was great. then as i got farther into i noticed the lack of an interesting plot. just click. click. click. if u want a true rpg, with plot,go for something along the lines of planescape:torment, or bg2. i gave this 2 stars for one reason. after having a true challenge in bg2(baldur's gate 2) it is a pleasent change of pace for about 15 min 2 just kill things",2.0
"The reason i gave this game 2 stars was the fact that u can only beat act 4 so many times.  Sure, at first this was instantly my favorite game.  But after about a month, there was nothing left to do.  I had the best items in the game, i tore diablo a new one, and beat the thing on every level.  I would recommend just borrowing this one from a friend, because it isn't worth playing for very long....",2.0
"Metal Fatigue is a great RTS game that has many features not seen in any game.  You can build giant robots using a myriad of parts, like missile launchers, axes, energy swords, plasma cannons, etc.  You can mix and match  between the dozen of parts to make your own unique combos.  also you can  build tanks, jets, bombers, and other vehicles to destroy the enemy. Also  the graphic engine is very sharp and clean, with amazing textures and light  effects.
With all this said, why did the game rank so low?  Well I'll ya  why.  The game is unbelievably hard.  Not hard as in Algebra hard.  We're  talking Level 5 Calculus for Phd candidates.  I was able to beat Starcraft,  Tiberian Sun and other RTs without resorting to cheating or trainers.  Metal Fatigue is written so you will definately need cheats to even past  level 4.
First of all, the building speeds are ridiculously slow.  It  takes you about 40-60 seconds to build the standard hover vehicle (which is  the building vehicle).  Artillery takes about 1-2 minutes, and bombers take  about 3 minutes.  Your robots, called combots in MF, require you to build  the 4 basic building blocks: right arm, left arm, legs and torso.  Each  part takes a certain length of time, depending on its function.  Sword  arms takes 30 seconds, while more expensive arms take 2-3 minutes.  You can  build several factories so you can build parts faster however.
Even  though building your army is half the fun on these types of games, it  SHOULD NOT take 3 hours to build a decent army.  I'm running a Pentium  2/300mhz with 192mb and a 16mb video card.  It SHOULD NOT take me 2 hours  to build 6 combots, 4 tanks and 2 missle trucks.. The worse part is your  enemy always starts off fully build with dozens of tanks, combots,  fighters, etc.
Even worse is the incredibly cheap AI.  The computer  will randomly send 20-30 fighters and combots to attack your base at once,  and unless you have build a decent defense, your base will quickly be  demolished. Game over! On Level 7, you start off with a handful of units.  Within 3 minutes, the enemy launches nuclear missiles from their orbital  base.  each missile can take %50 damage off combots and 100% of your  smaller vehicles within a certain radius.  So while you're busy building  your meager army, the enemy will randomly shoot 2-3 missiles and destroy  what you have been working on for the past hour.
Also, you have three  separate levels of building your base: the planet's surface, underground  and the floating islands.  You have to manage all three levels at once.  So  if the enemy is attacking your base on one level, you quickly have to  switch levels and find them off.  Meanwhile they'll ambush you on the top  level, and middle level simultaneously just to throw you off.  Remember  those orbital bombardments?  Well one of those can destroy whatever's on  your floating island.  Of course it takes your men forever to even build  one orbital bombardment.
It took me 4 hours to finish the 3rd level, and  5 hours for the 5th.  And we're not talking 5 hours of funfilled excitement  - rather it's micromanaging idiotic peons that can't navigate around rocks,  build a decent turret or even aim straight.  Games SHOULD NOT be this hard.  And folks, the game was set on the easy level.  Don't even think about  playing on the hard difficulty level.
If you're thinking about getting  this game, wait until someone has cracked the cheat codes or written a  trainer.  Otherwise you'll have to suffer hours of slowly building your  base and have it entirely wiped out by nuclear missiles, while you're in  the middle of collecting enough energy to build a hover vehicle that just  got blown up from the many waves of strike parties.",2.0
"Playing Diablo II is like reading a tedious novel with a magically cursed bookmark.
When Blizzard tackled the computer role-playing game genre with their original Diablo, they focused on combat and perfected it to a degree of high art.  Diablo's combat was fun and challenging.  They haven't really changed the formula for Diablo II, and that's part of what makes the game so tedious.  For a sequel, you'd expect more: more story, more options to completing quests, more ... role-playing! Instead, it's all combat, all over again.  Moreover, the combat in Diablo II isn't as challenging as it was before.  The baddies aren't as bad.
Exploring the new character classes is interesting, and there are definitely different strategies you need to employ to be an effective fighter with the barbarian over the sorceress, for example.  The skill system gives you greater options for carnage.  But all of the skills and all of the the character attributes contribute nothing except your ability to fight fight fight.  And the new quests, which are either kill X or retrieve Y, involve having to wade through thousands of minions on your way to X or Y.  It's dull.
Though the game is overall tedious, Blizzard has done some things well that other game houses would do well to emulate.  The cinematic scenes between acts are top-notch: the computerized special effects and facial expressions are some of the best I've seen.  And in most computer role-playing games, moving from one area to another involves staring at a ""Loading..."" screen for excrutiatingly long times.  In Diablo II, there's zero---ZERO---delay!  (The only ""Loading"" messages are between major map areas, and those are quite brief.)  Good job, Blizzard!  Unfortunately, the in-play graphics haven't really improved much over the original.  Sure, the amazon's butt cheeks show up pretty well, but it's a fairly low resolution game.
So, what did I mean by a ""cursed bookmark""?
Imagine if each time you put down a novel and picked it up later, your bookmark moved back by 50 to a 100 pages ... that's the Diablo II experience.
You see, there's a bug in saving games.  When you resume your saved game, you don't appear where you were.  You start out back in the town.  All of the items left around aren't where they were, either.  And all of the baddies you killed ... they're back!  The tedium of having to kill them on your way to finishing a quest is doubled because you have to do it all over again, every time you save your game.
There's an old adage in software engineering that says if you document your bugs, they become features.  How saving games works in Dialbo II is indeed documented in the manual.  But this ""feature"" is a lamentable excuse for what so many other games---including the original Diablo---got right.
Maybe Diablo III will be better.",2.0

"Ugh, I hate it when something like this happens. I get all worked up the  week it is slated to come out, then I get it and am let down. The initial  problem was getting it to play, which took Blizzard 2 days to get back to  me. Then it was beating the game the 4th day I had it. I promtply  un-installed after 3 nights of trying to get on bnet with no success. If  you want a good RPG then go straight for Vampire!!!",2.0
"Besides having all the system requirements necessary and still not being able to run the game, my biggest problem with it is not being able to save  the game state. This completely ruins it for me--and probably for anyone  else interested in the single-player aspect. It is truly awful to have to  go back somewhere to get items that were perhaps left behind, only to have  to fight everything that you already killed once all over again. Sadly,  this ruins the game and storyline for me. I know other folks who aren't  bothered by this at all, however. For me, though, it's just a terrible way  to have released the game. I honestly think that they should've kept that  save feature in the game, even if it meant releasing the game later.",2.0

"Diablo 2 is no technical marvel.  It is limited to 640 x 480 in 256 colors, and doesn't have a customizable character, it has sort of limited itself.  The gameplay hasn't improved much from the original, as far as I can tell.  Diablo 2 simply doesn't match up to the standards that Diablo 1  helped to set.  I wish I had waited until the price came down.  This is not  [worth the $], in my opinion.",2.0
"When Diablo II came out I bought it immediately expecting it would be at least as fun as the first possibly more fun.
I got bored of the game easily.  The thing I really didn't like was certain enemys that just run  away. You have to chase them for what seems like an eternity till you  finally catch them and slaughter them, and if you decide to just let them  run away they'll continuously come back to haunt you. Then to make things  worse the game doesn't save what you've killed so if you decide your done  playing for the day the next time you play all the runners will be back.  These enemys are called flayers and when I first encountered them I got  bored of fighting them over and over and discontinued my gameply and moved  to a different game.
Another thing I didn't like is running. Not that  running is bad, in fact I love the fact that you can move faster, the  problem with it is that the background (trees, grass, etc.) really bothered  my eyes with it scrolling past so quickly. That is not as big a deal as the  run-a-way enemys, however.
If you like to chase endless hords of enemys  then the game is for you.  If not don't bother with it.",2.0
"I really wanted to like this game.  I really did.  I love RPG's!  So I jumped at the chance to play a Dreamcast RPG.  I was horribly disappointed.  While the storyline is good (not great but good), the game goes by WAY TOO FAST!  I hadn't played it for more than 10-12 hours and I was already at the end of the game!  The end boss was too difficult at the time so I checked out an online walkthrough and found out that to really play through the game, you need to go back into the same dungeons without beating them multiple times to get better items and save up enough money to improve your equipment.  It's tedium at best mind-numbing at worst.
The random dungeon feature was nice and kept things relatively fresh... but it got old quick.  It was nice to be able to see the monsters too.  Rather than random battles you could initiate whenever you wanted.  Approach them from the rear and you strike first.  Vice versa, then you get hit first.  You can also sneak by monsters if you want.
The game is pretty, but it needed more.  All-in-all, a disheartening start to the Dreamcast RPGs.",2.0
"This game if fun for a while, but there are definitely some better ones out there to choose from. All the dungeons are randomly generated every time you enter them. They're all just long, thin almost above view hallways with hidden traps that connect larger rooms... with more annoying hidden traps. As you get further in the game they become longer and longer. They end up being about 40 floors of doing the same old fighting, finding randomly generated treasures and searching for the stairs to the next level. You may as well not even take the time to level up your characters unless they have huge gaps between them (ie: mag is level 50 and chain is level 30). The monsters only level up as you do. I think the bosses stay 5 levels ahead of you at all times. I know at least the final boss does. I had to level up to 100 just so he would have to reach his max level of 100 and be even with my characters. There are very few (if any) reasons to keep playing once you finished the game. No hidden characters, super weapons or bosses to search for. The game is basically spoon fed to you as you progress. I'll admit, I did have fun with it. But if you want a decent RPG for the dreamcast, I'd suggest you check out Skies of Arcadia.
All in all, The gameplay is pretty boring and the graphics and sound are mediocre.",2.0
"I bought this game used from a friend, and had high hopes even with his disappointed attitude towards it. After playing for what seemed like hours going through far too similar levels, I realized that all the levels were just randomly generated. While this lets the game fit on one cd, it makes the story line a very small part of the actual time spent playing. The only plus side to the game is the actual mechanics of battle. Unlike the final fantasy style (I'm not putting down FF, I'm actually a big fan) the fighting in this game has a lot more strategy involved. The attacks are rather humorous and the graphics are great. But without a storyline readily available to look at and interact with, the game comes up lacking.",2.0
"The game has many flaws in it making it almost unplayable. The most notable is the Anti-copy feature on the CD's themselves making it impossible for some CD and DVD drives to read. At present Blizzard has no  plans to fix this feature. Also the graphics and lag time in both online  and single play are bad. In order to get the game to play you will need to  tinker with the drivers and system options to get it to work. Reminds me of  the old days of  DOS where a Boot Disk had to be created to change your  memory options. The box reports a minimum of 32Meg of memory, I would think  it is closer to 64Meg. If your character incounters a large amount of  monsters it will bog way down and the monsters will kill you before you get  a hit in. If you must absolutely have the game I would wait a month for the  problems to be fixed. There are already 2 patches in less then 2 weeks with  number 3 in the works.",2.0
"This is it!  Is this what the hype was all about? Totally disappointed with this game. Again, a game that took 3 years to develop isn't a guarantee that it'll be good (Daikatana anyone?). Diablo 2 is just all hot air. Lets start with the bugs. First of, let's start with the technical goof ups. The  game had problems with some CD drives. It takes me 3 to 5 tries just to  have my Creative DVD recognize the CD. This is a major bug. Second, the CD  had problems ejecting from my drive, thanks to the patch they released  v. 1.02, it still didn't fix it. Thanks for nothing Blizzard. Third, the game  won't run on my GeforceDDR under Direct 3D. So now, Im running the game  using DirectDraw from my GeforceDDR. I ran the game using 3dfx glide and  the graphics were so washed out and hazy. What do you expect from glide?  Now let's go with the gameplay. It is absolutely similar with the first  Diablo. Sure they upgraded the graphics and all, but gameplay is still the  same old Diablo. The game comes in 3 CDs. The first CD will take you only  about 4 hours to finish it because the monsters are just too dumb and too  easy to beat. You'll have the case of BOREDOM by the time you finish CD1.  As you progress deeper into the game, you start to realize that the  challenge becomes more of simply just finishing it because you paid [good money]  for it rather than seeing the end of the game. Motivation factor is zero.  There were a lot of new items and weapons not found in the old Diablo but  new items and new weapons just isn't enough to save this game. Maps are 3  times bigger than the old Diablo. Other than that, this game is just a  waste of time because it runs and feels like the old Diablo which is  already a tired old engine to spend your gaming hours on. I enjoyed playing  Nox more than Diablo II. Newcomers in the Diablo world will feel just dandy  with this game. Old Diablo players will go ho-hum with this one. My take on  this game, wait for the retailers to put it on the bargain shelves.",2.0
"Wow! This was a huge upset. When i opened the package 2 days ago and rushed to install the game i was so excited. Then after i chose my character, typed in my name, and started playin i already noticed flaws.  Bad graphics, bad sound, same old stuff. Inventory the same, story is  basically the same. After an hour of playin it i was back playin halflife  playin with my friends. The box, manual and game had  ""mysteriously"" dissapeard only to be found in the garbage the  next day. The only reason i gave this a 2 is cause, wait why did i give it  a 2?",2.0
"Diablo 2 is a good game. That's it....a good game. After a 3.5 year wait, I was expecting a damned GREAT game. The story is uninspiring after playing the original....the art is dated, and the gameplay is not MUCH improved. If  you are in desperate need of gaming (have already played the OTHER good  games), get this game. If you're in the market for a GREAT game, buy  Icewind Dale instead. You will not dislike this game, but great chances are  that you will NOT love this game.",2.0

Its made by ""Hip Gear"" with the following label on the back ""PSX 1Mb Memory Card"".

"As an avid adventure gamer, I found the plot to be less than intriguing and the puzzles to be simplistic and random. Graphics were way too dark, and having to go back to different worlds to pick up items frustrating. I  give it a BIG YAWN!",2.0
"White I agree with the first reviewers accessment, for the most part, I found some of the puzzles quite arbitrary. Who'd think of using a radio to (oops), well, do THAT. I never did find the lever near the spaceship  because it was so dark; I had to cheat. The only hint that a certain tool  has to be used again is that it stays with you; figuring out what it has to  be used on and where is extremely obscure.
When the graphics are good,  they are almost great; but when they are bad, they are awful.
Take into  account that I play few games. I loved Myst and Riven and solved both. When  I got stuck, I could always think of something logical, or at least not  totally random, to try. I've played several others of the same sort.  Crystal Key is the worst of the lot (thought at $20 also the  cheapest).
It would not run on a Mac PPC9500 on 8.1. It did run fine on a  new (gold keyboard) PowerBook. It hung on an IBM ThinkPad 760e (Win95).",2.0
I found this game to be just so so. With computer graphics you'd think that they'd be able to make the aliens more alien. They remind me of stormtroopers in black armour. I feel this game was limited to 1930's stile imagination.,2.0
I was so disappointed in this game.  It really had very little story line and the graphics were poorly done as well as the puzzles.  I may have spent 3 hours on this game from start to finish and continued to be disappointed with the ending of the game.  About all I can say about this game is that they tried...,2.0
"I really truley enjoyed this game's graphix, storyline and interaction, HOWEVER, this thing was so badly buggy I had to download three patches before I could even resume a sorta normal play.  THen some of the patches screwed up the rest of the game!! I finally became so frusterated I had to uninstall it and put it back in the box.  When I called the tech support for the game they said to uninstall the game and try again, starting over from scratch, I WAS almost DONE with the game!!  No thanks I am a Computer Store owner and I will not be selling this game.",2.0
"Overview: Succinctly put, if you liked Myst, then you will probably like The Crystal Key. If you didn't then stay very far clear of this game. Unlike Myst, however, there is at least some slight semblance of a plot at the beginning of the game instead of just being thrown down in the middle of an island and expected to figure out what is going on. With The Crystal Key, you, the player, are expected to help save your people from an alien race, but that is about the extent of the plot. Like Myst, however, more of the background story begins to unfold during the game, but not by much. In The Crystal Key, you have to navigate through deserts, jungles, meadows, underground worlds, and alien ships, most of the time jumping from one place to another without any real sense of direction or idea what to do next. This game would have been greatly improved if there had at least been a narrator, or a method to look at items and get a description of what items were being picked up, or what the player is looking at. Nearly all of the puzzles are illogical, and require tinkering with switches until something happens. Sometimes there are hints, but they are generally so vague, that it is easy for a gamer to miss them. Another thing which greatly annoyed me was there were a few parts in the game where if the player didn't find an item (like a screwdriver) and they later progressed through the game and found out they couldn't go back to get the item, they were pretty much dead. I HATE puzzles like that, especially if the gamer is just wandering around and can't figure out what went wrong because the player never found a particular item, or didn't write down a particular code. There was hardly a moment during this game where I pondered through a puzzle, and a nice big light bulb went off in my head and I would say 'that was a clever puzzle'. If you want a decent adventure game, go find an old Sierra game, ANY of them provide more entertainment and better game play than The Crystal Key did. If this is the future of adventure games, then maybe adventure games should roll over and remain dormant until the big players like LucasArts or Sierra decide to come out with more adventure games.
Pros:Beautiful rendered scenes (when they aren't so dark that you can hardly see them). Made for both PC AND Macs, so that earns another couple of bonus points. Also, it's an adventure game, so that earns a few brownie points. The game was fairly short, so it wasn't TOO painful, and it cost only ... I've read about bug problems on the PC, but it worked with absolutely no problems on my G4 Tower Mac.
Cons: Some of the scenes (like on Ozgar's mothership) are so dark that it is very difficult to see what is going on. Nearly all of the puzzles are highly unintuitive, and involves plenty of poking around until something works. Sometimes objects are difficult to even find, and require more poking and prodding than most people would like to spend time on. Also, this game is very linear, so if you get stuck on a puzzle, you are stuck for good until that puzzle is solved. And one pet peeve I have with all games that just jump from screen to screen like Myst and The Crystal Key, is this is a very lazy attempt, and moving about like this might have been okay in 1984, but it wasn't acceptable in 1994, and it is certainly NOT acceptable today. For the ending note, the ending is very, very, VERY lackluster, and just shows a screen that says congratulations. Very disappointing ending if that was it. No fanfare, no party, not even a Golden Mop as a token of appreciation!",2.0
"I do like pastoral games, but this one was just a shade too soporific for me. I got about halfway through before I realized that I just didn't care if the aliens destroyed Earth or not. Bad sign!",2.0
"I bought this when I was in my ""Adventure"" mode. Several other games earned my dollar, such as Lightbringer, Gabriel Knight 3, Kings Quest 8, etc. This one, however, was not really with the $19.95 I spent.
The visuals are beautiful. The gameplay is too linear however. You have to ""do this"" before you can ""do that."" There is no way to accomplish your goals in multiple ways. Whereas this concept was astonishing 3 years ago, it no longer appeals to the gamer.
Another gripe: WAY TOO SHORT. If Al Gore had played and beaten this game, he would have demanded a recount and a re-recount. (LOL...oh, the political humor!)
Buy this game only if you truly are a fan of mindless puzzles and rail gameplay. If you want a little more freedom in a game with a little more depth, story, character development and replay value, look elsewhere.",2.0
"Because the box showed shots that made it look a lot like Myst or Riven, I  thought, ""Hey, this looks cool!"".
Unfortunately, I forgot the  adage ""Don't judge a book by its cover"".
Even though the  graphics we quite nice, and the game utilized the 360-degree environment  which was pioneered by Presto Studios in ""The Journeyman Project 3:  Legacy Of Time"", this game really lacked in a plot and story.
Sure,  there's puzzles that require a lot of thought.  By the time you get to the  end, though, your first thought is ""That's IT?!?!!?  Boy, that wasn't  worth it!"".  A very disappointing ending.
I played this game on a  fairly up-to-date PC, and it never made the computer crash, but I did have  to go to Dreamcatcher's website twice to download two programs that are  important in the playing.  Kinda stupid...as other reviewers noted, they  shouldn't have released a game with so many bugs.",2.0
"Crystal key has terrific graphics, yes.  The storyline has a promising beginning. There are occasional snippets of good music.  However, the game is horribly slow on my computer.  It often took 30 seconds or more to move  to the next scene, which made it cumbersome to use.  The storyline falls  apart after the opening and, while you go about seeking things and solving  puzzles and such, the storyline virtually disappears.  The creators have  created a nice universe, but leave you with no information about it. The  ending, as well, is horribly anticlimatic.  You finish the game wondering  what happened and why.",2.0
"I was really excited about this game. I loved both Myst and Riven and was hoping that this would be as good or at least playable! I read all of the reviews and thought that the bugs and the lighting and the thing crashing  every 2 seconds were not going to be that bad. Don't waste your money. This  could be an enjoyable game, its not the most challenging but still  enjoyable the only thing is you have to worry the whole time that something  is going to go wrong, or tools that you know you need to do something just  don't work no matter how many times you click on them. You need a cheat book  just to tell you where certain things are because you can't see them! I am  going to try to finish this game but I am very frustrated. Why would  someone put out a game with this may problems?",2.0
"When I first saw this game on the shelf of my CompUSA store, I was thrilled! I couldn't wait to get home and play it. Once I began the game, reality struck. I was stunned by the lack of solid, vivid screenshots. I was  frustrated and very disappointed mostly by the hard to see, fuzzy and  nondefinable objects(either while ""walking"" or standing still)  within the game as well as the graphics for the background and foreground  shots. The atmospheres were too dark and in contrast to the colors and  supposed textures throughout the game. Although the ""movies"" were  nicely done and the graphics within them were expertly executed,the  graphics within the interactive sequences of the game could have been  awesome if more attention to detail had been given to light and dark as  well as clear cut definition of lines and borders within worlds and  objects. The so called ""puzzles"" were not what I had expected nor  were they the type of puzzles that make this type of game more challenging  and interesting. Most of the items/actions necessary to create the proper  reactions were either too obvious or illogical( when you could actually see  them!)which had a profound impact on the gameplay as a whole. In fact, the  game would have been frustratingly tedious to finish were it not for a hint  book that I purchased shortly after installing this sorry excuse for an  adventure game. This was a TOTAL letdown and NOT what I expected from  Dreamcatcher Int. and CO.",2.0
It's not that the graphics and story line are not good because they are. The problem is the difficulty. Even for an adult this game is severely difficult. You will want to throw your controller within 20 minutes. For kids to play a game this hard is just torture. You don't want kids going through this kind of aggravation. It's not healthy.,2.0

"When this thing was new it was certainly all the rage, but its main rival, the Sony Playstation was still a step ahead no matter Nintendo did.  Nintendo releases games like Goldeneye and Starfox, two GREAT games, but then Square and Sony release Final Fantasy VII to america, which certainly changed things.  On specifics, the N64 is 5 times more powerful than the playstation.  But the N64 cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black CDs.  Why Nintendo didn't bother to use CDs as they originally planned confuses many to this date.  CDs last longer, and in truth, are harder to damage.  A bad drop on a tile floor may send fragments of plastic and silicon from your ""F-Zero X"" could be all over the kitchen floor.  Nintendo did have one thing going for it over Playstation, remakes of classic games.  With the 8bit Nintendo, they started some great games out.  Then with the 16bit Super Nintendo, they made 16bit counterparts to the 8bit games.  Now with this 64bit system, they made counterparts to the 16 bit games.  This was their edge, and it made the system sell very well.  In the long run was this systems downfall.  Games are much harder to produce for N64 than they are playstation.  Even though it it more powerful than the playstation, it is still second to it.  What will happen soon, is anyone guess.  Nintendo next year will release their new Gamecube.  Gamecube doesn't play DVDs like Sony's Playstation 2, and it doesn't appear so far to be anymore powerful.  Playstation 2 will be hard to beat for one, as you can see by it's current demand.  It seems that Nintendo has become the underdog, with giants such as Microsoft entering the race.  Perhaps they'll pull through, its unknown.  Sega's Dreamcast is certainly on it's way down, it will not be possible to compete with the much more powerful Playstation 2 and Microsoft's X-Box, and possibly the morepowerful gamecube.  Word to the wise, if you're planning to buy a top of the line system, I do not currently suggest this system.  Dreamcast is a good bet for the buck, but waiting a while seems to be a wiser choice.",2.0

"Trespasser is not a good shooting dinosaur game. It's frustrating and you're wandering around going nowhere with a stick. If you get a stick as a weapon, you know this game is going to be really bad. Second of all, where the heck are all the dinosaurs? I see a dino on the cover, dontcha think there should be some in the game? What else is bad? Well, I don't even want to talk about the graphics. They look like something you could find on an old Super Nintendo game. The camera angles are just plain awful. Most of the time, you're stuck in a wall with your puny stick. Next, the controls stink. You have to press another button while holding another button to walk. You can't walk straight because of the bad camera angles, you end up walking off a cliff. Whoopee. I'm having a lot of fun holding a stick and walking off cliffs. The only thing that stops this horrible game from getting the dreaded 1 is the music CD inside. You can listen to 7 music tracks on your CD player, watch 5 music videos on your computer, and ignore the other crap on the CD. Now, most of the tracks on the CD really do stink. But, the Powerman 5000 video, Propellerheads' Take California, and the Propellerheads video Bang On! keep the track from being just as bad as the game. So, whoever made this game should thank the music CD because it kept it away from being really really really bad. Oh, wait it already is. 2 stars.",2.0
"Star Trek New Worlds gave us the promise of ""Starcraft meets Star Trek."" When starting the game, you believe you are going to get this, but then things go wrong...very wrong.
First of all, there doesn't seem to be any logical method to what you need to build. Sure, you need power and mining, but every other required building's function seems to be very vague.
Next, the missions seem very difficult to complete. You build the required buildings and go on the missions, but it sometimes takes up to an hour to really get going.
All of this is made even more frustrating because of a lack of a Save Game feature. If this game had one, it would make it so much better. You play for an hour or so and then loose. It is a horrible experience.
The most positive aspects of the game lie in the story and graphics. The opening movie and continuing story are excellent and very much in the spirit of ""Star Trek."" The graphics are also top notch and are really detailed.
Overall, I cannot recommend this game. If it had a save game feature, you could overlook the other flaws and have a good time.",2.0
"I have played every Star Trek game that has been released. Wait- Did I say play or beta test? Same difference with most of them. Nearly every Star Trek game has been an immense let-down...
Star Trek, New Worlds was certainly a let down to me. Is my objective to play the game or to try and see something preferably before it blows up? Unfortunately, The view controls are extremely complex and don't make a whole lot of sense. You can use the number pad keys to rotate the view (That's right, no simple hold down the right mouse and move to rotate) but, of course, that is depending what view you are in.
Are you in First Person view? Are you in Birds Eye view? Do you control-left click, or shift-left click to zoom? If you double-click something, will it bring up stats on the building, or lock your view on it? When you zoom, is it zooming to where your curser is pointing or to the center of the screen? You would think it would be pretty obvious what First Person view vs Birds Eye view would be, but depending on how you zoom and tilt the camera, both of these views could look exactly the same... Does this sound confusing? It was to me too.
A typical game session:
Okay. Great. There is my base. Okay. lets build stuff.
Clickity Click.
Hmm... Is that a group of ten transport APC's or are those science vessels. They all look like ants to me, is that a tree or a rock? I guess I could click on each one... Nah, I don't want to do that, I just need to look at them.. Okay.. Zoom... Hmm, That would be number 8. Okay, AGH, I didn't want to zoom there!!!
That's an awfully big tree....
I see a Red dot on my radar! I don't see it... I should see the bad guy.. Maybe it's just really small... Okay, I can zoom, I remember how to do that.
That's an awfully big dilithium crystal.....
Uh oh, What is that sound of shooting? I don't see anything... What just blew up? Oh, Wait a minute, I have to hit F1 then hit the number pad 2...
Mastering the view controls the majority of the game. And after you mess with control-this and shift-that and hold this down and double-click that only after pressing F-1 and then F-2 you may be close to yelling F-U and proceed to take out vengeance upon the mouse and the keyboard, which makes you feel like it is taunting you the entire time...
For those that do not know, New Worlds is a RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game akin to a mixture of Command & Conquer, Age of Empires and the increasing line of RTS games.
The graphics are certainly good and you can't really complain about the sound, but the game does have a steep usability curve. However, sooner or later you will realize to stay mostly in the same view and just use the Tab to switch between Tricorder views (Oh boy, I didn't even mention that in the above equation, phew) At times, You will be tempted to just leave it in Tricorder view, reverting this game into something from the 70's... Which brings me to another problem.
In most RTS games there is usually a close up display (the main screen) and then a smaller map that covers a wider area (radar/map screen). ST:NW is the same way. Normally, if you want to jump to another place on the main display, you just click what you want to see on the map. Not in this game, You use a hot key (That's right, Control-this, shift-that) or scroll all the way there, slowly I might add.
After playing it for some time, looking through the manual and re-visiting the Tutorial (and I'm a person that normally says ""What is this Tutorial you speak of?"" when it comes to games, but with this its a necessity)
The game has it's moments, but most likely you will be in the wrong view to see them.
If you are a Star Trek fan, Like I am, save your money on this game and spend it on a game that deserves it.
Star Trek - Elite Force is one of the best games I have played in a while, Especially for a Star Trek game. Elite Force is a First Person Shooter using the Quake3 engine.
Alternatively, You could go with Star Trek - Armada for a Real Time Strategy game if you really wanted a Star Trek RTS.
Either of these games will give you an enjoyable experience and at the same time satisfy your Star Trek fix.. but I certainly don't recommend this one.",2.0

"OK, if you never played the SFB board game, you might find this game to be just fine, and it is better than the average sorry#$@ Star Trek title.  This was marketed for the SFB audience, however, and here the game is a big  disappointment.  The worst is multiship control.  Your wingmen AI is poor  to non-existent.  Individual ship control is good to excellent, albeit a  bit cumbersome.  But it is impossible to control 3 ships at once in the  heat of battle and the interface and AI make the simplest commmands to  squadron members ineffectual at best.  You literally cannot even have your  wingmen attack one target while you combat another.
The mission  briefings are hopelessly inadequate and you will have to buy the  aftermarket strategy guide to have any clue as to what you are expected to  do.  There does not seem to be much connection between your battlefield  success and the campaign game.
The fact that they redid most of the  ship visuals is nitpicking after these more serious flaws, but if you are  an SFB fan you expect double saucer hulled Gorns with orange triangle  insignia and catamaran and trimaran Lyran hulls that don't look like 23rd  century vacuum cleaners.  And the Hydrans were just completely redone with  no similarity to the original.
Despite this, the ship to ship combat  works well, and the graphics are marvelous.  Even the cloaking device is  handled correctly, although this would have been easy to botch up.  This  product needs a sequel that gets the other parts right.
P.S.  Forget  playing for the Federation in this game, since the combat algorithm makes  photon toredoes miss about 75% of the time.",2.0
"The game is incredibly detailed, the graphics are incredible, and the AI is solid (hence the 2 stars) but the interface has far too many buttons to control in the heat of battle.  Couple this with an underwritten  instruction manual (filled mostly with ship specs, all of which are  available in game) and you have a rather frustrating adventure ahead of  you.  But let's talk about the adventure itself.  The campaign system is  poorly designed, and the control interface falls horribly flat when trying  to control more than one ship.  At first I thought it was pretty dumb to  have a limit of 3 ships (the game is based on Star FLEET Battles, after  all) but then after experiencing the frustration of watching your vessels  do the opposite of what you intended them to do I understood why the limit  was 3 ships.  Additionally, the progression of missions in the campaign  doesn't seem to follow an interactive approach (i.e. fighting Gorns while  stationed on the opposite side of the galaxy), so you never get the sense  of the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance.  No, you get a set plot  course vastly similar to the Wing Commander games, despite the claims on  the packaging.  I won't go into detail about vague mission descriptions and  abstract victory conditions.  I'll wait for an improved sequel (if it ever  gets made).",2.0
"The idea behind this game is spectacular. Get a fleet of ships or even a single ship, control it, kill stuff, whatever. A true Capitol Ship Combat game. This is not. Maybe its supposed to be. The controls are hard to figure, the instructions read like something from a TechEngineer, and it  has more bugs than an ant hill. Example: going into combat, no damage, red  alert, etc. MY WEAPONS WON'T FIRE! Or better yet, I take a hit reported to  be only sheild damage, no hull damage, then I try to make a high-speed turn  so I can fire back, AND ALL SYSTEMS FAIL! Not to mention, I still can't  tell the other ships what to do except ""attack at will"" or  ""run away"". Even after following the instructions, letter by  letter! Good idea for a game, but almost a waste of money. But the graphics  are spectacular! Try again Interplay! But next time, try a game that  doesn't need 6 fix d/l's 3 weeks after release.",2.0
"The problem with Star Trek games is that they try to be too much like Star Trek. Sound confusing? It is. To break the mold, Star Trek producers are going to have to lean on other designs because the way they make their games now just isn't getting it done. I mean, how can one series of games, with all the countless titles, all be so mind-numbingly below average games?
The problem with Starfleet Command is ambition. The game boasts true 3-D combat. This isn't true in the slightest. If you want 3-D space combat, go buy Homeworld. Starfleet command is on two axi, the X and Y. No mention whatsoever of the Z axis. Everything is played on a flat plane. Now, I'm no expert of space travel, but this just isn't accurate, nor does it make for an enjoyable experience.
Don't expect to use your torpedoes with this game either. They miss almost every time you launch them. And it isn't because of anything you're doing wrong: they just miss. The game is also very hard to figure out in its ship setup stage. If you want to load certain shuttles on your ship, you actually have to tell the game to NOT load them to get them to be there. It is backwards thinking, and I cannot believe that they shipped the game with errors in the interface like this.
Overall, it isn't terribly bad, but is not very good either. It is better than 2 stars but not quite at 3 stars either. I'd rate it 50%. It has some nice features, such as being able to command a starship and be in charge of every feature of that ship, but you soon find that, with the absense of hotkeys for most parts of the ship, this game turns into a micromanagement simulation when you don't have time to micromanage because you're being shot at. The AI is generally dumb in the game when they are isolated, but some missions can be near impossible, and combine that with the fact that your ""wingmen"" do not do anything helpful, it can be very frustrating when trying to destroy over 30 Orion Pirate ships in one certain Federation mission. That's just it: some missions are impossible to beat, and the strategy guide does not help in the slightest.
To make a long story short, I played this game for about 10 days, then uninstalled it on my hard drive and sold it in an online auction. The game just does not deliver what it should for what a starship combat simulation should.",2.0
What were these people thinking? It's yet another pitiful game title from Interplay. It has far too many bugs to be anywhere near enjoyable. All the facts about the ships and weapons is out of date and incorrect. The Interface is also far too complicated. I strongly recommend that you don't buy this game.,2.0
"I really want to know who it is out there who seems to think that because you slap a recognizable name like Star Trek on a product and sell it is all one has to do. I also want to know how it is that two completely separate game companies, Interplay and Activision, can produce two separate games  (Starfleet Command and Star Trek: Armada) that work almost the same and  reek of the same shoddy workmanship. It is products like these that make me  realize why I have abandoned Star Trek fandom in the first place. Because  like Deep Space Nine and Voyager, they are so lacking in the creativity  that made the franchise so worthwhile in the first place.
 Starfleet  Command-a space combat game by Interplay (Quicksilver), is so bereft  intuitive control that it becomes a laborious task to make any ship you  control do anything useful. Case in point, in my first mission with my  frigate sent after Orion pirates, it took me 15 minutes just to hammer down  the enemy ship's shields and constantly fiddling with my ship's weapons  systems just to get it to fire at the Orion. Of course while all this is  going on my frigate is endless rotating and turning all over the map. Why  should it be harder to NOT do something than it is to do something. At  least in Armada you can simply drag-and-select your ship(s) and click  elsewhere on the map to get them to go there. In Starfleet Command, it  takes so long to get your ship to do anything that I was given to wonder  why I had to select crew members for my new ship in the first place.
  And why, in the year 2000, with all the great computer games out there and  the high level of coding in those games, are we still playing so-called 3D  space combat games in 2 dimensions? I do not care if they is based on the  Starfleet Battles board game, I played that to and realized that it was  limitation with it as well. Why is it so hard to work in the 3rd dimension  and enable the player to go `Up' or `Down'? We live in a 3 dimensional  world and as Homeworld proved, it's easy to control, because the  programmers made an interface that was simple and intuitive as well as  functional. I am also given to wonder why people are not more critical  about products like this when they are so inferior when compared to similar  programs. If you comparison shop for a car, why wouldn't you do the same  for a piece of software. It isn't like Starfleet Command is the only one of  its kind. It is your money afterall.
 Just because it has `Star Trek'  tacked on to it does not automatically make it good: Remember Star Trek  Voyager? Maybe my standards are too high or maybe I shouldn't feel ripped  off for spending $... and having the pervasive sense of not getting my  money's worth.",2.0

"My friend lent me this game knowing that I have an interest in--but almost no practical knowledge of--farming, and I was totally overjoyed that such a game exists.  But I'm the type of person who prefers to sit down and just start playing the game.  For some reason, however, I just can't figure it out.  Besides that, the game is obviously intended to be ""simple fun"" kind of entertainment.  I'd prefer something more technical where a person can try their luck at really managing a farm.  I'm not a big computer game person, so if such a game exists, I really don't know; but my guess is that I'm one of very few people who would like to play such a game, and therefore doesn't.",2.0
"This game is good for when it was made, but it lacks the on-going game qualities of other Maxis Sim games. A good buy for a short term amusement.
In the game, you are able to build plot-like fields of farms with varying types of crops, like strawberries or grains.  What you want to plant will depend on where you are located in the U.S. (which you choose at the beginning).  Little icons appear to show you if you have pests or other problems with your crops.  You can apply chemicals by tractor or plane.  I never could get the crop duster to work very well, though.  Then you harvest and can sell immediately or wait till the price goes up.  But the price might go down, or you might wait too long and your crop will spoil.
Personally, I'd probably buy another Sim-type game over this one.  It is quite outdated for today's graphics and sounds, and is not very complex.  For the time, it wasn't too bad.",2.0

"I really had my heart set on Toy Commander and when I got it, the game just didn't deliver! The game concept is really cool on paper but it didn't translate into a good game. The jerky camera which comes as a result of the poor vehicle control actually makes me sick everytime I play it! Control is so important in any 3D game and this game just lacking, big time!
The multi player mode is also disappointing as the small vehicles get lost among the colourful stages. The game is just not fun! The graphics and the sounds are great but the game is just lacking in the fun department.
I'm sorry people but the bottom line is that you can pass on this game and be quite contented because you saved a couple of bucks.",2.0
I got my n64 in almost record time but the console was in bad shape. Banged up and had old sticky soda spilt all over it. So I cleaned it up and plugged it into 4 different TVs and it wouldn't work for any of them. My buddy and I concluded that it was a faulty AV cable. I appreciate the hastiness of the delivery but I bought the dern thing to play it and I can't even take a trip back to nostalgia city. Overall 2 stars.,2.0

You also can't build up a hunting party and people you meet have no real purpose because you can go anywhere. I never figured out the importance of any of the story line.",2.0

"I was late to this game, but decided to play because of the reverent way in which it is still spoken of amongst RPGers. There were bugs that prevented the completion of multiple quests, although none that were required to progress with the game. However, all too frequently NPCs integral to the plot would not respond when I tried to initiate a conversation. Reloading a saved game fixed every instance of the issue except for when I tried to speak to the owner of the tattoo parlor just before going to the final dungeon - again not integral to the plot. Even though the work-around was relatively quick and simple, reloading the game over a hundred times just to be able to play became incredibly tiresome.

The plot of the game is definitely its strongest element. Long, and I mean long, blocks of text are only interspersed with brief periods of point and click or combat that typically lasts no more than a few seconds (This is not to insinuate that combat is easy. Due to poor AI it can be very difficult, but is never really very involved either). As a result, the game often feels more like reading a book than playing a video game. Not necessarily a bad thing; however, I would not expect a book with Torment's pacing issues and frequently recycled passages of text to receive rave reviews either. It read like a very good and compelling short story that was stretched out too far - resulting a mediocre novel.

A game released with the issues that Torment possesses would be torn to shreds by today's standards. After reaching the end, I couldn't help but feel it wasn't worth the trouble.",2.0
"this game gets a lot of great reviews, and i guess almost ten years ago, this game was considered cutting edge with RPGs for PCs. i only bought this game two months ago, and i feel it's only okay. the graphics are a bit bland, which creates problems because sometimes your character will have to find something in the game environment but since so much on the screen is either shadowed or looks the same, it's hard to spot important things. also, the AI can be maddeningly frustrating. you ""control"" a group of about five players, but they'll do the most ridiculous things, like running into danger, standing and simply getting hit, not attacking. this becomes a serious issue towards the end of the game when you have to fight a lot and need your characters to be on point instead of doing things which specifically gets them hurt and killed. overall, this game is okay, the storyline is okay. it's just a blah sort of game.",2.0

"I'm pretty seriously unimpressed with this product, particularly from a user interface perspective. Here are a few reasons why.
(1) It has only one graphics option, which is running full screen with a workspace that is  800 x 600. It can't be minimized, run in a window, or run at a higher  resolution that wouldn't waste half of my display. In addition, my Start  menu isn't accessible while the program is running. I find these kind of  limitations frustrating and unacceptable.
(2) The windows are not  resizeable, so even though I have plenty of screen space to work with, I  can't use it. This means that I have to use the horizontal scroll bar to  view only a small portion of any of the tables at a time, which makes the  product particularly difficult to use.
(3) There doesn't appear to be a  way to indicate multiple copies of a card in my collection without having  multiple entries for that card. This might be useful for rare or special  cards, but having hundreds of entries for lands, or dozens for commons,  makes the feature much less useful.
(4) The text in general is a light  font on a dark background, which is not terribly functional. The help text  is particularly difficult to read.
(5) The online game interface is a  separate application that I am unable to close without closing the product  entirely, even though I can have both the online game and the encyclopedia  running simultaneously.
The product *looks* very nice. I just wish WotC  had put half as much effort into making a product that works as good as it  looks.",2.0
So I didn't realize this was only for the console and didn't include any cords. but anyways this thing was pretty beat up. I wish the seller would've at least let me know about that first. but we are still yet to fire it up since we don't have the cords or anything. i'm sure it works but still.,2.0

"...move along, nothing to see here.  I purchased my N64 a couple of years ago for one very specific reason, so that I could get the new Zelda game (and I mean Ocarina of Time, have gotten Majora's Mask since then) I'm an old school gamer, I mean from the days of Atari, and I still have all of the Zelda games for the Nes, Super Nes, and N64 as well as all of the systems.  Despite my lasting dedication to the Zelda and Metroid franchises (no Metroid64 though, what a disappointment)I must say unless you are dedicated to a nintento owned series and must have it, I wouldn't waste money on this system especially in this post Gamecube release time. (For those of you younger gamers who might not know Nintendo's system history, when they release a new system they totally abandon the old system as though they'd never made it.  There will be no more N64 games made, and no Nintendo system has yet been backwards compatible.  One very useful Sony innovation, smart move by Sony as well, they still sell their old system with a screen no less)  Games for N64 are too expensive, sometimes half to 3/4ths of what the system could be bought for (at least before Gamecube it was this way, now stores are trying to sell out their N64 collection like rats jumping a sinking ship cause they know Nintendo has chucked development for the system and it's dying, so you can actually get good prices on games now.), games are generally aimed at young gamers (very few mature titles) and generally don't have very sophisticated graphics.  The library of game titles is pitiful, very little variety in game types.  The system is not included with it's full capabilities, and you have to drop another chunk of change to buy an expansion pack so that some more advanced games will work on it...as well as having to drop another chunk of change for a Nintendo rumble pack...to attach to make it's unwieldy three handled spaceshipshaped controller more unwieldy and actually able to vibrate (cause unlike Sony they coudn't just build the rumble into the controller) and who has three hands to run a controller anyway?  Well have no fear because the directional button pad on the left is practically useless, I've not seen a game yet that uses it.  Oh yes and despite the cartridge mediums one advantage (being that games can be saved on a cartridge game instead of a memory card)N64 also made memory cards for another chunk of change...which is also nearly USELESS because 85% of the games save on the cartridge.  Nintendo used to be the leader in game systems, perhaps with the Gamecube's move to disk and picking up RE, they'll be able to turn around their slide toward the way of the Dreamcast.  Meanwhile if you want a cheap fun system with loads of available games of all types and aren't worried about cutting edge video game technology (which you aren't if you're considering the N64) then buy a PSone.  Half the price, many many more games for much much cheaper, and if you later get a PS2, the psone games will work on that as well.  Happy shopping True Believers.",2.0
"I will admit it i reserved the nintendo 64 months in advance. Sure when i got it i thought it was great, but after months of defending it against my classmates and their playstations, i decided to get my own. It by far surpasssed the n64's enjoyment. Sure the n64 has better graphics, but playstation was the better games and better sound. In my opinion nintendo aims their games for a much younger audience. Many of their games are not apealing to the 14+ crowd. Playstation provides way more games for this age group, along with games for the younger group, but they can still be injoyable for the older gamers. The playstaion controler is much better in design. The dual shock controller is the best that i have seen, but who wants to put that bulky heavy rumble pack in the back of the n64 controller? I hate the memory pack for n64, one season on qb club fills the whole thing, theres 20 bucks gone for a game that costs 60 in the first place. That brings me to another point, games are alot cheaper pn playstation, you are looking at a 20 dollar diference. If you are deciding between a playstation or a n64 i would go with the playstation. If you are buying a system for a younger gamer then i would consider the n64.",2.0
"if U are thinking about buying a 64...honestly think again ...it's a better system than PS1...the sound is better..and graphics are better in a wierd way (it's abit dreamy like)...though...what a good system needs is good games...and 64 is a terrible machine in this field...I seriousely think those guys in Nintendo are crazy ...I mean who would like to pay 50$ to play TENNIS using mario...or take snap shots of pokemon characters flying By,..or MArio golf, MArio party...or a fighting game using mario or play Banjo tooie agame exactly like banjo kazooie, which is excatly like mario 64 which is exactly like the new ZELDA which is exactly like the.donkey kong 64 which is exactly like..for some reason. NINTENDO has decided to make really strange, wierd bad games....I have a 64 and I can't play the type of games I want to play with it...like..Crazy taxi, driver, street fighter 2, ...and I am constantly waiting for a better game to come up though each month They disapoint me with their ""funny"" ideas...what's next ..Mario nose picking competition?",2.0
"Sure the graphics on this game might be nice, and have creative ships and characters, but in the long run this game is just a big bite off of Mechwarrior: Mercenary.

"Yet another in the turgid 'Wing Commander' series, 'Prophecy'thankfully reduces the amount of dull, plotless FMV, whilst notsignificantly improving the gameplay, which doesn't seem to have evolved very much since the original 'Wing Commander'. Your ship still doesn't 'feel' as if it is flying through space, the supposedly-invincible bad guys are more of a nuisance than a threat, and if you fail a mission it will probably be because you failed to protect something that you were not told about.

"Origin seems to be in the business of reinventing their trademark series that first gave them credit to the ""We Create Worlds"" slogan.  However, in the process of making them 3D accelerator and masses-friendly  Origin has also managed to undermine everything that had made the series  great, namely its characters and compelling stories.  Now this outing which  puts closure on the WC series isn't nearly as bad as Ultima Ascension, but  it's severely lacking nonetheless.
It makes sense to try to start anew  with a fresh-faced protagonist who has yet to make the name for himself  that previous legend Chris Blair forged in the last four games, especially  with Mark Hamill entering his twilight years and whose heavy uniform pips  and medals may alienate newcomers.  That's all good.  What's not all good  is that the choice they made to take over the pilot's seat, Lt. Casey, has  all the spine of a jellyfish and the verbal acuity of a junior high school  wallflower at his first party.  Even in the later half of the game when his  piloting skills have started to beget him some respect from his peers, his  attempts to affect the grizzled demeanor of a kid who had to grow up too  fast and pull his own weight on deck is as laughable as his previously  innocuous self.  As for the rest of the cast, they even more annoying.  All  of the men act like egotistical frat boys, and all the women like snotty  ice-queens.  Even returning loose canon on deck Maniac looks unbelievably  uncomfortable on-screen, and in the process hams up his role.  You could  care less about these superficial cardboard newcomers, in fact, the only  relief comes from old comrades reprising roles and making cameos, namely  Blair, Hawk, and even brief appearances of Admiral Wilfred and Col. Decker.  Unfortunately, the former two end up dying during the game, leaving you to  dogs of these petulant Gen-X-Wing jocks.
The plot is unapologetically  formulaic: Evil aliens invade our space and its up to our heroes to thwart  'em.  The missions cover familiar, if somewhat banal ground from previous  WC  installments along the escort/patrol/strike variety, though not nearly  as innovative as the ones from WC IV.  The new alien foes are fearsome  enough in their sleek and reptilian splendor, actually bearing an uncanny  resemblance to species 8479 from Star Trek: Voyager, but they are given no  context.  By contrast, they have none of the culture or history of the  Kilrathi that was so captivating, even delivering a renegade in your midst  in WC II, Hobbes.  You really learn nothing about the alien race in  Prophecy or the purpose of their invasion, merely some pseudo-theological  drivel about they being the harbingers of a space-age apocalypse, but the  premise falls flat.  One gets the impression that they really exist to  merely show off the new ship models. You'll find the one-sided design of  the plot to be an enormous step backward from the complex conspiracies  woven in WC 4's civil war.
The game ends on one of those portentous  sci-fi sequel-promising notes (""They'll be back, y'know"").  Except Origin is no longer creating straight-forward single-player epics,  so one is forced to ask exactly what was the point of breaking all this  supposed new ground if nothing is going to be done to evolve it and its new  cast beyond their rote and insipid beginnings.  Then again, since Origin  seems to have been unable to churn a decent game since 1996, maybe that's  not such a bad thing.  Sure, the engine looks gorgeous, and all of the  fighters and cap ships have undergone complete cosmetic changes, but all  the eye-candy in the world can't cover up the lack of a compelling plot or  characters, qualities that made the series endure eight years.  In  summation, the discriminating space sim gamer is better of with Descent:  Freespace II, X: Beyond the Frontier, or hell, wait a few months for Chris  Roberts of Digital Anvil to release Starlancer, he being the pre-Prophecy  WC man who really knew what it was about.",2.0

If you can pick something up you can  surely bet that it will have an immediate use in the next scene. Not too  challenging.  Lastly, the game itself did not play smoothly.

After playing the game for  two months I could not understand why some many magazines gave such a  average game tons of ""above average"" reviews.

"Okay. Some people (Like 10 and 12 year olds) think this game is sooo cool. This game so very unrealitic. Infact, everything about this game is stupid. The weapons are okay, but when you fire, there is no recoil that makes you reticule (The cross thingy that helps you aim) go up and down. Also, 1 shot from any gun kills an enemy (Which is pathetic) so why put your M4A1 rifle on burst? Just use single shot to conserve ammo. The games graffics are as [bad] and the screams that the enemies make when you shoot them are corny and cartoony. I suggest that you do not buy this game because of the reasons listed above. Please, save your money and buy a better game like Counter-Strike (The best game ever made) Half-Life (The second best) or Rainbow Six: Raven Shield (The third best) If you are looking for realism, DO NOT look here at this game.

"I picked up this game and I am not particularly impressed.  The only real improvements to the game are the additions of rain/snow, bogs, and more fiery explosions than the first DF.  Still, it remains unexciting.
There is no end mission body count and aftermath reading like there was in the first DF; you just get put back on the map when you beat a mission.  Furthermore, if you win the campaign, you simply win the campaign.  There aren't even any messages letting you know you beat it.  Also, there is a horrible shortage of missions.  When I found out about the new underwater assault rifle and pistol in this game, I was excited and prepared myself for some Navy SEAL-type missions.  However, there are no missions that require the use of these weapons, and likewise there are also no missions that require the use of the underwater rebreather.  Just as well, there are no missions that require the use of the video camera (I don't know why they added this one, it's no substitute for extra ammo or a Kevlar vest).
There are some good features added, such as the ability to blow up tents and watch the smoke billow from them, but this didn't really save the game.  It needs more missions and it shouldn't add unnecessary gear to really be worthy of more stars.",2.0

"I've played almost every flight sim available today, and some that are so old that they haven't been available in years. I have hoped and  waited for Microsoft to release a Flight Simulator program that not only gets the flight dynamics of a real plane correct, but also gets the  graphics up to par with some of the other less realistic simulators (combat sims mostly). Flight Simulator 2000 disappoints again. I am  running a very high end system with a very powerful video card and the graphics on this game still are bad. When you look out of the  sides of the airplane (left, right, back, etc) the program requires 'loading time' in order to render the cockpit art. Totally unacceptable in  my book. No amount of settings adjusting could correct this on my computer.
  If the largest software company in the world is going to release a program, and charge 50 bucks a pop for it, I think that the graphics  should not only be adequate but should absolutely kick some behind! Flight Simulator is a serious disappointment in that department.
  The dynamics are interesting. I guess if all you want to do is look straight ahead and instrument fly you are in luck here because the  dynamics seem to be fairly realistic. The adjustable difficulty settings are nice and the variety of airports to take off and land on are a nice  feature as well (though there isn't much difference between runways as far as particular problems in approach are concerned, because the  MS flight sim world is COMPLETELY FLAT).
  Poor showing Microsoft. Hire some coders who can make the artwork something other than ameturish and you may just have something.  Look to some of your competitors work for an example, or take a ride in a real plane and make an attempt to recreate not only the way  it handles, but how the world really looks and what it is like to turn your head around in a cockpit. I guarantee it is nothing like FS 2000.",2.0
"""De plane! De plane! It's stuttering! De plane!"" First of let me say that you need a computer the size of the Empire state building to run this game. I got a PIII 800 with a GeForce 256 card and a 256 memory and  this game tore it to shreds in a matter of minutes. This made me think  again about upgrading my system. As long as you fly straight it's ok; that  is if you want to fly to the North pole or the South pole everytime you  boot up this game. But once you turn the aircraft, you'll experience  graphics turbulence. You'll feel your computer shudder and shake as it  battles it's way to redraw the scenery. You'll see your frames slow down  really bad. Lower the graphics settings? Try it and you'll just make this  game laugh in your face. Download the patch? Yes, I did and it was still  stuttering. You can make every upgrade you want on your computer but if the  game is the problem then it's a lost cause. If you're thinking about  picking up this game, make sure you have a powerful computer that runs on  nuclear energy. Like most other Microsoft Flight Sims, this one is geared  more towards the gamer side and not so much on the real simulator  enthusiasts. The planes are just too easy to fly. You could ask your kid  brother to do the take-off procedure. Realism is not that all real as the  game boasts itself to be. The game does have its own pluses though like a  huge database of airports, downloadable Jeppesen weather reports, and of  course there's a lot of third party support on this. If you're a gamer who  wants to try flight sims then pick this game up. If you're a simulator ,  then pick up something else like Fly 2K! (very realistic) or Aerowinx  744(very very realistic).",2.0
"I agree that this is a great sim as far as graphic detail and features go, but if you do not have an EXTREMELY FAST machine with LOTS OF RAM, and a GREAT VIDEO CARD, you are in for a disappointment.  I tried all of the tips  and techniques for squeezing extra juice out my computer, but it was still  a very slow jerky, frame rate.  It also takes a VERY long time to install.  I am running a PII333, with 96MB RAM, and a VOODOO 3 video card.  I ended  up removing it from my machine and reinstalling FS98, which runs fantastic  on my machine.  I think Microsoft could do a better job of tuning this  thing up so it will run better on less powerful machines.  It is not that  much better than FS98 unless you use maximum scenery complexity, etc.  I  even tried to use FS2000 on Sparse everything, but it was still very slow.  At the least Microsoft should put the real requirements on the box.  I  wouldn't have bought it if the box had said it required as much power to  run smoothly.  Hope this helps someone from making a mistake.  I am keeping  it until I get that monster machine sometime in the not too distant future.",2.0
"As a seasoned veteran of Flight Simulator 98 and a licensed FAA rated commercial pilot, I am no stranger to Microsoft flight simulations.
Initially when I loaded FS2000Pro I was very excited due  mostly to the hype surrounding this product... This of course was short  lived.
I am currently running a AMD-K62 400Mhz CPU, 128Mb RAM and an ATI  Expert 2000 32Mb video card.
If I turn the overall display quality down  to 1 (the lowest setting), I get marginally acceptable framerates at  800X600. (800X600 is the lowest you can go and still have clear, readable  rendering of your cockpit intrumentation)
Even Microsoft's recomended  system requirements are not enough to run this simulation, much less the  minimal requirements of a Pendium 166Mhz! I can now see myself returning to  FS98 if not totally abandoning the MS platform all together. (I am  currently looking into X-Plane which operates on an OpenGL platform)
On a  more positive note, my two stars are given for the great job in the  graphics detail. It would be nice to enjoy them in their full glory (as  soon as I spend $500.00+ in system upgrades).
In the end the number one  quality that will impress real pilots and home users in a flight simulation  is INTEGRITY. ""Are you listening Microsoft?""",2.0
"I was about to purchase FS98 when I heard about FS2k and waited for the ""as real as it gets"" edition.  I am so disappointed in FS2K that I returned it to the store and bought FS98.  Don't get me wrong, the  graphics, planes, etc on FS2K are out of this world, but you need a system  capable of running the Space Shuttle to run the thing.  My system meets all  requirments for FS2K, but what I have is a slide show, not a sim.  For the  average amatuer user, its not worth the extra money to upgrade your system  for a flight sim.  Chances are you'll be disappointed.",2.0
"If you are going to buy this game because of either David Bowie or because somebody said ""you can interact with almost everything in this world"", DON'T!  It's just not worth the frustration of having to  play the game.  First of all if you want Bowie's music get it on CD sounds  better.  If you want an interactive world talk to your friends.  Both these  things get old in the first 30 mins of the game and you have hours to go  before you are done.
  First the positive, Omikron does give you a huge  world that you can play around in.  The graphics for the people and places  are pretty good.  The general story line is pretty good, enough to keep you  interested for a while.  The sound is excellent. That's about it for the  good.
The Bad:
The Controls: Nothing good can come from having to set  your movement controls for four different gaming situations (Exploring,  Swimming, First person shooter, and hand to hand combat).  If you don't  mind the default settings this won't be a problem for you. If you do, you  have to go in and change the controls for different situations  independently.
The Graphics: Althought visually stunning, they are not  so good unless you do the 1.6 M install, if you don't everything you do the  game has to read from the CD kind of slows down the whole gaming  experience.  If you don't have the best in equiptment expect slow downs  anyways.  I'm also not exactly sure what the people at Quantic Dream deemed  it necessary when they enveloved the entire game in a fog.  It detracts  from the gameplay because you can never find anything unless your standing  in front of it.
The Gameplay:  The puzzles in Omnikron are not that  difficult to figure out, and they seem to rehash the same puzzles again  under a different premise.  Once you solved it the first time the  subsequent times are just tedious (Actually the whole puzzle solving part  of this game is tedious. It doesn't really involve all that much thinking  it's more you have to run around and find the components which are  sometimes obvious and other time just plain obscure or hard to read).  You  will also spend an inordinately large amount of time just running from  place to place.  The world is just to big sometimes.  If you forgot  something or need something from storage, it gets frustrating when you  spend 10 mins having to run to the closest terminal to extract it.  The  biggest frustration in the whole game is you don't always know what your  suppose to be doing.  Other adventure games always give you a sense of what  your suppose to be doing next.  Omikron fails to do that several times and  this is enough to get you to start cursing the day you bought this game.  The game seems to have an agenda of its own and neglects to tell let you in  on it.  This is just bad game design.
The first person shooter:  It's  like playing a beautiful Commodore 64 (computer from the 80's) game. Not  much challenge and enemies seem to have the ability to appear wherever they  want.
The hand to hand combat: Remember the Original Street Fighter  game this is even worse.
The final bad: Bugs lots of them  everywhere.

"I bought Age of Empires II because of the glowing reviews in PC Games magazine, and right here on Amazon.  I was tremendously excited; I loved the Warcraft series, and so this seemed like a perfect game for me.  Sadly,  I was wrong.
The game so closely resembles Warcraft, it ought to pay  licensing fees to it.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially  since the graphics are markedly better.  They are breathtaking, in fact; I  spent the first few minutes of game playing just marveling at them.  I also  was impressed with the tutorial mission, which teaches you the basics of  game play.  It did an excellent job of showing the ropes to impatient  people like me who hate to read manuals (although I did, later, and was  impressed by its comprehensiveness).
Then the problems began.  I played  the first real campaign, Joan of Arc, and was hopelessly board.  The first  two missions in the campaign were mind-numbingly dull: I was supposed to  ""escort"" the French Tart all over creation.  Get her from one place to  another without getting her killed and you win.  Fail and you lose.  There  appeared to be only one usable path, so strategy didn't enter into it.  The  only way to win was to play each scenario once, die, and learn where the  ambushes are placed (they were always in the same locations).  I gave up  when the third mission appeared to be more of the same.  I couldn't  understand why the tutorial had gone through all that time and effort to  teach you skills like building and foraging only to give a campaign that  required none of those skills.
Despairing of the campaign, I attempted a  ""random map"" scenario, in which the computer generates a map and turns you  lose on some computer opponents.  That is when the huge problems in the  game play became evident.
In warcraft, your peasants (or peons, if you  were an Orc) could do three things: build, cut trees, or mine gold.  In Age  of Empires, your peasants can do the following: build, cut trees, mine  gold, hunt animals, herd and slaughter sheep, hew stone, build walls, farm  crops.  Sound fun?  Not when you have to micromanage the entire affair.  In  Wafcraft, you could usually set your peons to work and forget about them.  In Age of Empires, you are constantly running out of sheep, and having  farms go fallow.  I was so busy trying to occupy myself with peasant  affairs that I didn't have time to muster and march m army.  ""But it's more  realistic,"" you may say.  I disagree; you're a TYRANT, for crying out loud!  You don't tell peasants where to farm; you demand your tribute and leave  them alone!  I also started getting lost in the building options; there  were simply too many buildings.
The first few times I played, I kept  getting overrun by the computer's armies.  I simply didn't prepare properly  because I was too busy building mines and monasteries.  The third time, I  managed to get my army gathered, and marched them into enemy territory,  prepared for glory.  I was thrilled with the anticipation of a bloody  victory.  I was happy with the formation options, that let you choose your  marching formation.  I chose the square, which put my weaker units in the  middle, for protection.
Too bad it didn't work.  Enemy soldiers would  simply charge through my front lines, directly to the weaker units, and  slaughter them before my army had a chance to respond.  Are you really  going to tell me that an army regiment has such slow reaction time that  they can't close ranks when an enemy soldier charges in?  It was another  frustrating element to the game, and made me ultimate shut off my computer  in annoyance.
There are some wonderful reviews of this game.  Maybe I am  missing something.  I must be missing an awful lot, though, because the  primary emotions I felt with this game were boredom and annoyance.  Get  Warcraft II instead.  Or do your laundry.  Either way, I think you'd have  more fun than playing Age of Empires II.",2.0
"I really wanted to like Warpath: Jurrasic park more then I really did, Honest.  It sounds like such a great concept, get a bunch of really neat dinos, put them in cool enviorments from the movies and presto! you have the concept of a realliy exciting game that is anything but exciting.  The dinos in this game are neat looking and move well (But why is the Velocoraptor 2 stories tall?) but most of them are dull and dreary and act withought any personality.  Some of them are just insane to defeat (cough cough cough pachysaluphasaurus cough cough cough every other dino cough cough cough) The hardest part of the entire game is the insane difficulty level, even on the easiest level this is not even close to being a walk in the park especially the god-* dino that is like a kangaroo and a pachy combined who is impossible to defeat and could be the most annoying charachter in a video game sience the frog in StarFox 64.  Unlocking extra worthless dinos to play with is about as exciting and fun as watching golf on TV.  You will probably have to play a compleate game 3 to 4 times to unlock a measly extra dino that does about as much damage as a insane snail that is addicted to beer.  One of the worst parts of the game that is close to being as annoying as the kanga-pachy is the human commentator.  After each match he will yell something laughable and annoying like ""Get the containment rooms moving stat!"" or ""What a specticle"" and if you choose to continue playing after loosing a match (Trust me,dont) ""Its not over yet!"".  It is for me, uggh.
The good: You can play as a dino, eating humans and dogs is fun, neat enviorments, you can use the game disk as a ninja disk weapon.
The Bad: playing more then 3 times will get you bored out of your mind, playing multiple times is boring, unlocking things is insanly difficult, victory scenes are annoying, the commentator should be shot.
And the Ugly:  Some dinos are insanely difficult to defeat, how can a 10 ton triceratops jump in the air?",2.0
"The first Age of Empires was great. The second one just plain sucked. Sure it has good graphics and an easy to use interface, but the game would always crash both of my computers.

"The problem with this game is that there is no room for artistry.  You put up the same buildings, usually in the same order, and it doesn't much matter where.  Games like ""Civilization"" have wonderful movies  (showing, say, the blasting of a Titan rocket or the building of the  pyramids) and require a great deal of strategy.  Games like ""Caesar  III"" allow you to feel as if you are actually presiding over a Roman  City.  Indeed, as you build your city, you have to balance every aspect of  Roman life, from water resources to the worshipping of Gods.  However, Age  of Kings enjoys none of these dimensions.  I have found that the one-player  version (that I play)is simply more frustrating than fun.  The messages  from other kingdoms flash too quickly on the screen, the demands are  outrageous, and then you get invaded by all three other kingdoms at once.  And, unlike Caesar III, the stockpiling of resources in Age of Kings is  simply dull.",2.0

So I'm not convinced this game is actually new, but probably used and given some new shrink wrap. Or maybe it was just REALLY beat up with the original shrink wrap.

"After playing Asheron's Call for almost 18 months, I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach.  For lovers of the fantasy genre, this game had much promise from the it's beginning, but quickly decayed into an empty shell created by poor game design.
Quests are horrible, and quests items are merely shiny toys to show off. They, for the most part, serve no purpose and are useless.
Character classes are a complete joke.  At the point of character creation you are given a great number of choices and variables, but after 2 months of play you quickly realize that almost all character skills are useless.  Only 2 character classes are viable: Mages and Warrior-Mage hybrids that MUST have Life magic.
The world in vast, but unused.  Monsters are dull, and for the most part the designers take one monster and 'skin' it 10 different ways, and call them new monsters. Player vs. player is a joke (once again you must be 100% magic heavy). Archery is a joke after 2 months of play. Lockpicking is useless. Alchemy is useless....on and on.
A good concept, but horrid design. Kill, kill, kill, level, kill, kill, kill, level. A bad first person shooter.
If you pick up this game and love fantasy, you will be hooked for 2 months, until you begin to realize that all the fantasy/lore/quests elements mean nothing. To play the game after that you must kill the same monsters sometimes 5000-10000 times to become strong enough to kill the next monster. Them you kill it 10000 times to become strong enough to kill the next monster. Get the picture?
One other point to touch on is the lack of punishment for cheaters and exploiters...there is none. At various times the servers have gone through periods in which they would crash very frequently due to players exploiting the game (and 'duping' items). Also, the monthly updated code always causes long periods of game outages.
Bad game play. Poor design. Bad code. A first person shooter in the disguise of a fantasy game.",2.0

On the other hand, if you have other responsibilities and interests that will prevent you from investing many hours daily in this game, you should skip it altogether.  It's way to complicated, and the other players are way too immersed in it, for you to have any fun with anything less than an all out effort.

"Asheron's Call is a basic RPG played online. You create your character from three different races of humans (basically English, Arabian or Japanese) and then assign skills and stats to customize your character. And then you're launched into the world of Asheron's Call.
The first thing that strikes you is the scale of the game. It's huge. The second thing is the unavoidable question: What do I do know? Now here's what I did: After entering the game I wandered around for an hour or two trying to make scense of it all. I was then asked by another player if I wanted to swear allegiance to him (which meant that he would be my patron and help me get started with my char.). So I then followed my patron around for a few hours and did what he told me to do. I killed a lot of monsters and was given a lot of equipment. This quickly became boring and I quit playing and traded the game in at my local games store for a copy of ""Sacrifice"" (which was much more exciting).
The main problem with an online RPG is, in my opinion, the lack of meaning or a goal. At least in the beginning. You just wander around and kill things. There's no quests. There's no nothing. Just wandering around in this huge (note: to get an idea of how huge it really is, read Douglas Adam's description of infinity in ""The Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy"") world. Another things that really bothers me, is the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee ($... in this case) to play a game you initially paid a fair sum of money for (in my case, $...). Why is this? I'm sure there are some expences in keeping the servers going, but not $... a month for each player. On Microsoft's webpages, it said that there were over 200k people playing the game. Multiply that number by $... and you get the staggering amount of $... a month (no way it costs that much to maintain the servers). Capitalism rules, I guess.",2.0

In the towns you  can walk two steps, lag for 5 secs, walk 2 more, wait another 5 secs, etc.  It all gets to be particularly irritating when these glitches appear during  combat.

"I am an avid player of quite a few online games (Ultima Online, EQ, Diablo, etc...) and I must say that I find M$'s entry into the market quite lame. Yes, it's a huge world. Yes, it's got pretty graphics (Hence the 2nd  rating star). Yes, it's got ""Make money from addict RPG'rs.""  written all over it. But truth be told, the game has zero content and  depth. Games like EQ and UO give you a feeling of things moving and  changing around you as well as a sense that your actions also make a  difference. Asheron's Call, on the other hand, gives you the feeling of  playing in an upscale version of Redneck Rampage (no disrespect meant to  that game which is enjoyable in it's own right). For a game that tout's a  3-D immersive enviroment, they should at least let you immerse yourself in  the local lake. Unless of course you like feeling akin to a minor deity and  run across it while outrunning some local nasty.

"When EA sports got the rights to WCW I guess they thought about how to do it, do they go with the way THQ did it, or the way ACCLIAM would? They seemed to be able to make a graphic that is in between both designs! It's kind of the THQ game play with WWF Attitudes graphics in a way. The graphics of the wrestlers and motion in this game look like Attitudes style only they look stupid, each character looks like a big head on a small body with skinnier legs, they look like they are going to start hopping around the ring like a rabbit or a kangaroo or something.

The game has so many flaw...

- No costume change for any wrestler.
- Cant edit wrestlers
- Created wrestlers cannot have there moves chosen individually. You have to select a pre programmed set of moves from one of the existing wrestlers in the game. And you cant even select a different finishing move which is stupid because it shows an option to change it but if you change it to say the Jacknife Powerbomb then it will change the previous move list to that of Kevin Nash.
- Too many moves are wrong, not done right, given to the wrong wrestler ect and high flyers like Rey Mysterio don't have off the rope moves or anything, there basically grounded. or moves are missing, hogans leg drop is not a finisher, Nash doesnt do that size up thing in the corner, scott hall has no choke slam, lex luger has no torture rack, sting does headscissors, but its the wrong headscissors, he does a cruiserweight one instead of the regular one, randy savage doesnt raise his arms on the top rope elbow, god knows what else is missing.
- Moves just become repeated and it gets boring. Every charactor feels about the same to control.
- It sucks to only be able to hit your opponent with a weapon 2 or 3 times before they block it (every time, no joke) the weapons don't consist much more then chairs and bats.
- Going backstage is nothing special. 4 weapons and nowhere to go but back to ring side.
- The codes are annoying to have to put in up to 15 digit codes every time you wanna access it - meaning you have to put them in each match, then once you finish you have to put them in again.
- There has been little attention payed by the creators to the background.
- Everything is too programmed. You figure out right away that eventually you can hit your opponent twice on the ground before they get up and finishing moves don't mean your opponent will stay down like they should. I did a 3-way match and dropped about a million diamond cutters on them and they get up right away.
- Only one special move for each wrestler. And all are done the same way in a grapple, which means wrestlers like Bret Hart and Stings Sharpshooter are not there finishers!
- You can only select about 5 tunes for a CAW's ring music.
- The entrances are very dodgy.
- The commentary becomes VERY annoying after you've heard it repeated 1000 times in the one match.
- CAW can't choose attires from the other wrestlers, or a moustache like Hogan to make a CAW version of the yellow and red Hogan.
- A lot of moves are missing; Booker T's axe kick finisher thing, Bret Harts 'hart attack', double team moves, ways to turn your opponent around to grabble them from behind, Hogan's big boot, there is only one pin unless it's a move - not one of them hooks the leg or anything unless it's a move given to them, taunts are missing, entrance taunts are wrong or missing.
- It's another game that has completely ignored Hulk Hogan's Leg Drop as being a devastating finisher, it's simply just a running leg drop that doesn't even look like the height Hogan would do it from and I don't know if I've ever seen Hogan pull off a standing drop kick before. It's just an average leg drop with little damage.
- all the backstage rooms are the same, there just a diffrent picture on the walls which is boring.
- Goldberg's not only in the game, but also on the damn cover.
And finally, it's WCW.

My recommendation is WWF NO MERCY. However the WCW fan may prefer WCW/NWO Revenge. THQ made the better wrasslin' games on the 64. Stick with them.

"I hated WCW Mayhem for a lot of reasons. One, way too much production level was spent on making the characters look good and they still looked awful. The Create A Wrestler was a total pain. Why? Because if you picked certain items of clothing for a wrestler, it didn't match and he looked stupid. Honestly, if you picked Nash's pants, you either had to be skins on top or wear his tank top as well because nothing else matched or looked right. That and you didn't get to pick any of their moves. Again, another F- for effort.
Basically all you did was create a new non-matching-outfit-having wrestler with someone else's moves. Bad. Very bad. So bad that's why WWF Warzone never did that type of Create a Wrestler ever again. And not saying that WWF Attitude was the heart stopping game that it was supposed to be, but at least they learned their lesson and never did that type of Create a Wrestler option.
The grappling totally ate. I was basically kicking, punching and occassionally jumping off the top rope in an attempt to win. I could not get the grapping. It was seriously that bad. Every now and then, I'd pull off a little something, but after that one time, I could never replicate the move. Again another G- for effort (the grading was so low that I couldn't even give it an F because it was that bad).
I wouldn't waste time or money on this title. I still think the better N64 wrestling game was WCW/NWO or WCW Revenge. If you really want to play this bad attempt, then go ahead but I won't be responsible when after you play it, realize that it WAS THAT BAD and throw it out the window.",2.0
"WCW STINKS. At least that's what most WWF, ECW, and other wrestling fans believe, and from the looks of this game, they're right. The only fun thing about this game is the 4-man battle royal. Everything else, the character designs, the entrances, the bizarre physics of contact (I punch while you're a mile away; you feel it) just smell worse than... Santa after a rowdy elf party. Stay away from this game... it gets one star for the battle royal, and the other for just booting up when you turn it on. Go buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.",2.0
"Don't get me wrong, both games in Anthology are excellent. I would consider Final Fantasy VI, to be the greatest RPG ever created. But the ""Greatest Hits"" version of this package does dissapoint.

The original black label version of Anthology was created by SquareSoft, and included in the package was an extra CD, with music from both games.

However, the black label edition has been out-of-print for some time. The newly formed company, Square-Enix decided to re-release Anthology as a ""Greatest Hits"", but excluded the music CD in the package. So, instead of receiving three disks (the two gaming disk, and one music CD), only the two game disks are included with the game.

The Square-Enix release of Anthology feels much more like a cheap cut-and-paste copy of Final Fantasy. Besides lack of the music CD, much of the artwork from the previous black label release is gone, and instead, the gaming disks are designed with a standard white label.

Final Fantasy Anthology from Square-Enix, is certainly not a collector's item, despite what the package label might say. It is my suggestion to pass this purchase up, and find a copy of the black label release from SquareSoft.",2.0
"Got this and the Sidewinder II force feedback stick for Christmas. I couldn't WAIT to play it, so I installed it on my mother-in-law's NEW Celeron machine right a way... BIG mistake!  The box grossly understates the requirements, but it says ""Pentium"", and it MEANS ""Pentium""! Don't even try on a fast (500 MHz) Celeron.  At home, I installed on a 400 MHz PII, 128 MB ram, and set the visuals to a compromise point, so I could at least get 15 frames/sec.
I think they should have ditched some of the thousands of airstrips, and save the space for better terrain detail.  Flying over flat, blocky, repeated aerial photos just isn't that exciting.  Trying to please everyone in the world by putting in their local po-dunk airport has make the overall product suck.  It is fun to fly out of your hometown once, but since there is a tremendous lack of detail, the novelty quickly fades.
The 3D buildings have poor detail, and dynamic scenery, like clouds, are always ""popping"" up in your face as the machine frantically tries to keep up.  This creates a huge lack of details in the distance, and an unrealistic feel.  It is much easier to fly at night, because the shimmery, blocky ground graphics do not distract you.  Flying VFR (visual) should be easier, but the detail is so poor, you can't tell one road from another.
When you land, there is nowhere to really go, except up again.  There is nothing to greet you at the airport terminal - not even traffic to avoid. If you can even find your way to the terminal, that is.  Again, the ground detail makes it very difficult to see where you are going.  The terminals are just static blocks.  It would be fun to actually deliver your passengers to the gate, or something.  It would be cool to have a ""passenger meter"", showing the discomfort of your passengers when you pull some serious negative G's in a 737.  Some screams and cheers in the background would be appropriate, and would give some sense of accountability when you barrel roll through the Grand Canyon!
The force feedback to the SideWinder blows.  It felt like I had a gator by the tail!  I have flown planes before, and they do NOT fight you the way this game/stick combo does.  Turn the force off, because it spends all its time trying to force itself back to center, using the FS2000 settings.
On the positive side, the flight models seem very accurate (if you don't use the force feedback stick!).  This simulator would be somewhat valuable for pilots practicing IFR, navigation, and approaches to specific airports.  The sound is very good, but gets crackly when the visuals drain your system resources.
When somebody builds a sim that I can look down and RECOGNIZE houses, streets, etc., I'll try this again.  Otherwise, I'd stick to games/sims that rely on action and strategy, rather than realism, for their fun factor.",2.0
"Although F/S 2000 has much improved graphics and sound, it is nowhere near as user-friendly as F/S 98. The flight options are much harder to access and even with allot of disc space, the program crashes quite often. I have  yet to complete a flight. I have uninstalled F/S 2000. I will continue to  use F/S 98 . I hope that Microsoft can work out the kinks in the program.  It does seem like others have had these problems. If you are looking to  purchase F/S 2000 be warned of these existing problems. It may be better to  wait until M/S can modify the program, and rebates are offered.",2.0
The graphics performance of this game is very slow and pixelated without a 3D graphics accelerator.  I don't recommend playing the game without one.,2.0
"When I first played this game I thought it was terrific - amazing graphics (apart from the characters, who look very blocky close-up), stunning visuals and fast movement.  It truly looked as though Sonic had entered the  32-bit world.
But after you've got over the graphics you realise somebody  forgot to put a game into it.  The controls are just rubbish - it takes  forever just to change direction, so that later levels which twist and turn  are rendered impossible even after ages of practice.  There are far too few  tracks, so things become repetative, and it soon becomes very boring.
To  sum up, if all you want from a game is pretty graphics and the pure  presence of Sonic the Hedgehog then this is a must-buy.  If, on the other  hand, you're looking for something with any kind of gameplay, depth or  long-term appeal then look elsewhere.  Personally I didn't relish watching  the other races speeding away into the distance with computer-aided  perfection for the millionth time.",2.0
"When I first saw Fighting Steel on the shelf, my immediate reaction was ""Finally, the ultimate follow-on to the Great Naval Battles series.""  As I read the details printed on the box, my interest peaked  and I couldn't wait to get into a major capital ship engagement.  Unfortunately, I then installed this turkey and tried to play it.
Simply  put, the game requires too much detailed effort to be enjoyable.  There are  an endless series of menus and sub-menus that must be employed to get  anything done.  By the time you have formed your forces, set navigational  parameters, and maybe gotten lucky enough to engage the enemy, you're more  than ready for the action to start.  It doesn't happen that way.  The game  requires micromanagement of every aspect; navigation, gunnery, damage  control, and this for every ship.  What should be a very enjoyable  simulation just bogs down in minutia.
What is even more frustrating is  the magnificent selection of available forces.  Battleships,  battlecruisers, heavy cruisers, destroyers, subs and just about everything  else from every major fleet are there, alongwith an almost overwhelming  assortment of weapons.  This game could have been a World War II  enthusiast's dream come true, but it just doesn't deliver on the  promise.
Worse yet is the brutal tendancy for the game to lock up in the  middle of the action, with no apparent pattern to the problem.  Technical  support is non-existent, so you just get to start over and hope for  something better.
The graphics are good, the sound effects are  excellent and, if you can get a battle going, it's quite realistic.  The  problem is that it takes too long to get there, too much effort to control  the forces engaged, and carries no guarantee that you'll get to see  anything through to a conclusion.
If they ever get this right, it's going  to be great.  Somehow, I don't think I'll hold my breath.",2.0
"Frustrated with trying to run Microsoft's power hungry monster Flightsim  2000 on my PII, 450mhz system , I thought I'd give '98 a try.  Frame rate  was explosive but it's anemic virtual world left me flat.  Flightsim '98 is  only a couple years old but in todays high end visual universe, it looks  and feels nothing short of drab and dated.  So long old friend, the time  has come to move on to the budget software bin, your time in the sun has  sadly passed.",2.0
"I was really excited about getting Who Wants to Be A Millionaire. The graphics are well done, and the game is much like the television version. Yet, after just a couple of hours, we began to get a repeat of questions.  After just two days of owning this product, I'm lucky to get any new  questions. Needless to say, I'm a Millionaire!",2.0
"The good thing about this game is that the gameplay is all its cracked up to be. The ship designing, AI, options, and research were very good. The only major things disapointments in the gameplay are the cruddy video  clips, poor dimplomacy, and dated graphics. However, the interface is  pathetic. It is slow, clumsy, and annoying. One turn, on a top of the line  computer, can take 3 seconds. That may seem like little, but the average  construction time for a ship is 75 turns. It also pops up these annoying  dialog boxes from time to time, changes screen resolution for every  different screen, and requires far too many clicks to do the simplest of  tasks. It is also very unstable. it took me four tries to install it right,  as there is no documentaion for installation. The game also crashes about  every five minutes. I will not even mention the lack of support for moer  than one game, the almost non-existant multiplayer (25 tries and I still  ant get it to work), the rediculus number of startup screens, or any of its  other major problems. All things considered, ... I  would recomend a different game. Alpha Centauri, Starcraft, or something  like that. While the gameplay is good, it is not worth the time it takes to  actually play, as you will have to restart continuosly, if you can even get  it to work.",2.0
"I think that the review at the top of this game has it right -- not enough questions.  Also, the $100 through $1000 questions are too hard (compared to the TV show).
Another annoying feature is the inability to skip past stuff that you have seen a million times, that is redundant to you.
I bought this game out of boredom, and I think that I paid about $... for it.  If you like the TV show, then don't pay any more than that.  But, if you see it on the rack real cheap, then hey, pick it up.",2.0
"Free, with the purchase of a specific brand of rice-flavored cereal: Who  Wants To Be A Millionaire, 1st Edition.  The complete game.  Yes, the CD is  right there on the front of the cereal box.

"There are two problems with this game:
1) Not enough questions, and not  enough repetition logic.
2) The ""phone a friend"" lifeline is  completely useless. If you were on the show, you would phone a real friend  and you would have a good idea whether or not they *should* know the  answer. On this, you're just calling Regis' friends, so it's not really  useful at all. Therefore it's not an accurate representation of the real  game. (yes that's bad, and no I don't have a suggestion around the  problem)
The game is fun for the first 5 games or so, until you start  getting more questions repeated. It's not a full priced game though, so you  kind of get what you paid for.",2.0
"At first, I was very excited about getting this game. When I got it, I really enjoyed it. It started out as a solid 4-star game, great questions,  sarcasm from Regis, heart-pounding music, it had it all. The only initial  problem was that the first few questions were too hard. But then after 1  hr. of playing it...WHAT WAS I THINKING WHEN I BOUGHT THIS GAME! The  questions kept repeating, and repeating, and repeating! After playing it  for 2 days of playing 1 hr. each day, I can get up to $125,000 almost  everytime because I remember all the answers! Besides the very limited  supply of questions, the multiplayer game was also pretty bad. Given, there  are more good things about it then there are bad things, but the bad things  are absolutely unforgivable. The only reason to get this game would be to  learn about 200 new facts (the # of questions) because you're guaranteed to  remember ALL of them after only about a week of playing.",2.0
"Now I like the television show, don't get me wrong, but the gamein comparison just gets stupid.  This computer game was obviously puttogether only to make more money off the sucess of the tv show.  For example, the ""genius"", or should I say not so genius creaters of this game put so few questions in the game that the questions begin repeating again and again.  How would someone think he is being challenged if he is getting repeat questions? Oh, he (or she) cant.
Despite this atrocity (the repeating questions) I did enjoy the game for the first 2 hours.  The lifelines were good.  Plus, the game is made by Jellyvision, the same makers of ""You Dont Know Jack"" and the setup is quite like that series. . .",2.0
"Frankly, I was absolutely happy to get this computer game and play it. Was I ever wrong. You have to go through 3 minutes of the numbers flying past you and finally Regis asking you if you want to be a millionaire, and you can't skip through there. When you go for the fastest finger, my only  advice is DO IT FAST. The slower you get causes Regis to announce he's  quitting, which, for your computer, exits the program. Time to load it  right back up again! Once you get through it, you're asked to type in your  name. Say you're not fast enough - he'll bark at you, ""Well, what is  it? A fake name's okay too! Hurry up!"" So much for slow typists: you  better hurry up. Finally, you get to the game and voila! Haven't you seen  those questions before? The $100 question basically is easy on some days  and sometimes will trip you up immediately - anyone out there know the most  populated month for weddings? August. And if you lose your money before the  $1000 mark, he'll give you a blank check and tell you he's seen lots of  people do better than you - in fact everyone. Or, it's a big check, but  only determining on how big your monitor is. And when you get to the  million (after his ""oh, $8,000 - big deal"" or whatever), it's  basically a hard question, or easy. It's just plain stupid. Oh, and try to  use lifelines. The 50/50 leaves the two hardest-to-pick ones, the Audience  is sometimes wrong (I lost on the million dollar question 'cause of them!),  and after you call one of his friends, Regis chats with them! Absolutely  stupid. There's one question here and if you buy it you'll be the lucky  one: Who wants to be cheated?",2.0
"As others have mentioned, this product has serious flaws--especially with regard to the pitiful number of questions available.  For me, however, a larger complaint is the surprising unfaithfulness to the show.
The  so-called ""Fastest Finger"" questions are nothing really like  those on the show.  You don't compete to put the answers in the right  order; you just buzz in when the computer flashes up the proper  arrangement.  It's related to the set of skills necessary on the real  show--but it's not the same.
Likewise, when answering questions in the  ""hot seat"", you don't really get the ""Is that your final  answer?"" prompting in a consistent way.  Only some of the questions  allow for it.
Also, the questions in the pre-$1000 range are unusually  difficult, compared with the show. There, they're ridiculously easy,  complete with flatly idiotic possible answers.  Here, by contrast, the  early questions are much more serious.  They're still comparatively easy,  but they're not the gimmes they are on the real show.
Hopefully, the  producers will have found a way to be more faithful to the show--and give  us more questions--for the second edition of this game.",2.0
"The first few times through, this game is entertaining.  However, I've never seen a game that repeated questions so quickly.
I've owned Jeopardy for a year and only occasionally get a repeat.  I got repeat questions the first day I owned this.
Save your money, don't buy this one.",2.0
Great game but...not nearly enough questions.  After a couple of hours almost all questions are repeats.,2.0
"First and foremost, the game needs more material.  The questions repeat WAY too much than they ought to.  Computer games I have from ten years ago don't repeat this often!  The other problem with the game is that Regis  does not ask you, ""Is that your final answer?"" until you answer  at $500,000.  He should start saying that at the $1,000 level.  Regis also  doesn't read the question, and the questions are timed.  On the show, you  could use the whole show on one question, though I'm sure they'd edit that  down to an extent.  But the game is pretty good.  What they need to do is  cut down on phone-a-friends (they have four per question!), and do more on  the game material.  But I did get to the million before the game started  repeating, and so I'm glad of that.",2.0
"The game is good (if you like the show's concept) except for the repeating questions. The reason that there are so many repeating questions is because every question has a phone a friend lifeline which is actually carried  out...you have to listen to 30 seconds of audio of a friend explaining  their answer...I imagine that the CD is all filled up with these 30 second  audio monologues. It's a cute concept but I would have preferred text to  the audio so there could be 100's of more questions.
Buy Jeopardy  instead...it's more fun and the questions don't repeat as often.",2.0
"If you really like Who Want's to Be a Millionaire, like the multitude of television watchers that does, this game is almost worth the price. As said many times before, the questions begin to repeat soon after installing.  Good graphics for a trivia game, humiliating remarks from Regis... it's  good entertainment for a few days. Instead of this product, I would  personally recommend the You Don't Know Jack series...",2.0
i think they rushed this game for xmas!  I could only play it once and then i have to reinstall it to play it again i went to the website and found so many pages of troubles with the game. i belive buy the book insted  you'll be happier with that because i took mine back and got the book,2.0

"Holy fat mama! This game was the most hideous thing I have ever played.  Not only is it easier than the TV show, its twice as dumb!  The first and second questions I was asked the first time I played were the same stinkin'  question.  From the third game on, I never went without a repeat question.  You should stay away from this.  It will probably eventually drive you  insane by the low-fi sound clip of Regis saying ""Final Answer?""  anyways.  Try some of the not-as-pathetic games by eXpert software.  Such  as extreme paintball, deer hunter, and other quickly thrown together  titles.  It gets a second star for being functional (barely)",2.0
"I've heard about people spending as much as $40 for this game...more fool they.
I've played about 20 games so far, and have yet to have a repeated question, but I'm sure that's due to change.  I have a few other  gripes:
First off, it's impossible to tourn the speech off.  Sure, I can  turn off my speakers, but then the silent game will pause whenever Regis is  speaking.  I'd rather just *play* the game, and not have to put up with  Regis' generally unfunny banter.  This is a contrast to other Jellyvision  games (such as You Don't Know Jack) where the announcer is fun to listen  to.  And, strangely, Regis doesn't actually ask the questions -- they're  text only.  However, if you use your ""phone a friend"" option, the  ""friend"" will comment specifically on the question.  Why not  Regis?  It doesn't make a lot of sense.
Unlike most games on the market,  one cannot skip past the initial intro to the game, nor the logos of the  game's producers.  This means a few minutes of wasted time while loading up  the program.
The questions are also of strangely varying difficulty, too,  much like John Carpenter's million-dollar win compared to (say) Matt  Marcotte's 250K win.  I've been able to win the million once with a  terrifically easy question (what was the first Swanson's TV dinner?) and  also lost out on the initial $100 question (what month is traditionally the  most popular for weddings?).
And, finally, as with the TV show, the game  is very Ameri-centric.  At least a third of the questions centre around US  politics, history, sports, or geography.  I'm a Canadian.  What do I know  from the Green Bay Packers?
The game's likely to run out of interest in  a couple of days, but on the other hand, it would have cost me roughly the  same to buy two or three paperback novels.  I'm glad that I'll be able to  resell it for not much less than I paid for it.",2.0
"As a big fan of the TV show, I was really looking forward to the home version, and undoubtedly so were thousands of other fans.  Unfortunately, the folks at Disney and Jellyvision were clearly aware of that, and the  rush was obviously on to get this game to market as soon as possible,  before the craze could die down.  The result is a game that doesn't come  close to matching either the TV show or Jellyvision's previous  efforts.
The most obvious problem is the limited number of questions.  This problem is greatly compounded by the fact that the game doesn't seem  to make note of which questions have already been asked--a simply  inexcusable error, which results in repeated questions after only a few  games.
The box proudly touts the fact that a ""virtual Regis""  hosts the game; and sure enough, he's there.  But his involvement in the  project was clearly limited; he doesn't read any of the questions, only  providing the pre- and post-question patter.  That's understandable, given  the amount of money that Regis would have probably demanded for such a  large recording job; but it does greatly diminish the illusion of being on  the show.
The game's incorrect pacing destroys the rest of that illusion.  Instead of encouraging the player to take his/her time as the show does, a  30-second clock is inexplicably added.  And while the game rushes you  through the questions themselves, it needlessly slows down between them.  Since the designers couldn't have Regis read the questions, they clearly  wanted to maximize his involvement between questions; so the game stops  after every question while Regis delivers one of a set of long canned  remarks.  This is tolerable later in the game, but it comes across as  simply silly during the first few easy questions that the TV show would  blast through in short order.
As others have pointed out, even the  keyboard commands have problems.  Assigning a lifeline to the same key as  an answer choice is begging for mistakes; and the lack of an ""Is that  your final answer?"" question in most cases further increases the  possibility of errors, as well as erasing the remainder of the feel of  being on the show.
The game does have its moments; if multiple people are  playing, a clever implementation of the fastest-finger round decides who  gets to sit in the hot seat.  But frankly, I can't imagine playing this as  a multi-player game anyway; the show's format simply isn't suited to be a  party game, and this home version simply isn't exciting enough to  watch.
In summary, the Millionaire computer game has its (brief) moments,  but simply isn't worth even the low price Disney is asking for it.  It's  unfortunate that Disney and Jellyvision chose to put their names--and the  show's reputation--on such a disappointing effort.",2.0
"I looked forward very much to this game. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed in it.
It's not a total washout though. The sound and graphics are superb. The music and the ""Virtual Regis"" do indeed give you the feeling of being a part of the show, even though the best you  can accomplish is becoming a ""Fake Milliionaire.""
Unfortunately  sound and graphics alone do not necessarily make for a successful game and,  to be quite honest, they stand as the only high-point of this  product.
There is obviously a very limited amount of questions in this  game. The question repeat after just a few plays. And then they keep  repeating. It is so bad that you can play one game and then start another,  only to find that one or more of the questions from the previous game  repeat.
If you're expecting the easy question to be as  simple as the TV show you're going to be very unhappy. There are relatively  few ""throwaway"" answers (in comparison to the TV show) and some  of the ""easy"" questions are, in fact, extremely difficult.
There is a 30-second time limit on each question (unlike the TV show  which allowed virtually unlimited time).
The lifelines are similar  to the TV show. The operative word here is SIMILAR. 50/50 is exactly like  the boob-tube version; two wrong answers are eliminated. The ""audience  match"" is based on a survey of 50 people polled on the Internet .....  amazingly many of the percentages shown are ODD numbers, which is a  mathematical impossiblility. That can be forgiven I guess. But the  ""phone-a-friend"" lifeline is extremely poor. The  ""friend"" in each case is ""one of Regis's friends"" and  each is far from being a reliable knowledge source, except on the easiest  questions. On the harder ones you might do better using one of your own  friends or a Ouija board instead! (The fact that you hear a simulated phone  call is entertaining, I suppose, but this is a triumph of style rather than  substance.)
Another negative ..... you only get the ""Is this your  final answer?"" question from ""Regis"" on some of the later  questions. On most of the questions if you inadvertently select  ""B"" rather than ""C,"" for example, you are stuck with  that choice. This is a real downer.
Another problem ..... you are  supposed to press ""L"" to select a lifeline and then ""5""  ""P"" or ""A"" to indicate which lifeline you want.  Unfortunately it is all too easy to forget to press ""L"" and to  immediately press ""A"" (for ""Ask the audience"" .....  what happens then is the game assumes you are answering the question with  selection ""A"" ..... at which point there's a 75% chance you will  be eliminated from the game!
The game's shortcoming are all too  obvious and once the novelty of the music and the ""Virtual Regis""  wears off there's very little that's that's enjoyable.",2.0

"This game can be satisfying for a Trek fan, but for an average computer game enthusiast, this game can put you to sleep. There are several complaints that are explained in the previous review that I completely  agree with. I'm not saying that this game is horrible, but it is relatively  limited. For Trek fans, this game may be appealing, but it's not a game  that's going to draw you into a story line or something. it is more like a  game you can full around with on your spar time, you won't be cough up in  it for hours.",2.0
"Being an admitted Trekkie, I was excited to try Starship Creator to try my hand at creating the ultimate starship and blasting some pesky Klingons.  The problem is, there are a lot of obstacles in the way of accomplishing  this.  The game touts itself as a ""starship creator,"" with  several class types to mix and match from.  In actuality, you have a few  ship types and a few customizeable options for each.  It doesn't allow for  too much creativity.  And my dreams of teaming up James T. Kirk with  Jean-Luc Picard were dashed.  When selecting a crew for your ship, you can  only choose a crew from the ship's time period.  For example, only  characters from the original series can fly in the original Enterprise ship  class... Kirk cannot be selected to pilot the ship classes from Next  Generation or Voyager.  Thus, Kirk and Picard can not serve on the same  crew, or Data and Spock, or Sulu and Janeway.  This took a lot of the fun  out for me.  The missions you fly with the ship are simply brutal.  There's  precious little action and it takes a LONG time, even with the time  acceleration on.  So I'd say even if you're a Trek fan, I'd be careful of  this one.",2.0
"Starship Creator: Review by, Jay
I would say that this is a good game if you are intrested in the different classes and staffing ships. However, when I bought this, I was expecting to design my own ships, not choose a class, name it, staff it, and choose parts for it. The missions are  horrible. They are time consuming and you have no power once they are  started. The dialoge, which supposedly happens between different  crewmembers, is the same each time, boring, and they would not really say  those things. The graphics and sound are the best part of this game, as  well as the background information on the crewmembers. There is no  differece between the Intrpid class and Constitution class, except in  capacity in equipment and etc. Don't waste your money, the games on  startrek.com are cheaper, and better than this game right here.",2.0

"Mortal Kombat dominated arcades and home consoles worldwide, but did it dominate handhelds? No. No it did not. The Game Gear version was fairly good, but the Game Boy port suffered from really slow gameplay, dull music, and no sound effects. The graphics were okay, but it didn't help keep the Game Boy version from getting a fatality.

This is possibly the worst Mortal Kombat game.",2.0
This game was way too confusing for me. I think it would be recommended for people that can stand annoyance and stress. You can't even tell where your going and the signs that appear every 50 minutes don't help at all. I recommend you not to buy this. I think people should try to sell theirs and don't regret it.,2.0

As we all know the point of this game is to get the frog from point A to point B without getting killed by cars or water. The game has good graphics but there are some things I did not like.

Anyway only if you love frogger get this game.,2.0
"I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, and I had played Mario Land 2 in the past, which was excellent, but this game is bad. I'm sure it's not the worst Mario game out there, but it's the worst one I've played. It's not a horrible game, but it's just not as good as its predecessors or its successors. The biggest complaint I have are the controls and the physics. It doesn't even feel like a Mario game. The controls are klunky and often unresponsive, the physics are weird, like the Fire Flower's Fireball. It ricochets everywhere before eventually going out. The enemies are unlike anything I've ever seen in Mario. In one world, you have to Easter Island Heads with arms and legs, kinda like Nosepass from Pokemon. The Koopas explode when you jump on them. I don't mean they explode and die, i mean, when you jump on them, they go into their shell, and explode like a Bob-Omb, hurting you if you're too close. The graphics, I can't give TOO much flack to because it IS gameboy, but it doesn't look much better than the Mario Calculator games I played back in highschool. I'd say skip this one, go straight to Mario 2. It's much MUCH better.",2.0

This game excited me so much when I beat another level. Then there was the save part.  After so much work, this game wouldn't save for you. Very frustrating.  Finally, when I got to the final 12th level, the boss Tatanga or whatever was impossible to beat. The music on this game stunk too. The only thing I still like about it is the level/levels where you ride a rock over spikes. The 1st to 11th levels are fun for first tries.",2.0

In the Sega CD sequel the player has 4 brillant ways to end a match not just the one you get with the genesis game. The Sega CD version has overkills which is in this game ,but in addition has cinekills(a cinema scene where you brutally dispose of the opponent)Vendettas(where each character has a unique way to let out his/her revenge),and Sudden Deaths(another background finisher like overkills except they are harder to pull off and ends the round quicker)and tons of characters I believe 38-40 with not palette swaps like the ...

"If you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examined

I can honestly say I've yet to play a good Spider-Man game. For all the hype, good reviews and people willing to pay the big bucks over this one, I thought it was sure to be the best. How disappointed I was to discover it's one of the blandest and boring beat-em-ups ever.

You begin playing as Spidey (but can later change to Venom if you wish) and you go about tiresome duties beating up generic thugs on the streets of Manhattan. Every thug looks the same and you'll end up punching to death the same guy a billion times (more so for those infuriating end of level bosses). The crap music is the same on every level. Apparently the game has 'additional music' by some band called Green Jelly, who I have never heard of. I assume they must be some none-hit wonder grunge band from Seattle back when all that was new. And quite what exactly they contributed to the game is a mystery as there are only 2 tracks in total (level music and boss music).

There is some plot going on but I couldn't follow it. The comic-book cut -scenes look terrible and the writing is too small to read. Plus the are very slow and add too much time between the boring levels.

The controls and gameplay are dire. There's no fluent movement or grace in the fighting. It's all just an annoying mess and terribly programmed. If you can bear to stay with the game until level 2 you'll know what I mean. It was so rage-inducing I almost gritted my teeth into dust and chucked the controls into the TV.

Stay well away from this horrible game. As a beat-em-up it stinks. As a Spidey game it stinks. It just plain reeks overall.

"If you're a true Bubsy fan, you would know immediately that the title of my review is actually a quote from the very first thing Bubsy says in his first game.  How prophetic.

Now, let me say that I loathe hyperbole.  Bubsy 3D is not the worst game ever made, and believe me, I have played most of them.  Despite what the fifteen-year-old reviewers on Amazon would have you believe, Bubsy 3D actually won some acclaim when it was released, and retained what was, for the time, the 3D platforming status quo.  The problem with the status quo back then was that there wasn't one, and any given game might have any old control scheme, many of which didn't make any sense.  Bubsy 3D suffered from exactly that, among other things; namely, the overly simplistic environments and the sketchy depth perception.

And oh yeah, it suffered from one more thing: Super Mario 64 had completely blown the lid off of everyone's expectations.  Suddenly, simply average platformers made only months before suddenly looked like clunky, outdated dinosaurs.

And there was left poor old Bubsy.  The controls for the game are clunky at best, that much is certain, and it takes a while to learn his ropes.  His jumping mechanics are very different; the developers solved the depth-perception problem (partially, anyway) by having the camera switch to an overhead view whenever he jumps, giving the player overly precise control over where he lands, a la Jumping Flash.  Unfortunately, he takes so long to get a running start, he will probably slide right off of that platform you just landed on so precisely.  In fact, you will get to know the jumping controls extremely well, because you are going to fall off of that platform quite a bit.

One thing that still surprises me to this day, though, is the sharpness of the game's resolution.  No, there aren't hardly any textures to be found, as Bubsy's 3D world consists of purely colored geometric shapes, but I'll be darned if there isn't hardly a jaggy edge to them.  The characters and their expressions, as well as their animations, are actually really well defined, and the 2D sprites fail to pixelate.  Its just too bad that they all live in a world created by the God of Playskool.

Bubsy 3D is not one of the worst games ever made.  It is simply one of the most unfortunate, a rushed product shoved to the front lines to catch as much residual success off of its competitors as it could.  To understand that, you had to have been there in 1996, when platformers were anybody's game.  When Mario grew up he changed all that, and invited us along for his joyous adventure, from which we never looked back.

Poor Bubsy.",2.0
"This game is horrid! The graphics and the framerate are too choppy! The sound's okay (sound effect wise), but MKII was never known for it's music. The control is absolutely horrid; there aren't enough buttons on the Game Boy and special moves are nearly impossible to pull off (much less FATALITIES, as there's only one per character).

But the worst of it all happens to be the gameplay. Seriously, I beat this game in half an hour! And when did blood ever become an ink error?

The battle mechanics were odd, but I always enjoyed games that were challenging so you had to think out what you were going to do, sometimes you would lose a battle due to making a bad move, and you can learn from it and do better.

Unless your someone who likes to play old games, avoid this one, there are games which are all around upgrades.

"Quest 64 is a Role Playing game that stresses 3d eye-candy, with little depth of story, plot, and no long lasting appeal (all three are essential, along with others, for a good rpg).
The main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire game.
There are no side quests or red herrings to keep you intrigued, no easter eggs.
The battle system first of all is the most boring turn based combat system ive ever seen.  Oh and youll spend 80 percent of the game running around the countryside fighting monsters to build your levels (thats all the game's empahsis is on, building levels) and thatll bore you after about a couple of hours, off and on.  The game's story seems to get loss in the building of levels after the first few hours or so.
The amazing 3d graphics are the only thing really good about this game, as its the only thing that really keeps it from getting one star.  But still graphics don't make up for a game with such a linear monotonous flow.
I recently re-read some of the previous Nintendo Powers reviews of this game hyping it up as being as good as Final Fantasy series....that was a selling/promotional point more than anything else, since as the first editorial writer above said, ""Quest 64 sinks in too many areas: (to paraphrase him).

"After I saw the movie I was in a real ""X-Men"" mood so I went out and bought this game. When I started playing it I became very frustrated. It doesn't show you how to do any of the moves in the instruction book (not that I ever need an instruction book to learn moves). To do moves in this game it takes a lot of practice. So to find out how to do anything with a character you have to go into this boring and frustrating training mode. Once you master a character it is then easy to complete the game. But then, if you want to play another character, you have to go back into the training mode all over again. The endings in this game are very short and unsatisfying. The good thing is that after you have beaten the game with everybody you can view each ending linked up together and then it makes a lot more sense and you get more satisfaction. There's lot of things to unlock in this game but no codes. No secret characters. The worse part about this game is the gameplay.

"Nightmare Creatures appealed to me as a Victorian reenactor and a gamer. Unfortunately, its flaws are greater than its charms.
The game is closer to Tomb Raider than Resident Evil (the GameSpot review notes both of them); but it looks like the relatively choppy TR1 than later, smoother, installments. Control is hard to master. There are some moves that I never got to perform, though I practiced as much as was possible in the time alloted.
Time, in fact, is where this game shows its worst aspect. One of the pleasures of 3D games is exploring these lush and visually interesting worlds. And, indeed, you're encouraged to look around to find the powerups. Yet you also have to kill a constant number of critters lest your ""adrenaline"" run out! These two goals work against one another (and, as well, against your ability to practice complex moves). Because enemies don't repopulate, you have to watch your meter carefully to maximize the effect that your kills have and try to get in some exploration at the same time. Once all the enemies are gone (and there's no good way to know this), you have to run for the exit. Time-limit games are seldom a good idea; time-limit adventure games are even worse.
And it's ""Aleister Crowley,"" not ""Adam."" Maybe Adam was Al's father? Nothing to that effect in the manual! Having an offhanded historical reference helps many works, from Flashman to H.P. Lovecraft's work; but at least we could have had a little more historical accuracy.

"I could only get to the first boss. Don't get me wrong I had fun with this game, but many factors killed it for me.

 Most noticebly is the controls. The controls in this game are aweful! You have no idea how many cheep deaths the controls caused me. Its the main reason why I could never get pass the first boss. This is an extreme problem when you're facing more than one enemy because the controls won't respond when you need them to. The camera doesn't make things any easier. When platforming the jumping controls and camera will often cause cheep deaths because you can't see where your going or jump at an angle that causes you to fall off.

 Another issue I had is that when you get a game over you start all the way to the beginning of the game. Extra lives are also hard to find. This wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't so bad.

 The plus side though is that the music is wonderful and there are moments that are creepy AND SCARY. I would love it if they remade this for the Wii, Xbox, or PS3 with better controls and handling, but due to how long its been I don't see that happening.",2.0

It is too frustrating for me because these elements (switches, keys) necessary to keep the momentum in the game going seem to me to be arbitrarily located around the levels, whereas in Quake there is a ""rhyme and reason"" to their placement. One time as I was playing this they hid a switch behind some secret armor inside a wall, but I got the armour and missed seeing the switch because it blended in with the background color and pattern. when I finally went back and noticed it I was fuming.

Beaver Bother (you know what I'm talking about if you've played this game)

I had always heard how DK64 was such a classic, and so naturally I wanted to finally buy and beat it.

Instead of a classic, I found a game that was, well, kind of lazy. You essentially have 7 levels before the boss level, and you have to beat each of these levels with 5 different characters. So, you have to spend your time getting all of DK's bananas and missing the other 4 characters' bananas, because only Diddy can get Diddy bananas, only Tiny can get Tiny coins, etc. This means you have to basically go back and re-do the whole level with another character all over again.

Couple this with the fact that camera angles are constantly changing on you, it makes for a very ho-hum experience.

At one point during the 30 hours it took me to beat this game, I turned on the game and found all my data was erased. At first I was angry, but then kind of relieved that I didn't have to feel like I needed to finish this game anymore. That's saying a lot, because I always finish games I start. (I turned the game on-and-off again, and the data was there again, so I did finish playing it. But the point still stands: I WANTED my data to be erased.)",2.0
"When I think of the N64, I think about great games and memories. Games like Golden-Eye 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Banjo- Kazooie. Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother, grabbing my 120th power star, and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.

Donkey Kong 64 doesn't come up in any of these if you haven't noticed by now, and for good reason. It's slow, pokey, and not really all that fun. Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.

THE GRAPHICS: Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64, in that the characters are a little on the blocky side, but their really not all bad. I've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description: In one area, the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character's face on it. Sounds fine right? Wrong, the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas. A metal switch attached to a wooden chest. Sheer laziness. VERDICT:*** 3/5

THE STORY: Quite simple really, Donkey's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool, ruler of the Kremling reptiles. He's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game. The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies, along with some pretty whacked up levels. It's not really all that original, but it works.
THE VERDICT: *** 3/5

THE GAME-PLAY: This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills, and not in the good way. The game rips from the popular ""grab the golden item to proceed to more levels"" style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Now, that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years, but DK64 has you ""power-walking"" your way through each task, some of which are dragged on already.

 It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose (except the first level). The game is loaded with long hallways, ledges you need to slowly climb, and slow frame-rate issues at times. If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster, I probably wouldn't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother's room so he could sleep. Oh yeah, and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction. This game ruins hands, and sleepy little brothers. THE VERDICT: * 1/5

THE MUSIC: The game ranges from toy factories, jungles, pyramids and the like, so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across. Some of the music is pretty catchy, but I didn't find myself dazzled by any means. I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs, but that was it, none of which you'll be hearing very often. The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original. Thanks to this game every time I see an orange, I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game. Pretty funny right? VERDICT: *** 3/5

OVERALL: DK64 had a lot of hype, and it's a shame it didn't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County, Battletoads, and Jet Force Gemini series, which were excellent gems. I played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game, I really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then, because I can't seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level 4. While the music is descent, the graphics okay and the story shallowly good, none of those elements are what make you play a game. You play to have fun, to enjoy the universe of the characters, and to enhance you skills. I'd be able to accomplish all those things twice as much just eating a banana and watching my dad trim his nails than playing Donkey Kong 64.

 OOOOH BANANA.

#1.  Extremely long  fights:  Most of the weapons in this game are frustratingly innacurate and  don't do much damage.  As a result, fights go on and on and on and on and  on and . . well, you get the idea.  In X-Com and Shadow Watch, fire fights  tend to be relatively quick and decisive.  If a bad guy steps out in front  of you without cover, he goes down.  In this game though, he can stand  right in front of you at a range of three or four spaces and it will still  take a few turns to kill him.  You shoot and miss, and shoot and miss and  so on.  And then when you finally do hit the guy, it takes five or six  shots to take him down. Your mouse hand will get sore from all the point  and clicking. Both the accuracy and the lethality of all the weapons in the  game should be about doubled or trippled, which would lead to shorter, more  decisive engagements. 2.  Computer controlled characters have a huge  advantage in accuracy:  This is a weird glitch that becomes really obvious  from about the second fight onwards.  All computer controlled units are  roughly two to three times as accurate as your (supposedly elite) mercenary  units.  What does this mean? A couple of examples: a.)  One of your  mercenaries (with a high accuracy rating) is lying on the ground, firing at  an opponent lying on the ground, with no intervening cover.  The computer  controlled character will hit you about four times for every time you hit  him. b. You have a unit which has carfully positioned itself crouching  behind a tree for cover, shooting at a computer unit standing in the open.  You will hit each other with about the same frequency.
While over all  game balance is preserved by the fact that your mercs can just take so damn  much damage, it still makes game play awefully frustrating.  Here you are,  knocking yourself out to find good covered positions to protect your guys,  and the computer still hits them easily, while you're missing its guys that  are out in the open. The problem becomes even more annoying once you start  training local militia to protect your villages.  Being computer  controlled, the local militia also benefit from this huge increase in  accuracy, which means that they completely outclass the mercenaries who  trained them.  Which makes you wonder why they needed your mercenaries to  come liberate them in the first place.
Problems with the Strategic  Level:
Unbalance Economy:  Simply put, the amount of money running around  in the game doesn't balance out against the cost of most items.  Local  Militia, for example, can be trained for $750, a sum so small by comparison  to what your mines are turning out that it doesn't even enter into your  strategic thinking.  Similarly, the rewards for completing quests in the  game are ludicrously small wnen compared to your income.  What do you say  to a major NPC who is trying to get you to do some major quest by offering  you 20K dollars.  ""Hello, I make more than that in a single day of  mining.  Why should I bother?"".  The numbers on a lot of this stuff  need to be adjusted. 2.  A preponderence of innefectual hand guns:  For  some reason, most of the mercs that you can afford at the start of the game  come equipped with hand guns rahter than assault rifles.  Excuse me?  A  professional merc who's going to airdrop into the middle of a civil war  with only a pistol?  This is particularly ludicrous when you realize how  innefectual handguns are in this game.  Even at close range, an NPC is  likely to die of old age long before you ever manage to finish him off with  a .38 revolver. Adding to this problem is the fact that you can't buy  rifles.  Oh sure, the nice mail order company that you do business with  will send you ammo, but not big guns, grenades, night vision goggles, or  any of the really cool stuff that you want to play with.  To get that  stuff, you have to ever so slowly find it off the bodies of dead enemies.  In the course of 15 hours of play, I managed to find only two rifles.  Unfortunately, they were of a calliber that I couldn't buy ammo for.  Arrg.  Why can't you just buy decent armaments in this game?
Overall, I would  have to encourage people to buy all the X-Com games and Shadow Watch before  buying this one.  And even then, I would replay the former titles again  before sending buying this one.  Firefights in Jagged Alliance are  needlessly long and indecisive, there is little variation between combat  locations and opponents, and there is a lot of built in frustration in the  fact that your units are so vastly inferior to those controlled by the  computer.  This is a game with a lot of subtle problems that should have  been caught in the beta testing.",2.0
"...the actual game is okay but certainkly isn't on par with goldeneye. with the exception of the man dan carrington the characters are wooden and the story is very poor, you never feel into the game's story at all. the level design in general is bad, like the supposed 'stealth' mission in chicago where every enemy knows where you are anyway so there is no stealth involved whatsoever. some of the levels though are fun with inspired design like the sniping levcel in the snow but it doesnt make the game good.
what does make the game worth playing is the multi player modes, although the graphics take another turn for the worse they are acceptable in 2 player but with 4 you cant see anything at all without a massive tv. the multi modes make pd, beating the hell out of simulants in slow motion can be fun and sure beats the game. this is what you should be buying the game for, not for the story mode. the trouble with this is that the pd arenas are poor and its only the graphically altered goldeneye levels that are worth playing. a bit lazy on the developers part.
overall: except for the inclusion of mr. carrington the story mode is a bust so unless you have enough mates to make the multi worthwhile don't buy it.",2.0
"Nintendo has taken one of the greatest racing games for SNES and revamped it into a whole different futuristic racing game. For starters, there are 30 racers rather than 4, and this game is very fast! But to be so fast and have 30 racers, the game is very cheaply detailed. Lets just say the car your driving is very small and looks like a box with rocket boosters. Also with 30 cars 6 cars to start and 24 to earn, it gets a bit confusing as to who you should chose to race as, so there are detailed photos of each driver so that people can pick their favorite to drive as. The originality of the game is the fact that the track forms itself into any sort of shape. It goes into huge anti-gravity loops, half pipes where you can drive on the ceiling, and pipes where you can race on the outside of it... all around it... without falling off! There are three levels of difficulty, customizable colors, cars, speeds, acceleration and three circuits with seven or so unique tracks. Finally there is an original battle mode, where you must destroy other racers by knocking them off the track. This is a game you should rent before you buy.",2.0
"If you think a super hero game can never be too fast-pased, this could change your mind. Enemies come at you from every corner throughout the entire game, constantly trying to take you under. You'd swear you were in Detroit.
If you want a slower-paced game based on the animated series, try the SNES version. It doesn't let you play as Robin, but it has more depth and . . . wait a minute!! I'm not reviewing the SNES version!!!
As either Batman or Robin, you throw various weapons at your enemies as you keep scrolling to the right and trying not to get killed.",2.0
"this  game  is  ridiculous.  somehow,  it  is  hard  but  boring.  it's  impossible  to  have  fun  or  get  addicted  to  it,  like  you  can  in  other  great  games.  this  makes  it  extremely  boring.  in  the  beginning,  the  game  doesn't  state  where  you  are  even  supposed  to  go  to  get  to  ""the  action.""  when  you  do  get  to  ""the  action,""  it's  is  too  hard.  I  of  course  shouldn't  say  that  because  I've  never  been  too  good  at  the  game,  but  still,  this  is  my  opinion.  The  ""action""  (if  you  could  call  it  that)  is  flying  over  lava  pools  or  getting  to  a  certain  ledge-  none  of  the  classic,  very  fun,  jumping  on  enemies  and  timing  it  right  to  blast  yourself  out  of  a  barrel  onto  safe  land.  the  gameplay  is  horrible.  this  new  corrupted  version  of  the  great  classic  game  makes  it  extremely  boring.

"To say the least, Donkey Kong took everything this genre stood for, and made a muck-up of it. Endless item collecting, muddy details and slow action leave this one for the chimps, uh, chumps.
You have bananas, golden and coloured, coins, coconuts, ammo, musical notes etc. and for five characters. The collecting seems endless, and when i was forty % done the game, i just stopped. I looked at this forest level and i said, this looks just like the desert and water ones, only with a different backdrop.
And what's with the story? Some giant floating island or something? Why does K Rool have such a loathing for the Kongs? WHy doesn't he just butcher them instead of placing them in unguarded, easily escapable places???? Rare really messed up on this one. The sound isn't all that awesome (the DK rap, what the heck was that?), and the graphics were bleh; this thing required the 4mb expansion? Banjo Kazooie looked twice as good.
Even the characters are lame. I thought the release of Kiddy Kong in DKC3 was dumb, but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by 2 old ones. Tiny is the spitting image of Dixie, and Lanky is the babyish side of Kiddy while Chunky is, well the chunky side.
I think Rare thought their game was weak themselves, that must be why they added this mediocre 3rd person shooter multiplayer, isn't it? They didn't think they did a good job on the shooter part did they?
I have so many peeves about this game, it's nuts. What difference is tehre between the gun and the instrument??? They both unlock things. Why did Rare feel it necessary to have two things that can work switches??
Honestly, the only entertaining and redeeming part of this game are the Jetpac and Donkey Kong hidden arcade games.
Certainly a long game, but length is not always a good thing. Look at Conker's BFD, it was short, and still owned this game wicked bad. 15 hours of this, and you'll wish Rare had stopped there.",2.0
"I was extremely disappointed with this title.  You will like it if you like Goldeneye, but definitely go with Goldeneye over this game.  The multiplayer is 50 times better than Goldeneye, but the cheats and single player levels leave EVERYTHING to be desired.  For one thing, it requires more sneaking around because one missed shot hits the wall letting the guards know of your presence who will then hit you with perfect accuracy and kill you in a matter of seconds because of your quickly draining life meter.  You also run out of bullets faster and reload much slower.  The difficulty is just about near impossible.  If you can't beat Goldeneye with EVERYTHING as in cheats, bonus levels, record times, etc, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  You can't beat this game on Perfect Agent unless you're a game tester, and I'm sure even they had problems.  The game is so hard it just totally degrades from the fun factor.  The plot is also absurd.  Aliens and such.  Ha Ha.  Amusing.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  I strongly reccomend going for Goldeneye rather than Perfect Dark.",2.0

Another thing is that the game is so goddamn HARD(dont get me wrong, i like hard games)and with the bitchy controls, it makes it impossible to play.

"Here comes the (one-time) end of an era.  And sadly, it ends not with a bang, but with a whimper.  Like MM7 before it, Mega Man 8 suffered quite a bit of backlash, and this time around it was a result of the rather unbecoming 16-bit-ish graphical structures on the 32-bit wonders of the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation, and, if you ask me, it was not the title to follow the monstrous Mega Man X4 that came out around the same time.  Still, for all the weeping against statues, MM8 still serves up some classic Mega Man fun with that new-school Mega Man X feel.  The searching for hidden items becomes more important and challenging this time around, the action is still consistently hectic, and the level designs are pretty nicely done with some rich and vivid color work.  However, there's a very cheesy, sugar-coated appeal to this, even more so than MM7 (which, I think, was trying to emulate the American animated series); that and the bosses and weapons don't seem as good as they could have been, Rush's abilities aren't as important as they used to be, and the voice acting is atrocious for certain characters (Dr. Light, Bass, and some of the bosses are the prime sinners in this regard...and Rush Shiraishi did a better job voicing X in X4 than she did Mega Man in this.  It fits better, if you ask me).  Still, there's enjoyment to be had.  Just remember to take it at face value...and consider it a stepping stone to Mega Man 9.",2.0
"This could be considered the companion to Alien Trilogy as it takes place in the Fourth Movie following the first three presented in Alien Trilogy.  This game featured controls that people are more familiar with in these days, but didn't understand at the time.  The controls may be above average, and the graphics are excellent for the time, but seriously, the level design is a piece of crap!  What kind of space ship is this?  Very illogical design leads to BORING gameplay that is only fun for 5 minutes with invincibility turned on, otherwise you'll die in 2 minutes without it because you move soo slow.  An interesting thing is that if you get impregnated by a facehugger you won't be allowed to go through airlocks or elevators, which is interesting that they followed through on this principal with the chestbursters, and you'll have to find a device to take out the creature before the time runs out.  The thing that doesn't make sense with this is that even with a chestburster inside you, aliens will attack you, and that makes no sense.  Facehuggers can also attack you by hitting you with their tails.  Don't play this game, I'd rather watch the movie.",2.0

"Trying to go back to Yoshi's Story has been very difficult for me. When I was child I loved to play the game to death, It was one of my favorite 2D platformers and it might have been my favorite Nintendo 64 game as well. But in 2014 I must say 16 Years later Yoshi's Story has aged quite poory. I will say the graphics are some of the best looking for Nintendo 64, Some of the music is quite good and the multiple level idea was quite interesting. However the gameplay just feels so shallow when compared to other 2D platformers even on previous consoles like on the SNES. Literaly even though there are quite a few secrets to uncover and a few areas to explore this game is way too easy. Also even Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island a game that was on the SNES has about 50 levels with so much extra content. But this game only has mesaly 24 levels which is quite dissapointing on a console that's more advance. This game is also incredibly childish, Being cute or has somewhat childish is ok for me as I do I like some concepts of it. But having to hear the Yoshi's sing is well quite annoying as I feel like a 2 year listening. Overall Yoshi's Story is a Mario spin-off is a game I don't reccomend. There are way better 2D Platformers out there and better Nintendo 64 games to buy.",2.0
"When Yoshi's Story came out, I was stoked thinking it was a 64-bit sequel to Yoshi's Island. I was SO WRONG. This game is aimed at 5-10 year old gamers. You go around ""Chapters"" collecting fruit in the levels to advance, thus levels have no actual exit. There's 4 areas in each chapter. 6 chapters calls for 24 total levels in the game. To make this game even more disappointing, when you finish one level (say 1-1), you'd think you go to 1-2, but no. Instead you go to Chapter 2. What the heck?! It turns out you have to find red hearts hidden in each level to unlock a level in the next chapter. To unlock all of Chapter 1's level you have to complete one level, die, then go back. It's a stupid setup. I was really hoping for a Yoshi's Island 2 type game here but this is Nintendo cashing in on their child fanbase. Basically, if you're older than 10, this game will be too childish for your liking.",2.0

"This is a superb shooting game with lots of realism and strategy incoprorated. Graphics are great as is choice of team-mates and weaponary. I guess that it pretty realstic in a lot of ways as your team mates get in your way, and the terrorists are not as stupid as they are on some other games - they will shoot at you as soon as they see you. But there are times when you shoot at a terrorist and he doesn't die but shoots you instead. It seems to be a problem with the game. There are lots or really weird glitches too. You see dead terrorists levitating and half of them stuck through walls and their legs hanging down through the roof etc. I find it irritating that the designers take so much care to make tyres go down when you shoot them, and different sounds when you shoot a bed or a window, but then so little detail is given to other aspects such as the lights which don't go out if you shoot them. I have never seen lights like that. ""Goldeneye"" has lights that pop so why doesn't this? A lot of this game is just too difficult to win at. In addition, you get a mission such as the one at the datcha where you must avoid detection -  this is really difficult. The idea is to plant a bug and a camera and leave as though you've never even been there. You can go round and shoot al the windows out and still complete the level...and no one will notice that there are windows missing, glass everywhere and bullet holes in the walls? My point is, if you are going to go for realism then go all the way, or not at all. My low rating for this game is due to the problems I have had playing it on the PC. I think it's a game with really great potential, but you end up waiting all the time while the computer makes grinding sounds which freeze your action, but while you are frozen it really impedes playability and you end up getting shot because you can't react. Unplayable due to this, and I have a powerful computer, so that's not the problem. This is overambitious for the PC market, and there are things that need rethinking to make it a better game.",2.0
"I remember playing this game a few times with my friend. And then I asked him why did he get it....over and over. Batman Forever is based on the so so movie of the same name and as licensed games go, developers rush it out the door as soon as possible to make money. So that's one of the many reasons why this game wasn't so great.

As some of the other reviewers have stated, this game used digitized graphics and controls made popular by Mortal Kombat at the time. So, it looks great for a SNES game and uses the Batman license. Unfortunately, everything else about the game sucked. Batman and Robin both move around like either tanks or robots. Basic things like walking and jumping are a chore to do. They each have special moves, which are set up like moves you perform in fighting games, except they rarely work. The enemies were super hard to beat and it seems every couple of minutes you see a loading screen (you should NEVER wait for a game to load if it's on a cartridge!) Add in the lack of save features or continues and you got a hard game that wasn't meant to be played or beaten.

Stay away from this crap even if you are tempted to buy it. It isn't worth it and it turned out to be WORSE than the bad movie it was based on.",2.0
"The digitized actors give the game an interesting visual style, and the levels/backgrounds bear a decent resemblance to certain sections of the movie. As someone who's played a lot of Mortal Kombat I thought the controls were decent, but I can understand how frustrating gadget usage must be if you aren't used to inputting 'special move' commands all the time.

Really, the game just gets boring and repetitive after awhile. There's not a lot to do except beat up thugs, and the 'loading' that takes place between each room kills the momentum and gameplay flow. A lack of continues or save feature keeps you from wanting to jump back in when you die. And beyond the graphics in the levels, presentation is downright bad with bland elevator music and a weird batcomputer display that tries to move the narrative along. Plus what kind of game do you have when the manual doesn't even list how to jump down between floors in a room??

2-player co-op does make the game a bit better, until you either get stuck or get bored. Overall, another dud Batman licensed game.",2.0
"Batman Forever is a perplexing experience all on its own.  The original film, released in 1995 is one of the more divisive films in the entire franchise (it's neither universally loved nor universally hated).  Being a bit more kid friendly, light hearted and trying to be fun.  It's surprising then, that the video game doesn't even try to be fun or entertaining.  Batman Forever is a boring and monotonous game that came out in a time when creating video games based off movies were not always good... but they weren't exactly bad.  As a film Batman Forever is probably an okay outing.  As a video game it's a great cure for insomnia and a good lesson on how not to create a game.

I should note that Batman Forever was available on several different platforms.  The Super Nintendo version might've been slightly better than the Sega Genesis one, but merely because of the controls not necessarily because one console was better than the other.  Let's start with the basics though.  The game is based off the movie and divided into eight levels.  Before each level you get to choose two gadgets to take into each stage.  Batman has a good arsenal of tools.  You have the Bat Bola which can render enemies temporarily immobile, smoke grenades or even a device that makes you invincible so long as you're using it correctly.  Players don't just have to play as Batman either.  One can also play as Robin.  While Batman uses exclusively his fisticuffs, Robin actually has a staff he can use as well.  The two also sometimes get different gadgets they can choose from.  While Batman as pellets and grenades, for instance, Robin has a blinding light, tranquilizer darts and wrist rivets to stop enemies in their tracks.  There are also default gadgets the two have on them all the time such as the Batarang.

It may seem like Batman and Robin would play radically different, but they actually don't.  Each one of them has a set of universal tools.  Not just the batarang, but also a grappling hook to reach other layers of stages, tiny bombs to find hidden passages in the floors (and to deal damage to enemies etc.) and the same basic attacks.  Despite Robin having a staff it doesn't operate any different than Batman's fist.  The game won't be significantly easier if you use one character over another.  You might think their gadgets where they differ make a huge difference but the gadgets the game is made to favor are shared by both of them.  It might seem great to try to decide whether you should use Batman's slippery goo or Robin's Sticky goo but both tools are so horrible you'd never actually use them to begin with.  Both have the preferred Bat Bola and respective gadgets that will make them invincible when the gadget is active.  You won't find any significant difference in the characters.

Each level has lots of things to find.  There are items to pick up, enemies to vanquish and secret passages to find.  Some levels also have hidden blue prints and if you find them all you'll unlock hidden gadgets the two can use.  As with many of the gadgets, though, they're not really anything special.

The game has you traverse each of these stages, room-by-room, beating up the enemies, uncovering secrets and finding a goal.  The goal of each level isn't always specified.  While there is a small briefing before hand, most levels end once you finally get to the end and have dispatched all enemies.  Some stages have actual bosses to defeat such as Two-Face or The Riddler, but they're usually just glorified henchmen.  Most rooms just have you fight through thugs, each with a life gauge of their own.  Once it's depleted they're dead.  It's a typical beat-em up but without the usual elements that create a good beat' em up.  This isn't like Final Fight or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  The levels aren't short and snappy, there is nothing pressing you forward and you're on a single plain in a side scroller.  At first this is perfectly fine, but then the game begins to get really boring really fast.  Once you've played the first ten minutes or so of Batman Forever, you pretty much know everything you need to know about the game.  You walk into a room, beat up some bad guys and walk to the next room.  There aren't a lot of variations to it or specific goals you need find.  It's just you as Batman or Robin walking through a room and beating up people.  There are occasionally platforming moments, but they're frustrating thanks to the strange jumping mechanic that's made for combat and not platforming.

All of this brings together a game that's surprisingly boring to play.  The levels are lengthy but they aren't engaging.  Were it actually a traditional side scrolling beat 'em up it might've actually been okay, but instead it's a game where you go room by room.  But doing this isn't even all that great in and of itself as each time you enter a room you have to wait for the game to load each area.  For large stages with several rooms such as the first level of the game where enemies can knock you back into a previous room... this is going to get annoying.  The game even flashes the words ""Hold on,"" each time you go to another area.  The music also isn't adding anything to this either.  It's kind of boring and repetitive... but it also doesn't really pump you up or make you feel like Batman.  Take, for example, how the SNES version of ""The Adventures of Batman and Robin.""  Everything about that game reminds you of the animated television show it's based on.  Here you've got nothing that reminds you you're playing a Batman game.

The game also doesn't play well.  There are far too many things to do and not enough buttons, even on the Super Nintendo, to compensate.  Your grappling hook, for instance is mapped to the ""Select"" button and if you want to shoot it straight up you need to press ""Select+Up.""  The end result is that if you don't press them both exactly at the right time you end up just shooting your grappling hook to swing normally (a moment that is only actually needed ONCE in the entire game).  This sounds pretty bad as it is, but it's a nightmare when using gadgets.  The game itself makes you use gadgets the way you use moves in Street Fighter II.  This works for Street Fighter because it's a fighting game.  Here's it's awful.  When beset upon by several enemies at once it can be annoying to enter the specific commands for your gadget.  It also doesn't help that sometimes the controls aren't responsive to the inputs.

It doesn't matter anyway, you don't need you gadgets to take down enemies anyway.  The only time it's useful to have even one (the Bat-Bola) is when taking on Two-Face who is surprisingly the only enemy that's difficult to defeat otherwise.  Aside from that, the game isn't challenging at all, it's just repetitive.  From stage 2 and further along you'll mostly run into the same enemies over and over all capable of doing very similar things.  Sure you'll come across a Riddler Thug eventually or you'll fight clowns in the circus stage but none of these enemies have much of anything that separates them from the enemies you're already facing.  There's nothing unique, nothing that's visually striking.  Two Face is likely the only enemy that seems to actually be different from the onsalught of other thugs you'll face.  Even the Riddler (who is the game's final boss, by the way) fights almost exactly like the basic enemies you'll face getting to him.

Are there good points to Batman Forever?  Sure, but even they come with an asterisk.  For instance, the game has some decent animations and is actually quite visually appealing.  But the levels themselves are repetitive, utilizing the same backgrounds and designs constantly.  The game looks good I just wish there were more of it to look at.  The level design also isn't enough to actually distract you from the same constant backgrounds appearing constantly.  It also takes just a little too long to explore every nook and cranny of the game.  Each level grades you on whether you could find all the secrets in a stage or defeated all the enemies and the like.  Completing these tasks rewards you with extra lives but the game is so simple you won't need them... and these tasks needlessly pad out the game to a length it simply doesn't need to be.  There are no greater rewards for doing so.  All it does is prolong what will already feel like a long experience.

The game also doesn't have a bad soundtrack either.  It's surprisingly good.  The opening title theme and the music that plays in the stages is actually good.  It just sounds slightly (not always but slightly) out of place for a Batman game.  But for the most part it's good.  I even found myself humming some tunes.

Batman Forever is a game that's close to being good.  But the repetitive nature of its combat and the fact that you've seen and experienced everything there is experience with the first level alone makes it less fun to play than other games.  It's a pretty boring game that, for those who have time, can use it to kill two hours, but it's going to feel like it's far longer than two hours to complete.  Visuals and music aside, there's nothing that special about Batman Forever that's going to keep you coming back to it time and time again.",2.0
"Diddy Kong Racing, simply put, is a game I have tried to love, and simply cannot do it.  I have even tried to play it, but I cannot simply stand playing this insipid game.  I do now know why, but this simply is not a good game.  Perhaps it is particular tastes.  But I simply cannot stand this game.  The tracts are fairly imaginative.  One grating thing about it is say you hit a tree.  Well, instead of bouncing off like on many other racing games, you stay bashing into the tree.  It does have some interesting features, however.  The sheer volume of tracts (had it been any other game would have been a plus) shows ingenuity, the story line is interesting, but in execution the game just flails horribly.
Why do I give it 2 stars?  The concept.  I love the concept.  Making an adventure out of a racing game, and the format they gave it is an excellent idea.  The sheer number of tracks is exhilarating.  And on some courses there are THREE (plane, hovercraft, kart) types of vehicles to use.  It is just a tragedy that in practice it doesn't come off at all.  It is nowhere near Super Mario Kart 64.  That game is fast-paced and loads of fun, the best racer to hit the N64.  Size wise, this dwarves Mario Kart 64.  If they could have had the execution on Mario Kart 64 and the concept of Diddy Kong Racing, we would have had one hell of a game.  Sadly, such a game does not exist (yet).  We have to settle with a badly executed game (Diddy Kong Racing) with another racing game that is superb in all manner of ways.  But, with a little engineering, we could have the best of both worlds.  Super Mario Kart 64 is the way to go, folks.  The multiplayer battle is really fun too, especially Block Fort.  Superiour in concept, inferiour in execution.  That's the bottom line.",2.0
"I reviewed this game a while back on the Genesis, and yeah its not one of the better Batman games that's 4 sure! With a few minor differences in sound and landscape design of the levels this game is almost identical to the Genesis version, and that being said your in for a lot of headaches.

The set up of this game is very unique. The gameplay mechanics resemble something from Mortal Kombat or other fighting games, but its actually a walkthrough/beat-em up style action game though. You can choose as Batman or Robin, and of course with the option of having a 2 player mode as well. Like the Genesis version they use real live digitized footage of actors for the sprites in the game so it looks pretty good overall. That is also where a lot of the pros end on this game, the rest are cons!

First off its extremely hard not just because of the constant barrage of enemies you face but the controls I think may have been designed by a programmer with a really bad sense of humor! The characters do not respond and sometimes feel glitchy and too perform the easiest of moves it takes a very odd button combination. So fighting the constant flow of enemies is super annoying and frustrating! And also the SNES is known for having great soundtracks and sound quality in its games, not here, there are literally 2 tracks through out the game! 0_o

The Adventures of Batman and Robin on The Sega Genesis is a great Batman game, and its port on the SNES isn't too shabby either, check out one of them but avoid this one!",2.0

"Though visually stunning, Rogue Spear ha the worste game AI I have ever stumbled across.  The ""incredible"" AI was one of the games selling points.  mission success depends on how much you are able to keep  your team-mates from doing anything.  I love when they throw grenades in  rooms with hostages.  The enemies are no better.

"Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire was released near the end of 1996 and was one of the first generation games for the N64. It's a decent Star Wars game overall with nagging issues that keep it from being one of the better games for the system.

Set after the events in the movie Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back but before the events in the movie Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (and also based on the book of the same name), you set out to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from the hands of Prince Xizor. Choose from 3 difficulty levels and battle through 9 levels set in planets that are part of the Star Wars universe; battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform game.

The PROS: Well, the overall presentation is good enough to make you feel you're in the Star Wars universe as the sound effects and music are what you expect to hear in Star Wars games. Even though the game has 9 levels, they are long levels so you won't be cruising through so easily.

The CONS: Unfortunately, this is not one of the better SW games available for the N64 for several reasons. This game was part of the first generation of games for the N64 and it shows. The graphics did not age so well and back in 1996 , they were horrible. Super Mario 64 was a launch title and it had way better graphics. Here, the game gets choppy when there's a lot of action, the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of ""pop up"" scenery and dense fog (to cover up areas that don't have any animation.) The controls are no better than the ones in the PS title ""Tomb Raider"". Your character controls like a robot, aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection. Add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button doesn't respond until a full second AFTER you press it. On top of all that, the game's difficulty is pretty unforgiving. Even if you set in on ""easy"", the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting at.

Considering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether, you're pretty much hyped and can't wait to see the rest of the game. Unfortunately, when you do, you realize that the game falls flat on its face. Star Wars: SotE had a lot of potential. It's a Star Wars game and gives you the feeling that you're part of the awesome story it conveys. But that feeling goes away fast as the crappy graphics, robot like controls, bad platform elements and near impossible difficulty that this game presents keeps it from being the kind of game it could have been. Only the die hard Star Wars fans would pick this up. For everyone else, be warned as other Star Wars games released for the N64 are much, much better than this somewhat playable effort.",2.0
"The SNES version is kinda sad compared to the Genesis version. It gets very monotonous after a while and the levels are all really the same. It did bring back fun memories though, either way.",2.0
"For the past few months I'd been picking up old N64 games that I didn't get a chance to purchase during their initial release, and when I saw Shadows of the Empire I immediately grabbed it, being the big Star Wars fan that I am.
Shadows was one of the launch games for the N64, and while it might have been a decent game in its day, maybe even a good game (I can't, however, believe it was ever considered a great game), it hasn't aged well at all. To compare, I also recently grabbed Super Mario 64, the original launch game, and still found plenty of charm left in that old cartridge.
The graphics are a mixed bag. Our hero, Dash, is rendered rather nicely, with more polygons than one might expect. The levels, however, have ugly textures that will remind the player of early pseudo 3-D games like DOOM and Dark Forces. Hardly the graphical quality the N64 is capable of. Enemies such as the Stormtroopers and mercenaries are fuzzy with blurred details. However, the graphics on the flying missions and the speeder bike level are exceptional. With regards to sound, John Williams score has never failed before, and fortunately, the music combined with classic Star Wars sound effects is just what Star Wars fans want.
Where the game really fails is the gameplay. Shadows tries to include many different modes of play, and not all of them work. The snow speeder level is a classic, as it inspired the game Rogue Squadron; the speeder bike chase is rather cool, as is the fight with Boba Fett. However, in other areas of the game, your craft is stationary and all you are required to do is shoot. It's not much different from the Super Nintendo Star Wars games, and the simplistic gameplay can only entertain for so long. Then there is the first-person levels, which unfortunately make up the bulk of the game. Though the game has multiple view modes, Dash is easiest to control in the first-person mode, but the player won't even see the tip of Dash's gun, as is customary with all shooters. There is no target reticle, making aiming irratic. The levels are too big and empty, and are too straightforward. It's a simple matter to walk from point A to point B, with few surprises. You'll find yourself rushing through most of the game to get to the better levels, but unfortunately they're few and far in between.
If you're a Star Wars fan, there's still enough here to warrant a purchase, but mostly it'll be for a piece of N64 Star Wars history. While I might have had different feelings about this game had I bought it at launch, I can't imagine feelings much more impressed by it. Shadows of the Empire is the most disappointing of all the N64 Star Wars games.",2.0

"Spider-Man has been in a lot of games in his career, from his first adventure on the Atari to the recent game for the Playstation.

The gameplay is just too bland and repetitive for it to be fun. While it does have plenty of his best villians, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Graphics are good, sound is okay, but there are better games out there. Sadly, the Playstation Spider-Man game has been the only game to truly capture what Spidey's all about.

But after the famous title sequence ended and the game started, I was left in frustration. Level one put me against thousands of dinosaurs, scorpions, and worms. After 30 unsuccessful minutes, I used the flawed Game Genie ram editor to give myself invincibility, and level 1 became a snap. Level two started. I was put in mode 7 with a land speeder, not good considering the age of the game. The clunky land speeder vehicle could hardly aim at the Jawas, and once I shot all 10 of them I zoomed towards the sand crawler. Level 3 begins. It was an awful platformer with enemies that knock you back to the ground. Luke can't even jump high enough to reach half the platforms.

"When Mortal Kombat 1 was released on the arcades nearly a decade ago, it immediately became a HUGE hit. It was so realistic, and the hand-to-hand combat style was so extreme. The game also centered around controversy due to the incredibly unique violent content. Fans anxiously awaited for the game's arrival on home video game consoles. When it was released to the Super Nintendo, fans wasted no time purchasing it. However, the happy fans were quickly disappointed when they discovered Mortal Kombat to be edited. Thanks to Acclaim and Nintendo, this game has NO blood & guts! The fatalities are edited and toned down. The blood has been changed to sweat. MK fans were ripped off and very angry about the censorship in the game. At least the Sega Genesis version of MK had a blood code. The Super Nintendo version plays a lot like the arcade hit. The graphics, sound, music, and animation play equivelant to the arcade. But without the bloody violence and original fatalities, it's just not the same. This is still an okay fighting game though, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. Too bad it's so old. I could do without it. MK II and MK III are a heck of a lot better. Don't waste your money on this. Rent it if you can.",2.0
"Mortal Kombat was really weak on the SNES because it was so censored. No blood, some people had different fatalities (ex: Johnny Cage's foot in your stomach). Blood was traded for sweat (?!?!) and because of those 2 reasons, the game was truly brought down a notch.
Yes it's still a classic but it's not worth it on SNES. You're better off getting it on the SEGA system because that way you could overcome the censorship and at least put in a ""blood code"".
Personally, I'd skip this one anyday and go straight to MK II because that was just all out better than MK and it was a lot more enjoyable, had better replay and a lot more characters. Trust me, skip MK on SNES and go straight for MK II on SNES.",2.0

Gameplay is quite repetitive, I know a lot of games can be repetitive but its a repition that bores me. Your constantly locating stuff, that got boring. But I will say, if I was bored or just killing time before I go out it would be good for a few rounds to play. The story line is pretty impressive, so I guess the game deserves props in that area. The game is good in its own little ways, but I just don't rank it up there with some of the other classics. I have some friends that love this game, so I guess I respect it for what it is.",2.0
"This game plays ok, but Nintendo caved to media pressure and edited most of the best content out of the game.  This game feels neutered.  It is like buying a music album you really like from a great artist only to find out you bought the radio edit version instead of the explicit version.  Granted a lot of games that were ported from an arcade console to the SNES system had to be altered to fit the parameters of the system, but this game could have left in the gore and everything else.  This is one of those rare times where Sega got it right and Nintendo goofed it up.  One of my favorite parts of the game was playing against other people and ripping off their heads at the end of a battle.  None of that in this version.  I feel like it should have a Care Bears sticker on it or something to let  buyers know this is the G rated version.

There is still some slow lag issues in the game and some bugs here and there.  The play control has some issues it does not seem fluid.  I would stick to only playing this game in the arcade for the true overall experience, that way you can see why everyone enjoyed it so much.  The endurance rounds provide a nice challenge that would be the only thing this game does better than MK2.  Other than that the sequel was superior in every way.  Seeing the classic characters is nostalgic and brings back a lot of memories.",2.0

"This was my first introduction to the Mortal Kombat series and thankfully Nintendo owners would get much better versions of the follow on games on SNES and N64. Graphics and sound were pretty good on this version, but the gameplay is terrible. Plenty of reviewers have covered how stiff and unresponsive the controls are, but I want to hit some of the more unbelievable glitches and errors that were allowed to pass QC (if it was even done on this game):

Projectile Glitches: for some reason in this version, if each combatant throws a projectile simultaneously, only the first one lands. The other one mysteriously disappears. Although that sometimes gives you a fighting chance against the computer AI, I really can't see how this made it past the testers.

Scale Glitch: the whole scale of the game is off - the size of the combatants versus screen size renders the jump kick nearly useless because you will jump over your opponent if they move practically one step towards you. This is especially apparent in a one player game. It just reeks of a rushed conversion.

Raiden Glitches: Where to begin...they just butchered my favorite character. His projectile generates from behind him...nowhere near being lined up with his hands, and then it is just  a big blob instead of rotating like other versions. There are multiple issues with the ""superman"" move. First, he will often come up short trying to land it so instead of hitting or bouncing off, he simply ends up standing in front of an opponent vulnerable to attack. When he does hit, he pushes the opponent for about a half second. This is more of an aesthetic problem as it does the right damage, but it just looks terrible. Raiden's superman attack also does not fly under the appropriate projectiles like it did in the arcade significantly altering gameplay. As a final insult to the character, Raiden's victory lightning summon is not synced with the sound except if you beat an opponent with a lightning throw. Small, but again shows how poorly this conversion was done.

Thankfully Sculptured Software regrouped and did a good port of MK2 for the SNES, but it is unfortunate that SNES owners missed out on a good experience with MK. I really didn't care that the blood was removed. Some of the fatalities I thought were pretty good and seemed to inspire later fatalities in MK2 and beyond (Raiden and Sub Zero for example). The gameplay is what really matters and this is where MK fell short...very short.",2.0

"I never got into the hype of Mortal Kombat when it came out in arcades; it was good on arcade while the game lasted and then shipped to SEGA and SNES. Playing it on SNES was pretty boring for me for three reasons. One was the lack of blood. It was probably the most interesting feature of the arcade game. Two was the controller problem. I could never get a lot of moves done the way I asked for. Three was the sheer boredom of it. The game is very one dimensional for me. There is not much to do except memorize the combo moves for each player and then the fatality move. After them, there is nothing else anymore. The tournament is interesting, but once the ladder is climbed to the top, that's it. There isn't much to be said. All in all, Mortal Kombat doesn't cut it for me.",2.0
"Because you need something like that to make this game interesting and enjoyable; because its that bad!!!!!!!!!!

Seriously this game sucks, the graphics were great for the 16-BIT, the sound isn't all that bad, and that's were it stops. The gameplay is full of glitches and other issues. There is no blood, though you'll see a lot of sweat, maybe some tears, but no blood. You can't leave that out of the deal, also the game was just censored to death. The combination of the bad gameplay, and lack of originality that should have come from the arcades killed this version! I remember you could trip someone half way across the screen!? ;( Its just a dumb game.

If you wanna make it good like I said in the begining get some beer and other things, possibly get drunk, and then maybe you might find it entertaining. Other than that avoid this one, but check out the sequel.",2.0
"I missed the original Mortal Kombat in arcades, and was introduced to the series through word-of-mouth about how violent the title was. Really if this was the only version I'd played, I would've never gussed what all the hype was about.

Graphics and audio are pretty good, far surpassing what the Genesis version was offering and staying pretty true to the arcade version. Gameplay however, is a failure. Nevermind that the fatalities have been changed and the blood turned to sweat - the actual fighting is stiff and unresponsive, and it feels like the fighters have their feet glued to the floor. The only move that works well here is Scorpion's spear, and it's so smooth in its execution that it becomes the best way of landing cheap hits.

Look at MK objectively: bad controls, less characters than Street Fighter, less moves, a limited number of environments with no background animation (though the Pit idea was rather cool). The first installment was truly one that sold based on the strength of its gore, and on the SNES we're deprived of that as well.

MK fans might or might not want this version for completion purposes (since it looks graphically like the arcade but removes all the violent content). Everyone else should jump to MKII, which really got the series started.",2.0
"Initially ""Saga Frontier"" is quite interesting, but unfortunately it quickly bogs down from there.  The game offers seven different characters in seven different stories (some of which are actually quite interesting); this is a very neat idea, but the action gets repetitive after exploring the same area in different stories.  The fight action is interesting at first, but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time.  One thing I did like was the backgrounds; some of them were just beautifully rendered.  Unfortunately the character/monster graphics just did not fit in with the background; they were two different styles that just did not mesh well with each other.  If the game had offered a better combat engine and more unique areas for each character, ""Saga Frontier"" would have been a pretty good game.",2.0

Is there any way to see before i buy another copy if the setting buttons work? I literally cant play it if i cant change the jump button..thank you",2.0
"This is one of the most overrated games of the Mario series. First of all, it's extremely difficult and frustrating. There's always been a problem with Mario games concerning the controls, they're slippery and not responsive enough for the difficulty of the game. Also the fact that the only attack Mario can do is jump on his enemies, at least in this game which isn't enough arsenal for the amount of enemies that are set against you at one time (armies of them). I know people who have been stuck on the same level for years and it makes me wonder why people bother with this game.

Another dire problem is the process of saving your game. The game only lets you save at designated points instead of saving at the completion of each level which again makes this game seem frustrating when you complete a substantial amount of the game and suddenly die and get sent back five to eight levels for losing all your lives.

I would've given the game 2 stars for the graphics alone which look somewhat advanced for 1991 but there are so many games from the 16 bit era that surpassed it that I'm going to ignore the graphics in this review because they simply don't make up for its lack of detail and intuitiveness in everything else. In comparison to Donkey Kong Country and Sonic The Hedgehog 3 this game is dwarfed for its graphics. Another reason to overlook the graphics is the blending of levels in which the same type of level looks nearly identical to every level of its kind.

And let's not forget the overrated soundtrack. The music is dull, repetitive, and juvenile and not in good way. It's not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is  ridiculous because they didn't even do this on the NES.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm a casual Nintendo fan who immensely enjoyed other games on the Super Nintendo and Nintendo games on newer consoles, Super Mario World isn't one of them because it's frustrating and it sucks.",2.0
"This game could have been one of the best on SNES, but Interplay screwed it up. Well, lets start with the good. The graphics are REALLY good. Very detailed trees, characters, enemies, etc. The in-game animations are very fluid, almost life-like. Interplay does an excellent job of setting the atmosphere. A light fog covers the Barrow Downs, giving it a very eerie appearance. The music can be chilling at times. Interplay also did a wonderful job of scaling Middle Earth. The world is HUGE. This is one game where you will definitely need a walkthrough, or risk being left behind, as I later was. Now for the downsides to this game. In this game, you control one central character, while the others follow you around (Like Secret of Mana). However, these other characters will sometimes wander off-screen, usually ending up getting themselves killed. I might add that this is a game where one traveler won't survive. You NEED those other party members, especially when you get in a fight with 2 or more orcs. My next complaint is the graphics. Great, like I said before, but pretty soon all screens start to look alike. ESPECIALLY the caves. Speaking of caves, some of the mazes in this game can be really frustrating--even with paper and pencil handy for drawing maps. There are not that many enemies in this game: wolves, bats, snakes, orcs, barrow wights, and dark riders, but that's all I remember after many hours of playing this game. The towns are boring and uninteresting--you can't walk into any building, only see it from the outside. Finally, there are some mandatory quests that you must undertake that were NOT in the books. Your very first one will be to find someone's glasses in a large cave. Overall, this game will seem exciting and interesting at first, but after you play it for a while you'll probably start to see what I mean.",2.0

There are only two quests you can do without a player Dungeon Master.. and those get old very very fast.

You may have to repeat a mission two or three times, but no more than this, and you'll have finished all levels within a week (or a few days if you spend much time on the computer playing games).  There is very little to think about when playing this game except whether you can gun down your enemies, which will disappoint those interested in exercising their wits as well as their trigger finger.  With the Quake engine and the possible storylines, this game could have been something.  Once again, Star Trek fans will have to wait for decent action game worthy of the name Star Trek.",2.0
"How many times do we have to tell game designers that game saves are an integral part of any game. Game designers, this is a PC game you're designing and not a console game.  Let's start with the bad points as Im  sure all the readers would like to read first. The game committed the most  sinful act of not providing a save game feature accessible anytime and  anywhere in the game. You could only save the game when it loads a new  scene or level. I was in a dungeon for 2 hours (real-time), dying, and I  couldn't save the game because you have to walk out of the dungeon to make  the game reload the level and save your points. This is crazy! This is an  RPG we're playing here. I mean, Final Fantasy III (console game) had built  in save points in the dungeons. Why cant a PC game like this have one? This  is a real turn-off. Next is the interface. I still have to figure out how  to properly move the character. It's so hard to control the camera as you  move the character in the game. The view pans out then suddenly pans in.  The game tried to make its interface unique and it ended up making the game  more complex. Graphics are good. Nice colors, voice acting was ok. You need  a good sized system though to run this game like a PIII 600 and 32mb video  card. Story: well, this game completely ignored the pen and paper version  with too many battles in it. I beat the game in 30 hours. So there really  isn't much there to expect. Will you buy this game? I say, don't buy it until  they patch the game with a save feature. If you're after a RPG, then look  somewhere else.",2.0
"As a fan of the paper and pencil V:TM game, I was delighted when I saw the ads for this program. Upon playing this game, however, my delight turned quickly to disillusionment and then to the desire to put a stake through  the game CD and bury it somewhere.  My main complaint is that the game  seems to have been released before it was truly finished.  The most  annoying example of this is the lack of an in game save feature.  You can  only save at your ""haven"" or use the autosave which saves each  time you change levels.  This results in having to either (a)re-fight  numerous battles if you happen to get killed or (b) run back to the start  of the level after you make some progress so the autosave function is  triggered.  Frustrating and repetetive to say the least.  Also, trying to  control up to four Vampires and their myriad powers in real time combat  without a pause feature is frustrating, especially given the poor AI for  non-player vampires(eg. casting auspex when 1 rat shows up).  I have heard  that the programmers are working on a patch that will address these  problems but it's really something that should have been worked out before  the game's release - another case of rushing the release a flawed product  and trying to fix it later.  I gave the game 2 stars instead of 1 because  it is beautiful to look at and the plot is somewhat faithful to the  original RPG even though dialog is limited and has little effect on the  outcome of the game.  Bottom line: unless you like retracing your steps  numerous times, refighting confusing battles and poorly programmed ally  AI's, I would wait until they fix the game or spend my money elsewhere.",2.0
"I ask you, why?  Why did they have to screw this game up?  Why did they rush to get it out?  Why didn't they spend that extra time to make it perfect?  Here are my problems. -Save game feature-you've heard it many times more.  Here's one more time. -Combat-annoying and too much.  Basically the thing that bothered me most was the excessive  combat.  If you've ever read any of the Vampire: The Masquerade pen and  paper supplements you see how the plainly state that vampire is not all  about combat.  Vampire is about monsters.  Damned creatures.  Combat is  there, but each enemy has a reason and purpose.  Not some blundering  vampire out to kill.  If you want an all out combat romp, buy Diablo.  There's only one thing that I think may save the game.  The storyteller  mode.  I find it confusing at times but the possibilities with it are  great.  With the right storyteller you can have a game with plot and  meaning and not all combat.  The bottom line is this title had so much  potential, but lost a lot of it.  I wish I could give it five stars but  it's not so.  I want other companies to learn from this mistakes.  I would  have gladely loved this game if they sacrificed graphics for gameplay and  story.  Make the game using the bioware engine so it's like a Vampire  Baldurs gate.  Then it could be longer, w/dialogue and have more meaning.  Ok, I've used up enough space.",2.0
"I am a huge fan of vampire fiction in any form and also enjoy a good RPG.  So I was ecstatic when I heard about Vampire being translated from the pen-and-paper sources to the computer.  And Vampire is an amazing looking  game that I really wanted to like.  Unfortunately some bad design choices  and poor features prevented it from happening.
I'll start with the good  points.  The graphics are stunningly amazing.  The animation of the  characters is fluid and weapons are superbly done.  The lighting greatly  enhances the dark and sinister atmosphere.  I kept going in many places  because I wanted to see what area I would visit next.  The camera control  is also very smooth and easy to manipulate with the mouse.  The gameplay is  actually fun for the first bit of the game while you are adventuring by  yourself and with one other party member.  The source material and the  manual add a lot to this game.  Wandering around towns and seeing people  milling about made it feel alive.  And it was always oh so fun to feed upon  someone to refill your blood level.
The RPG system is also great.  There  are several positive and detrimenatl traits for the characters.  A certain  level of blood must be maintained to use the disciplines (spells/skills)  and to keep your character from succombing to frenzy.  Experience points  can be distributed among such traits as strength, dexterity, intelligence,  willpower and several others.  Very nicely done indeed.
Here is where I  have to get in to the demerits of this game.  First off, the voice acting  is not very good; but it's not the worst I've heard either.  And the  sequences of dialogue are long and boring.  The characters simply stand in  place and wave their hands about.  NPC interaction is left to a few  choices which really have little baring on the outcome of the game.  Nothing as rich and detailed as Planescape: Torment.
The combat, while  fun and reminiscent of Diablo, only keeps its spark for the first part of  the game.  Most of it consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting until  you've hit them enough times for them to die.  A big flaw that becomes  noticable during the first few levels is that the enemies wait until you  are in range before they attack.  They will simply stand idle as you  slaughter others in the same room!  As the game progresses you will gain  party members, and will bemoan similarly incompetant AI.  I equipped one  with a bow and laughed in disbelief as he continuously fired in to a wall  when he should have moved a couple steps to the side before doing so.  Also, you can control the other members of your party in combat, but the  main character will stop fighting while you are doing so!  Aaahhhh!  Add to  this that you can go through entire areas and clean up with little to no  problem, but then come across certain areas that will be nigh impossible to  pass.  Both enemies and your fellow party members will get hung up on  walls, doors and other obstacles in the room.
And here we come to the  worst sin of the game, the save system.  Saving is automatically handled  when you transition between levels are areas.  The only other way to save  is to be in your haven or safe area.  One can get there by using the Walk  the Abyss discipline (aka spell/skill).  But it takes a while before you  have one of these in a given area.  So we are left hacking our way back  through areas and levels already completed.  I found myself abusing the  autosave feature by running back and forth between levels to save.  But  what if more than one person is playing the game as is the case on my  computer?  It's pretty much tough luck.  This is a computer game, not a  console.  The game should have been balanced so that players could save  anywhere at anytime.
The multiplayer sounds enticing with the ability for  one person to take control of the NPCs and monsters.  But if the gameplay  is similar to the single-player then I can't see it being much  better.
With great graphics, a rich source material and so much  potential.  It makes me sad to not be able to like this game.  This takes  me back to Revenant, another game with a lot of potential but came up  flacid.  Maybe the patches will fix the problems, I certainly hope so.  But  much has to be done for the AI to make this game worthy.",2.0
"At first look the game is beutiful. I'm a die-hard RTS fan and I am glad  that the genre is moving toward 3D (Ground Control, Earth 2150, etc). The  real problem with the game is the gameplay itself.
First I'd like to  point out that the camera model or 'perspective' as it is called is  severely lacking. The camera can only be position up, down, left, and  right. With many passages in the game on a 30-45 degree angle it is very  hard to view the action. I wish Pandemic would have allowed the freedom to  rotate the camera a full 360 degrees (maybae by holding the Shift, Alt, or  Ctrl keys while moving the mouse.
Secondly the missions just are not fun!  There is no fast and frantic gameplay. Taelon extraction and unit creation  is just too slow.",2.0
"Given the pre-release hype from game sites, I was really anticipating this game as the contender for the best RTS this year. I'm pretty disappointed.
The good first: The game looks very nice. It has that same  techno-organic look as Battlezone 2, not surprising since the same guys did  it. It runs fairly nice, aside from the crashes. The framerate and overall  running is probably the smoothest I've ever seen on a 3D RTS, even  Homeworld. The interface is also quite well thought out, and a step forward  over other 3D RTS's, particularly the ease of camera movement.
Other than  that, the game is a dog. Sorry, fanboys, but I have to call it like I see  it. Gameplay is a real snoozer: Tons of dicking around and not much combat.  Everything is just deliberately slow--aircraft move as slowly as infantry  on foot, et cetera. If you are looking for fast, furious, exciting  gameplay, this is not the place to find it.
The unit pathfinding is set  up in such a way that they all move one at a time so that they don't  obstruct each other. Thus, you'll move one unit, and if any others are in  its way they will all, agonizingly, move one at a time to new positions so  the mover can get through. In any movement of groups this problem is ten  times as bad. You'll watch in frustration as your units get ripped to  shreds while they stupidly maneuver into position before they start  returning fire.
No real story is going on here; there are no characters  and nothing happens inside of a mission to alter the plot. There are some  vague cutscenes between the missions, but they're so irrelevant that you  could have just played the missions and made up your own story to string  them together.
Overall, I regret having bought the game. I can't  recommend it unless you're compelled to get an RTS fix.",2.0

"(This review was updated on July 10th, 2006)

I've changed my mind about Super Mario World and actually think it deserves 4 stars.  I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating.  It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90's.  It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did.

I still stand by what I say in the original review: ""The Donkey Kong Country series, for example, came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO, so, if I were you I'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World.  For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other (plus, they feel more creative and memorable).  Unfortunately, many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and, as a result, I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours.

To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself ""I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage"".  It's not like that in Super Mario World.""

I still believe that, but I've recently come to change my mind a little and think that, even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.  I also don't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think.  They sort of look blocky but, to their credit, Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors, which is a plus.

So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario (the games MY generation grew up with).  After all, it's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them (except Mario Is Missing, but with time we've come to realize that game never even existed!)

Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 (but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds).  I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water, desert, air, plant and ice worlds (in addition to more).  In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion.  Those aren't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back (but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it).

Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score (96) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level, but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels (but not all levels have keys).  This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time.  It's sort of boring.  Once is enough.  The concept of collecting keys wasn't a good one.  I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape, you can quickly fly through the levels (except for water levels, and any level where the screen pushes you to the right) but that's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal (or the key).  However, at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way.  I just get tired of it.

Go ahead and get it.  Yes, it's a classic.",2.0
"The product worked great, but the game is HORRIBLE. It is a side scrolling game is boring and darn near impossible.",2.0

"This X game was just tedious.  I remember the original X game on the SNES was fun, as were X2 and X3, but this one was just bad.  Playing as X or Zero was fun, but Zero was hard to control and both storylines were, well, boring.  I was almost to the point of yawning.  Plus, it was easy to figure out who the final boss was for anyone who has ever played an X game.  Additionally, some of the upgrades to Xs armor made him harder to operate, and, well, I guess what I really want to say is this was boring.  I was bored stiff.  I couldn't wait to beat it so I could move on to something else.  Unlike X, X2 and X3, there is almost no replay value in this game.  I mean, beyond the cheat codes for the special X armor and Dark Zero, nothing.  I only hope that X5 and X6 are better, but I'm not sure if they will be.",2.0
"This game could have been a lot worse, but is definitely not a first reccomendation. For one thing the first-person view indoors is not very good, but that is not the worst part, because the gameplay is not bad. The biggest disappointment with the game is that you spend hours beating it, doing all the objectives in order, and you get the worst, most disappointing ending in video game history. A black screen that simply says ""you have escaped from jurassic park"" Gee, thanks feelas, we didn't know thats what it meant when we got in the helicopter and flew away.",2.0
"I must admit that this game is not totally without its charm. However, if you are looking for racing action at its finest, then don't bother. Perhaps what turned me off the most to this game was the lack of challenge. First, there is absolutely no need for the brake. Mindlessly holding down the accelerator will get you through most of the turns. And strangely enough, every car handles about the same. It seems strange that a double decker bus can beat a pack of sports cars. The graphics and sound are not too bad, although the music gets tiresome rather quickly. All in all, this is definitely a game for rental only, unless you are the kind of person who does not like any challenge whatsoever.",2.0
"When my PC broke, this was the only version of Doom I had to play. As such, I beat it several times on UV, so I think I'm as qualified to judge it as anyone.

1.) Graphics were what original Doom used to call ""Low detail mode"" back in the oooooold days. There actually used to b an option for this on the PC version back in th day. In fact, the graphics on the SNES may have been worse. This makes the game even more difficult as at a distance it is hard to tell where the enemies are. They ""Se"" and shoot you just fine while you pretty much have to try to look only for movement.

2.) Framerate is what really made it hard. Very difficult to line up a shot even at close range.

3.) Doomguy got snagged on corners. I have no idea why, but if you got too close to a corner you'd just get stuck there and would have to back up.

4.) Lack of monster infighting was balanced by the fact like monsters could hurt eachother. Basically a modified form of monster infighting.

5.) No floor and ceiling textures mad it feel very Wolfensteinish.

6.) Music was incredible sounding. Definitely the high point.

Al in all, this version should have never been released. Systems with twice the power of the SNES still had to neuter the game. That should tell you something. Ultimately I'm glad it did come out, though, since all the great sounding music tracks are up on Youtube. So why did I play it so much when it was such a crappy port? Because I'm a Doom addict, and addict's aren't known for being picky about their fix.

It's hard for me to imagine anyone being stuck with this version of the game now that everyone has the internet (even on their phones!), multiple computing devices (PC, laptop, tablet, phone, game systems, even TVs now), and multiple ways to buy the game (it's easily downloaded online for free).

"I play a great many strategy games and I consider myself to be a fairly decent player, though not great by any means. On the one hand, I truly enjoy playing IG2.  The mechanisms of planet building and support, the ship design, the research tree, and the general interface are all excellent and make the game a pleasure to play.  Or would if the difficulties (easy, normal, hard) were actually indicative of anything. When I play a game on easy, I expect to learn how to play and very likely win on my first try.  In IG2, the easy was so easy, I won before I really felt I had a handle on the game. Normal level should be a challenge.  I should need to play well, and in the end, I should still only win about half the time.  I've lost count of how many times on ""normal"" (as the Solarians) I have not even come close to winning.  I get wiped out every time by a Kra'Hen fleet so large I can't even conceive of what I would need to do to make one half its size.  Sometimes I die even sooner. Goodness forbid that I even try to play on ""hard"" difficulty. For any normal game, I have come to expect that the ""hard"" difficulty to really be ""nearly impossible"".  In IG2, normal mode does this, and I feel the game is hardly worth the trouble as a result. I have tried as the Shinarians as well, with similar results. In conclusion, while I truly liked the game architecture, I cannot recommend this to anyone.  I found this to be one of the most frustrating games I have played in quite some time.",2.0
"I bought IG2 based on reviews, and overall the game is quite nice. It has some serious flaws, however, which should have been corrected by the developers. The most serious flaw is the research system - you have to  build 3 different types of research centers for the different techs, but it  rapidly becomes incredibly tedious to cycle through all of your planets  toggling the various research centers on and off when you want to research  different classes of technology. A single research building for all the  different classes would significantly decrease the meaningless  micromanagement and let you focus more on the game.
Another flaw for me  is performance. My system is a PII 330MHz w/64MB RAM and an 8MB 3D video  card. I have to play the game at the lowest resolution (VGA), and still  find it incredibly slow. Especially annoying are the pauses whenever you  switch screens - I get at least a 5 second pause, making the previously  mentioned research center toggling triply annoying. Other 3D RTS games like  Starcraft and Age of Empires II scream on my machine at their highest  resolutions (SVGA), but this game makes me feel like I'm playing on a  386.
Also annoying is the CD security. The game has 4 CDs - a base CD and  one for each of 3 races. The annoying part is that you have to have the  base CD in the drive to start the game, then swap out for another CD  *every* time you play. Why not let the game start up from any of the 4  CDs?
Anyway, if you can get past all these flaws, the game isn't bad. I  prefer Master of Orion, though. Swapping CDs and plodding through the  various screens just makes this game too painful for me to really get into.",2.0
"Bleem! for PC is a program which allows you to ""play"" Sony PlayStation games.  However, if your computer isn't EXTREMELY fast with a killer 3D card, this isn't worth it.

And the graphical enhancement ranges from none to  ""that looks great!"", but when the frame rate is as slow  as it is (20-25 fps if you're lucky) it's not worth it.

I'm an old risk player from way back, I used to play the board game with my brother in law many years ago, and I have the pc version of original Risk,and even though that game cheats as do all computer games, it's not near half as bad as risk 2.",2.0
"People who haven't played the original PC RISK think this ""sequal"" is fun, but people who have probably know better. Don't be fooled by the pretty graphics or the neat-sounding simultaneous-moves game. Those are the only things this game has that the original doesn't have, but they are both a big disappointment. Furthermore, the original had way more features which were way more fun and this game doesn't have any of them. Let me explain:

RISK II:

GRAPHICS: Yes, it looks cool to see the little soldiers aiming their guns, shooting, and dying, but by the 20th or so battle it gets to be a real bore and only serves to slow the game down immensely (and there's no way to skip through it.) It might be more fun if there were many more animated soldiers or if they stood in formation (like in the original.) The graphics are certainly better quality than the original but it's really just an attempt to give the game a modern, 3D, RTS look. In short, it looks good at first but gets old and boring really fast.

SIMULTANEOUS-MOVES: The makers of RISK II did a good job of figuring out how to resolve all the many complex situations that can arise when you have multiple players who can split attacks, attack from two different directions, or surge attacks (two territories in a row.) But the disappointment was how the actual combat was resolved in these situations. The thing that really gets my goat is that when a territory is attacked from multiple enemy territories (called a mass-invasion), each attacking territory gets a separate die, regardless of the size of their force. The problem is that the defender has to beat ALL of the opposing dice to do any damage at all. In other words if six armies each attack the same territory from six different territories (one from each) they will have a HUGE advantage even if the defender has the same six armies all on the same territory. The attacker will get six dice and the defender only one, and the defender will have to beat all six opposing dice even if five of them rolled lower numbers. The catch is that if you do roll hihger than all six then you will kill all six, but with only one die your chances are slim and in my experience it just doesn't weigh out. It lends itself to strategies that favor dividing your forces rather than massing them. In reality this would be strategic nonsense.

AI: On top of all these problems, the AI is rather unsophisticated. I've gotten to the point now where, if I play my cards right, I can almost always beat the computer, no matter how many opponents I play against. You learn to use the mass-invasion tactic to your best advantage but the AI never figures it out.

That's about all there is to say. This game does not have many fun features.

THE ORIGINAL GAME:

*Several different maps! Europe (Huge!), Asia, Americas and more.

*Historical scenarios, some with TONS of armies.

*Short battle movies and unit animations (with soldiers in formation!)

*Tactical Cards like ""Attack Right Flank,"" ""Defend Center,"" ""Ambush,"" ""Echelon Attack""

*Generals!

*Forts!

*Terrain effects!

*Many other features and options that I can't remember.

"This version of Risk I thought was an overall bad idea because it just played of the original.  furthermore,  the original RISK 1 disk was more than good enough in every department.

"First the good news: you can play classic risk by yourself or with a friend and let the computer take care of some of the work.  (The board game is still MUCH more fun with friends!)  More good news: you can play ""same time,"" which is a really interesting twist on the classic game, and it's only feasible on the computer--all players issue simultaneous battle orders!  It's offers some brain-tweaking fun to figure it all out.
The bad news: the AI (the computer players) are dumb as posts, and I'm not much of a gamer. I could have gotten to harder AIs, but I didn't have the patience to work my way through all of the lower levels.  Why not let us play at a harder setting to begin with?  More bad news: no saving games!  Worst of all: you have to endure a slow pace!  Unlike the original computer Risk, which came out in the late 1980s, you can't just flip through the battles--the game only allows you to speed it up a tad: so you could be playing speed games on the computer, but it won't let you! Tedious!
While ""same time"" is really interesting, the fact that you're stuck playing AI numbskulls detracts a lot.  This game is best-suited for young players, perhaps ages 9-14.

"It really is a shame...  This game was so close to being awesome, but, like just about every other Lucasfilm game (except Super Empire Strikes Back on SNES), it fails in its execution.
I'll start with the positives though.  The graphics are excellent, though the characters may appear just SLIGHTLY dated.  They animate very well, having been motion-captured.  The backgrounds are awesome, and so is the music.  Of course, you can't go wrong with Star Wars when it comes to graphics and music anyway.  The character voices are even cool as they sound just like their actor counterparts.
However, the gameplay... this, unfortunately, is what ruins it.  Now, there are some cool features here such as a free running mode which makes the game truly 3D like Bushido Blade (and unlike the pseudo 3D of Tekken, for instance).  There is also a limited guard meter (like Street Fighter Alpha 3), which prevents turtling.  Unfortunately though, these nice features are overshadowed by very serious flaws.  First of all, the are the motion-captured moves.  While they look great, they're also extremely jerky when translated to the game.  They are also plagued with horrible lag and recovery times.  Even a simple jab leaves you open for all sorts of counterattacks.  The other problem is the control: it flows like 3-year-old Heinz ketchup.  There is no hope of stringing any moves together because the game cancels out all additional button presses from the moment you start a move all the way until your character completely recovers at the end of the move.  This wouldn't be so bad, except for the previously mentioned problem: extremely slow recovery times.  In fact, the lag time for throwing a swing is longer than the recovery time from getting hit by one!  This means that you hit the opponent with your strongest move, and they recover from it before you do.
The most annoying problem though, by far, is the sidestepping.  Though this may be a cool feature, it is also horribly abused.  The computer AI seems to have an obsession with it, sidestepping constantly (I've timed it--they never go more than 2 seconds without sidestepping, even when they aren't being attacked).  Now, this doesn't sound like much, but it really is a huge problem.  The constant sidestepping also rotates the game's camera.  This makes the computer impossible to hit with any straightforward attack because you are never properly aligned with them.  Combine this with the slow recovery times, and you'll run into situations like this:  You smack the enemy with the first hit in a combo which, logically, should set him up for the next hit, right?  Wrong.  Because of the unbalanced recovery times, he'll recover before your second swing ever comes out, and he'll sidestep, then stand there watching as you go off swinging at the air in some odd direction.  Then he'll automatically turn to face you and hit you in the back of the head (since your character takes forever to re-align himself properly when he isn't facing the opponent--another design flaw).  The constant camera rotation (or, swirling, to be more precise) makes you lose all orientation on the playing field.  Add to this archaic features such as ""Ring Out"" (which should have gone out in the Jurassic period of fighting games), and you have an unplayable, nerve-wracking mess.  Basically, you will lose many matches from being smacked in the back of the head as the computer rotated the camera on you, or by cheap Ring Outs because you couldn't see where you were on the battlefield (again, because the computer rotated the camera on you).
I'm not particularly a fan of 3D fighters, and this game reminds me of why.  Stay away from this one.  If you're not a Star Wars fan, it's just a bad fighting game.  If you are a Star Wars fan, that will make you even more disappointed in this title.",2.0
"When I put the game into the Game Boy it wouldn't work. I tried everything to get it to work, with no success. The game was given as a Christmas present, so I had to tell my daughter that I couldn't get the game to work and I would buy her another one. When I got home, she called me the next day to let me know that her and her friends had worked on the game and had finally got it to work by blowing into the game several times and then putting it into the Game Boy. I will not buy another game from the seller because I had so much trouble with the game.",2.0

"I was unimpressed with this game. The races are too similar to each other. The ships within each race do not differ much except in size. Mouse control is painfully sluggish. Space is two-dimensional - ...Resource collection is uncreative. Several ship classes are missing, such as the Intrepids. Only 8 ships can be selected at a time. Whether I played the Borg or the Federation, I got the feeling that I was just building the same things with different graphics in a [copy] of Starcraft.
Generally, a rather half-hearted effort at a real-time strategy game. It's not bad, really, it's just that there are much better games out there. Like Armada II.",2.0
"The graphics are smooth and intense.  The controls, even though initially confusing, are pretty good.  I've gotten pretty far in this game as well (8 out of 10 levels completed) after playing many, many hours on this  game.
Sound good, right?  Wrong!  The difficulty of the Dreamcast version  is terrible.  I had been in the console/computer game business a while  back, and one of the main flaws I noticed is that computer game developers  are hardcore gamers, developing games for hardcore gamers.  This is a  classic example. ...
Given enough time, many  people could pass this game.  However, there are limits.  After all, it's  just a game, and should only take a maximum 100 hours to complete. This is  well beyond the 100 hours.
Unless you live and breathe video games and  you find ninety-nine percent of all games too easy, stick to another game.  I cannot stress this enough!  It is nearly impossible to complete for any  normal person!",2.0

"Star Trek Armada promised to be what Trekkies had always wanted, a strategy game allowing control of the fantastic ships of the Star Trek universe. At a first glance Armada appears tto do just that. However, beneath the glamarous surface, Armada hides a rather dissapointing game play.
The graphics of Armada are fantastic, truly capturing the different ships and creatures in their best lighting, you could truly be looking at the special effects of a Star Trek episode when zoomed in. However, the gameplay is frankly, dull. The sides all have different units, but underneath they are virtually identical. While the federation Sovereign and Romulan D'deridex Warbird look completely different and have two different special weapons, otherwise they have identical shield and weapon values. The reaces each have a scout ship, which are all equally powerful, a destroyer type ship, alll equally powerful, a cruiser, all equally powerful etc.
The different special weapons hardly make up for this, and the base defences are far to powerful and effective, meaning that you need only your command centre and a few torpedo turrets to survive any attack. Also, the simplistic units mean that once you've reached the most advanced level, there is never any need for you to purchase the more primitive ships.
The campaigns ar ealso depressingly short, a mere four missions for each race then four bonus missions at the end, and the missions are dull, sparked only by a few special ships. There is no real difference between playing as any of the different races.
It's not that Star Trek Armada is a particularly bad game, it's just that there are so many ways in which it could easily be improved. We can only hope that the sequel will be more varied in units and more enjoyable in game play.",2.0
Every time I have bought an activision game I have loved it. But Armada is not a game like that. Its major faluts are:bugs(it crashes every few minitues) AI (the computer has yet to beat me) patches (Activision stopped makeing patches!) and that it requres a fast computer to run well. However the graphics are good and it is fun when it isn't crashing. Buy this only if you are a trekke and rich.,2.0
"I am a true Star Wars fan and I collect everything and love all the movies but this was definatley not an enjoyable game.  Sadley the gameplay did not come natural, so there was a learning curve.  The graphics were behind the times and character movement was horribloe.  I even often found AT-ST getting stuck up against a wall and unmoveable - a total frustrating moment.  Yes this is Star Wars and yes it is great on that respect.  However compare it to any RTS that came out a few years prior to it and you would be still dissapointed.  I'm sure Lucasarts will try again soon, hopefully...",2.0
"I found Star Wars fun at first but its lasting appeal died off fast and the levels and gameplay were very slow. There were a couple annoying gltches, including a menu glitch which made it impossible to read the menu.  Finally the graphics are not so good. Not very impressive for a lucas arts  game. But if you are a die hard star wars fan it would be a pretty fun  game.",2.0
"Nice game for the first two levels, but the little things make the difference; such as bunkers cannot fire and only hold two soldiers.  The game gets confusing and the story jets off in certain points.  A much  better game of the same genre is Ground Control. FOCOM also is very  unrealistic because AT-ST's cannot destroy soldiers well at all.  Another  downside of this game is the unit limit, which is very annoying.  2 stars  is very fair if not nice for this game.",2.0
"I've played ST: Armada all the way through all the scenarios and I must say that while the game is fun, the Borg were made just way too powerful.  The Federation ships are ok, but the Klingons and the Romulons are too weak  to be belived. Not to mention that the AI is NOT (intelligent, that is).  When I play multi-player, I play the borg and it's a rare occasion when I  loose ships and/or structures to anything but stupidity.
If you are an  absolute ST fanatic, go ahead and get this game. But if you are in to the  RealTime Strategies, better if you skip this one for now. At least untill  some of the sudden abort bugs are fixed (bugs that cause the game to abort  and exit back to windows without any notification or warning).",2.0
"The Good:
For the first time, command Star Wars Imperial and Rebellion units in real time.  The sound is truly the most excellent part of the game; the unit sounds are fantastic, and the metal-ized version of the  Imperial Theme is a nice touch.  Graphics are a bit dated, but I feel  they've done a good job with what they had, using a dated 3D engine.
The  Bad:
The main menu and the user interface for controlling your force  looks extremely tacked-on in a last-minute fashion, and should have been  done much better.  The interface makes controlling units a chore.  This is  a common deficiency in recent LucasArts games, though.  The 3D perspective  takes time to master, and until you do master it, you'll lose alot.  This  combined with the interface reduces you to alot of micromanagement, which  can get problematic.
The worst aspect of the game is how resources are  derived.  The game works on a system of ""command points"", whereby  you are rewared with the capability to purchase more resources when you are  succesful in combat.  This sounds like it might have been innovative, but  in this implementation what happens both in the single player and  multiplayer game is that the player (or computer) who wins early skirmishes  gets access to greater numbers of units and advancements, thus quickly  overwhelming their opponent.  This condition, where the outcome is decided  from the start and you've virtually no way to recover from an early falter,  causes frustration and represents to me poor design.
If you are an  absolute freak about Star Wars, you might enjoy this game because you'll be  able to re-enact the battle of Hoth and other scenarios.  If however you  want an excellent real-time strategy game, try Starcraft or Age of Empires  II.  If you want strategy in 3D, Homeworld is also an excellent bet.",2.0

If your looking for a warcraft or C&C type game using starwars stuff This isn't it. The game play ability was poor and slow. It was boring to the point of falling asleep.

Unfortunatly my friends and I all believed the game was a let down and of  poor challenge quallity. Be wise and don't buy .,2.0
"Looks like LucasArts has done it again: a great storyline and great cutscenes mixed with a slow, akward interface. Sure, the colors are all there and 3D is everywhere, but zooming in closer shows the boxy troops and  vehicles, with very low detail compared to many games of today. The  learning curve is steep, and new players can't even adjust the difficulty.  In conclusion: hard to control, hard to see what's happening, and hard to  think why LucasArts couldn't have done better.",2.0
"I was very disappointed when I stuck the game in my AMD K7-600 machine and found out that it even slowed my computer down.

I am hoping that adding another 128  MB chip into my computer will correct the problem.  If it does I will  resubmit my review.  It is a great looking game.

"Do not even assume for a moment that Star Trek: Armada has any resemblance to Relic's Homeworld, the two are about as closely related as Woody Allen is to Arnold Schwarzengger. First off, it has the longest install process  of any game I have ever played, and I have a 48x CD-ROM drive. Second, the  interface is monstrous, even though it looks elegant and simple. While  positioning ships is easy, (and it should be since they only move in 2  dimensions), there is no real sense of scale, plus they have a tendency to  `bump' into objects like space stations and other ships. Secondly, the  instant they see an enemy ship, any vessel you control within weapons'  range automatically opens fire, taking interaction down a notch. Also  unlike Homeworld the user cannot assign formations to his ships, making  dispersement messy.
 When the game starts the user is treated to a  rather nicely rendered opening scene with lots of fleet action between  Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg vessels that culminates on an all-out  run on Borg Cubes. (Though one wonders how Picard can face down Locutus  since they are the same guy. Did the Borg clone Picard?) Unfortunately, the  game doesn't deliver anywhere near the excitement generated by a 3 minute  opening segue. At the title screen you have a choice to play a series of  missions as either the Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg and they all  must be played before arriving at the finale mission. Overall, the game  seems to have been slapped together to capitalize on the franchise, lacking  both the quality and substance that LucasArts has put into their Star Wars  line of games. Armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like Homeworld  or even Starcraft. If you changed the space scapes to ground and the  starships to Zerg or Protoss units, Armada would be Starcraft, except not  as much fun.
 Armada prolongs the Star Trek game curse when it should  have shattered it. The prospect of moving a fleet of Defiant and Sovereign  class starships around the screen should have been an easy game to create.  Perhaps if Activision had optioned the Homeworld engine for Armada, things  would have been different. However, on the upside, the rendered starships  do look nice, as does the 3D lighting for all of the effects shots. Getting  Patrick Stewart, Michael Dorn, and Denise Crosby to do voices will probably  get die-hard Trek fans to purchase the game to feed their pirana-like  frenzy for franchise merchandise, but style should never win out over  substance in a game like this. There is very little meat to this game.

"This is a semi-decent game. It will keep your attention for about 2 hours. Basically you play the Federation, Klingon, Borg or Romulans. You control ship production and deployment. Of course there is mining and resource  management. For the most part this is basically Star Craft with Star Trek  ships. The graphics are mediocre and the AI is horrible. The AI doesnt  re-build once you destroy the enemy bases.  I would wait on this game until  it goes into the sale bin (and it will head there fast). This could have  been a really promising game, the ship designs and attributes are ok-and I  like the feature of being able to transport troops onto enemy ships and  then take it over. Aside from that, there really isn't anything special  about this game.

"Remember the moment in the movie Jurassic park when Dr. Grant raced across the plains of the jungle on the back of a galimums while shooting his machine gun at attacking helicopters? How about when he trecked through ancient aztec ruins while shooting flame thrower equiped janitors? And don't forget the time he ran around on a cargo ship while blowing up floors and engines with his arsenal of grenades.

What? You don't recall those action packed moments? Neither do I, but that's what's presented in the sega genesis game ""Jurassic park: Rampage edition.""

Jurassic park rampage edition (JPRE) takes an alternate, more action paced look at the classic story of dinosaurs gone amok on a jungle island. Where in the books and the movies Grant was a quiet paleontologist who just wanted to dig up ancient bones in the desert, here he's become a super military commando who makes Rambo look like Ronald McDonald. Where in the movie and books Grant was focused on getting off the island without becoming dinosaur food, here he's shooting everyone and everything in sight...which isn't necessarily a bad thing, due to the fact that everyone and everything on the island is out to kill him.

It should be said up front right now. JPRE is the most unintentionally silliest games i've ever played. All the little factors add up to create an experience that is so silly and so dorky in all it's aspects that one can't help but chuckle when you look back on the experience.

Where to begin? Well, let's start with the other humans. For some reason, Jurassic park is populated with thousands of soliders and janitors, both who are equipped with military weapons and are, for some reason, out to kill you. No matter where you go, you'll find dozens of soldiers and janitors shooting at you and chucking grenades in your direction (Luckily, Grant can survive multiple grenade hits, so it's not too much of a problem). It's a mystery why these guys are out to kill you when there's no logical reason to it. Furthermore, they seemed to have made an alliance with the local dinosaurs because they never attack them, and the dinosaurs never attack them as well. It seems that poor Grant is under the crosshairs of every single living thing on the island.

Every stage you go through in the game (with the exception of Grant's final level) is packed to the brim with a riddiculous number of soldiers, janitors, raptors, compys, spitters, and even a triceratops or two. How do you deal with these threats? Here's a hint. You run. You run your stubbly little legs as fast as you can. While the whole point of JPRE is to be an action packed game where you shoot every living thing in sight, it's simply much more efficent to just run and jump your way to the exit (with this method, you can finish the game in about twenty minutes).

If you want, you can go through the game and try to kill everything with your enormous arsenal of weapons (more on those later), it's simply not really worth the effort. For one thing, you'll probably get hit a lot trying to inflict damage on your enemies. Trying to kill raptors is a pain in the butt due to faulty hit detection. A raptor (or two) will jump next to you and start bitting and whacking away with thier tails as you frantically fire your shotgun over and over again trying to hit them, yet they take no damage. So you leap away and start firing, and finally kill them after several shots. As a result of not being able to hit them at point blank range, you've lost 3/4th of your health and a lot of ammo has been wasted. When attacking kamikazie soldiers and janitors, it's very common to have several grenades chucked in your direction before you even get a shot off. Result? Loose health before you even take out one guy.

And let's not even talk about the wackiest enemy in the game. Attack helicopters! Yes, that's right. When going through the savanna level, Grant is constantly being assaulted by attack helicopters that fire rockets at him! When I saw one coming onto the scren for the first time, I had to pause the game because I was laughing too much to keep going. Here I was, just trying to get across that blasted savanna, being attacked by grenade chucking soldiers and machine gun equipped janitors, and here i'm being attacked by an attack helicopter?! What kind of psycho island is this?! Thankfully, these helicopters can be driven away by shooting...of all things...tranquilizer darts into them. Whee!

Fortunitly, to counter the threat of attack helicopters and flame-thrower equipped janitors, you have an enormous arsenal of military grade weapons at your disposal.  No longer satisfied with gas grenades and puny tranquilizer pistols (from the original Jurassic park game on the Sega genesis), Grant has an arsenal of death dealing weaponry, ranging from shotguns to machine guns, to rockets and death dealing grenades.  All of these get the job done, but the greatest satisfaction comes from using the greatest weapon in the history of video games:  The electric gun (or as I call it, the zappy gun).  This amazingly fun weapon doesn't just kill bad guys, it disintigrates them!  Simply fire the gun, watch the bolt of electricity go out, and when it hits the janitor, he'll go ""Ogh!"", briefly turn into a skeleton, and vanish into thin air.  It sounds brutal, but it's absoloutly hilarious to watch! (and let's face it, disintigrating an incredibly annoying enemey is tremendously satisfying!).  As an added bonus, it also does the disentigration effect on dinosaurs as well!

If one wants to have lots of gunning and running action while shooting dinosaurs, then you'll certianlly get it while playing this game.  Going through each level pits you against literally hundreds of soliders and dinosaurs, so much so that at times it's easy to get overwhelmed.  Fortunitly, the game does include a desperatly needed checkpoint system (which was missing in the first genesis game).  This is the kind of game that you can play two ways.  You can run and try to survive to get to the end, or you can take your time and kill everything you come across, so you do get a bit of freedom when it comes to how you play.

But even with all the guns, the sillyness of the game, and even the checkpoints...JPRE just isn't much fun to play.  As I said earlier, it's fairly easy to be overwhelmed by enemies in some levels, but the game eventually just boils down to ""run and shoot"" or just ""run"".  There are items you collect for points, but those points don't do anything.

At it's core, JPRE is a simple, run around and shoot em up shooter.  It has good graphics, some nice music (I do like the jazz/rock theme), but whether you like it or not is really up to personal taste.  If you like mindless action games with guns...lots of guns...then you might like this.  With many emulators on the internet, why not try downloading it and giving it a try?  You just might find yourself getting a laugh or two messing around with those crazy janitors.",2.0
"Back in 1993 Sega released a dull, lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time. Quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, tougher and better.
It isn't. It's a slow, boring game.
You can choose to be either Dr. Alan Grant or...a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant go around killing all those army guys (just what are they doing in the game)? And why a Raptor be killing other Raptors? Weird.
Obviously not learning from their first mistake Sega really dropped the ball on this so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, sluggish and dullest platformers I have ever played.",2.0
"I purchased a brand new factory sealed Sega Genesis 3 over 8-months ago. It is very light weight and compact compared to the earlier versions. However, in decreasing size and weight Sega has also diminished the quality.

I was very excited when I first recieved the Sega Genesis 3 console. Unfortunely this excitement quickly faded. After plugging in the controllers to the connection port over 3-dozen times, the ports began to pull away from the exterior casing and pushing inward where you could not even plug in the controller anymore.

On top of this the controller ports are fastened to the power switch circuit board which also pulled back with the ports, causing the power switch to become inoperative. After removing the casing and leaving it off permanetly, I was then able to plug the controllers into the exposed ports and use the system correctly.

Obviously this is not the way you want to use or care for your BRAND NEW system. Now that circuit boards are exposed they are susceptible to far more complications with dust and possible component detachment.

Could this issue have been a once-in-a-million fluke? Sure, but after spending over $75.00 for the brand new Sega Genesis 3, I will not take a chance at purchasing another, due to the fact that it does feel rather fragile and flimsy. I would recommend the Sega Gensis 2 over this model or even take my chances with the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Officially-Licensed-Sega-Genesis-Gen-Core-System-w-20-Sega-Games-Built-in-Cartridge-Slot/dp/B002SLZSC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Officially Licensed Sega Genesis Gen Core System w/ 20 Sega Games Built-in & Cartridge Slot</a>.",2.0

"LJN was a subsidiary of Acclaim Entertainment created to make more games for the NES and it continued into the SNES/Genesis era. One of their first games they released for the SNES was WWF Super Wrestlemania in 1992. While it was great to see a game with the WWF license, it only turned out to be a forgettable wrestling game that sorely lacked content and variety.

WWF Super Wrestlemania lets you take control of one out of eight wrestlers. From there, you can choose to play a one player game to go against the computer, a 2 player vs. game to go against another player or a tag team mode where you and another player take on a computer controlled tag team. Whoever pins the other person first is the winner of the match. That's pretty much the entire game. There is nothing else to do but to tweak the options before or after the match.

The PROS: For its time, the graphics and sounds were top notch. The controls were simple enough so it doesn't take long before you pull off punches, kicks, body slams and jumping off from the top rope. The wrestlers look good enough that you recognize them. Finally, 2 player support means you can take on a friend anytime you wanted when you get tired of playing against the computer.

The CONS: The problems here are few but bothersome. First off, you only have 8 wrestlers and that is a small selection to choose from. Second, the game modes are scarce: there aren't any main story or tournament modes to play through. One player, 2 player vs. and tag team modes are no different from each other. Even though they look like the real wrestlers, the in-game wrestlers don't have any of their trademark moves. They all move the same and have the same basic moves so it didn't matter which wrestler you play with. Then there is the ring you fight in. There's only one ring you fight in. The crowd cheers for you in the background but it loops constantly so it will eventually get on your nerves. At this point, the game starts to get very repetitive with no real purpose other than to fight over and over again. Clearly, LJN just wanted this game out there since there were new gaming consoles that people were buying at the time.

It was fun playing this game for a while but afterwards, it got boring. The lack of game modes, variety in the rings and the absence of trademark moves for the wrestlers just makes WWF Super Wrestlemania feel like a generic wrestling game without any of the things that mirrored the World Wrestling Federation at the time. If you're looking for a good SNES wrestling game, get Royal Rumble instead.",2.0
THE GAME IS SLOW AND THERE IS NO WRESTLING MOVES.BUT YOU GET OUTSIDE THE RING ACTION WITH ANY WRESTLER.PS IF YOU WANT WRESTLING GET WWF RAW OR THE ROYAL RUMBLE FOR SNES.,2.0
"The original Wrestlemania was in no way at all a good game. It was boring, slow and every wrestler had the same exact moves and more or less looked the same.
Wrestlemania wasn't meant to be a stand out game. I think it was meant to be the beginning of something else because after this came WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw which some of us plated to death.
I would surpass this one and go straight to either WWF Royal Rumble or WWF RAW.",2.0

"This is a Mortal Kombat clone, with huge amounts of blood, and two fatalities for each competitor. The only difference with this game is that all of the fighters are pre-historic! Two apes, a big dinosaur, a fire breathing legendary dinosaur, a raptor and much more. The gameplay is much like Street Fighter 2, and the gameplay is very slow, because you are fighting as dinosaurs! Another interesting feature is that for those who like to use the same move over and over again, the game laughs at you. Pretty cheap game, rent it before you buy it.",2.0
"(...) Primal rage is a game about seven dino-gods who are set free from their prisons when a disaster strikes ""Urth"" in the near future. The player's goal is to defeat the other dino-gods, conquer their lands, gain the most number of worshippers and end up ruling the new urth. The concept sounds okay, but the game which follows the story is not really.
When you turn on the game and arrive at the title screen, you may think the background bird sounds are cool. But go to the player select screen and from there it's all downhill. The sound and music quality is more like that of a Sega Genesis game. Then there are weird scratching noises at times, and a horrible ""continue screen"" music that will make you drop the controller and run for an asprin! The graphics are slightly easier to handle. The seven monsters are reasonable, especially the t-rex duo Sauron and Diablo. Sometimes however you may find yourself trying to identify which is the head and tail in the middle of the action. The backgroung visuals are also decent. But the fatalities...are terrible. They are nowhere near the quality of Mortal Kombat. It's hard to actually figure out what they are doing in some.
Then there are the special moves. Some of them are okay (like Diablo's ""hot foot""), and some of them are not (like Chaos's ""farts"" and ""puke""). Talk about weirdness. The character Vertigo is ridiculous. A dinosaur with the head of a cobra and the tail of a scorpion? Some special moves are hard to identify as what they're supposed to be. The controls aren't quite what you'd want. The characters are poor at jumping, and even slow and clumsy on ground. It's sometimes hard to identify if the move they are performing is a special move or just a normal one. Oh, I said something of the sort above, didn't I?
So if you want a Genesis quality game for your SNES (you're nuts), then you can buy this. But what's the point? The SNES has much more eye-candy and easier to control fighting games out there. This is one of the least appealing SNES fighting games I've played. If you want some mindless button-mashing with no real depth and unrealistic amounts of gore, this game is for you. Incase you don't realise the difference in quality right away, play this first and then play Street Fighter II Turbo, Mortal Kombat or even TMNT: Tournament Fighters. You soon will.",2.0
"Max Payne has been in development for approximately 4 years, and it took all that time to publish a [...] game that doesn't include a multiplayer mode, very, very few cut scenes, and one boring character who has the constant look of constipation or a reaction to ""stinky feet"" on his face 100% of the time, it's really very annoying.
The whole game revolves around ""Bullet time,"" a nifty idea that is great when it's simply another feature in a game, but to have the entire game built around it is simply boring.
Max Payne consists of running into a dark room, shooting everybody, then moving on to the next room, wash, rinse and repeat, over and over and over.
On top of that you get to read incredibly corny, ""John Woo"" style (whatever that is) dialogue (read: bad cliches) and cinematic flair.
The story revolves around you finding your wife and child shot by someone and you go out for revenge as a renegade cop of sorts and uncover a large conspiracy.  The characters are completely uninteresting, look much too similar, and the comic book style text which breaks things up are as boring and dull as an episode of NYPD Blue.
Max Payne should've (been cheaper) for the game itself is only about 10 or so hours long, has little to-no extras, and limited replayability.
Shooting people in slow motion simply isn't enough to knock my socks off I guess.",2.0
"Yes, i played the whole game, twice.  For about the first hour, it was the greatest game ever, but by the time I got to the second chapter, it got a little repetitive.  Max Payne isn't the first game to have bullet time, and it has a pretty run of the mill plot. Guy loses family, goes out for revenge, discovers a large plot by an evil corporation to rule the world... What's new?  If you've played one action game you've played them all.  Once you figure out how to kill one bad guy, you can kill them all.  I don't see why everyone thinks this is the greatest game ever, its been done before.",2.0
"I have to say, I'm not impressed. I would have much rather have gotten Secret of Mana 2 rather than this. Not recomended.",2.0
"The storyline in this game is very thrilling from the whole Valkyr story to the blood trail dream phases, and the graphics are pretty decent, nothing spectacular.  This game's 2 big features are the graphic novel scenes instead of fancy cutscenes, and the Matrix, er, Bullet Time slow-motion shooting and the instant replay when you give someone a bullet to the head.  There is a nice variety of weapons, though it's a little odd how Max can carry so many at once.  Sounds like a 5-star game, huh?
  The major problem comes in when you realize, hey, there's little to no strategy or decisionmaking involved here.  The levels are depressingly straightforward.  There are all sorts of doors that make it look like you have a thrillingly complex level, but when you approach them they make a little shaking noise, as if you're trying to open them, but you have to move on to the doors that the emenies have so nicely left unlocked for you.  Occasionally, you'll have to figure out a way to get beyond a door, but that's usually just a few steps back.  Basically, there's barely any choices that you can make.  You just sit back and kill people until the next graphic novel scene comes on.
  Basically, this game would have made a better graphic novel.  Unless, of course, you love mindless shooting games with souped up animation.",2.0
"Definitely ""Max Payne"" has a lot of innovations to show, technically speaking. The special effects of slowing time (the Matrix-style effects), bullet time, special dodge maneuvers are all unique to this game. Besides this it is quite a no-brainer of a game and quite a short one as well.
Decide what type of a gamer are you... The ""Deus Ex"" type, where you have to think, interact, interrogate, read etc... in order to survive, or the Duke Nukem type where you go around shooting and shooting and ....

"I just finished MP, and it only took me a day and a half. Judging from other comments on Amazon I'm not the only person to have finished the game in such a short time. The graphics are a real mix. The cool particle engine shines as a stunning example of what we can look forward to in the next generation of game engines, but the scenery and background art looks brown and dull throughout the entire game - think Quake2 without the aliens and you're not far off.
The game's one ""gimmick"" of a slo-motion play mode is fun for the first couple of hours, then just gets boring. I wish they had spent more time on producing a story (it has every cheesy cliche in the book, and is presented by a dull expressionless monotone narration).
The game was so gripping that I just had to go and fill in my yearly tax return instead. Don't buy the hype.. buy a decent game instead.",2.0
"One main gimmick (the bullet-time feature) and some decent graphics. That's all this overrated game really offers. And not only is it a 1.5 trick pony, but it's a very short one, too...you can finish it the same day you receive it.
Suffice it to say Max Payne is just poor value all round. It's obvious most of the reviewers here either don't have the game or reviewed it while still in their 10-hour honeymoon with it. It's incredible how much a couple of days can sober one's opinion of this lackluster game. My two cents? Save your money and don't bother till it hits the bargain bin.",2.0

"I bought this game, because it was on Gamespot's Greatest Games of All Time list. The game itself is amazing! It's fast, it's fun, and has excellent replay value; however, this game requires that you have two different discs along with two different playstation consoles linked together in order to do multiplayer... What's up with that!!! This game would have been simple to provide split-screen for, so why did they have to make multiplayer so friggin' complicated and expensive. The chances of you finding another friend with a playstation 1 and another copy of Wipeout XL is almost zero! I wanted to play my brother in this game so bad, and I can't because it requires a friggin' console link! That's just bogus!",2.0
"I don't get the appeal of the Wipeout games. They're terrible. Wipeout 3 and XL are no different. The music is good enough (for a bunch of techno beats... yeah, I'm not a techno fan) and the graphics are slick and futuristic-looking, but the actual racing part has one BIG problem: you keep hitting the side of the track as you go around a turn and for some reason that means you have to make a complete stop. It wouldn't be so bad if you just slowed down, but the fact that your vehicle stops *immediately* is the worst thing ever.

How are you supposed to enjoy a racing game if you keep hitting the side of the track and STOPPING every couple seconds? There's so many turns in any one of the races, that the problem is unavoidable. I don't understand when people say you need skill to enjoy these racing games. If I can't increase speed, then what ELSE is there to enjoy? If the appeal lies in playing each race over and over so you can memorize the track to avoid hitting the side, then count me out. Doing that would be WAY too tedious of a task. You need a lot of space to freely drive around or else a racing game won't work.

Sure, I can go around shooting other vehicles, but who cares about that when I can't ever catch up to them. Too many sharp turns in the Wipeout series make it difficult to build up speed. Right when I think I've got a good race going, I hit the side and my car stops and there goes the momentum. What a way to kill the fun.

Then there are the controls, which I find much less intuitive than other Mario games--even the way Yoshi jumps is off...it's way too slow.  Even if I look past those issues, I still don't find myself having fun while playing this game.  Where's the fun??",2.0
"Most games based upon franchises are utter crap, and this is one of them. I had fun with it as a kid but going back to playing it makes me realize how bad it actually was. You pick one of the five original rangers, just one (single player game), -and they all look downright fugly and only have cosmetic differences by the way- and you run through various environments beating on Putty Soldiers until they explode (nice...). You press one button to jump, and one to punch, and your character does a three hit combo. It would be fun if your enemies put up more of a fight or presented a challgenge. In other words it's not quite as fullfilling as Double Dragon or Battle Toads or Streets of Rage or even the modern day Viewtiful Joe.

Midway through the level you get to morph into your characters alter ego and they use their weapons instead of their fists this time. Along with the boss battles this is where the Rangers differences pop up, but it's really only cosmetic in reguards to how they attack and what dinosaur is visible with their special move (save that for the boss). Quite possibly the most redeaming quality about this game, besides the bosses being the monsters from the show is the final two levels where you go toe-to-toe with a giant monster in the ultra cool Megazord. Now this plays like a fighting game, mostly like the Ultraman fighting game, but this is actually fun compared to that, despite the slow movement, and spike in difficulty.

Even for fans of the original (and best) Power Rangers this isn't even worth looking at. There are better beat 'em ups, and slightly better Power Ranger games. Whats terrible about this game (besides that it cashed in on the thousands of fans love of the series) is that you only fight two battles with the Megazord, and there was no Green Ranger, the coolest of them all. Weak... seriously weak.",2.0

"If you have NEVER played this game,, don't buy it thinking it is anything like Tecmo Super Bowl on Nintendo.... Its not.  Now, if you are familiar with this specific game and liked it in the past for whatever reason then there should be no reason why you would not continue to like it now.",2.0
"Battletoads are back, and bigger than ever.  No, seriously.  The sprites are much larger this time, which is what ruined my experience.  Sure, they look cooler and take advantage of the SNES's capabilities, but that choice came at a cost.  The characters are way too large on the screen which makes it very easy to get attacked, and this becomes even more apparent and infuriating when playing co-op because friendly fire is enabled.  It got on my nerves whenever someone was attacking an enemy and my giant sprite would get in the way and do serious damage to me.  There were also moments, particularly with the first stage, where the ground collapses and usually without any indication whatsoever resulting in cheap deaths.
While I am bashing on the game I do have to say the music is fantastic and totally captures that heavy metal 80s-90s aesthetic.  It was composed by David Wise, the genius behind the iconic soundtracks for the Donkey Kong Country games and he does not fail here.
Ultimately, I would prefer the classic Battletoads or any beat em' up with smaller sprites to play alongside friends.",2.0
"Many magazines have been giving this item rave reviews, but I can't understand why.  Sure the design is elegant and innovative, but it makes  games almost impossible to play unless you are in absolute darkness.

There has GOT to be a better way to light up your  gameboy, and let me tell you, this is NOT it.",2.0
"You first selects as one of three pit fighters to compete against a slew of amazing brutal pit fighters (a whole 7). This is your normal fighting game, no blood, no fatalities, the only difference is that there is more of a playing field, you can move around the total pit, rather than just moving left and right on a platform like other fighting games. There are pretty simple moves, punches, kicks, sweeps, yada yada, which make the game get old really quick. The only good thing about the game is its huge challenge and special rounds, such as when you must fight tigers! Rent it, don't buy it.",2.0
"I applaud the creators for their effort, which we all know was immense. I'm sure they put an insane amount of time and effort into this game, and they did manage to create some immersion. However, I did not care for the puzzles, and didn't feel inspired to go on. Video games work on a simple ""reward"" system. The level of difficulty should yield an equal reward. Otherwise, what's the point? Well I found with Myst that I was forced to accomplish and re-accomplish extremely large and time consuming tasks with little to no reward.
  In one ""age"", if u choose a wrong switch you have to go somewhere else and re-charge a battery, and to re-charge the battery you have to pump water and this whole time you're running back and fourth and back and fourth. I LOVE complex puzzles, but what I HATE is when they are spaced far apart and you have to keep running from A to B over and over, performing trial and error. I wasn't really motivated by the story, if there was one, and the bit of acting in the game was silly. The ages were completely devoid of humanity, making the ""journey"" depressing. Oh did I mention ""secret hotspots""? Yeah if you can't figure out what to do next it's because you haven't found the secret hotspot. Also the navigation is so confusing that you completely miss pathways. This is because when the curser says right or left, it sometimes actually means it's going to turn you 180 degrees. That's fine but when all the scenery looks similar, you don't know you you just turned to the right, or 180 degrees. It's a nightmare.
One reviewer said their 10yr old son liked the game. Yeah right. He just thought it was fun to play on the computer. Trust me, he wasn't actually playing the game. Most intelligent adults that i've asked about this game felt that it nearly drove them mad and they got pretty angry at the game. Not because they were not smart enough, but because the game really tests your patience and most of all- doesn't give you adequate rewards for your efforts. Sometimes when you step in an elevator the door automatically closes. Then, another time, you learn that you have to close the door yourself. I don't feel like I'm playing a game, I feel like I'm just learning how the game creators try to stump us. I will not be playing Riven, or anything else by these people. Which is truly sad because the graphics in Riven look amazing. If they spent less time on complexity and size, and put more work in the story, and the drive, it could have been worth my while. I had more fun playing Aura, even with the nausea-inducing 3D nagivation. Syberia remains the champion.",2.0

"To get the bad out of the way, this game is slow, tedious, and ""tactics"" simply is not a good way to describe it. There is very little tactical combat involved. Moves happen immediately as soon as you choose an action. There are no attacks that change the position of enemies, so a very large amount of the game is luck regarding the position of your enemies to allow you to cast wide-range spells that will annihilate everything. Adding to the bad is the downright broken leveling system. Essentially it works like this: Perform an action, get experience and job points. Regardless of what action you perform. This ends up making you enter a random battle, killing all except one enemy, and throwing rocks at each other for an hour until you all have leveled up obscenely, and can essentially learn any skill now. Not very fun. The story is also pretty pathetic, the translation makes the game very difficult to understand, and the story itself doesn't stand out among other RPGs. Personally, I don't care for the whole medieval politics setup, but it might please some. The good? There are a whole lot of skills and classes to learn and be, and the idea of being able to equip TWO job skills at once makes for some pre-battle strategy. For instance, you can choose to have a hybrid black and white mage, or a knight and a monk, or a summoner and a gunman. It's a nice little touch. The soundtrack is also pretty decent orchestral stuff that can be catchy at times. Nonetheless, the whole experience gets very old after a while. The battles are not very diverse, you just unload your skills on everyone time and time again, the graphics are annoying and the camera can be frustrating, and overall, it just isn't very fun.

"This game by any standards is violent. But that's about all that I can say. Sure you can hit a guy in any of the 29 anatomical hit areas programmed into the game. Sure, it's fun to watch a  guy holding a stub of  his foot after you blew it away with a shotgun. But how many of these  images would you really like to see for the next 4 hours until you finally  realize this is just what this game was all about. Nothing else. Graphics:  Nice OpenGL. Might cause some problems with GeForce 256 cards. Interface:  in game save. easy to use multiplayer options. Gameplay: regular shoot-em  up. very formulaic: shoot, blood, run. Do this for 4 hours and you'll  finish the game. Weapons ballistics are not that real. Believe me... I  know. AI: can be intimidating sometimes. Look before you walk into any  area.

"Ok, I know your wondering why the 2 stars.  Let me explain.  Just to get it out of the way, yes the graphics are astounding, and the body-sensitive damage on the enemys makes for a pretty fun way to kill a person (especially when you cap someone in the ""nether regions""), plus,  the weapons are pretty cool.  Now, to the less than stellar aspects of  the game:  AI (artificial intelligence):  Its [bad].  I guess I was  spoiled with Half Life, but when I rush into a room full of baddies, let  some shots fly, then run around a corner, I expect at least one or two try  to come after me.  Never happened in this game ( OK, maybe ONCE).  Like  fools, they just kept shooting at the wall...over and over and over and  over....I think you get my point.  Storyline: It can hold its own,  although it didn't draw me in at all.  There are no real puzzles in the  game, and the ones they do have stink.  There was actually a cut scene  where I was told I had to ""Find the helipad switch!"", where I  then walked into the NEXT room and *lo and behold!* it was right there!  They could have done a better job than that.  Level Layout:  Absolutely, completely, unequivocally linear.  Very, very few options to  make any choice in the path you choose to get through the levels.  Its  usually a straight ""path"" to the end of the level, which takes  away from the experience of the game.  Every door other than the one you  need to take to get to the end of the level is *Locked*.  Not too cool.  I know it sounds like I'm a party pooper over here, but these are the  things that can really make or break a game, and they need to be stated.  It is fun to shoot enemies in different parts of their bodies and see  area-sensitive damage, but that novelty runs out, and you wind up just  rushing through the game pretty quick.  Better map layout and storyline  could have really boosted this game from ""mediocre"" to  ""fantastic""...unfortunately, it just turnes out to be another  average FPS.  Buy it if you want, but don't expect to be blown away.",2.0

You think you're doing fine after you recovered from plague, whoops, here comes an invading army. If you fended off the army, Caesar gets displeased and dispatches a legion to wipe you out. If you manage to beat Caesar's first legion, he sends more doubling in size every time. That's not to consider the fact that your people are starving, the gods are angry and your city is on fire again and the plague is sweeping your houses again since the doctors were killed by Caesar's legions and you're in debt 5000 Dn to the emperor. Ridiculous. Most units are worthless too, the prefects only put out fires and I've never seen one actually fight a legionaire and not die. I've seen 8 prefects on 1 last surviving legionaire and he kills them all and ransacks my whole city!!! ONE FREAKING GUY RANSACKS AN ENTIRE CITY!!!

"At first, Caesar III got me addicted to the extent that I'd spend all of my waking hours trying to get a good city going, neglecting even my schoolwork. However, once I got into the medium and upper levels, it became obvious that this game was impossible to win!
It takes too long to develop a city up to the required levels. There is no definite objective; instead you have to achieve various set standards for your city before winning. While you focus on keeping your city safe from numerous barbarian hordes, you may inadvertently neglect the cultural facilities (e.g. theaters and stadiums) of your city. Once you achieve the required culture rating, you'll find out that your city isn't ""prospering"" enough. Each and every person living in your city has their own little complaints which they direct to you. These could range anywhere from disease, fire, floods, thirst, starvation, poverty, earthquakes, enemy attack, and building collapse to unemployment, riots, lack of workers, high taxation, lack of entertainment, and even the wrath of the Roman gods. Your city's houses always want something more, whether it be religious facilities, pottery, fruits, oil, or expensive imported wines. On top of all that, the emperor, Caesar himself, periodically asks for outrageously high amounts of a certain good; he can also order you to send all your soldiers away to defend other cities of the empire. If you don't fulfill his requests, he will be angry at you and send his legions to destroy your city. It takes so much time, frustration, and micro-management to win a single scenario that the gaming experience is simply not worth it.
If you are willing to spend hours upon hours trying to win a game that's simply too hard for most poeple to win, then I wish you good luck. You'll be needing it. But if you're like me and you have better and more useful things to do than listen to the greviances of people in an imaginary city, then I recommend NOT getting this game.",2.0

It can also be too complicated at times. For being such a recently developed game, the graphics did not live up to my expectations.
The reason I decided to give this game two stars was because of the game music: Rob Zombie, Cirrus, Cypress Hill, Skold, Ghoulspoon, and One Minute Silence.

"Early Castlevania games tended to be hit or miss affairs, and unfortunately this is . When I originally posted this review in 2003, I had made a concerted effort to create an honest review for the average player; I was (and still am) quite fond of the game. If I were to redo my rating scale, perhaps I'd score it slightly higher at three stars. All the same, I still feel that this game provides a low amount of fun given the intense challenge, and the rating is deserved given that overriding criteria.

Doesn't the classic GB logo give it away? This is not the fantastic GameBoy Advance title Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, nor is it Circle of the Moon or even Harmony of Dissonance.

What this is might well be described as one of the slowest sidescrollers ever made (and that's without slowdown affecting the game). Made in 1989, this is one of the first titles in Konami's Game Boy lineup and it shows. The level one music (Battle of the Holy) is excellent and a personal favorite, but the aural experience is unfortunately quite limited afterward. I personally like many of the background details (whenever they show up, that is) such as the trees and graves seen at the game's beginning. Much later on the ability to use exploding eyeballs as dynamite to open up a hidden area (no joke!) is a great concept well executed.

The whip Christopher uses in this game may be upgraded once for a chain whip, and once more for flinging fireballs...it's not quite an adequate replacement for the traditional Castlevania subweapons, but it does give you unlimited attacks at range.

Christopher's slowness in this title (and its sequel) makes Simon Belmont's hunched back and slow gait appear like a semi barrelling down the road, whereas Christopher is perhaps the man trying to push a tractor trailer down the road. Suffice to say that he's very slow - hyperbole aside, he seems to move at roughly half the speed of Simon.

The worst part of it would be the intensely difficult jumps found in large quantities. This is the textbook example of frustrating level design: Nearly every single jump must be done within an accuracy of a few pixels. While the most difficult jump in the game requires you time perfectly across two falling platforms-essentially three jumps-is thankfully optional (used to snag a 1-up extra life), since I can only manage it about once in twenty tries (an optimistic guess), the normal jumps are too close to this required accuracy for comfort. One long series of jumps has you going over about a dozen blocks in such a fashion; while there's solid ground below to fall down onto and the process of jumping may always be restarted it's easy to mess up here. A later and quite ugly level where you are chased by spikes for nearly the entire level (and one part consists of climbing upwards and jumping from rope to rope) has the same feel to it, as mistakes tend to get you killed quite often.

There's more. One level starts you off by bats which of course you can't hit right away because while a Castlevania Axe could take them all out, you have no axe, only your whip. Getting through this section unscathed is more a matter of luck than skill.

The end of the game, oddly enough, consists of the easiest Dracula fight since Castlevania 2 (where you could simply lay on the laurels for invincibility for the fight's duration). I won't give it away, but Dracula's second form is even more pathetic, in terms of an attack pattern, than the first (in either case, Dracula looks silly in this one). Given how hard this game is, though, it's probably not a bad thing to have some reprieve.

Are there any more problems? Oh yes, the killer: Getting hit downgrades your weapon one notch, so you essentially play the whole game with the basic short leather whip.

All that said, I do love this game, but it's not easily playable. It brings solid graphics to the GameBoy, but the gameplay...if it is solid, perhaps we would better say that you'll need a jackhammer to scratch the surface of this particular rock.

It gets the second star only because some people consider all terribly difficult games to be a challenge and they might enjoy it somewhat. As I noted, there are some nice points later in the game...unfortunately, just as with the previous year's (1988) Castlevania arcade game (Haunted Castle), most mortals will never see many of its neat details.

My recommendation is to pick up Castlevania 2: Belmont's Revenge instead. You have subweapons, less difficult jumps, a better soundtrack overall, and weapon downgrades have been checked significantly. Pick that one up if you're looking for classic GameBoy action!",2.0
"There are 5 levels in this game. On my first try I beat 4 levels. It is easy and short! You also can't save the game. If your, let's say, on level 4 and you lose all your lives.

"First, I would just like to point out like many others that I am an RPG veteran and have played these games for too long. That said, I usually am pretty apathetic and enjoy games regardless of crappyness or poor dialogue etc. This is because I immerse myself into the character(s) and find similarities between them and myself. So I would like to begin the review by saying that initially, the game was awesome just for the story b/c I too wanted such an adventure when I was a lad and was easily immersed.

One quick note- I won't discuss graphics or sound as I am not an expert on sound quality and don't really care and its a little late to be talking about the graphics.

So- Story

I rented the game and was like ""wow, it will be like a childhood adventure story."" Then after hours of game play and upon entering the second disc of play, I was crushed by the direction it had taken. No longer was it a perceivable child's adventure, but a tale of a grand scale. (What I mean by ""grand scale"" is that the characters went from an environment where they were insignificant travelers going on a quest to having this ridiculous amount of influence and effect over the entire planet). It just doesn't make sense that a single person could become so prominent so quickly etc etc or have the ability to do so especially when you look through a sociological lens. It's like if a random person running for President out of no where and winning. *spoiler* I understood why, but was saddened when Sue left the party, so that didn't help. *Spoiler over*. There is more to be said here, but ultimately it is where the story went that made me put the game down. (PS- if I put it down too soon or w/e u might think, I plan on finishing it a little later to see how it ends)

Game play-

But in keeping continuity of posting a review. The game play was terribly repetitive and unrewarding (or at least I didn't feel accomplished due to the ease of this game). Although I did some lvl grinding per se (spell increases), I feel a run through w/o lvling would still have been easy. Unfortunately after playing RPG's for so long, I like challenges such as those provided by Kingdom Hearts Proud or critical mode. (Btw, not cross comparing, just saying I like difficulty levels to be higher). However, I do see the merit in that this game was made before hard modes and hard core gamers etc etc. Basically, it was meant to not be difficult; so i will just say that veterans will be less likely to enjoy or feel rewarded by the game play.

Conclusion

This game cannot have today's standards applied to it, so it is difficult to say that it is good or bad, so I will just say who this game will be good and bad for. This game will definitely be amazing for new RPG fans. If you don't care about 100% completion, its a breeze to go through and most people will enjoy the story (I just have a problem with what I call the DBZ effect, where ppl become too OP/Over-Powered... uhhhhh its hard to explain). RPG veterans, will most likely find some flaw they don't like as they have come to a set of standards tailored to their favored types of games, such as the whole subs vs dubs deal, challenges, good graphics, etc etc. So it is my recommendation that if you are considering whether or not to purchase this, think about what you like about games and do a little research (as you are now) as to what you like about RPGs and see if this one has those elements. (Btw, if after this or other reviews you are really unsure about ""will I waste my time?"" just do what I do and read an online strategy guide and enjoy the story in significantly less time)",2.0
"I'm rather baffled by all the positive reviews for this game.  I bought it a couple months ago after reading all the good reviews and thinking this game must be a shining gem that has withstood the test of time.  Well, now I'm rethinking that assumption... No doubt many people will disagree with me, but on with the review!

Graphics (6/10): Sigh. Everything is pixelated. I'm not sure whether the graphics for this game were considered good when the game was released or not. On the bright side, the character designs are good as well as the towns.  The dungeons are another matter, but more on that later.

Music (6/10): I still can't figure out why people claim this game has a great soundtrack.  I've even heard people claim that Grandia's music is some of their most favorite of all time.  I wonder if Grandia is the only RPG they've ever played?  Anyway, the majority of the tracks weren't too bad. Unfortuneately, I remember some pretty bad ones.  There's one jungle where the ""music"" seems to only be ambient jungle wildlife sounds, which got annoying after the 50th bird call.  Unlike others, I found the Gumbo song to be one of the most annoying village themes ever.  It's okay right at first, but then starts to grate on your nerves the longer you stay in the village.  One more thing-the voice acting deserves mention.  It's bad.  I rank it as the worst voiceing I've ever heard in a game.  It sounds like they literally pulled people off the street and offered them $10 to read off some lines. Terrible.

Characters (7/10): The characters are interesting at first, until you realize that everyone's the same.  All possess the same plucky, happy-go-lucky adventurer personality.  I have nothing against light-hearted games, but everyone really did seem to have the exact same personality; there was just no balance to the party.  Speaking of party, there was a high rate of people joining and then permanently leaving, this (or something else?) really meant that no one really got any siginificant character development.  Most everyone had no back story of interest (or at all) and were not well developed.

Story (5/10): Here's where Grandia really starts to ""sag in the saddle"", so to speak.  The first 1/4 of the game and the last 1/4 are interesting and engaging.  I really enjoyed the start in Parm; rummaging through people's houses, reading Justin's diary for some amusing stories, and laughing at the way any alcoholic references were changed to ""coffee"".  Man, those were good times.  Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there.  The middle of the game becomes a neverending series of filler events.  The first couple ""villages in need"" or ""musty old ruins to explore"" didn't bother me at all, but after that, I started to feel like I was stuck on the wheel of karma or something.  It just got really repetitive, until I just knew the next village I came to would have to be saved by me from some disaster.  Well, what I refer to as the ""main"" story picked about the last quarter of the game, but it wasn't nearly original or interesting enough to make up for the huge amount of filler crap in the middle.  By then, only my sheer will power kept me playing to the end.

Battle System (8/10): Nothing really wrong with the battle system.  It's a variant of turn-based, with a small bar in the corner indicating who will go next.  While the bar does let you see when you're characters will go, I didn't really find it all that useful.  What keeps this section from a perfect score is the abilities-and how you level them up.  Using them over and over again strengthens your magic, but not how you'd expect. SPEED increases, not strength.  I found this very frustrating and pointless. The speed doesn't really increase enough to make much difference- and leveling spells takes forever.

Gameplay (4/10): Was the rotating camera really necessary? I've played games with rotating camera angles (like Xenogears) that worked just fine, but in this game it doesn't.  The problem lies in dungeon navigation. If the graphics had been better, or if there had been better dungeon design, perhaps navigation wouldn't be so confusing.  It's really hard to tell where you are because the dungeon design is so bland and repetitive; there are usually no landmarks with which to navigate, with the result that I actually wound up back at the entrance thinking it was the exit. On another note, something else that bothered me was the fact that even by the end of the game, you couldn't really return to much of anywhere you had been previously.  I kept expecting be able to return to Parm eventually, but no such luck.

*NOTE: This part's an extremely important part--the game is glitchy.  It would freeze randomly, forcing me to reset and start over.  The cds themselves were in good condition with almost no scratches of any kind, and I've heard this same complaint before, which leads me to believe the glitches are a flaw of the game design.  This is a huge turnoff--this added in extra frustration to an already boring game. This flaw knocks points off the score.

Overall (4/10): Note this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  I must say, given the flaws of this game, I'd never play it again. It's too bad really, it could've been a decent game if the makers had cut out the middle of the ""plot"" and fixed the glitches.  I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they absolutely have played every other good RPG out there and are just dying for something else to play.  Even then, it may be better to just replay an old favorite instead.",2.0
"When this game was released in 1993, the Ninja Turtles' popularity was declining so Konami took advantage of the fighting game market (that was booming thanks to the popularity of Street Fighter 2) I would have to thank that lame third movie for the declining popularity plus copycats like Biker Mice from Mars and Battletoads that were taking its place.

The Genesis version on the game proved to be the worst on many occassions.  Although it had the best storyline and graphics, it was too dark and difficult for kids plus the controls were sloppy, the game play was slow, the music score was awful, and the taunt button was a waste. Shredder was no where to be found in this game and the only connections to the 1987 cartoon series was Krang and the Technodrome.  The image was drawn closer to Mirage comics, especially when this game was suppose to be marketed for kids, but even teens and young adults can get fustrated and bored as well.  I wouldn't recommend this product if you are looking for a good fighting game.  This is not the worst fighting game, but it could have done better.",2.0

Everything is shown in a third person view (ie like Dune or something) and I don't think there is a way to change that.  the battles are boring and don't seem to require much strategy or thought.

"After all the Hype about this game I bought it...well in my opinion it just felt flat on its face. The game simply is not very intersting and the storyline can be plain boring.

The battles get boring extremely quickly since all you do is kinda point and tap the same guys over and over. The ""costumes"" and ""decals"" are kinda stupid. Many said this was the next EARTHBOUND, well is NOT and not even close. The Nintendo DS has so much potential and this game does not deliver in graphics, sound , game play and fun. don't get me wrong the game is not horrible by any means but defitnetly not that good either. check out some reviews out there before you buy it.",2.0
"ok i know this game has been out for a while but i just had to review it.i ran out and bought this game way back in 1995 and was so dissapointed with it.having bought the limited edition of maximum carnage the year before i thought that it would be better.it wasnt.it still played the same,but the magic that had been captured in mc was gone.i took it back the next day.being a big spidey fan a few years back i bought it again only this time to have it in my collection and not in my to play list.spdey fans  you may want to have this in your collection but if your a casual gamer that still has a genesis you may just want to skip this one.",2.0
"X-Men is a fun game... on ameatur difficulty level.  When I cranked it up to Hero (since you can't get any farther than the third level on ameatur), I found it almost impossible to do anything.  I got tired of playing the levels all over again, fighting the same, almost randomly apearing enemies coming from doors at any moment and surrounding me.  Although the game may have captured the feel of the X-Men, I didn't think they did a good job with the actual game aspect, which is probably the most important thing.  If you want to play a good Marvel game, try Marvel Super-heroes: war of the Gems.  It is much more balanced and fun than Sega's attempt at making an X-men game.",2.0

"This is about as good as a movie tie-in game.  It was released during the height of X-men fever, and was TERRIBLE.  The sound effects all sound like bowel movements- and I don't mean that as a clever way of writing poop.  I would just write poop.  I mean, have you ever had stomach pain, and there's a bunch of low moans rippling through your insides?  It's allot of that, and static.  Music is almost non existent.  But you say to yourself, ""It's the X-men!  I can be wolverine!  I can play with my friends!"" Co-OP is the worst part of this game!  Unless you and your friends mirror each others movements almost exactly you're going to be dropping each other into pits as the screen just pops them into life if you get too far away from each other.  Mutant powers ( the whole reason you're playing this game ) run out, and don't regen without a pickup.  Wolverine's claws, count as a power, so every second you have them out, you're wasting your power.  If only someone could have told mutants it was that easy to blend into society!  Just use up all your power in the morning, no one will ever find out.  It's stupid, and if you're buying this for nostalgia sake, I understand, but come ON.  This is about as frivolous and pointless a purchase as a black highlighter.  Do you really need this stinky thing on your shelf?  This sad plastic block of failure along side your statues and graphic novels, unlike this game- crafted by artists with passion and love.  Get part 2, it's at least a game.  Or better yet, buy more comic books!  Don't get this thing, you will regret it.  Do it for yourself, and for little me- in 1993, so excited to interact in one of his favorite fictional worlds.  Playing for hours and hours, trying to derive some form of entertainment from this punishment from sega, for not getting a SNES.  If you buy this UN-opened, I really hope you lose it in a fire.",2.0

"I know there's some of you who'd like to see this game get 1 star, but come on, it's not THAT bad. For example,the music, although not excellent throughout, is pretty good. My favorites are the Volcano, Boss, and Gale Mountain themes. The Boss theme is ESPECIALLY good,though, one of the best I've heard. I know that many of you complain, ""Oh, I don't like the random battles."" Well let me ask you this: Would you prefer 10 (TEN) MANDATORY battles on the world map before you can go on to the next area? I didn't think so. The dungeons and caves are a different story, though, as you can avoid most enemies (they appear onscreen)--unless you're going down a one-way tunnel. So the battles are a mixed bag, as you can see. Next, being a very early SNES title, the graphics and story are very bland--compared to later Squaresoft titles. Amazingly enough, I'm GLAD that Squaresoft made this game. Yes, GLAD. Why? Because when a system first comes out, companies aren't too sure what the full potential of that system is. Wouldn't it be dreadful if Squaresoft tried to put their BEST storyline, characters, music, gameplay, you name it, into this first game--only to realized that the SNES can't handle it, or that they could have done better later on? So I guess you could call this an EXPERIMENTAL Squaresoft game, just a way of sticking one's toe in the water. And before you start slapping your green numbers down in front of the cashier or reaching for the DOWNLOAD button, I suggest that you read other reviews--do a Google search or something--beforehand.",2.0
"It is an ok intro JRPG that holds the hand of anyone who wants to play it. However it is not worth the asking price. This game is worth $8 to $15 at best. The game is not all that rare or desired because even though it accomplished what the devs set out to do, it has been seen as an insult to western gamers. most of us in the gameing community don't really want it if we don't own it already.

"A cheapy, dumbed-down, 'beginner's' Final Fantasy, intended mainly for the 'less intelligent' U.S. audiences. No real customization possible in this game, as the unfolding of events is clear-cut & dry. The battle-action is similar to The Final Fantasy Legend series for GameBoy (which were actually re-labeled SaGa series games.) Still, lame as this game may actually be, it is a must-have for any serious FFfanatic-collector of FF paraphenilia! STiLL CHEAP..",2.0
"I should have gave it one star, but the system is ok to play! There is just no sound from the system! Thats why i have to rate this with two stars! I will never order a game system from them again! But i will still shop at amazon regardless! But this one is a rip off!

"This was, without a doubt the worst Final Fantasy game that I've ever played. Even Final Fantasy II had it's moments, but this game just annoyed me...
The same great music you remember is here, but everything else was left at the curb. Fuzzy-looking graphics, characters lacking any sort of personality or conviction, overly simplistic storyline, these are just afew words I would use to describe this game.
And it's not just that this game is lame in comparison to other Final Fantasy games! On the contrary, this was the first Final Fantasy game that I ever played, and if it weren't for the fact that I had already ordered Final Fantasy IV online, then this game would've stopped me from ever buying another one ever again.

The only thing that I actually liked about this game is that monsters showed visible damage once their health was decreased past it's half way point, wish they would've put that into other Final Fantasy games...
Other than that, this game should be avoided... You're better off spending your money on another Final Fantasy game. Whichever one you choose, it's sure to be better than this.",2.0
"This game is the worst final fantasy game I've ever had the misfortune to play. The bad graphics are only masked by the horrific gameplay & loss of convincing Heros, not to mention the absence of convincing story-lines that made the Final Fantasy series such a huge hit! The only fantasy that comes to mind when playing this game is the fantasy of killing yourself or throwing it out the window and praying to God for the souls of the people who put this game on the market. I warn all new-comers to the final fantasy world: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! If your looking for a good final fantasy game to start up with I recomend Final Fantasy I & II Dawn of Souls for the GameBoy Advance, or Final Fantasy Origins for the PSone.

"Some might say that to compare Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest to the rest of the series is unfair, since it was clearly aimed at a younger audience.  However, when you use a brand name to sell a product, the product had better live up to that name.  This game is not a Final Fantasy game, and only a complete FF completist should own it.  It takes under 10 hours to beat, and even a six year-old could probably beat it.  That's pretty much the point of it.  Final Fantasy II and III for the SNES are far, far better than this monstrosity, and they still remain my two favorite games of all time. Save your money and buy those instead.",2.0
"This is the black sheep of the Final Fantasy family.  It is barely mentioned in any discussion about Final Fantasy and there is a very good reason.  This is the worst game that I have played that actually bears the Final Fantasy name.  Simply put: this game is not good.  By the time this game was released, Squaresoft had give us a simplified version of Final Fantasy IV and called it Final Fantasy II.  FFII was more complex and had a deeper story than Mystic Quest.  The American audience had proven that we could handle more complex RPGs, but the next Final Fantasy we got was the children's game Mystic Quest.
I finished Mystic Quest the first time in about 8-9 hours (at most), and after that I could beat the game in less than 6 hours.  Had there been an actual story to the game, this would have been just a warm-up, but instead the game was complete.  Mystic Quest would have worked better as a side scrolling adventure RPG rather than a straight RPG.  As it stands, the game is closer in feel to Final Fantasy Adventure for the Gameboy than any Final Fantasy in the numbered series.  The story is simple: gather crystals and save the world (okay, FF I and IV had this story, too).  The gameplay was far too easy.  Most enemies would go down in one or two hits, and you can just fly through the game learning some spells and whacking enemies.
My description isn't quite doing justice to how dull the game is and how little fun it is to play.  Because of the weakness of this game, the only positive is that the game is so short.  If you must play it, go into it with no expectations.  If you want to play a good SNES RPG, try Final Fantasy II or III, or Chrono Trigger.  If you do play this game, remember to use the Cure spell on the final boss.  It makes life easier.",2.0
"Though any SNES game bearing the title ""Final Fantasy"" can now be called a collector's item, this is definitely the least sought after of the bunch. This is a hard game to appreciate having experienced parts 4 and 6, but for younger gamers, this is the perfect game. The story is strictly storybook-standard fodder, non-violent and pleasing to simple minds. The graphics and music are not even worth mentioning, as they cannot rightfully be called Final Fantasy material.
But considering the target market, it would be unfair to totally trash this game. If I had a son, I would get this game for him as an into into RPGs. The better installments could wait. I wouldn't  call this game the ""Worst RPG Of All Time"", since I have played much, much worse.",2.0

Plus, the digitised graphics, which were supposed to be 'groundbreaking' and make us all go 'ooohhh, ahhh' were just really rubbish. They were so blocky and resembled just a few big, chunky pixels vaguely in the shape of a human. I tired of it pretty quickly I'm afraid to say but a few months after I stopped playing it I went back after finding cheat codes in a magazine to restore the censored gore. But even that was dumb!

A gallon of blood splattered into the air every time you punched someone and it just looked so stupid that it had no edge. And then later on I got the cheats for the finishing moves and 'babalities' and 'animalities' or whatever such nonsense. But by that point they just took it too far and I never went back to it again. The sequels never took my interest either.

Not the best fighting game by far.

"Ever since SOR 3 came out in 1994 I wanted it. I never actually managed to get my hands on it until last year as it went for insane prices on auction sites and was very, VERY hard to come by in video game stores. Luckily for me I was given it as a present from someone clearing out their attic. I couldn't wait to get home and play it. All I could think about was loads of hours of solid beat-em-up action and a return of those ultra-cool tunes by Yuzo Koshiro that made the first two games so memorable.

As soon as I started to play I was shocked that Streets of Rage 3 is actually a really, really bad game that may be impressive in terms of graphics but in regards to music and gameplay is far, far behind even the first.

First of all the game is just too damn hard. And you need to play  it in hard mode otherwise you won't be able to get past level 5. And this time we're given a little bit more story and cut-scenes between the game levels. If you're playing the American or European release of this game I'd just skip these as they do not make sense and there are holes everywhere. The Japanese version (Bare Knuckle 3) has a different plot entirely and looks and feels like the REAL Streets of Rage 3.

In SOR 3 the story has Mr. X, in what limited capacity he now exists in, kidnap the Chief of Police and plant bombs all over city. He wants to replace high-ranking officials with evil robots. Or something! So, typically, the gang set about smashing the Syndicate AGAIN as their way of stopping him.

However, in Bare Knuckle 3 the opening cut-scenes with the nuclear explosion show the destruction of a city called 'Wood Oak' that was the first victim of a radioactive bomb powered by the newly discovered element 122, Laxine. The victims are given as an estimated 30,000 dead and 80,000 injured.

In a letter from Blaze to Axel she says that the Syndicate's laboratories seem to be involved in the research of Laxine and that a group in favor of a war with the country of Lima have captured the army general Petrov.

Mr. X tries to start a nuclear war by replacing the anti-war U.S. General with Shiva before a speech at the White House. In SOR 3 'City Hall' looks suspiciously like the White House so I'm led to believe that the level was just recycled and renamed.

In Bare Knuckle 3 you have to successfully prevent a devastating war by rescuing the general and the destruction in the city is just a slap in the face, while in SOR3 you basically have failed your task if you let the time run out (the General, now 'Chief of Police' is killed with poisonous gas). If you rescue the Chief in time you go straight to Mr. X's island lab, but if he dies you go to City Hall/White House.

Second, Yuzo Koshiro's music is HORRIBLE. What happened? The first 2 games had awesome music that showed what the meager Sega Genesis was capable of. The man was truly a pioneer when it came to composing stunning music for simple machines. In SOR 3 there are no cool tunes at all. It's all pathetic, tepid Industrial junk that would sound rancid coming from an Atari. A MAJOR let-down considering how amazing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streets-of-Rage-Two/dp/B00005ATJL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streets of Rage Two</a>&nbsp;was.

SOR 3 also has deleted characters that feature only in the Japanese version. Namely the character of 'Ash' who looks very, very homosexual and resembles Bennett from Commando or one of The Village People. I guess the PC Powers That Be thought the Western World couldn't handle such obvious gayness. The dialogue is also censored and 'naughty' words are replaced with 'clean' words. Character names are also radically and inexplicably different.

If you want this badly then the Japanese version is the ONLY way to go. Seriously, it's a complete disappointment otherwise. I'm not saying that the Japanese version is great, it's only slightly better.",2.0

"If you're interested in one of the only two console shadowrun games ever made,consider this; the only thing you'll be doin in the SNES version is scratching your head over what the heck the point of the game is, not only does it have its own completly different set of rules from the book version, but they don't make much sense, and after a certain point in the game (provided you can figure out how to get this far) the weapons, cyberware and magic you have access to (all at once) makes the game boringly easy.  So again, if you're looking to play the gritty, rough world of shadowrun, by the actual FASA rules, and with a great sense of the game world, turn to the Sega version. They've created a flexible game world with a viable and beliveble story-line, but the freedom to advance your character through other runs, explore different character types (Decker, Shaman, and Samurai), and spend more time having fun, than wondering why you can cast spells, cybered to the teeth, while firing an assualt cannon one handed.",2.0

"This game is one of those titles that you either love or hate, and while its more loved than hated, I'm going to say that I don't like this very much. Now, I know that multiple people have wrote the same type of review here, but this game frustrated me so much that I felt that I needed to chime in as well, along with the two others who wrote a similar review to mine.

On one note, I actually loved the color and diverse environments in this game, but there are two major flaws. The menu is extremely excruciatingly difficult to navigate through, you have to keep pressing X and Y all over again to find what you need, and the battle system is simply unforgiving. You have to wait for your attack to charge and sometimes you don't have time to wait for your attack to charge, and you end up getting gang beaten by all the monsters around you because your sword does not even hit the monster half the time, (yes you heard me right!!) half the time!!! That is unacceptable especially for an action RPG.

For a turn-based RPG I may understand, but even on turn-based RPGs enemy evades rarely happen, and only happen when the character has an agility lowering spell cast on, but no in Secret of Mana, you have to miss the enemy more than 50% of the time trying to hit it and it really aggravates me!! There is one more thing about this game that is an absolute deal-breaker. When you try to exit a room, you have to forcefully gather your characters by either hitting select, or going back towards them, but what if an enemy is still in the way, well you character meets the reaper!! This is the epitome of poor game design, I absolutely cannot fathom that this game has even passed testing, let alone getting the Nintendo Seal of Quality back in its release in 1993, and being re-released on Virtual Console without the AI problems addressed! Thank goodness I only wasted $8 on this game, and not $60 on a SNES cart. Please play Breath of Fire II, or Chrono Trigger instead, or if you really want an action RPG, you can play Illusion of Gaia or Zelda: Link to the Past; you will thank me later!!",2.0
"Before the expletives start flying, please read the review! I need help with this game. And I really wish you didn't have to give stars before reviewing a game.

 First off, let me say, I really want to like this game. The graphics, music, and characters are fantastic. There is no doubt that it's a fun game, but I just don't understand the 5 star ratings and hype. And I love action/rpgs, I've played a lot of them. (Zelda, the Gaia series, Metroid, etc.)

 I'm only 3 hours in and I have no real interest in continuing the game. I think the difficulty is what really holds this game back. There are a lot of cheap aspects about this game.

 This is one of the most flawed battle systems I've ever seen in an action/rpg. That's where the difficulty (and frustration) comes into play, in my opinion. The two supporting characters are a joke and they don't help or even attack 75% of the time. I've read walkthroughs that say ""just switch characters after every attack,"" but if that's the case, I definitely won't keep playing. That's absolutely horrible designing. And that wouldn't be fun at all, it would just be monotonous.

 The ""waiting for your attack to charge up"" aspect is awful as well, especially with how relentless the enemies are. I understand why they did it, they want to discourage button-mashing.

 The two supporting characters also die after 3 or 4 attacks. They leveled up quick at first but now it takes way too long to gain even a level. It feels like an action/rpg version of Dragon Warrior at this point. Attack a few enemies, go back and revive your characters every 5 minutes, rinse and repeat.

 Maybe I'm just a frittata and don't know how to play the game? If that's the case, and you read this review, please tell me what I'm doing wrong! And more importantly than that, tell me what it is that I'm missing.",2.0
"Sunset Riders is just like any of the TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtls) games except this one has cowboys and it's set in the old wild wild west.
You play as 4 different sherriffs (Bob, Billy, Steve? and Cormano) and your objective is to take down the most evil and dangerous men in the wild wild west.
O.k. this is what makes this game stupid, the enemy to hero ratio is completely off. There are always a lot more enemies than heroes on the screen for the most part and that makes this easy game a little confusing and a little too challenging seeing as how if you get hit like once or twice, you die and when a screen full of bad guys shoots 8 bullets in all different directions, it's kind of hard to didge.

"Krusty's Fun House is a reverse Lemmings. Instead of saving the rats, you kill them to rid your Fun House of all these nasty rats.
Honestly, I didn't like this one because it wasn't as gradual as Lemmings or even progressive at that. What I noticed when I played this game is that the first few boards are real easy and then suddenly, it shifts to brutally hard! Not cool. That and after you get past maybe one or two real hard boards, it goes back to being way too easy.
Krusty's Fun House is a sleeper. It got real boring real quick. Plus when it all came down to it, it was the same board over or and over again with just a few shifts of obstacles and a background change, but still it was the same level.
I think Lemmings would be a better buy because it's more challenging and a lot funnier.",2.0

This game looks terrible in comparison with the Genesis version,

The snes version is so much harder, you die in about 4 or 5 shots, period. In the genesis version you have continues and more bonus games. One downfall is that you can only choose between two characters on the gens version, but i think that they are the best characters of the four.

"The levels are vastly empty.  It makes you wonder why they added so much space in each level - It is just boring and makes you feel like the developers didn't care.  I laughed at the empty rooms, poor programing, monotonous music , boses which can be tricked into infinite loops and crapalicous sound effects (why not reuse the originals?)

X was an enjoyable game, I often go back to it.  X2 felt like a B Team game but I still loved it because it still felt polished.  With X3 it feels like Capcom didn't care; it feels like they put the C Team on this project.

To sum up the complaints:

-Big empty levels (not interesting or fun.)

-They didn't test the boses enough (cheap infinite loops.)

-Some graphics they borrowed from the last games didn't mesh with the new stuff they put in.

-Poor enemy design.  Why would Sigma design such cumbersome and stupid looking robots?

-Many upgrades are very easy to find.

-The sound effects sound like hilariously bad spoofs.  They should have reused the original effects for the death sound and the ""charged up"" sound, especially.

"Really disappointed with the quality of this controller. While it is an original controller, I payed extra for a supposedly ""Very Good"" condition controller. What I received was in no way very good condition. Extremely grimy, dirt and junk under every button. Upon opening the controller to clean the monstrosity, fur and hair were spilling out of it. I expect better for ""Very Good"" condition, if I wanted a controller in fair condition I would have bought a cheaper one labeled as such. In addition, there are 2 big scuffs on the back. It works fine, this is true but in summary, it was not in ""Very Good"" condition, fair/average at best.",2.0
"It works but not what was pictured. I got a ""Super 16Bit"" controller and the cord was a lot shorter than the authentic Super Nintendo controller that came with the Super Nintendo I purchased through the same seller.

I can use the other controller but I thought I should mention it was different than what I was led to believe I bought, as the picture showed Super Nintendo on the controller. :-\",2.0

"I usually love to go to thrift stores and find cheap games that I then take home and have a ton of fun with.  My experience with Barts Nightmare was short but definitely not sweet.  I found this game for a low price and I am still very unsatisfied this is a terrible game for a few reasons.  First off the controls are terrible not only in the mini games but also in the main game itself.  Its very lame and linear and even if you attempt to give it a chance the unfinished and horrible feel of everything the game has to offer is just too much to put up with,  I will probably never play it again I have way to many better games to waste time on this one.  Too bad I was looking forward to a good Simpson game to kill some time.  Also I was saddened by the fact this was sitting as reviewed as a four star game I don't know how that happened but hopefully this will save some others from wasting any money.",2.0
"Bart's Nightmare is a REAL nightmare.  The game stinks, plain and simple.  It shouldn't come as a surprise because back when the Simpsons were a brand new show NOTHING but crappy Simpson games were being released for the Genesis, Super NES, and regular NES.

"When I first got the cable it worked perfectly fine like any other cable. But the material is crap.

"The buttons feel like new again, i was still using the original ones from when i first got the snes in '95 but the start button wore out, the only issue i had with these was that the cord is at least a foot shorter than the originals which i didn't like because old school game consoles all had longer cords than the new ones.",2.0

I think if you want to spend less than 20 dollars, get Spyro Three...it is really, really funny and much easier to follow. I find this Ripto game is sort of a beta version of the much more enjoyable Spyro 3.",2.0

"This game is based on a futuristic game show, where rather than answering questions, contestants must enter an arena armed with a gun and face off against millions of club swinging minions, tanks, mutants and snakes, collecting cash, prizes (toasters, cars, VCRs), power-ups (orbs that shoot, force fields, razorblades that rotate), better weapons (grenades, spread lasers, rockets) and extra lives. You start in a television studio and must work your way through several rooms until you find the boss of the level. You can't just run from room to room either, you must defeat every single enemy that comes pouring into the room to shoot you, stab you, bite you, kill you, club you and run you over. There are literally 1000s of enemies per room making this game is probably one of the most impossible games ever! Before you get excited about this game, you view an overhead perspective of the room you are in, rather than a 1st person perspective. A nice feature of this game is with the SNES is that you use the buttons to shoot north (X), west (Y), south (B) and east (A) while your player runs in a different direction than you are shooting. This is also a very nice two player simultaneous game, for either competing against friends or teaming up with them. If you love intensity, impossible odds, shooting through never ending waves of enemies this is a great game! Thankfully the game came to SNES, people could have put $100 of quarters into the arcade game!",2.0

As soon as you touch it you can feel how cheap the plastic this is made with is, it does have the proper shape and everything, but lacks the nintendo logo.

"I got this game expecting a lot.  I was very disappointed.  But first the good.  The game is innovative, being a departure from the standard RPG by Squaresoft.  The battle system was a good attempt, but didn't work too  well.  The cinematic features of the game were not disappointing.  The cut  scenes were wonderful and the overall graphics were pretty good.  The  storyline was interesting as well.
Unfortunately, that did not make up  for the confusing nature of the game.  The weapon modification system did  not work well, and as I said before, the battle system did not end up being  as good as it could have been.  The gameplay was not immensely fun  either.
Call it my opinion, but I did not enjoy this game at all and  couldn't wait to trade it in.",2.0

"To anyone who is trying to play this game today, I just want to say that I played this under optimal conditions (Christmas break, 1998) at the height of my PS1 gaming power...and this game was extremely, extraordinarly mediocre. I know that a lot of people are falling over themselves to play the sequel, but you have to ask yourself, if a sausage factory like Square has waited over 10 years to make a sequel to one of their most (at the time) expensive franchises...was it really all that great?
The game had a few good perks to it (customizable weapons, beautiful CG cutscenes, a pretty unique storyline for an RPG at the time), but if you play it without the rose colored glasses of nostalgia and collectibility, you will find an utterly mediocre gaming experience. I beat the game from start to finish, and at the end of it I could only say ""I spent 30 hours of my life on this?!?""
I gave it 2 stars mostly because it was a risk on Square's part to break away from the successful Final Fantasy/sci-fi settings, which is commendable in itself, and I had approximately 2-3 hours of enjoyment out of it, but if you're seriously looking to spend $180 on this game, it's not worth it!",2.0
"I bought this game because we play it all the time at our friends, it's the ultmate party game.  You can have two couples playing, and change the difficulty level for each player.  So everyone has a fair chance.  We play it for hours on end.  I bought this since it had Tetris inlcuded.

"The first SaGa Frontier was absolutely incredible, so I bought this game... without hesitation. I would have been better off buying Soda Caps and root beer. I'm serious.

The story, while better than the first game, is like reading an encyclopedia. Everything that made SaGa Frontier 1 so great has been removed or replaced.
Two stars for the graphics and the concept.",2.0
"Okay, so the graphics were really neat. Other than that, this game was barely worthwhile. I like corny storylines, but this one was way too corny.

You also have to comb the same scenes over and over again to make  sure you picked up all of the invisible weapon upgrades. But it wasn't  challenging at all. Just redundant redundant. The background sounds were  annoying and the dialouge was silly.  I don't know why I bothered to beat  this game. Now that I have, I don't have any reason to beat it again.

"Now when I first played this game, I loved it!  But after awhile of playing I came to this one boss that I have spent a month on and havn't been able to beat!  And it's not cause I'm not good at fighting, it's because whenever he hurt's you, his life bar refuals to whatever amount he hurt you for TIMES TWO!!!  So if he takes away 22 health points from you, then he will gain 44 health points from you!!!  What!?!  And because I can't get any more health than 96 it makes it so I'm at a MAJOR dissadvantage!  And for the record 7/10 that I attack him I miss, even with the special attacks (Every one knows that special attacks shouldn't miss.  Other wise that makes it a regular move that just costs something more than a special attack!)!?!  Now that's unfair.  Now I'm not saying the game is bad because I was really enjoying this game up to this point!  But now I feel forced to buy a hint book or I may never beat this guy.  Shame on the creators for making such an unfair boss!  I feel like I was robbed of my money for this game.",2.0

This must be better as a PC game. Now I see why it was so cheap. The controls and maneuvering are so ridiculously difficult to learn and master. And the game has no tutorial or any way to learn what all the little squares and whatnot mean.

Yeah the title is right. This is Power Baseball. I nearly see 2 HRs a game at least. I like playing games that are real. Baseball is a lot different  than this game. It is no fun at all. I wish I can see a game that actually  has realistic baseball. You know the one that you don't score all of your  runs off of homeruns. In this game there hardly is a Pitching rotation.  Your Pitcher can basicaly pitch every 2 games. So do not buy this game.,2.0
"This game is horrible. The only thing I liked about it is the realism of  the planning mode. For those of you that don't know, in this game you must  plan your missions, everything including who you bring along with you, what  weapons they carry, what type of body armor they wear, etc.
Everything is  realistic which helped me alot with writing my book. But other than that it  isn't worth buying.
It is very hard to control the players. You are given  the first person perspective. It is hard to tell what direction you're  facing and where your enemies are with this type of view. It also makes you  dizzy when you look around because the entire screen is moving.
But the  thing I hate most is the way they made it for one player. Since you bring  three people with you on your missions it only makes sence that each member  be controled by a real person. Instead you must control what all three  people do at the same time. As well, you must control what hostages do  too.
And speaking of hostages, when you find them they can be really  annoying because they follow close behind you, making it difficult to turn  around and go back the other way if you accidentally take the wrong  path.
I recommend you buy this game for computer but not the Play  Station.

"Unimaginative, and not even good in comparison to other ""kart"" games.
The game is highly focused on picking up magic crystals on the track and using them against opponents -- for example, getting three  ""fire"" crystals hits *all* opponents with an unavoidable fire  attack.
And, frankly, what fun is that?  You race well enough to take the  lead, only to get hit with a cheap shot?  There's certainly no place for  such anti-rewards in a game aimed at anyone over the age of five, and those  younger won't be able to handle the twisty tracks anyways.
Breeding and  raising Chocobos in ""Final Fantasy VII"" was fun.  Racing them  around in mario-karts most certainly is not.",2.0

"For many people, life doesn't always turn out the way they want it to. Some aspire to being a world class Olympian and end up running the fry cooker at McDonald's.

And then you have Tetsuya Takahashi, the creator of Xenogears, who I imagine aspired to be either a director or a writer, but alas he sadly found himself in the position of video game designer, a truly loathsome job considering how dreadfully DULL video games are. Luckily, he was able to do away with everything that most respectable video games require, and simply use the two discs to ram home his bloated story to the player over the course of 100 grueling hours of text, text, text and then more text.

Oh, and sometimes there is game play (combat, exploration) which is terribly one-dimensional and lacks any sort of strategy whatsoever, but hey, that's not what we play video games for! We play for the PLOT. Because we're SMARTER than the average meat-head gamer who can't understand our refined tastes and probably just plays MW or Halo all day because they dropped out of high school! So there!

Look, people, there are millions of incredible stories awaiting you out there, and incredibly, they're no further than your local library, where you can get piles of well-told stories all for FREE. That's right, FREE. Amazing isn't it? And you don't even have to deal with boss battles, exploration, or any of that nonsense, the entire story is given to you in a direct and straight forward manner. It's pretty neat.

Just think, in the time it took you to conquer Xenogears, you could have read two or three truly great works of literature.

If you couldn't tell by now, this is the problem with Xenogears. While the story is pretty good, it's not THAT good, and I have to question whether those who heap praise upon it's narrative have consumed anything but video game stories throughout their entire life.

But I'm starting to ramble, and this is after all a 10 year old game. So I'll just leave you with these simple lines, perhaps as a counter-point to Xenogears monstrous plot.

"From what people make this game out to be, it was supposed to be the ""best game of all time"" perhaps, but I saw it completely different. I dunno if it is just me, but I found this games storyline incredibly boring, the battle system was OK in some areas, and the music was absolutely dreadful. Let me break it down for you....
Music: 1/5...
Why? Because it repeats the same tunes over...and over...and OVER AGAIN. The reason I gave it one star, is because when you first hear the music it sounds good, but after hearing it in so many areas throughout the game, its tedious and very annoying. And when it comes down to it I wasn't very satisfied with the music to begin with. Like for example, most of the areas in the game will play the same exact music, so it gets very repetitive.
Storyline: 2/5
I found the storyline pretty horrific as far as being interesting and captivating. Not once in the game did I really care about the characters or what was really going on. And there is so much talking in this game I could probably fall asleep after drinking 10 glasses of cafe mocha...To be blunt...there is way too much talking...and the story isn't explained till the end. So throughout the whole game you are confused about what the heck is going on.
Entertainment- 3/5
Why am i giving it a decent score for entertainment? Well there are a lot of interesting mini games here and playing in the xenogears mixed with humans is also interesting.
Playability- 4/5
This is probably the only good part about this game. You can actually jump around here (unlike most RPGs) and there is plenty to explore in your environment. This sometimes makes traveling through long boring dungeons...not so dull.
Graphics- 3.5/5
The graphics are alright, not good enough to give four stars, but pretty good for when it came out. I am a sucker for 3d playstation one style graphics...kinda the old-school style that playstation RPGs used to have. If you are looking for final fantasy 8 graphics....you won't find them here.
Overall- 2.5/5
If you have a lot of time on your hands...or like playing games for extended periods of time...this is for you.
I however, do not enjoy playing games for 80 hours just to see the ending. Yes thats right...80 + hours just to finish it off, not including finishing everything such as side quests...just the storyline. How someone can sit through 80 hours of jabbering and a boring storyline...and let's not forget annoying music...I have no idea. I hope some day I will understand why this game is considered to be so great...but I don't think it will happen.
Do i recommend this? Nope.",2.0

"I wanted to like this game...
I really wanted to like this game...
This game had all the things that would hook me in. It had some neat visuals, a tight combo-based battle system, some cool mechs, and some anime cut scenes.
When I first started to play this game, I was enjoying it. Sure, the dialogue was corny, but because it was fun and challenging to play, I didn't mind it one bit...
UNTIL...IT HAPPENED...
You know, this game has led me to believe that former legendary comic writer Chris Claremont must be in charge of Squaresoft. (For the uninformed, he was the writer who gave us many classic X-Men stories...like ""Days of Future Past"" and ""The Pheonix Saga"". These were the kind of stories that all comics would be judged.) If you check out any of the comics he's writen over the past 10 years, you'll face many problems...like OVERWORDY MONOTONOUS AND CHEEZY DIALOGUE, TOO MANY LEFT-FIELD PLOT TWISTS THAT CONFUSE PEOPLE, AND TOO MANY CHARACTERS. This game suffers some of the same ailments. The moment you find out about Fei's multiple personality problem, you will find yourself using the attack button a lot. Not because you're going to be in a lot of fights, but because YOU ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF ALL THE MONOTONOUS TEXT THAT FILLS YOUR SCREEN! In fact, it gets even worse the moment you get to disk 2! The moment you get to disk 2, you better started taking some NO-DOZ pills because you will be treated to a 10 minute cutscene with even more monotonous text to skip through! It has gotten so tedious that even the things I liked about the game are no longer enough to get me to complete it.
I hope that someday, Squaresoft realizes that confusing plot twists and overwordy, monotonous text do not a compelling story make. It is their refusal to learn that very lesson that keeps them from having a RPG with the charm of the SNES RPGs. It also kept me from enjoying this game.

If you give him less than 600 watts as a gift, it ungratefully yawns at you and you have to carry it around all day to get that many watts. Then if your child doesn't wear this toy or carry it or pay attention to it long enough, it will label you a ""Meanie"" and frown at you until you play with it half the day again.
  This was a waste of money.",2.0
"I loved the Sim Theme Park game on PC, and when my brother got a PS1 for his birthday I went right out and bought the Sim Theme Park for Playstation1. Well, I was dissapointed. The graphics have been reduced greatly. It is also difficult to create a park (in my opinion), and the it takes a while for our version to load. However, there may be a scratch or so on it, since I did get it used (I am cheap lol). However, most Playstation 1 games have lower graphics so, it isn't that bad. But honestly, I like the PC version much better than the PS1 version.
Pros:
1) Fun creating your own theme park
2) The great PC game comes to PS1!
Cons:
1) PC version better
2) Low graphics
3) Controls are difficult",2.0

"While you do get 30 Activision games in this compilation, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it would be on a regular atari 2600. It is much more choppy with a slower frame rate. I also find colors to be way off sometimes, and in some games ( such as Pitfall ) you can die in ways you won't normally be able to in the version on the actual Atari.

I suggest you don't buy the game. Get an actual Atari 2600 instead.",2.0
"I have actually bought this game twice. A few years ago I bought a copy of it mainly so I can play River Raid. I was a big fan of this game when it first came out in the 1980's if I remember right. To get to the problem, the game goes into a pause mode at irregular intervals as you play. You just un-pause it and begin to play again but you never know when it is going to happen. Every so often my wife and I like to play some old games but we sort of stopped playing this one because of the problem. I figured the problem may be with the disc itself and decided to buy another. I could only find a copy exactly like the original and bought it. This disc also has the same problem with the pause issue. It only seems to effect certain games. Also, some of the sound in these games to me is not true to the originals.",2.0
"A bug's life the game is based on the movie, A Bug's Life. I personally felt the game to be a bit of a let down. The game doesn't allow you to save unless you buy an additional saving cartridge.

Younger children may not understand the purpose of the levels and may get sick of the game very quickly.",2.0

Sure, it looked different, but it had lots of really cool additions. Now, a week has passed, and I must say that this game kinda sucks. It lacks the primary  component that Civ II has. PLAYABILITY. It's so freaking slow as far as  game play goes, and the battle scences are simply horrid. Civ was like a  nice little chess game on the nth scale. This is Might & Magic with  four billion rules. There's a difference. Wait for Alpha Centauri. Sid  Meyer actually had a part in that.",2.0

"A game where you play as a trainer and command Pokmon to fight other trainers, sounds awesome right? Pokmon Stadium is possibly one of the worst Nintendo games I have ever played. Now, when I was a kid it was really fun to do the free for all mode and chose the best Pokmon the game had to offer, but after you played that a few times it was time to shut off the Nintendo and plug in another game. There is no main story to keep you involved, its only tournaments after tournaments. In retrospect, the idea of a Pokmon battle game sounds amazing, but if you thought it was going to be anything like the hit Pokmon games on the Gameboy your surely mistaken. The one thing this game had going for itself was its stunning graphics. Pokmon Stadium used the Nintendo 64 to its full use on detail in this game, but the soundboard on the game can get slightly tedious and annoying. With an announcer restating every move you just made over the loudspeaker, it makes you want to play the game with the sounds off, and if your going to play it with the sound off you might as well not play it at all.
 Overall I give this game a 2 out of 5. It has great graphics, but the game couldn't seem to pinpoint the certain aspects of a Pokmon game that its players love; the story and the adventure side.",2.0
"I may not be a Pokemon fan anymore, but I LOVED the series when I was a lot younger (Fun Fact: A Jirachi card was what motivated me to ride my bike). Actually, I'd probably go play Pokemon Sapphire again if I were to come back to Pokemon fandom. Now, let me tell you: I'm not one to troll Nintendo. I'm a HUGE Nintendo fanboy, just so you know (See lots of my other reviews for proof).

But then when you look at Pokemon Stadium, you'd probably think: ""OMG POKEMON ON NINTENDO 64!!!"" It would be one of the best Nintendo games ever, considering how awesome the series was on Game Boy, right? WRONG.

Pokemon Stadium isn't what you'd expect to be the next big entry in the franchise. Rather than it being an RPG, the series's turn-based battles replace it all! It's all about fighting your Pokemon. Nothing else. In turned-based battles. How the heck is that supposed to work? It's not. If it's an RPG with that stuff, then we'd be all over it. You CAN'T have the turn-based battles make up a whole game by itself.

Okay, maybe it actually isn't ALL about the turn-based battles. There are minigames, and some of them can be rather interesting. But they only remind you that this should have been an RPG. We had to wait for Pokemon Colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed. This should be left alone, as one of Nintendo's few pieces of crap. At least the graphics were amazing for the N64.",2.0
"This is a homage to Japanese console type RPG games. Its sharper than FF8, but its use of ingame cutscenes from the Quake2 engine can be lacking. It is heavily story driven and I found myself just fast clicking through scores of irrelevent dialogue. Every npc can be spoken to, but they all have just 2 or 3 useless lines, repeated forever. This is the glassy depth of Anachronox. Buildings you cant enter, static npcs stand around all day, linear path across 'worlds' that are nothing more than large unreal map. There is no expansive city feeling when your enclosed in a quake map like this. All the traffic in some places are cool to watch for about 20 seconds.
You are shuffled down these maps, albeit gorgeous ones, and enter a separate battle screen when you meet enemies.  Enemies who stand in same place, even regenerating later after you wiped them out before. Even with addition of Mystech which is like simple magic attacks, it mostly boils down to clicking the same actions over and over when the timer is ready. Boring to say the least. Thankfully, there isn't too much combat. This leads to another problem.
With no fighting or heavy strategic planning goin on, you are following a complex adventure story. Its complex, but not good and you will probably give up before it really starts. It could make you laugh, it made me laugh with its awful minigames, arcades sequences, puzzles, and boring text. Its too mature of content for children, and too basic and repetitive for veteran pc gamers. I highly recommended avoiding this overrated flop. Not everyone thinks its the cat's meow.",2.0

"EA has always made great sports games.  Lately it seems as if they are coasting on their previous successes.  For one thing this game is prone to freezing when the computer makes a dumb error.  Like a pickoff that flies off into the outfield.  The ball gets lost and you have to reset the whole console.  Not fun if you are playing in season mode and are in the 9th inning.  The graphics are great until you see Dreamcast's version which makes triple play baseball look like puke on your TV set.  The crowd is always annoying, they jeer even whether you're 20 points ahead or behind.  As usual the announcers are annoying and don't really call the game (when are we going to have smart announcers?!)  Also there is a lot of saving going on here.  And I mean a lot.  You need 7 blocks in memory just for the season.  When you make it into the playoffs you need another 7 blocks.  There are some winning points, the homerun derby is fun, especially using players like Ruth, Eddie Murray, and Reggie Jackson.  And in extreme mode you not only have to hit home runs but hit targets as well.  The opening sequence is great.  And the prevailing song is the Magic Carpet Ride RMX... (they probably drained all their production costs into the soundtrack).",2.0
"The game sounds fun and very innovative, but it is very addicting. My 23 year old daughter has it and it causes many family fights. Her stupid ex-boyfriend bought it for her and it uses up too much of her valuable time. She is a senior at a major university and I think she is studying, but I check her laptop and the game is playing. She's really mean and cranky when she wakes up at noon and I suspect it's because she played it for most of the night. I hate this game. People need real lifes- not fantasy computer, simulated ones. Buy it for your kids at your own risk.",2.0
"This game was merely average (at best). It was only good enough to keep me playing--which is not very good, giving the current game famine. The juncture system and the magic system needlessly waste hours of time. Everytime you get new magic, find a new GF or change characters--which happens FREQUENTLY throughout the game (magic is obtained by drawing it from monsters or from draw points) you have to stop for a few hours and reorganize. Furthermore, using the juncture system, you you can only obtain 100 units of magic. You don't want to use this magic on enemies because it is ""junctured"" to your status (strength, vitality, elemental, etc.) and using it will weaken you. Also, there is less reward for fighting monsters (you don't attain magic from leveing up) and you don't attain money from fighting (instead you basically recieve a pay check every so often--$ is depedent on your seed rank--which you can obtain by taking tests).  Even if you did recieve money from fighting, you can't buy anything interesting, (i.e. armor, weapons)only items (tents, potions, etc). I miss the elements that play off good ole' american materialism--damn red japanese (kidding). Anyways, the story was average, characters were average. Don't bother unless you are really bored.",2.0

"Though considered a classic by many, FF8 raises the question ""Is it really worth it?"" The first good RPG I played was FF7. After playing FF7 I went on to purchase FF5,6,8,and 9. A great disappointment was my purchase of FF8. The game was lacking in its fantasy like elements. The opening to the game was very impressive and caught my attention immediately. The games graffics were mediocore and the battle system was missing great features from the first game. They replaced them with the junction system which drew all the fun out of the game. Overall if you look beyond its flaws, weak story line, and pointless plot ideas and misselaneous missions ypu have a, well bad game.",2.0
"Final Fantasy VIII was ok. It had great movie scenes, but an AWFUL battle system. It takes at least 20 minutes to complete a battle and thats just for one bad guy!

"If you like to spend hours equipping magic, Guardian Forces, and with that Junctioning System... this is your game.
The dependency on Guardian Forces is annoying.  I'll admit they have stunning graphics but it doesn't  make up for the fact that you always have to use them and there is no  option to skip the long animation sequences; they are well done, as I said,  but it becomes repetitive after watching Shiva coat everything in ice for  the 2,348th time!
Another down-side is the high-res characters on the  low-res, PSX backgrounds. It is superb watching Squall preform a limit  break on a truly magnificent looking foe... but wait! There's a pixel the  size of Texas blocking his way!  Wait... that's supposed to be a  rock.
The FMV's are fluid and life-like with special attention to detail  such as the reflections on the dance floor. Anim style hair and faces give  it that Final Fantasy touch that we know and love.
The Storyline, though  linear, is deep and involving as all Final Fantasies are.
All in all, it  is a game just barely fit to hold the Final Fantasy title. But, of course,  that's only my opinion.",2.0
"Without the technical problems present in the PC version this game is probably an average 3 star game at best. Before I anger the loyal fan base I'll explain the problems with the PC version. The most glaring problem  with the PC version is the midi music. There is nothing like listening to  the shrieking, butchered, Balamb Garden theme, at 425 rms watts + 120 rms  powered sub in pro logic on a home stereo system.(Yamaha RXV-795a) The  music on the PC version is almost unbearable. I have a Soundblaster Live  Sound Card and I'm sure that wasn't the problem. Using Microsoft  Synthesizer is a terrible mistake in this day of wavetable synthesis,  soundfount midi and xg midi.(Using midi at all is baffling. CDs have been  around since 1985 and DVDs with space for the extra audio and data have  been around since 1997) That is unexcusable and that was only the start of  my trouble with the PC version. The graphics might have been acceptable,  especially those sweet cut scenes but the FF8 graphics engine would not  cooperate with my 3d Prophet SDR GeForce 256 based graphics card. The  horizontal lines across the screen made playing with any kind of hardware  acceleration impossible. Software mode is a slide show on my 650 mhz  Athlon. I must say that the sound effects were fantastic though. So  technically you have a game with great looking movies, great sound effects,  horrible midi music, and a GeForce specific horizontal line defect. Even  without the horizontal lines the backgrounds are 320*240 stretched to  640*480 resulting in a less than pleasing grains. As in Final Fantasy 7 the  graphics were not re-rendered and the result is resolution locked in at  640*480. This game technically is worse than the playstation version in  both graphics and sound. It boils down to whole bunch of money for a  boatload of trouble.(Incuding the cost of a PC plus the cost of the game)  The game itself is mired with tons of gameplay flaws. Like FF7 this sequel  has emotion but what you have to do to get to the point when you get to  actually experience that can be at times tedious. The weapons are too weak  and the Guardian Forces are too powerful. I found myself entirely giving up  on weapons and using Guardian Forces constantly. In a game in which you try  to evoke human emotions through human interaction why are you making the  players resort to using non-human entities over and over and over and over  again. Square Soft wrote a story and left out the game. I am a big  proponent of have a great and entertaining story in a video game but the  gameplay has to be at least bearable. It's not interesting to watch the  same animation for literally hours. I only made it to disk two and stopped  playing the playstation version.(In hopes the PC version would be improved  in some way) I returned the PC version to whence it came from after an  attempt to solve the GeForce defect. This game is Playstation Passable with  some patience but is PC Pathetic. Don't even bother buying it. Wait for  Final Fantasy 9 or the feature film due out in 2001. Square seems to be  good at the video. Their games show that.(Perhaps, to a fault)",2.0

The music is below par (except for the  chocobo song)and often gets anoying durring play.

"If you're an experienced gamer, this review is not for you. But, if you're looking for advice on games to purchase for your children, keep reading. First, my advice: don't buy this game. Hudson Gaming has really laid a stinker here (they should learn what user acceptability testing is). Here's why. The reading level is too complex for children under 15, causing them to rely on an adult for translation. Second, the timing is off in many of the games. For example, when the word ""start"" appears, the game doesn't actually ""start"" for another second or two. This does nothing but cause frustration. Third, the game instructions are very unclear for at least 12 of the minigames, and for the game setup. For example, you get to set the ""virtual"" players' (players operated by the computer when less that 4 players are playing) difficulty, but your choices are ""easy"", ""normal"", and ""hard."" But what does that mean? Hard for the ""virtual"" player to win? Or, ""hard"" for the virtual player to lose? Or, ""hard"" to beat this player? Doesn't matter anyway, because there is no discernable difference between any of the skill levels. And, in other minigames that require cooperation, ""your"" role in unclear at best -- more frustration. Fourth, the level of kinesthetic response required for many of the games exceeds the capabilities of all but the most dexterous humans. For example, to win some of the minigames, the rate of pressing a button is physically impossible to attain, with the result being a win by the ""virtual"" players. Small children can forget about these minigames -- even more frustration. Lastly, the ""virtual"" players are much more highly skilled than any human player can possibly be -- this is probably the most frustrating experience of the game. A much better design would have been either a) the skill levels actually work, or b) when two or more humans are playing, ""dumb"" down the ""virtual"" players so that the game is more of a contest between the human players rather than a contest between the human players and the ""virtual"" players. In summary, your child will become frustrated and stressed playing this game, and will quickly discard it. Game strategy has more to do with overcoming the design flaws rather than building a gaming skill. Save your $50 and buy a game that will build confidence in your child, yet is challenging (not frustrating).",2.0

"Pick people up and drive them through an impressively rendered city to a limited number of destinations. Along the way you can chase people off the sidewalk, bang into cars, dodge traffic and even drive across the bottom of the ocean, but so what? You can't shift except to put it in forward and reverse. The car acts as though the wheels were under the center. There's no power sliding around corners. People always get out of the way on time. Some of the roll overs look realistic, but there's no real damage. You almost never get up to speed as there are so many obstacles and sharp turns. The cars all handle about the same.
This is the kind of feel good game. It all takes place on a bright summer day. The convertible taxi's go bombing around with their tops down, but I get a little stressed with all the rush rush and the traffic. I just don't feel like this is that much fun. It's stressful and tedious. People say this is a racing game, but it really isn't. It's a driving game, sort of a fake driving game and I think it's best suited for an arcade where the glitzy graphics can pull people in for a couple of rides and then let them get on with their lives. Playing it for more than a few minutes just shows you how little it has to offer. I don't think they even have different views and I'm sick of this town, San Francisco.

"This is not such a bad game, it has some good intentions but the bugs and incompatibility problems make it unplayable for some people, plus there are quite a few good games to buy out there today so don't waste your money on this one. To add some credibility to my statement I'll say that I'm 23 years old and I've played games all my life from board games, pc nes, super nes, nes 64 and playstation and even dominoes. This is not a good one, I returned it the next day and got AOEII, and this one is good (microsoft should stop making os's and office and take game making seriously). I don't value a pc game for its graphics and sound, and specially today, where all new games have great graphics (I would give shogun 4 stars in graphics and 5 in sound), if you don't agree, try playing again final fantasy (1) or quest for glory or pool of radiance or even your old version of tie fighter (one of the best ever made).  Well, enough talking for now and lets go to the game review:
1) incompatibility: it will not work for half of the people who bought it, although it did ""work"" in my computer, a 500 pentium with 8mb accelerator that is very decent machine for a third world country like mine.
2) heavyness: as I said the game loaded in my computer, but unless you have 500mb memory and 100mb accelerator the game will SLOW if you control an army over 400 men (about battle number 10 in ""easy"" mode), or if you have more than two other programs installed in your computer (this is mostly a windows problem)
3) interface and gameplay: now who said civilization call to power had a clumsy interface? this one is 10 times worse, it is only good if you command 1-3 units (or armies, whatever). I got the ""mouse move bug"" which means that when you ordered your men to move to a spot they'll actually move 2 or 3 times further, this made all VERY complicated and frustrating. Selecting armies was a little complicated, you only need to click once but then you'll realize that the army you selected is a totally different one, of course, you can always check which banner is ""moving"", this will take you aprox one minute, and your men will probably be slaughtered when you discover it, since the computer reacts very well. Some people say that the AI is tough, this is only true to defending AI, when you are defending all you have to do is place an army in a hill and the enemy will rush to you and get killed in an arrow rain... If you are attacking a bridge, you'll need an army 10 times bigger to win, unless you don't handle the attack yourself, its just better to let the computer handle it, there's probably a trick to this, but it'll take you a few months to learn, and since the game isn't fun, you'll probably just won't do it. The turn to turn part of the game is pointless, there's very little economy and politics to handle, all you have to do is move your armies from the place they are created to the front you are attacking, the stealth units suck, and as a matter of fact, the whole turn to turn system sucks too. I would like to keep on going but I think I may have convinced you already.
4) graphics and sound and historical setting: very good, the only thing that saves this game from a zero star.
5)replayability: I don't know since I did not finish the game, actually I didn't get to the middle of the game (or quarter).
Well. That is ""most"" of the bad things I have to say about this one, and the designers need to take their time before launching another fiasco sequel. I advise you not to buy or rent this game, you'll lose money either way, get aoe II if you want a RTS game or just play cac again for that matter (i wouldnt get tiberian sun either). Or if you have them both or have played enough of them just buy a good scotch whiskey bottle and invite a girl home :).",2.0
"EA Sports should have released TP 2001 as an arcade game because that is exactly what it plays like. Don't get me wrong, the game LOOKS great. But that's where the thread with reality stops. I love sports games for the PC,  and usually take a team of my design on a full season and see where they  end up.
TP 2001 does not have injuries built into the season mode. Your  players can play every day, all game and show no signs of wear and tear.  Finish a season with your invincible team? No franchise mode.
Other game  flaws include diving, which must be done with an almost ESP like sense of  direction if you want to even hope to stop a ball. If you decide to turn  errors on, watch out. Manny Ramirez had 8 ""errors"" on balls that  seemed to award an error just because they were hit in his direction.
On  the other hand if you like arcade style gameplay, codes that give players  unecessary and unuseable attributes such as big heads, little bodies, large  bats, Superman like speed, and no concept of what baseball is all about,  then rush out and buy this immmediately.",2.0

HOWEVER, there is one design flaw that won't allow gamers to enjoy the game to its full extent. Most of the  cars and tracks are locked and the only way to access them is to go through  a very challenging Evolution mode.

"I'll probably be one of the few people who trash this title but I've got to speak my mind.  I'll warn anyone who has a geforce card to stay clear for a while.

Well I have the  latest drivers and I still cannot complete ONE race without a complete  system lockup!  The graphics are outstanding but I have another big gripe  here.  The ""Newer more realistic physics"" of the came cause the  car to bounce up and down constantly and if you are prone to motion  sickness get ready for a major headache.  I have not found a way to turn  this off, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  I am a HUGE fan of the  NFS series but this is one major dissappointment so far.  I hope you have  better luck.",2.0

The tracks aren't as challenging, and the other race cars don't challenge you as well.  The Porshe cars are cool, and the graphics good, but the fact that it locks up my pc and I have to reboot every ten minutes is rediculous.  I just bought the game 10 days ago and I've already given up on it.  Don't waste your money.",2.0
"To start out skip this game. Yes it looks great and the graphics are some of the best, but this game lacks the fun that the last version had. There are only four tracks to race.

Who wants to drive one of the best cars in the world on these lame tracks and never get to fell the real speed of the game. If you want a better driving game go with driver or super bike 2001 or 2000.  These are some of the best looking and best driving games, because of the number of tracks, graphics and just plain fun to drive. Once again skip Need for Speed Porsche Unleashed.",2.0
"I loved Fallout 3 and mostly enjoyed Fallout: New Vegas, so I decided to give one of the older games a try and was pretty let down. The main problem with the game is that it's very unresponsive.

"It is difficult to stand against the onslaught of love and respect for this game. And I'm not saying don't try this game. Too many people loved it for me to expect you to go by my experience, but I do want to share with you my different perspective.

First off, looking back, I don't hate Baldur's gate. It has it's virtues. Its just that after 20 or so hours it began to weigh on me, leaving me with a feeling heavy, bleak, and insistent.  In taking up computer games as a hobby a year ago it was one of the first games I played or really got into.  Fascination rolled into addiction and addiction rolled into a kind of dread and tedium.  Finally I realized I didn't actually have to play this game anymore.  So I didn't.  This may seem like an obvious solution to you, but then you don't actually know me so well.

Enough preamble. I like to rate games based on categories that I find important to me and so I will do that below on a scale of say 1 to 10. How's that?

Story:  4,  I'll admit my predispositions here, and also that not actually getting more than a third of the way through this game limits me a little, but I do feel I got the main idea.  My predisposition is that I long for a computer game that is story driven effectively and actually works as a good story. Story is always such a distant second to gameplay that you end up with these half hour stories built into 15 to 60 hour games.  Generally they either make little sense, or fade into a weird sequel nothingness in the end (hello half life 2, beyond good and evil (good games both nevertheless)). I have tried so many, do actually like many games, but have been underwhelmed repeatedly as far as story.  Baldur's had the advantage that I was new to gaming and so hadn't seen all it's conventions before, even if they were familiar.  In this game you wake up in a prison cell and have a secret destiny.  Yeah yeah yeah.  It's actually not too bad though and the quality of some of the characters helps, but, and I think this might be the key problem, in order to create an open ended world, provide a variety of quests, and give the good/evil option as it were, the whole thing comes completely apart at the seams.  The story falls apart into ridiculousness except the game pretends it hasn't and you're supposed to too. Just to start you spend hours struggling to break out of a dungeon you have no knowledge of even though a member of your party broke in to get you.  Wouldn't she have some helpful information?  How did she manage it in the first place? So much of this game is full of stuff like this. Its been awhile so I'm fuzzy, but could come up with quite a few more examples, like places where the sense of what is good and effective to do in the game defies the reality of your characters as actual people.  In my opinion you can have a very linear game (problem is too few options as a player unless it's done perfectly), or a completely wide open, basically questless game (problem is it feels kind of pointless unless it's done perfectly and beautifully) or you can have a reality defying muddle in the middle of the two. Baldur's takes this last path I am afraid.  Still, I would have sort of liked to see how it all turned out if I didn't have to slog through so very much stuff and time to get to it.

Characters: 7 or 8,  very good.  Love the pictures. Voices excellent. Really nicely done, though after awhile hearing them say the same phrases hundreds of times was hard to take.  Also the story caused them to do things completely out of character at times.

Gameplay:  5,  I prefer less difficulty in games and would have appreciated a difficulty level system very much.  There is a lot of fighting, managing your stuff and fighting some more and its that d and d dice rolling fighting that can look very strange (big guy with huge sword swings at weakened creature just standing there and misses wildly). It often left me feeling faintly like it wasn't working and that the game didn't do what was in the queues for my characters even though I suppose it really was.

Graphics: 6,  nice general visual design and though its dated now its pretty powerful in the sense of mood it imparts (though see below). I mean it really did affect me in an almost dreamlike way for awhile.  It was a bit of a letdown in terms of giving me a sense of wonder though.

Dreariness factor:  1,  cold, chill and frequently joyless.  That's how I found it.  Some of the character humor helped a little, especially the nicer characters, but so much killing and grim characters and so little relief or oasis or real rewards or lightness in comparison. Plus I felt burdened by the way the quests could just sort of pile up on you and all be emergencies.

Technical issues:  I always feel this is so subjective as you never know what will be a problem with your computer, but a few small or weird glitches were really awful for me.  I couldn't get downstairs in one place, something crucial disappeared in another.

Learning factor:  4,  had a tutorial level which maybe I wouldn't find too confusing with the experience I have now in games, but I really wish it had been more clear and specific.

Product materials:  5,  a nice start, decent book, but really quite incomplete.

Chore factor:  2,  well, you know, so many rooms of so many monster things to really get anywhere.  I really did feel burdened.

Difficulty:  3,  kind of already discussed but I'll add that everything seemed either kind of hard to kill or quite hard to kill, it would have been nice and even appropriate if some things had been very easy too. I will repeat I might have lasted longer with an easy or moderately easy setting, but it still would've gotten to me in the end.

Game saves:  7,  a pretty good save anytime system only flawed by an inability to save in combat, which, if I recall, could sometimes sneak up on you and then it was too late.

Conclusion:  I find when I write negative reviews of really popular and respected games (gta vice city is a good example) people tend to say its not helpful, and if I like them its very helpful,  but sometimes I think they maybe already played the game and think it's some kind of contest these reviews (then of course, maybe they just think its not a very informative review).  I'm just telling you my reaction here and my thoughts. A lot of people gave this classic game 5 stars. I really think this game could've been alot better.

Baldur's gate made me think maybe I don't like rpgs too much, but I am currently pretty far along in star wars knights of the old republic and very much like it.",2.0
"What's all the hype about? I got this game on the basis of myriad good reviews and recommendations, and was impressed by the many classes, races, weapons, and monsters flaunted by every site devoted to this RPG. However, I must say that I was unimpressed by the game itself. Despite their sheer number, I found that there was very little difference between the classes; it seemed that some could use spells and some could not, which naturally made me prefer the former. However, as it seems that half of the spells counteract the other half, I didn't have a huge variety to cast. Going into towns to buy things was utterly pointless, as you find many of Baldur's Gate II's best standard items in the first five minutes of gameplay. Which brings me to the most pointlessly tedious part of this overrated RPG: combat. I would think that my mighty Kensai (or Paladin, Barbarian, Ranger, or Monk; it really didn't matter) would chop Mephits (hairy things that look like bats with the ability to hover) in two pieces on the first blow, especially when wielding a Katana, that mighty Japanese blade forged by meticulously folding thousands of layers of iron and steel to create an edge capable of bisecting a thick rod of steel in a single strike. Instead, I learn that he missed. With a sword. In melee combat. How is this possible? It takes me a further fifteen slices (and five misses) before the thing finally releases a ... squirt of blood and dies. If battle in fantasy worlds is that boring, I'm glad I live here and now. In disgust, I let my brother try the game, and his verdict was even worse than mine. I may be one of the only people in the world who thinks so, but in my opinion, there are much better ways to spend one's time than trying to futilely slay goblins with poleaxes.",2.0

"At first play a thought this game was for me. But a short time playing I relieved I was wrong.
Being a fan of sim/build/war games and expecting that from 1602AD I was very disappointed. The game does incorporate  building and war but room for expansion is limited (all you have to build  on is small islands). Game play was difficult due to poor feed back during  game play (being attacked and not even made aware).
I purchased this game  because people who brought The Sims also brought 1602AD.
If you want a  good game of building/war/sim I would recommend any of the Ages of Empires  or Civilizations. Both good games.
Please don't waste your time or money  on 1602AD.",2.0
"Like many of the other previous reviewers, I bought the game because the demo was outstanding. I'm finding in practice that the game really doesn't measure up, however.
To Ground Control's credit, this is probably the  best 3D land-based RTS game to come out yet. However, it still doesn't  manage to escape from a lot of the shortcomings of its fellow 3D  RTS's.
The nature of 3D RTS, at least so far, seems to be that units are  more 'realistically' proportional to the terrain. While that may be nice on  paper, in gameplay what it translates to is that you spend hours moving  your units from one place on the map to the other, because they're so small  in proportion to the terrain. In fighting battles, you're obligated to zoom  out to such an extent that each unit is only a blip of a few pixels on your  screen--not much fun to watch or look at while directing the troops.
I  don't find the elimination of resource management to be a plus for Ground  Control. What that ends up meaning is that there is no reinforcement  available for you to build or buy; you can't simply play and have fun if  you want to try different things in a mission. You have to carefully and  tediously position your units so as to incur as few losses as possible. Add  to this the fact that there is NO in-game saving in Ground Control, and you  find yourself playing very carefully and tediously indeed.
Topping this  off, there just isn't a good story happening here to keep you interested.  It's mostly told through the thoughts of the two side commanders rather  than through good character and dialog. The cutscenes are hands-down the  worst I've ever seen--they are videos of the game engine, it looks like,  and they're so badly compressed that they look like they're being streamed  over the web--blocky, blurry, and awful to watch.
On the positive side,  the game does look great, especially when you zoom in close to the units  fighting. It plays better on lower-end systems than other games of its  type, but you'll still need a blistering machine if you want to see it in  its full glory.
Be warned also that it's not entirely stable. A patch was  released the day after it hit retail, but not all of the bugs are out of  it. One of the worst is that it will crash on completion of a mission, and  you don't get credited with the mission. I've spent more hours replaying  because of this than I'd care to admit.
As a former Army officer, I think  there are some cool tactical things happening in Ground Control that  haven't been modeled well in other games--friendly fire, fire support,  formations--but in the end, when all is said and done, I have to say that  the game just isn't that much fun to play.
You're getting 90% of the  experience in the demo. If it really floats your boat after seeing it, then  maybe you should try it. Other than that, buyer beware.",2.0
"Here is the deal people,  the game plot is good, very good, but it all rolls down hill from there.  First of all if you buy this game, save and save a lot (thank god for the quick save option), because you will, I repeat will experience crashes, any where from everyonce in a while to quite frequently.  You will also experience several glitches and bugs, some that will keep you from being able to kill the bad guy John Irenicus.  Don't rely on Interplay or Black Isle for help...... their idea of customer service is and always has been... release the game and leave the customer behind because once they buy it, we have our money.  The game got boring after a couple days of playing because it was basically the same stuff all the time, run into an NPC he/she has a problem, you go hack and slash your way through hordes of bad guys to solve it, no real problem solving involved.  They did very little to fix the AI from Baldurs Gate 1, but they did come up with ""way points"", that is if you feel like taking the time to lay them out AND know what is ahead of you through the Fog of War.  They boasted that the game was going to be more acceptable of 'Evil' characters, but it really isn't, all of your NPC's in your party will be mostly ""lawful good or chaotic good"" except for one Mage that you can get and the two druids who are nuetral (but they act more good than true nuetral)and Viconia, and they will leave you at the first sign of you ""evil ways"", that's right, you can't go clear whole city blocks of citizens and expect to have a party left with you.  Bottom line, the game is terrible, it seems like interplay rushed the game out about four of five months too soon.  Oh and if you have a problem at the final battle and can't seem to kill John Irenicus, find out wich party member isn't talking remove them from your party, and then ask them to rejoin, interplay made me find that out on my own, quality service I tell ya.",2.0
"This is not Art or Philosophy, or anything close. What it is is a 200 mind-numbing hours long sequel to a traditional, dyed-in-the-wool RPG thats intensely boring.

"Fails. I've never played baldurs gate. I remember my sister asking to so I asked my dad to play Icewind Dale. He set this up for me and I remember playing to the Vale of Shadows. I stopped about half way through. The most ignorant part about the games is the battles. As you go they get increasingly frequent. I hate haveing to fight a skeleton with 2 hp every other second. As for fighting, the game lacks as it is more of a point and click.
I started playing again from the middle of the Vale, and finally got out of there. I then went to a temple which was alright. After that I realized that I was going to another dungeon type cave. This time, I read a strategy guide to find out that it was about 5 levels of fighting. That's not fun. That is not fun at all. I could respect a short game with few battles, but when I fight battles every other minute just to drag out something... It almost seems meaningless after a while.
Anyways, I stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today. I am enjoying it more, mostly because I know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids. My druid last game killed about 15 units. My main character killed about 300. This can only tell you that my druid was bad. Fortunately I was able to change him later in the game. Although when I did, I got stuck with a level 1 character who was easily killed off. So yea, don't think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game. The feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is, the game will be too hard for you to change.
The game does a great job in voice actors though. The fact that I create my entire party is fine. The graphics could use some work. I get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute. Even the snow seems depressing. Other than that, the game offers repetitive battles and little more. Online play isn't fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or 2 games going. Once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option ""max hp on level up"" set.
Here's some advice, go play baldurs gate. My sis, sister is playing it again. She is enjoying it. This game is bland, depressing, and repetitive. Sorry but don't get it unless you wanna blow 5 bucks.",2.0
"After reading all the excellent reviews for this game I thought I would give it a try. After many hours of trying to get myself to enjoy it I just gave up. Now, I know that this is an RPG game, but personally I find the pace of the game to be much to slow compared to some of the other RPG's that I've played in the past. Also, I highly recommend reading the manual before you play or you will be completely lost. I'm sure many of you out there like these challenging games, but I just thought I would give a different perspective about what to expect. Some aspects of the game I DID like are the graphics. Beautiful scenery and settings throughout the game, and some cool effects with certain characters as well. I also liked the opening cutscene. My advise is only buy this game if you are really into RPG's otherwise I would stay away.",2.0
"....  It's ... frustrating, too the point that it isn't fun.  I'm an avid gamer.  It's fun to ""role-play"" low level characters.  An orc or two can be a very scary thing.  This doesn't translate well to a computer game that wipes out an entire party in ten seconds even with the ""AI"" scripts on.  The visuals are cool, but I wish I would have plunked my money down for something else.  This game does not deliver.  Boring linear plot and hack-n-die.  Buy some dice, a figure and paper for a real roleplaying game.",2.0
Dull very very dull and very linear.  Not worthy of the Baldar's Gate games.  The funny thing is that even after I knew this (about five min. into the game)  I continued to play.  Trust me it is not worth it and 2 stars is more then gererous.,2.0
"I cannot belive the number of people who love this game.  When comparing this game to the likes of BG, BGII and Planescape: Torment it is ridiculous that this game be rated anywhere near as good.  The graphics are only slightly better than BG, but they are vastyly inferior to BGII and Torment.  The sound is good I'll give it that, but then the sound is just as good in the three other games I mentioned.  This game is also way too easy.  I beat it in less than two weeks and I don't play more than 1-2 hours a day.  I also do not recall ever dying in the game either.  Another thing is that it gets a boring after a little while.  All of the battle is inside areas that in many cases is unremarkable, but their are some nice ones.  The gameplay is also poor becuase one quickly gathers a lot of gold and gems in any of the many dungeons (which are practically the only areas in the game) but without gem bags or bags of holding you end up dumping VERY good magical items and gems because some of the items are just so ridiculously powerful.  At one point I almost dumped my +4 weapons in favor of the +3s and +2s because the game was too easy.  Also in dungeons one might expect traps, and some nasty ones might I add, these are nonexistent in Icewind Dale.  A party could quite easily get along without a thief at all.  This game was no where near as good as it could or should be.  If you are interested in buying this game, don't waste your money.  Instead buy BG, BGII or Planescape: Torment or save it until Pool of Radiance 2 or Neverwinter Nights come out.  All of these games are VASTLY superior and also are a lot of fun the second or third time around unlike Icewind Dale that is not great the first time.",2.0
"DOA2 is a fun game to play with friends that can play it also.

First off the game has NO extras. That in itself is disappointing!

Secondly, the single player game [...] BIG time. As a result the team battles and versus battles with friends are all you will have to hang on to.

These 2 flaws really killed the game for me. I love extras and a good single player mode since I can't have friends over everyday.

On the plus side, the graphics are great and the gameplay is fun, espically with friends. I'll recommend this game as a good game to play with friends. If you don't have that option then you couls let it slip by.",2.0
"To start off, I would say that I would have liked to give this game at least four stars.  Imaginative setting, more monsters than you can shake a stick at, frantic pace, and KISS (sorta).  However, it's so full of bugs that it becomes unplayable after a while.  Even with the latest patch it crashed a lot.  And yes, I made sure all my hardware drivers were up-to-date.  The worst problem was the corrupted save files.  I'd click to load a saved game, and my entire system would lock up.  The game's official discussion forum, which appears to be gone now, was full of people saying how buggy this game is.  Probably worth a try as a bargain-bin title.  If it works on your machine, you'll have a blast.",2.0

"I have to say that I could not WAIT to buy this game when it originally came out.  I was a huge fan of the first one and recommended it to everyone that was interested.  I would not do the same with this one.  I actually did not find the darkness to be a problem as many of the other people who have written reviews here did.  What I did find to be a problem were the following:
 1) storyline/plot, was very unintriguing.
 2) the level of difficulty was extremely high, yet unnecessarily so. I want to clarify this statement - I enjoy challenging games.  In fact, the more challenging, the better usually.  However, the challenges in Thief 2 were what I would call ""unskilled challenges"".  They were based more on how long you had the patience to check each square foot of every hallway in order to find a key or some such object.  If you find it, it's not that you solved any kind of puzzle to reason where it was placed.  It was just dumb luck requiring pointless hours of time painstakingly scouring a building ... if you like that kind of thing, great.  I don't.  Many of the levels required tedious tasks such as the above.
 3) I agree with another reviewer that the foes were essentially unscary.  The first Thief really provided a level of intrigue and suspense with the monsters and the plot.  This one did not even come close.
 All in all, I was wholly disappointed with the game.  In fact, I almost didn't even feel like finishing it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I did if you decide to buy it.",2.0
"I love gaming, and really wanted to play this game, but it was just too doggone DARK! Most of the time, the screen is completely black. I think they saved a lot on graphics development. ;o)
I played for 45 minutes, and couldn't even get inside the building! I kept getting stuck on some unseen barrier, and the map they give you shows your general location, but was not detailed enough to pinpoint where I was and show me how to get around whatever I was stuck on.
My husband played for one afternoon, and didn't see much of anything either. The screen was black about 80% of the time.
I'd like to be able to see at least an outline of what's in front of me. Maybe the next game will be ""Thief III: The Cave."" :o)",2.0
"Great graphics, poor customer service, bugs are minimal considering the vastness of the game, but assistance can be sketchy if you are hindered by one.
This game is NOT the high fantasy setting many AD&D players are  used to. However, it does offer an alternative to Quake and the like.  Gameplay has a free-will feel. You are left to wander the world and do as  you please. Participation in ""events"" is  optional.
Communications from company to customer have been poor to date,  though they are improving slowly. Again, I cannot express enough the lack  of quality customer service from this company.",2.0
"Everquest.  One of a very few (so far) ""Massively Multiplayer"" online games.  Everquest allows you a 3D perspective into a high-fantasy world.  It's a standard computer ""roleplaying"" game with a ton of  other people.
The good bits? The first time you see a giant, it'll  probably give you a rush of ""Wow, that's really BIG.""  The game  world is also pretty large, and some bits of it are stunningly beautiful,  and contain challenging and entertaining quests for the player.  This game  is genuinely fun, for a while.
The bad bits? Eventually, you're just  doing the exact same thing over and over again.  A very vocal minority of  the player population needs to relax.  Badly.  Characters have an extremely  limited range of customization.  And, of course, my personal pet peeve:  You can spend a lot of time and money to learn how to make things.  At the  time of this writing, you can easily obtain far more powerful items far  more easily.  Thus, time spent to painstakingly master the art of making  armor is time totally wasted.
In all, it was rather fun to play for  several weeks, but not at all worth the money.  The beautiful user  interface fails to make up for the extreme lack of variety.
As with  everything, your milage may vary.",2.0
"As is the case with many of these 4 and 5 star reviews, i was impressed with the concept and glitz of Everquest in the first month that i bought the game.  It wasn't until about a month into the game thati realized the true colors of the game, as i became extremely bored or angry everytime  that i played.  I would put hours into the game at a time, and not  accomplish anything.  So i quit.  Canecelled my account and didn't play the  game for 6 months.  Just recently i got bored and reactivated my account to  see if anything had changed, but i was dissappointed to find that the game  was in the same sad  state as when i left.
There are so many bad things  about this game, but i will try to list them here in brief form.
1)  Verant, company that made the game, is money hungry and does not listen to  or take input from it's players at all.  In fact through it's customer  service policies the company proves that it assumes all players are  snotty/whiny/cheating/scammers.  If you doubt any of this all you need to  do is read the Official Everquest forum at check out  the gameplay forum especially, this is the only forum that the ONLY public  relations employee at verant reads, so its where most of the players go to  speak their mind)
2) The only way to advance your character is by  leveling up since you cannot get experience any other way.  Technically you  can get experience by doing quests, but its so little thats its not worth  the effort.  Since characters are defined by classes, almost all characters  of the same class and level are exactly the same.
3) There are tons  of bugs in this game, and with such a poor Customer service department, if  you die from a bug you are screwed.  You could lose all of  your items and  money due to a bug, but you will not be compensated.
4) The economy is  out of control.  I mean it doesn't work at all.  Inflation is so bad that  at high levels money becomes useless.
5) Trade skills are useless and/or  not profitable. For some reason in Everquest trade skills such as  Smithing/fletching/tailoring, etc... are useless.  the time and money you  put into these skills will never pay off since the cost to buy the raw  goods often exceed the profit you make by selling the product.  Several of  the Trade skills have been broken since day one... such as alchemy.
6)  The downtime in between fights can be huge!  Seriously once you pass level  10  you have to wait several minutes in between each fight to restore your  hit points and magic points.  At the higher levels i heard it takes as long  as 20 minutes to recover mana, and during this time your character must be  sitting down, and not doing anything at all.  So i guess the players of  everquest are supposed to read a book or do their laundry during these long  periods of downtime.
7) oh yeah, due to the way the game is structured,  its not really an RPG.  Its a hack and slash game where the only purpose  is to gain more levels.  The quests are far and few in between and most of  them are pretty lame.  The players have absolutely NO impact on the world.  You cannot join an army, or hold a goverment position, or any kind of job  for that matter.  You are good for nothing other than killing monsters out  in the wilderness... which after a while gets really boring.
8) The  creatures that give the best loot are ""Camped""  24/7, meaning  that several groups will sit and wait at the areas where these monsters  spawn and kill it as soon as it spawns, and then wait again for however  long it takes for the monster to spawn again... sometimes hours.  Again  this is very lame and boring.
oh well, i guess thats enough reasons for  now, although I""m sure i could think of more if i tried... oh yeah the  grouping system is not good.  You can only effectively group with people  near you in level otherwise neither person will gain experience.
My  advice?  In my opinion there aren't any good MMORPGS out right now,  Asheron's Call has potential.  You can try Everquest if you are bored and  want to see what these online games are like, but don't let it dissappoint  you the way it did me.  The game has lots of potential, but for whatever  reason Verant fell flat on its face as far as making any of it work.",2.0
"A highly addictive game, which can be played with whatever suits your role playing philosophy.

Constant server downtime for long periods  ( 6 to 8  hours many times )  to make minor changes.  Impossible to reach tech  support or customer service.  Several spokespersons who respond to  complaints on message boards with the almost literal 'well that's the way  it is,  so forget about your complaints'.  Even with the release of this  upgrade,  a fiasco occured where many people did not get the upgrade after  weeks of waiting and having paid for overnight delivery.

"I qualify as a Might & Magic Junky, having played all of the series since #1.  The best aspect of these games is the development of the team.  In my family, each person becomes a ""named"" character with a personality to suit the mood of the game. You always had your choice to be a good or bad.  MM8 has lost all this. You now can only create/name one character on your team, and it's tough to be a good character. Only two of the eight allowed classes have possitive sounding attributes. The entire game has a dark and gloomy presentation, such as if you want a top knotch wizard, you need to be a Lich.  Ugh! A Lich is to be killed, not personified. No longer can my family enjoy being their own chacters. You now ""higher"" your remaining (computer named) team characters.  But, just when you spend all those spell points/money to become a master/grandmaster, you have to drop this body from the team to make room for a someone else in order to complete a specific quest.  Too much comming and going. Too depressing. Not fun at all.",2.0
"Might and Magic VIII was really a dissapointment when I first played it.  It has the same game engine as its most recent prequil, but with some downsides. First you only get to create one character, your main character,  and the rest of your party is filled up with characters you meet. Second,  and lastly, the characters are ugly expecially the male knights.

"Having played M&M6 and M&M7, I was really looking forward to this game.  Unfortunately, once I started I lost interest pretty quickly.  It is so similar to the earlier games that I felt I was just replaying one of the  other titles.
My biggest problem is that there have been few if any  upgrades to the basic game engine since #6.  Don't get me wrong, I like the  basic game engine.  The world looks interesting and is easy to navigate.  However, some of the problems that first bothered me in 6 have become even  more annoying in the later titles.  Namely:
HOARDS OF UNINTELLIGENT  MONSTERS: All monsters in the M&M universe behave in exactly the same  way.  Once they see you, they charge to attack.  (OK.  A few will shoot at  you from range, but the principle is still the same.) No opponents use even  rudimentary tactics. As a result, every fight feels the same.  And there  are A LOT of fights.  There are so many damn monsters in this game that  your finger will get sore from pressing the attack key, and the repetition  gets pretty mind numbing.  In particular, I got sick of the pirates on the  first island.  There's a trigger zone that creates new ones every time you  enter it.  How many times do we really want to kill the same monster  off?
MONSTERS DON'T REACT TO EVENTS AROUND THEM: The game uses the tired  D&D cliche of the dungeon crawl.  That is, you go into the first room,  kill everything there. Rest.  Move on to next room.  Repeat.  Guards in  other rooms don't react to your presence until you attack them, even if  that is months later.  Frankly, I would be happier if the next game in the  series used a system like the one in Fallout 2, where all the guards in a  complex react in a coordinated way to your presence once they realize that  you are there.  This forces you to use stealth, dialog skills, and to  really think about who you attack and when.
THE STORY IS STILL VERY  LINEAR: Basically, you have a bunch of quests you have to do.  You have no  real choices in who you ally yourself with and who you attack.  The world  consists of people you talk to and people you kill, with no overlap between  the two.
THE NPC SYSTEM COULD BE VASTLY IMPROVED:  You have no choice in  how you handle NPC's.  You hear what they have to say, then do their quests  for them.  I would much rather see the game move towards an NPC systme like  the one in Fallout 2, which is really quite good. Your lead character's INT  determines how many things he can think of to say, and his oratory skill  determines how well he can lie and manipulate people.  And you always seem  to have at least two or three different ways to approach any  NPC.
Overall, my big problem with this game is that there just isn't a  lot of thinking involved, or much freedom of action for the player.  You  slog your way through endless fights against repetitive and brainless  monsters, only to collect a reward and then do more of the same.",2.0
"Alien Vs Predator is a first person shooter. AVP has a very poor AI and does not have much of a storyline, It is just a get from point A to point B by killing everything that comes in your way. You could play as three different charecters Alien, Predator and a Colonial Marine.
ALIEN : The Alien levels compared to the others are very easy. It does not have any weapons besides it's claws and tail, So to kill someone it needs to get very near the enemy, But a couple of attacks could kill the enemy. It moves really fast and can walk on walls or any surfaces. It can see clearly even in darkness. The alien gameplay is orginal and a initially a lot of fun but gets boring fast because the same thing happens in every level, No new weapons or new enemies.
MARINE : The marine levels are very difficult and quite unplayable. He has a lot of weapons but is given only a few for the levels and sometimes after the level completion the weapons collected are taken away and is given only a few. Each level have a lot of monstors but you can't see them comming because the levels are very dark and you need to use the image intesifier to look ahead, It makes the dark areas green and the bright areas white, If you fire a weapon with the image intense on the screen becomes white and you cant see where the enemey is. One minuite you could be walking with full health and aurmor but before you know it zero health, zero aurmor and game over. The marine levels are very difficult even on the easy difficulty.
PREDATOR : Compared to the marine the predator levels are very easy but not as easy as the alien. The predator moves very slowly and can become almost invisible, It has many weapons and can take a lot of damage. The predator has four types of visions to see in total darkness and it can also heal itself.
Each of the three charecters have six levels each, If you complete a charecter you could unlock a few bonus missions, And the number of bonus missions that is unlocked depends on the difficulty you play. AVP Gold has a limited number of saves depending on the difficulty. I would recommend you to play on the hardest difficulty (Director's Cut), Though it would be very difficult it would unlock many bonus mission, I don't think there is any difference between the difficulties besides the number of saves you are limited. AVP's graphics are sound are ok, The special effects are very good. Compared to the other games it ran very smooth and it did not crash much either. Alien Vs Predator is a good game but only for very good gamers, It is the most hardest and the most frustrating game i have ever played.",2.0
"Challenging? No, Impossible is more like it! Just remember to download the cheat codes first before playing this game, you'll need them.
  The graphics, sound and user interface are exceptional but those features are over-shadowed by the short amount of time players stay alive in the game. This is not really a serious gaming experience, its more of an exercise in futility. The only time you'll last longer than an alka-seltzer tablet in a glass of water is when you play as the Predator and even then your life span is not that long.  The alien can't heal and the marine is the ultimate victim. The game settings should not be ""Easy"", ""Medium"" and ""Hard""; they should be changed to ""Slow Suicide"", ""Quick Death"" and ""Don't Bother Fighting Back"".",2.0

"I read a couple of decent reviews of this before I bought it(Games Domain.com) and as I'm into a bit of action and adventure and thought Severance to be superb, I shelled out my cash for Rune.
Rune has a great story line running through it.  Thats about the best thing in the game.  if you liked Tomb raider, then this is Tomb Raider with Vikings (with few challenging puzzles)!!  Lots of ledge jumping and climbing, swimming and swinging from vines and stuff- very disappointing.
The enemies did nothing for me and the combat system is basic to say the least.
The graphics are good (so they should using the Unreal Tournament engine)but even so at some angles Ragnor becomes transparent.
All in all don't waste your money on this unless Tomb Raider style jumping is your thing. If you're over 18 buy Severance because its ace!!
You might also try Heavy Metal Faxx 2.  The heroine is a babe, the action is good and the enemies are cool.
F.A.B. guys",2.0
"The opening of Rune's single-player game is incredibly promising; you start in a beautifully rendered Viking village.  Once you prove yourself in combat against the Master of Arms (or somesuch), a cutscene takes you onto a longboat and across the sea.
Up to this point, the game had my interest.
Next, however, the ship sinks, your character dies and finds himself in the underworld, and single-player Rune becomes one of the most boring, repetitive games I've ever had the displeasure of playing.  It's the same problem Unreal (from which Rune got its engine) has, really; the single player game gets duller and duller as you move on.  It bored me so quickly that, desperate to find redeeming value in this game, I fired up the multiplayer.
Playing this game multiplayer makes it all worth it.  I can't describe how much fun it is to beat up your friends with various hand-to-hand weapons, or even with their own severed limbs and heads.  The combat and movement is so perfect and smoothly done; instead of using dumb, ultra-generic fantasy monsters in the single-player game, Human Head Studios should have tried to implement more of a bot AI, because playing against humans in this game is fun!  It's got the depth of a fighting game but without the dizzyingly complex controls.
The problem is, the only multiplayer modes available in Rune are Deathmatch...and Team Deathmatch.
Because of this, the game is disappointing.  The single-player, which was unfortunately probably the focus of the studio's efforts, is godawful.  The multiplayer is incredibly promising, and fun despite its limits, but it really needs so much more.
Now, a game with the combat system from Rune, but with more multiplayer modes and levels, and with bot support, would be one I'd not regret spending fifty of my hard-earned dollars on.  Rune Tournament, anyone?",2.0
"I had such hopes for this game.  I enjoyed the demo very much, so I ran out and bought it.  Bad idea.  Next time, I'll learn to read some reviews from magazines first.
What sounds cooler than a viking warrior stomping around, eating live animals, and cutting the heads off his victims?  Switch hunting, at least according to Gathering of Developers.  I spent the vast majority of my time in Rune stumbling about a dark corridor searching for a switch or a wall to break, or just getting lost.  I think it would have boosted the realism of this game if Ragnar randomly shouted out ""Where the hell am I?""  I was looking for joyful swordfighting fun, but spent most of my time hacking up spiders and those annoying undead ghouls who keep popping back to life.  There were brief moments of mindless carnage, which I loved, but these were far outweighed by boredom.
Now I hate multiplayer in general, but I must admit that Rune's multiplayer is refreshing and entertaining for a while.  Unfortunatly, there is absolutely no variety.  Just strafe, rush in, swing weapon, hope you don't die.
In short, Rune could have been so much more than it was.",2.0

"This game is bad.  I loved the first Tenchu game, and the PS2 version rocks.  The entertainment factor here can best be described as standing on a packed bus on an 95 degree day, with no air-conditioning....someone crapped thier pants...you don't know who, the bus stinks, you just missed your stop, and the next stop is not for another 20 minutes....yeah it's that much fun!  The game play is rough, the landscapes are not interesting, and it lacks all of the fine tuned quality of the first game.  You are constantly fighting the camera angles.",2.0
"Tenchu2 itself isn't an utterly terrible game--I know I've put in a good  10 hours or more on it, but what's frustrating is how there is so much  promise and so much failure both in the same package.  The feel of the game  is that Activision rushed this one out the door, and throughout the game  you'll find bugs, glitches and all sorts of annoying problems that would  lead one to believe that the game wasn't even beta tested.  Here's my list  of gripes:
-The controls are worse than Tenchu 1:  Of course, Tenchu 1 is  clunky but they are even worse here.  A lot of would-be perfect kills will  get ruined because what should have landed you right on top of your enemy  has you rolling out in front of them or some other stupid  stunt.
-Ridiculous AI:  Tenchu 1 did not have the best AI but it was far  superior to this.  I've walked in front of guards and had them not see me.  On the other hand, some guards are capable of seeing me through the back of  their head.  Also, guards quickly forget your presence and seem completely  uninterested in pursuing you once you are out of sight.  Yup, you can be  one foot away from them but under water, and neither can they see through  the water nor are they patient enough to wait even a minute to see if  you'll resurface (nor wonder why a bamboo air-pipe is suddenly sticking out  of the water.)  This is really a let down given that there were reports  that the AI would be vastly improved, guards noting blood running along a  stream or looking for fallen bodies (blood doesn't run down stream in the  game anyway.)  Other guards can see you without even being present.  This  is a neat trick when your KI meter is in the teens or lower and you can't  see anyone but they can see you.
-Graphic interface or whatever you want  to call it:  Graphics are just plain sloppy--my ninja is often teleported  up four feet instead of actually having to climb or jump over fences  anymore .  In the same manner, when dragging bodies I've been able to leave  them hanging in mid air, as though supported by an invisible floor of  glass.
-Graphics in general:  Sometimes the backgrounds go through  objects (IE you can see the sun and clouds THROUGH a wall of mountains.  Also, sometimes you can see guards out of your perriphrial vision but not  straight ahead.
-Inconsistancy with stealth kills:  Again, not only can  guards see you out of the back of their head, but some -cannot- be stealth  killed. PERIOD.  This wasn't evident until playing Tatsumaru's 'labor  shortage' level where certain guards could not be knocked unconscious even  with 20 tries or so.  Incidentally, this level seems nearly unbeatable and  I think gives even more evidence that this was a rushed job.  With 20 tries  on this level, I could not beat it, and I can't say I really want to  anymore.
-Difficulty level:  A good friend of mine nearly sold this  within the first week until we dug up the cheat code.  The game is nearly  unplayable without the armor, but it is almost impossible to get a grand  master, so you can't get the armor. This would be different if I could  start looting guards for blow darts on level 1, but even then, those are  useless against bosses, and between the combination of worsened controls,  bad camera angles and 'two hits and your dead' boss damage, Activision has  managed to take all the fun out of Tenchu and turned it into a tedious and  frustrating derision of the first game.
-Voice assignment:  This is  thefunniest glitch.  Sometimes the voices of the guards are the wrong  gender, and probably the glitch that had me laughing the hardest was when  the shark started talking.  C'mon folks!  The shark should not talk.  Please test your game before releasing it.
-Mission editor is a joke:  Ok, this isn't really a glitch, but really, I can't even make roofs in this  thing.  The saving grace would have been being able to make an island full  of cats or something, but all you get are boring people (maybe you can make  a bunch of godha's samurai and evil samurai line up like some insane  football game?)
My overall take on this game is that while Activision  certainly added a lot of new things to make Tenchu the 5/5 it should have  been, they lost it where it really counted--the outstanding game play that  made Tenchu 1.  Sure, Tenchu 2 has a lot of improvements, but none of this  makes up for the lack of AI, a soundtrack, good controls, and an  environment that reacts in a realistic way instead of one that has so many  bugs in it I never know how it will react.
I sincerely hope Tenchu 3  will be the game this should have been.  There are a lot of great ideas  here, but they just seem so poorly executed that it makes one long for the  game this should have been. It's still somewhat enjoyable (especially with  the cheat codes), and its glitchyness is sometimes amusing, but all and all  it isn't worth the $40 price tag--maybe you should look around your local  vendors...my used copy will be showing up soon :)",2.0
"Where do I begin...?  In the beginning of this game it had so much potential. I was really thinking that since the graphics were pathetic that the story would have to go on forever, which I had no problem with, I LIKE long games. Then I came to a point where the screen slowly spelled out ""Final Chapter"". I freaked out initially because I thought this was the end, I spent ... for this wasted entertainment. Then I thought ""hmm, maybe it is just the final chapter of the PREFACE"", which would mean that the actual ""ogre battle"" has yet to begin (which would have been great), and the entire time I have been playing was designed to be the events that unfolded to ensure that I understood that the battle that will betaking place was a direct result of my failure to be everywhere at once. I thought maybe all that I have done was only done to ensure I understatnd the orgin of the real part of game once I got that far. I thought that at some point all of my ""soldiers"" and charecters (except the main ones) were going to become ogres and then the real fun could begin... Well, at least I was thinking. The ending came right after that chapter and I hated it. I felt like sueing the guys who programmed it, but couldn't because I didn't have a case. It was so irritating to come that far and just be let down like that. The most difficult obsticals in that game are learning to play it (translating the vauge instuction booklet), and the patience it takes to go everywhere nine times before giving up on little ""side quest"" (In my case I never use ""stradegy guides"" like nintendo power, so this alleged ""bolt of silk"" and that damn ""annihilation"" spell book will always be a mystery, along with about anything else that I haven't even heard of yet).  I am currently working on my third time playing. So far the endings aren't much, there had better be about 60 of them or I will consider this a one star. Hmmm... Maybe I should have played the snes one, who knows, this is just my opinion.",2.0
"This game was a real disappointment to me. The game contains a lot of profanity that frankly I would not like my children to learn. There is a warning on the box about mild language, however the language is worse than ""mild"" and it is used very frequently, within the first few minutes of game play on. The profanity is completely not needed and is way out of place in the game. Aside from this major complaint the game could be fun, though the game still remains somewhat tedious and dull.",2.0
"My god, I can't believe what passes as a good game nowadays.  Being an extreme fan of the Wing Commander series, as well as other space simulations like Descent Freespace, I was more then ecstatic when I first  bought Starlancer.  After playing the game for 5 hours, I was disappointed.  2 days later I was downright appalled.
Descent Freespace 2 raised the  bar for what a space sim should be.  Starlancer is nothing more then a  colorized version of Wing Commander. Sure, there's alot of action, and the  graphics are purty, but it could have been better - alot better.  Actually  they should have called it Freespace Lite - For Dumbies.
First of all,  it's downright impossible.  Even at the easiest setting, I barely managed  to finish each level.  Why?  The enemies weren't' that hard to destroy.  It  had to do with the fact that your ship, no matter which ship you choose,  couldn't carry anything worthwhile.  In Descent Freespace 2 (DS2), the  ships could carry dozens of missiles of various types.  In Starlancer, you  have 3-7 hardpoints which carry one missile each.  Yep, one missile.  Except for the screamers, which come in 20, but they have no lock-on  capacity.  Imagine trying to kill 10-20 ships each level with 4 missiles.  And the worse part is you can't reload!
And then there's the fuel.  Even though it's 2160, you're still using solid fuel, so if you tend to use  the afterburner (which you need alot because everything is so far apart),  you'll have to install fuel pods, which limits the missiles you can carry.  So now you're left with 2 missiles, which makes the game even harder.
And  then there's no logic behind it.  At the beginning of mission 8, the enemy  carrier is launching torpedoes at your carrier.  Your carrier informs you  to just attack the fighters and disregard the torpedoes, because their  cannons will handle it.  Yet 30 seconds later, when enemy bombers jump in  and start launching ALOT of torpedoes at your carrier, the carrier begs you  to shoot down all the torpedoes before they are destroyed.  So  you command  your wingmen to destroy your bomber, but since they're so inept, it takes  them 15 minutes to destroy 1 bomber. Meanwhile you're chasing back and  forth shooting down torpedoes.  I had to replay that mission at least 8  times because the wingmen couldn't tell the difference between a bomber and  a hair dryer.
Communication Remember how in DS2 you had complete control  of your wingmen?  In Starlancer you only have three options: help me,  ignore this enemy, or go home.  What happen to guard?  What happen to  rearm?  Even though half of the missions require you to guard a freighter  or convoy, you can't even tell the wingmen to guard it.  And the worst part  is, on the keyboard, you use 1-6 to change camera view. Pressing  ""C"" will bring up the communications display, then you hit  ""1"" for talking to the enemy, ""2"" for talking to your  wing, etc..  But since it's so slow, if you hit C then 2 really fast, it  will change the camera view!  So if you need to issue commands in a hurry,  you can't, because the screen will change view!  Who's the genius behind  this?
Graphics The graphics are the best part of the game.  The engine is  basically the same as Privateer 2, except with some heavy tweaks.  The  blackness of space is replaced by distant nebula and asteroid fields.  But  the odd thing is, you're flying around in our solar system - there's not  suppose to be nebula in this area.  Ships blow up in little pieces after  you destroy them.  Each weapon has its own look and feel.  Missiles leave a  trail of smoke after you fire them.  But it's not nearly as good as  Freespace 2, where deep space is alive with nebulas, comets, galaxies,  planets, etc.
Also there's little things.  Every time you play another  mission, you have to change your HUD settings. You can choose what displays  are shown - missiles, guns, damage, etc.  If you turn it off on a level,  when you start the next one, it jumps back to the default HUD display. So  you have to waste time setting the displays back to what they were before.  And then you can't bypass the in-game cinematics, which just takes  forver.
Starlancer should have been called Wing Commander 6.  Except for  the graphic overhaul, the introduction of online gaming (which is pretty  cool) and  the new ships, it's the exact same gameplay, same commands, and  same missions.  After 2 days of Starlancer I went back to playing Wing  Commander 4.  Sure it's outdated, but at least it's got Mark Hamill.",2.0

"I've played several sonic games(14 to be exact), and this one is probably the worst. It's probably the best one on genesis, but I don't have a clue what they were thinking when they made this one. there's nowhere to run or speed up in this game. in the console version, I used to dash through the loops and run down the spirals until time ran out. in the fist zone, the only place where you can even come close to having fun with the sonic speed that made the series famous is going down some hills on a rickety set of tracks in a mine cart. Infact, I didn't see a single loop, or any spirals, or anything relative to one. there is hope though, sonic chaos is so much fun that it's probably worth 12 copies of this game. the most important thing to remember if you want to buy sonic 2 for game gear is not to expect anything nearly as good as the console version, so get sonic chaos.",2.0
The controller wasn't fully original and the n64 had broken pieces along with a black marker mark on the part where you put the games,2.0
"So first we created a bundle that included Zelda OOT and MM, The smoke N64 system with matching controller, a rumble pack, a expansion pack, the AV and power cables for the system, and a memory card. I purchased it and shipping did not take to long but the box it was shipped in looked like the package from the opening scene of Ace Ventura... Besides that the rumble pack had a very strong vinegar smell and I opened it up to find corrosion on the inside of it and some oily substance was all on the inside of it. I cleaned that out and tested it and it works so I didn't want to complain. I was able to test the rumble pack after finding that the AV cables did not work as well as the Expansion Pak that was sent to me. That in itself was a issue and had to call the seller and they sent me out another set of cables and another 3rd party expansion pak. That much I have to say was nice of them and the cable situation was done. But the expansion pack they sent me would work for 4-7 minutes before the system would go to a all black screen and was in operable. I know they system is not completely messed up as I have played threw Ocarina of time with no issues at all but attempting to play Majora's Mask is impossible. I am not sure if the initial port that the Expansion Pak plugs into is bad or if I have been sent 2 messed up Paks.... An the thing biggest reason I gave it two stars was because the few times I called about the Expansion Pak issue I was constantly told that everything was in wonderful working condition and was tested before it was initially shipped... (I can either take it as there are in directing putting blame on me or that they are hoping I did not care and was just going to drop the issue and idk... not care i guess) I still have yet to get the expansion Pak issue fixed. I will say they might have some knowledge about the business but the execution of the transaction and customer service after the initial purchase was sub-par...If I was not in the process of moving at the time and had the time to test it right when I received it I would have asked for a refund as I had stressed to them my main concern was that everything being is perfect working order.... cosmetic shape was not a issue as long as it all worked well.....",2.0

"I have been enjoying the ace combat series for sometime now. But this one leaves alot to be desired. The mission briefs were dull and very uninspired. The missions themselves were very similar. It didn't take long before one mission seemed the same as the next.  The aircraft designs were very cool and that was the best part of the game. Some of them were nigh brilliant. Although most of them were enemy aircraft.
  I finished the game in around 3 hours which makes its lasting appeal minimal. I am waiting to see what they are going to do on the PS2.

"If you have played this game in the arcade or on a Dreamcast unit you know how fast and colorful a fighting game this one is.  Truth is it is one of  the best 2D figthers you can play.
Here is the bad news though,  if you  own a Playstation and want this translation you will be disapointed when  you play.  First of all the lack of the tag feature really does kill this  game.  Without being able to tag in another teamate mid battle it takes  away some of the games statagy.  I think it also seems to move and load  much slower on the playstation than in the Dreamcast.  We just have to face  it, this game is a next generation game on a five year old piece of  hardware, and it just does not live up to its true potential.  I love my  plastation, but I have to advise all to pass on Marvel vs. Capcom for it.

"This game was pretty fun until you get to level 3, then it is almost inpossible to get past the bridge while a chopper is shooting at you, not to mention about 10 tan troops. The only way I beat the level was with gameshark, but if your going to get a Army Men game...get Army Men Land*Sea*Air or Army Men Sarge's Heroes 1 or 2. Once I got done with level 3 (with a lot of help from gameshark) I took out the gameshark and couldn't even move on the next level without getting shot or wounded. It is also fantasy for you of those who like real war games, it takes nine shots to die! I didn't like this part of the game either, you don't even get a platoon to go through the levels, I mean on Ghost Recon, you get to have a platoon of 6 soldiers. You would probably be better of to play with your little brothers toy soldiers it would probably be funner. I wouldn't recommened you get this game (Save your dough), I would for surely recommened Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Island Thunder.

"#1 - VISIBILITY. I had to screw with the brightness on my television just so I could see the opening screen right. Everything is in a million shades of green, and you'll be constantly running into obstacles, trying to turn yourself around while an enemy slowly chips away at your health.
#2 - DIFFICULTY. On the easist setting, I still can only get three levels into the game. It's not that I'm a lousy gamer, it's just that certain spots where there may be a concentration of plastic helicoptors, infantry, etc., are next to impossible to get around. I let a friend who is an excellent gamer borrow it for a week, and he couldn't get any farther than I did.
#3 - TWO-PLAYER MODE. Two-player modes are supposed to be fun. This one, well... isn't. The levels are too big, and you'll spend ten minutes hunting down your friend's flag, and once one of you gets the other's flag, it's too easy to cross back over into your territory without getting caught.

"Not anywhere as good or fun as the original Armymen 3D. This game has one and two player modes. The graphics and fighting environments have been ""improved"". There are times when your soldier cannot walk under a  leaf or around a small rock, the zoom feature which worked so well in the  original has been replaced with an inferior much slower zoom/aim feature.  Ammo crates so easy to see and obtain in the original have been replaced by  icons that are hard to see against the background of plants and rocks. In  two player mode you are not able to assign your allies to attack or  defense, the computer does it for you. While playing the computer I noticed  the artificial intelligence seemed to get confused, for example while  attacking a villiage a bunch of tan soldiers ran to attack me, they then  stopped and stood there while I blasted away at them. You are often able to  stand in sight of the enemy and get no reaction, even in the hard setting.  Many actions are slower than in Armymen 3D. On the bright side it is better  than Sarge's Heros, there are no bathtub battle senarios, this is more  realistic. It is cool the way you have to ""finish off"" the  wounded enemy. I was real excited about this game, I bought the day it went  on sale, it was a real let down to me. We will just have to keep playing  the original to have fun game play. You will find nothing like Snake  Canyon, Cabin Fever or Tanks Alot in this new game, sorry back to the  drawing board.",2.0

"I would like to start out that even though I gave ASB 2001 only 2 stars, it is a decent game. It's the kind of game that you sit down and belt out a few hard earned homers and then quit. I didn't like how hard home runs are to hit in the home run derby. You hit the ball and it just goes.... no sounds, no commentary, only the repitiveness of the dull crowd. In Triple Play, you hit a home run and you know it. The crowd knows it also and you get the warm fuzzies all over. As for the competition, it was incredibly easy. I think i lost one time when i was the minnesota twins playing against the cooperstown legends. Nolan ryan smoked my batters, but they only won by a 7th inning Mr. October homer that barely cleared the left field fence. Besides that, it's an OK game to play against your friends for a bit.

"Gameshark for Dreamcast... three of the most eagerly anticipated words from well before the Dreamcast hit the market.  Then when it did, it was found that it was capable of enabling a small number of imports to be playable.  This alone sold tons of the small wonder.
Then, the bomb was dropped: Interact encrypted the codes.  Why?  Because Interact officially declared (and in as many words), that they were the ONLY source for Dreamcast GameShark codes...you want codes, you go to the official gameshark site and take what they give you.  Which, as many have found, is pathetically few codes.  The Game Shark Code Creators Club devised a method to create codes for it, and were promptly nailed by Interact.  So now, other companies have developed their own, non-encrypted solutions, and I'm getting one as soon as I can find one (probably Xploder)
But back to GS CDX... it's VERY poorly designed, fails to fit in MANY popular controllers, and develops contact failures in mere months.  I hope the other companies do better.
The only reason I gave it a 2 star rating is for the partial import ability, but when the contacts fail, it's all over anyway.

"The concept is great, but the game stumbles on several points.  A couple points have been well-covered (third-person view is clumsy;
too much of the game depends on figuring out what the game designers wanted you to do); in addition, there's:
1) often the puzzles are logically inconsistent.  At one point you have to kill a limo driver, but later on the limo is driven off -- by WHO???  In another level, you have to pretend to be a guy working at a club, so you can get to a point to also pretend to be a patron of the club.
2) The game consists of a series of assassinations.  Each one requires planning to get the job done, which is reasonable; but often the planning requires information that can only be found by playing the level then losing, then playing the level again.  This is kind of missing the point of the planning parts of the game.  It's not really ""planning"" when all your doing is playing then finding out what doesn't work.
3) You can't save in the middle of a level.  This is annoying enough, but it's really annoying when you're in the middle of a level then the game crashes.",2.0
"Never having heard of this game, I must say that I was excited to begin playing. (How can a game where you portray a hitman go wrong.) But immediately after beginning gameplay I realized that this game was somewhat of a disapointment. I have to admit the graphics and sound effects were good, but the dull settings and boring gameplay ruined it for me. At times I found myself wondering streets aimlessly searching for some type of meaning within the stages even after having had read the objectives. I don't consider myself to be an incompotent regarding games, but this game was entirely too strict as to how and in what order you complete levels. (Expect to repeat levels more than several times in order to appease the program gods.) There are no savegames within levels so if you are an unfortunate, and make a minute mistake, you go through the whole boring process once again.(From beginning of level.) I give the game creaters credit for attempting to create a game with some realism, but if you are looking for a great third person shooter I reccomend you try ""Max Payne.""",2.0
"Hitman is a fun game packed with a ton of weapons, baddies and confusing missions. It starts you off in a facilty were you begin training with the arsenal of weapons provided for you. A year later the party begins.
The pros for me were the graphics and the large selection of guns and knives. The option of wearing the baddies outfit was a pretty great feature too.
Cons, the way the missions were to be carried out was stupid. Story line was flat and the several bugs in the game got annoying. Another was repeating the same mission over and over from start because there is no save feature. And one that always got me was how certain missions left you stranded.
All in all it was an okay game that found its spot on the shelf along with many of the other games i have. This is a probably the only game I lost interest in after the first day.",2.0
"Looking at the box of this game i expected it to be really cool, and from reading all the reviews that say it was good, but when i bought it, it was a very large dissapointment.  After the first few missions the game becomes so frustrating, that you will want to break your computer.  The controls are very messed up, and the camera fews always get stuck on walls so you can not see anything.  This game is frustrating because 90% of the game is trial and error.  If you go the wrong way you become ..., because most of the missions are timed ... so you lose the mission.  I got to admit the visuals in this game are very eye pleasing, but it doesn't not make this game worth the ... that it is.  HC47 also had tons of glitches and bugs in its system which eventually ... the ... out of you.  Well my opinion is not to buy this game, but u can try it for yourself, and see what you think",2.0
"The initial thought of the game seems good enough: trying to break down the all-too-linear approach to first person shooters, and give the player alternative ways to finish off your objectivies. But this is exactly where the game fails. The missions are clearly designed for two specific approaches: (1) Blast your way through (which is remarkably easy) or follow a very fixed stealth route. The first level could be an example. Here you are supposed to assassin an important trial member. You can then either choose to shoot everything that moves, or get on top of a building an snipe the target. Those are basically your two options. And quite frankly, I had expected a much more open gameplay.
The computer A.I. is also horribly bad. On one level, you can easily stand against a corner, shoot two guards that are in the room, and then wait for other guards to come running in and shoot them too (all the time you hardly take a hit). Here's another example: At one point you're supposed to kill a trial leader. After having disguised yourself as a waiter, you attempt to give him a poisened bowl of soup. Unfortunately for the trial leader's bodyguard, he has to taste the soup and ends up dying. There's a cinematic gunfight where the leader escapes. Now here's the thing: after the gunfight, everything returns to normal and all the trial guards in the resturaunt doesn't seem to have noticed anything.
The positive thing about the game are the graphics. The movement of the characters are fairly realistic. I especially like dragging corpses behind me and watch how their bodies bump into furniture and such. If you try dumping a body over a toilet, you'll see how it slumps down the side and falls to rest on the floor. Very nice. The jungle levels are also impressive, with the trees and the plants.
But as they say: gameplay above graphics, and here ""Hitman"" fails miserably.",2.0
"I got this game cause my cousin gave it to me.  The concept sounded awesome - like you're this hitman going around doing missions and killing people.  To be honest, I have not finished the game.  The action is very slow paced.  You have to plan things out.  There's no way you can finish a map the first try cause you have to know the pattern.  For example, when the limo driver makes his routine routes, or when the bad guys go inside the shops, or when the bystanders are not looking, etc.... At first it starts out really fun - like everyone has mentioned.  But as I progressed in the game, the missions got a lot bigger, harder, and more complex.  Even the maps get more bigger and it's so big that it takes forever to get around.  sometimes you have to do 6 sub-missions on one map, which can suck because if you screw up on the 4th sub-mission, for example, then you gotta start all over again.  basically it's a lot of trial and error.  I'm more into fast paced games like Half life and counter-strike and Unreal tournament and Delta Force so this wasn't my type of game.  I basically got bored of this game and it does get frustrating.  Maybe it'll be better with a cheat or whatever.  But I'm going back to playing counter-strike and Unreal Tournament.

"After purchasing Deux Ex and falling in love with that game, I looked within the Eidos family to find another FPS with the same kind of action and functionality as Deus Ex, after reading many good reviews on Hitman I decided to give it a day in court.

As for the systems extra features well, the DVD  feature isn't bad but not as good as a dedicated DVD player and the  backwards compatibility feature is pointless.
Right now I wouldn't  recommend buying a PS2.  For the price, it's not worth it.  Wait a few  months after the release for a price drop and hopefully by then there will  be some better games too.

"This game is fun, if you are willing to accept the fact that the programers were on an extremely tight budget. If the programers beta tested this game enough they would have worked out all the problems that prevent this game from being AWESOME.
  First, I must point out that it is ""real time"". Meaning, time is ticking while you are clicking/scrolling through your list of units and commands. Time is always ticking. If the interface was fast and efficient there wouldn't be a problem, heck it might even be realistic. But at best it takes too long to issue simple orders, and to play the game successfully you will be issuing dozens if not hundreds of orders. All the while the clock is ticking.
  Why is the clock so important?  Because you are dealing with an enemy that has ships, aircraft, subs and MISSLES appraoching fast. If you can't issue orders fast enough, you will always lose.  Like I mentioned the interfact is clunky and very inefficient.  The programers could have made it much much better.
  Also, common sense moves that in the real world would take place almost automatically, don't happen. You literally must issue orders for every little action. As if each ship or aircraft doesn't have a captain or pilot to make common sense desisions. Example: If an Air-to-Surface missle gets too close to one of your AEGIS ships, the ship doesn't automatically attemt to shoot it down as would happen in the real world...naa the computer waits for you to give the order. But it is often impossible to give every order in time when you have a dozen missles coming at you, a dozen enemy aircraft and a dozen enemy ships to be aware of...annnnd in addition to mainatining your air/sea defense, you have to carry out your offense. This is all in real time. Thus because the game is so un-userfriendly it is virtually impossible to do well in most scenarios.
  Other complaints,
1) the game doesn't come with an instruction book. Sure they include it in the ""read me"" file, but you cannnot access it during a game.
2) The game AND the 'read me' files do not define/explain any of the weapons systems that are used in the game. So without that information it is impossible to play the game with any chance of winning. You either have to be a Naval warfare expert to know what each sytem and weapon is designed for, or you must buy a reference book that describes each weapon system and its mission explained.  Without this information the game is not playable.
  Such a waste. This game could have been AWESOME. If the game designers would have put a little more effort into it, this game might have won awards.
  My advice, play but don't expect to not get extremely frustrated.",2.0

"All digimon fans out there rejoiced when this game came out, and so, so many were disappointed.  Why?  Lets see Holy Highlighter's standard breakdown:
GRAPHICS:  2/10 - This game SORELY lacks, by any standards.  While I wasn't expecting it to rival high-end RPGs by high-end companies like Sony, Konami, and Square, this game's graphics are remniscent of the earliest playstation games, and I thought developers had moved far beyond this.  Blah!  Blah!  At least the FMV is decent.
SOUND:  1/10 - Ok, the sound quality is just God awful.  That, and the digimon sounds are really damn annoying, like the fact that a blaringly ugly sound is made every time a legless digimon ""hops"".  You would think that since this game would only become popular due to the TV show that they might have included the theme song...but no, of course not!
CHARACTERS:  5/10 - The characters are decently developed, I suppose, and reflect the typical air-headed attitude of the TV show.  The biggest gripe of most gamers is that none of the TV characters make an appearance!  What's the point of having a Digimon game without any of the characters from the show?  Another fatal misstep on the part of the designers - most of the awesomely cool, powerful digimon from the show never show up.  There is also very little control over which digimon your basic digimon evolves into, which annoys me greatly.  The other annoying aspect is that every 2 hours of gameplay or so, your digimon dies and you have to start the process all...over...again.
PLOT/STORYLINE: 2/10 - There isn't one.  That's all there is to say - the whole ""lets bring digimon back to file city"" crap is not plot, it's a pathetic excuse.  99% of the actions of the digimon do not revolve around the plot.
SYSTEM/INTERFACE:  3/10 - The battle system is unique, which is the only plus this game has.  In order to make your digimon even close to usable, you have to play an assortment of ""minigames"", where you walk up to a sign, press a button, and lo-and-behold, your digimon gains stats.  At first, I thought that letting the digimon participate longer in this game would make them gain more stat points - but it doesn't matter, so basically more mindless button mashing is all that this thing does for you.  Battling is 99% of the game, and it gets boring relatively fast, especially since every 10 seconds or so you have to feed/clean up/immunize/rest your digimon.  Even tamagotchi aren't this needy!
But there must be a positive thing somewhere, right?  Well, yes, the game is amusing for about an hour, before you realize that it's just repetetive and doesn't pass off as an RPG, or an action game, or anything else for that matter.",2.0
"Too many feedings and too many bathroom trips gets
annoying fast. What did they put in the food-prunes?When
on the training field,i often had to stop training just so
my digimon could use the bathroom. Most of the time,my digimon
didn't make it to the bathroom on time,resulting in a rather
unsightly little pile. Another gripe is that my digimon
evolved into the practically useless Numemon 98%of the
time. I often let him get killed off until I got a digimon
I liked. My advice is to rent this game.",2.0

"You would think that a game based on jedi light saber fighting would be a guaranteed hit, but Lucas Arts missed their mark again.  The fighting is similar to the first Phantom Menace game, but enough already with the jumps.  Hello video game developers- you do not need jumping in a 3D game, this isn't Mario Bros.  It's disappointing when you work your way through a level only to be stopped at the end trying to jump from one ledge to the next.  Also the game play is lacking.  I've only had the game a short time and I've had screen freezes a few times.  I encountered the same problem in Phantom Menace.  If you're a Star Wars fan, I guess you have to get it, but if you're choosing between the 2 titles, I would recommend Phantom Menace over Power Battles",2.0
"I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  I've played it for hours and hours and gotten a lot of fun out of it.  But there are three things that I have done my best to overlook but cannot:

1.  That the thing is full of bugs!  Presumably this is because it was rushed to ""press"" to coincide with the release of the 4th STAR WARS film -- who knows?  But there are many times when your guy will suddenly die for no reason because you fell down some invisible hole, that kind of thing.

2.  Your lightsaber is absurdly weak.  In the movie, the Jedis lightsabers cut through those droids on Naboo like butter.  In this game, you'll be giving them three or four whacks.  That doesn't look right, and that's not all:  the droids can give you a vicious uppercut that will fling you back about 20 feet or so.  It makes for some absurd viewing.

3.  Back in the day I remember a couple of gamers who nicknamed this ""Jumping Jedis.""  Jumping challenges are par for the course with such video games, I guess, but the problem was the program's lighting, shadow-rendering, resolution -- or whatever -- was not good enough for such contests to be fair.  There's one fairly hellish sequence on Tatooine where you can't tell where your guy is, how far he has to jump, which way exactly he is facing, etc.  I think the game should have toned down all the jumping challenges until they were able to render the graphics with enough precision that you can tell where your effin' guy is on the screen.",2.0
"This game is Very boring, all you do is kill the andorids in your way (which is Easy to accomplish) and then your faced with a big robot(and you think that is the end of level 1 it NOT) then you kill more andriod then your faced with a bit space ship. This game reminds me of the old Mario bros games, where you walk foward and get to the end. I was excpeting this game to be more like Spyro with hiden rooms, challanging villians and clues to figure out this game is so NOT like that!!

Also my biggest Pet peeve about this game is you can not Save it at any time. You have to complete the Whole level before it will let you save your game. After playing for 3 hours and not finishing level 1, I unfortunatly died and was NOT allowed to save my progress. I had to start ALL over from the begaining. It took me another 4 hours to finish level 1 (after starting over from the begaining 50 times) When I finally finished level 1 I was FINALLY allowed to Save my game which SUCKS. If you get tired and want to save the game and come back later you CAN'T you'll have to finish the level before you can save it.",2.0
"The one word to best describe Shenmue is not ""groundbreaking"" its repetative. Talk to 50 persons to find the one with the clue to carry the game forward and when you get that, repeat! Action is sparse and senseless wandering is essential to the game. I HATE talking to EVERYBODY to discover that I have to go to meet someone the next night! To make things worse youu can't skip time so you really have to wait and wait and wait. The ""Quick time events"" are cool but too far apart to save this snooze fest. Shenmue got old after Disc 1 and went downhill from there.
The graphics are awesome and the idea behind the game is cool but not well done. This game can put you to sleep faster than sleeping pills. The worst part of this game is working in the harbour for 5 days and having to do that stupid forklift race each day, yawn and tedious to the MAX. I have no desire to finish the game as you never face the bad guy, not even in part 2 you just keep walking and talking, walking and talkin, walking and talking (get the point of this game). If you like wasting precious life that could be used to live then this is for you...otherwise get a more fulfilling gaming experience elsewhere.

"This game is one of the most time-consuming and frivolous games out there for the Dreamcast.  The missions are dull with hardly any decent action.  The one quest that stands out in my mind the most is one where you have to find Mr. Yakamoto.  You are given no idea as to where he lives and go door to door trying to find him.  It always happens that his house is the last you look at.  Another problem is the fact that many of the quests are given to you at one time and you have to wait 24 hours before you can actually do them.  There is no way to make time go forward so about 35 of the 40 hours needed to complete this game will be on waiting around for the place you need to go to open.
This game is very disappointing and if you are somewhat interested in it, borrow it from a friend.  If you don't have any friends, then only dish out the $6 to rent only if you think you might like it.",2.0
"Bottom line on this game is it is boring. Visually it's pleasing (very accurately done Japanese town), but game play and pace gets old quick. I am 29 and have played 100's of games, I love RPG's as well, but this game requires no thought, no challenge, no puzzles, little excitement???!!! Only puzzling thing is trying to figure out which drawer to open in Ryo's house, and trying to get him to pick up objects correctly so you can find things, very frustrating and a waste of time. I played the game up to the 2nd disk, got into a few easilly won fights, and spent probably 20 plus hours running from one person to the next, listening to bad, boring dialog, waiting for something interesting to happen. Games should be exciting, and not feel like a job. Worse yet this game made me want to give up on gaming all together and step out into the real world , where I can have decent conversations with real people (Bad sign developers!!!). I felt like I was doing homework or something just to play this game. I hope developers will get a clue in the future, make the game exciting, with puzzles, and plenty of action. Plot should develop rapidly, not take days of looking for some lame object that would be easily found if the interface only worked right. Needless to say I am going to sell this game and find something better to play.",2.0
how can this game be good if you can not even control your fielders. So what i am trying to get to you is what kind of a baseball fan likes a game where the computer controls your fielders and not you. There are also other glitches in the game like sometimes in the infield your infielder runs in place before catching the groundball whitch results to the computer being safe on first. There is one good thing world series baseball 2K1 has good updated rosters for the 2000 season not the 2001 season. Also pitching to the batters can be fun but with all the glitches and not being able to control all your fielders drags the game down to a two. I really had high hopes for 2K1 to bad the game is not good.,2.0
"This game has some cool features--the batter/pitcher matchup is reasonably good; players are (except when they're sitting on the bench) very realistic-looking.  It also doesn't eat an entire memory card like NFL 2K--just a little over half of one.
The bad news, though, is that there are some INCREDIBLY big problems with gameplay.  Number one: FIELDING FIELDING FIELDING.  The worst are grounders through the ""gap"" between first and second.  The first baseman is apparently unable to move even three feet to his right in order to snag the ball.  Ugly.
Number two: baserunning. How many major-leaguers have *you* seen running on an infield popup with less than two out?  Play this game at all, and you'll see guys who get paid more than the GNP of some small countries making that very same bonehead move.  The player has to physically remind his baserunners to return to base on a pop-fly.
These two very large problems are enough to really take a lot of the enjoyment out of what would otherwise be a very good game.
There are some other problems, too: the little graphic that shows where the ball (tiny white pixel), defensive players (tiny blue pixels) and runners (tiny yellow pixel that is nearly indistinguishable from the ball) is almost completely useless. The fans in the stands look like something out of a Nintendo 64 game. There's no way to skip past the incredibly awful renditions of the national anthem at the beginning of each game. The replays aren't very interesting. The commentary is wooden and nowhere near as well-done as in, say, one of the excellent NFL games. The controls are not always very intuitive or responsive (especially irritating when you're frantically pressing B to get your idiot baserunners to return to base while they blithely jog along, finally realizing that Oh! You want them to DO something!).  These are all pretty petty little quibbles, really, and none of them would be enough to really make this a bad game by themselves, but when combined with the fielding and baserunning problems, the annoyances just mount and mount until you want to chuck your controller at the TV.
(Barely) worth the $15 I spent on it used--for the graphics and to tide me over until WSB2K2 comes out in a couple of weeks.",2.0
"A total waste of time!!  Never has a game with such potential and mouth dropping graphics been soo horrible.  I got the game thinkin I could get atleast a little enjoyment out of what seemed to be a great game.

No lie here, the worst baseball game to date, hands down. Just take my advice, stay away!",2.0
"I expected a lot from Sega as they have delivered on almost every account of the ""World Series Baseball"" series (no pun intended). Also with the Dreamcast finally deciding to show its true ability, I saw stills of this game and was in awe. This very quickly ended as I first played the game. Oh my god, yes the graphics are amazing. That is where it ends. Players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs. But this cant save the game. The control is quirky at best, batting is a real hastle. Hmm, perhaps defense will  be better. No, quite the contrary. There is absolutely no fielding whatsoever. The ball flys in the air and the computer moves a player to the spot then u decide which base to throw too. Sound like fun? Didnt think so. Lets go try another mode. HA! No extra mode for you! We are presented with exhibition and season. Oh well, lets try playing a season with some of our friends. Nope, cant play on the same team as a friend. With lack of extras, poor control and lack of it as well, and no team playing, this game avois a 1 star with its amazing graphics. This game is horrid to play and I strongly suggest playing Tommy Lasorda Baseball for Sega Genesis over this game. At least you can field....",2.0
"This game has great graphics,dont get me wrong. The gameplay is horrible and stupid. My advice don't play it.",2.0
well i gave the game 2 stars because of how it looks  .... it LOOKS great........  but gameplay and well everything ealse about the game is horrable...  there arnt enough words in the world to say how horrable this game is.,2.0
"Well, the graphics are amazing and the batter pitcher interface is smooth  and well thought out.  The rest, however, should have been worked on a  little more.
The greatest strength is by far the pitcher batter  match-up.  When playing against another player, the game simulates reality  very well.  The pitcher can set up the batter like in a real baseball game.  You can throw a fast ball high and tight, and then fake the batter by  going low and inside with a change up.
The biggest problem I have is that  about half of all at-bats are pop-ups to the infield.  The rest are  harmless grounders or strikeouts.  This game is incredibly difficult to hit  with, and makes it lack really any playability.
Other problems are that  stats are not readily available at the end of a game, the sound is  reminiscent of a bad Genesis game, controlling runners is a pain, and there  is not much control on defense.
This game is like an untested prospect,  lots of potential, but not really ready for the big time.  Best to wait for  World Series 2002, if the Dreamcast can survive that long.",2.0
"Remember the OLD World Series Baseball games for Genesis and Saturn? They  were great, with a ton of features not found in other baseball games. Plus,  they were tons of fun to play. Well, unfortunately, they both put World  Series Baseball 2K1 to shame.
  Don't get me wrong. As nice-looking as  those old games were, 2K1 looks much nicer, with nice, smooth animations  and very well rendered ballparks. In fact, the game starts off with a bang  with a great intro featuring some of the more exiting plays from the game  and almost photo-realistic graphics at times. However, as any gamer knows,  fun in videogaming does not rely on graphics. Think about Pac-Man. The  graphics are very primitive compared to the new state-of-the-art stuff, but  it is still a very popular game because it is so addictive and tons of  fun.
Sega has played a cruel joke on us with 2K1. Of course they'll hype  it as being a great game, but it is very, very far from being great. In  fact, it is not even very good. Here are a few things to consider:
1.  Auto-fielding. Excuse me, I think the players would like to control what  happens in the field! Especially when you see some of the stiff and/or  jerky plays they make. Plus, once the fielder has the ball, it's your job  to throw the ball to the infield and you can only use the analog stick.  That means if your thumb slips, you might throw to the wrong base.  Aaarrgghh!!
2. No batting control. You just swing. Period. No switching  between contact or power hitting, just swing. Tap the R trigger and the  rest is up to the computer.
3. No color commentary. This makes for a very  quiet game. The crowds are half-dead, too. Even the music is quiet and  annoying.
4. Iffy pitching control. The pitching control is decent, but  is below-average compared to most other baseball games.
5. None of the  ""little things."" No wind. No homerun derby of any sort. No funny  or interesting commentary. No motivating music to pump you up to play. No  getting to make the exciting plays yourself. No fun.
I really have to  wonder about Sega. People have been waiting for quite a while for this game  and you'd think they'd have put their hearts and souls into it. That didn't  happen. Instead, they released a game that would show a lot of promise if  it were HALF done. I mean, compare this with NFL 2K or NBA 2K. Not only do  they look great, but they are also FUN! And that's what it's all about!  This is a rental at best. Give me the original World Series game on Genesis  anyday over this...thing!",2.0
"This game was fun for the first two full games I played, since then it has been more fun being used as a frisbie.
Sega failed to include some  critical aspects begining at the core - player controlled fielding.  They  also failed in the multiplayer aspects of the game.  I have two roomates,  therefore most of our game playing is done in a multiplayer mode. Sega  failed to allow the user to play any part of season play out in multiplayer  mode, thus if you are looking to collect stats on a given team you must  either play by yourself or grab a pencil and scorebook and track them  yourself.
They also failed to include some key elements of other  successful baseball games (i.e. homerun contest, batting practice,  etc..)
Overall I think this game was rushed to be produced, and Sega felt  the great graphics (which are truely great) would carry this game over its  many flaws.
To those considering a purchase: wait till next year...",2.0
"I have to agree with the other reviewers.  Batting is VERY difficult.  They put up the strike zone, but then give you no indication of where the  pitch is heading until it is past you making it alomost purely a guesing  game to try and hit the ball.  I can't even tell you how disapointing it is  that there is no Home Run Derby (I don't feel like playing a game all the  time).  The graphics are cool and the stadiums are up to date (including  PacBell Park in SF).
Overall, I'm bummed I bought this game.",2.0
"The game has great graphics and and very smooth gameplay but, the biggest problem with it is that you cant even field so when the CPU hits teh ball  you can just sit there and wait for the CPU on your side to get it. It  gives me the feeling of little control. The pitching could be better. I  mean come on you got this little circle with lines pointing off of it in  different directions you have to look in the book for WSB 2K1 to find out  which pitch is which. The aiming thing to bat. I hate that even though they  do have a cheat for it. Well I think they could have done a hell of a lot  better.",2.0
"I admit it, I was extremely hyped about the release of World Series Baseball 2K1.  I remember going to various Dreamcast sites and seeing previews.  To put it briefly, I was amazed.  The graphics looked stunning,  and because of that, I figured the game was going to be like the rest of  the games in the Sega Sports line: awesome.
How wrong I was.
As soon as  I put the game into my Dreamcast and began playing an Exhibition match, I  realized how terrible the game was.  As each inning passed by, my disgust  for the game became more evident.
Here are the problems I have with the  game.  Though the graphics are stunning, it constantly causes the game to  slow down and stutter (i.e., when a runner steals the base and the catcher  gets ready to throw it).  I found the batting difficult and hard to  understand.  Most of all, and what caused me to return the game, was the  fielding.  (Ahem.)  Excuse me.  THERE WAS NONE.  You have no control over  fielding whatsoever.  I have no problem with having no control over  grounders, but fly balls, that's another story.  The only control you get  is throwing the ball.  (Whoop-de-...-do.)  This made the game horrible  and boring.
The reason I had to give the game 2 stars instead of 1 was  simply because of the graphics.  That's the only good thing about the game  - the graphics.  Even though they do cause the game to slow down many  times, they are still stunning.
But, overall, that doesn't matter.  World  Series Baseball 2K1 is a horrible game.  Sega Sports should be ashamed of  releasing such a shoddy game.  This game was a terrible way to start out  the World Series line of games.
Do yourself a favor.  Take the [money] you'll save by not buying this game and buy tickets for a real baseball  game.  I promise you, you'll have more fun trying to field a foul ball than  you will with this game.",2.0

YAWN!!!!!!!!Yes it looks pretty but unless you like long drawn out storys and watching a game more then playing skip it .....",2.0
"AS all the other reviews have said you can't control the defense. You control where they throw the ball but fielding ground balls and pop ups is  done by the dreamcast. This leaves no exciting diving catches or robbed  homeruns. Also the outfielders in the game are pathetic. There are more  bloop base hits in this game than in any other games combined. Plus all  throuws from the outfield are thrown like rainbows high slow floating  things. Then when you do throw into a base there are no sweep tags, there  are slow two handed tags leaving many runners safe even if the ball arrives  much earlier. The pitcher is your best defender. He makes jumping catches  and all kinds of spin moves to throw runners out (automatically of course).  The automatic defense isn't even that good. You will hit a grounder to the  right side of the third basemen and he will dive left.  I will say that the  pitching is high control and well done. Hitting is another story. It is  very well done. You release the R trigger to swing making it difficult to  time the swing. This makes it very challenging but will all kinds of  handicaps and difficulty options you can handle it. It takes a while to  learn but it is a lot of fun when you do. True there is no Home run derby,  no playoff mode, and no bull pen but the graphics are amazing except for  the fans. Don't buy it because not being able to play defense is just  ridiculous. What a idiotic terrible job by Sega.  And don't rent it either  because it takes at least that amount of time to learn how to hit.  2 out  of 5 because of graphics.",2.0
"NFL2K and NBA2K were wonderful. NHL2K was okay. MLB2K1 is just a further regression. I am not a hardcore gamer. I only enjoy playing sports games.  Since the previous games were so good, I had high expectations for this  one. I almost feel mislead. The slowdowns are horrible. There is nothing  fluid about the gameplay. Sure the graphics are good. That is what you paid  for. It is almost impossible to hit. The CPU does its best hitting when you  are winning and have two outs against it. It becomes rather frustrating.  Not having control over your players is also a negative aspect of the game.  To play Defense, all that you need to know is which bag to LOB it to. Not  too challenging.  I was all geared up when the Dreamcast was released. I  figured that the sports game would improve after NFL2K. Why does it have to  take so long to release these games? After reading other reviews, I would  say that Sega has some kissing up to do with its gamers. If not, I will be  the first one to sell the Dreamcast to buy a new Sony once released.",2.0
"This is the worst baseball game I ever played. I had moreenjoyment reading the negative reviews on this than actually playing this game. Every negative review about this game is 100% correct. The only good thing about this is graphics. Game play stinks (I don't want the computer fielding for me or running bases)and what ever happen to the infield fly rule. I was cought up in 5 tripple plays because the batter popped up in the infield with two men on base. This is crazy!  A total waist of money. I'm putting this game up for sale after only having it for 1 day. ... Sega need to be sued for false advertisment. Most of the info on the back of this game is false. No hot or cold zones, no 32 different pitches (if there is, the game book doesn't tell you how to throw them), can't control base running, the men on base are running on every hit ball no matter what base they're on or the amount of outs in the inning.

"First off, let me say what was fun about the game.  The day my package arrived, and I took the wrapping off.  That though, was where the fun ended.  I found this game to be absolutely horrible.  As others have also  written, who in the world thought of putting auto-defense into this game.  If I don't want to control the players in my game, I'll turn on the TV and  watch the Cubs.  The auto-defense doesn't even seem to work a descent  amount of the time anyway.  I've watched my centerfielder sit there for  quite a while pondering the thought if he wants to move to catch the ball,  and guess what?, most of the time he decides not to catch the ball.
This  game also appears to be stuck with a terribly chopping frame rate.  I've  watched my runner on third run home, and when there is a play at the plate  the game goes into slow-motion.  I don't know if this is supposed to be  some sort of graphic effect, but whatever it is, it's not good.
The  batting is a unique new way to play, but it is not really to my liking.  Base-running is oftly difficult to control too, the analog control stick is  not the greatest for this feature.
I feel I have wasted my [$] on this  game, and I don't suggest others do the same.  I will either be putting my  game on [auction] soon, or [trading it] for a copy of Virtua  Tennis. Sorry Sega, graphics do not make a game, I want to actually be able  to play my game.  Overall, D+!",2.0
I can some this game up in one word lame . The only thing in my opinion this game has going for it is the graphics. What moron thought of the idea  of having computer controlled fielding. That takes the fun out of the game.  Though the pitching is ok and the batting is almost acceptable i think if  you want a good video game get virtua tennis,2.0
"If you are a true baseball enthusist, I think you may be disappointed in this game. If you are only into graphics, you will be pleased. What I am  basing this off of is my history with N64 All-Star Baseballs. 2K1 lacks the  following in comparison: Lack of control of fielding, minimal graphics,  & the inability to strategize your game (pitchouts, directing bunts,  etc.) Oh yeah, and if your into replays, forget it unless you are stealing  or get a simple base hit (better get a good look at those 475' bombs the  first time. I'm glad my friend bought it before I did.",2.0
"Perhaps you have to be born in... to find any kind of realism integrated into this game, where you are given a world of overly-drawn out and extremely tedious back and forth game-play.  Don't get me wrong I am a big fan of adventure games, in fact they are my most perferred genre of gameplay.
The acting in this game is completely off the wall and at times becomes intensely boring.  Such as the scene with that one guy at the port, (he looks like some Elvis type punk), who acts so weird its almost horrifying.  You're telling me that this same guy who earlier in the game tried to beat me up now wants to be friends, that makes a lot of sense.  And what is with having to go back to your house every night, this guy must be really whipped.  I could count probably 30 times when I was told to visit some restaurant, but it wasn't open until like six hours after I was told.  So what am I supposed to do; use the pointless shops and games that simply take up memory.  Or I could talk to the many many old people who tell me they know nothing.
This idea of getting a job is stupid too.  I was ok with it the first time, but after a while it becomes so repetitive that I start to go into convulsions.  These mourning races, if you want to call them that, looks like old men riding in electric wheelchairs to a finish line for no purpose at all.
Half of the videos in this game are pointless.  Like talking to the little girl about her kitty, ahh, how cute.  Whatever!  Not once did that fortune teller lady give me any concrete help either.  The fight scenes in this game hardly have anything to do with the real plot line.  They seem to be there simply to show that he's a ""cool guy.""
And lastly to help and get a little good out of the game I will end with the positive points.  There are definitely somes points in the game where you are aching to see what will happen, but of course this will only end in another set of ""ask the hotdog guy"" or ""talk to the crazy old man who eats pigeon crap in the park"" scenes.  Don't buy it unless you have extreme control for overly-praised, overly-la-la-land realism, and ""ooo let's throw in a bad word"" to boost someone's image gameplay!  Love and kisses Shenmue.",2.0

The true test of a baseball sim is how much it can emulate the  technical game of baseball, with all of its intricasies. This game falls  short in so many ways it would take me hours to list them all. In a  nutshell, the hardcore baseball fan will find this game very disappointing.",2.0
"I was all pumped up about Dreamcast's first baseball game. I went out and reserved the game. Bought it the day it came out, and found out that it was  a huge disappointment!  I've only played it twice so far, but I could tell  that they were in a hurry to get this game out! First of all, THERE's IS NO  HOMERUN DERBY in the game!  If you think about it, ALMOST ALL baseball  games have a home run derby. Why doesn't this game have one?  Another huge  let down was that this game only allows up to 2 players. That's pretty sad,  considering NBA2000 and NFL2000 gives you the ability of up to 4 players. I  also found that it was unusual that you have to hold down the ""R""  button then release it to hit the ball. Also, PacBell park doesn't look  like the real one. The only thing that the game has going for it so far is  the graphics. It is by far superior then any other baseball game out there.  Now keep in mind that these were the things I caught after only playing it  twice. It probably has tons of glitches such as NBA2000 and NFL2000. Don't  get me wrong, there all great games, but they need to stop putting out  games in a hurry!",2.0
"This game is not a complete lemon, but it's clearly not all it could be. The promised hot-cold analysis of hitters is non-existent. There is no  option to turn off the automatic fielding; this is especially irksome when  outfielders don't actually try to catch the ball or do, and then stand  around admiring the lush environs rather than making the play at the plate.  Your baserunners are worse than T-ball players, taking off at full clip  when a Texas-league fly goes up with no outs. Thus, you have to manually  send them back EVERY TIME, which they don't even do with consistency, much  less aplomb. Then when you want them to tag up and run, they don't go  anywhere. On the plus side, the pitching interface is well-done and  intuitive. The graphics, of course, are very good, and that's important,  but even they seem incomplete. Baserunners seem to be missing a frame of  animation, giving one the impression of waddling to first base. Create a  player is good, allowing you to choose from numerous batting stances (some  based on actual hitters) and pitching styles (for pitchers, obviously, and  also with some based on actual players). The game generates fairly  realistic scores, and can create some nail-biters, but really only in  two-player mode. At least with two players, when your shortstop refuses to  throw the ball or your rightfielder is too busy eating a hotdog to make a  catch, there's an even chance of it going for or against you. I haven't  played very many baseball videogames, so I feel like I'm fairly  unpredisposed to harshness, but just play this one before you buy, and if  you're a hardcore videogame baseball fan, I'm betting you'll want to take  on this wild pitch of a game.",2.0
"This game has great graphics, excellent player models and intense realism.  But the hitting interface is incredibly difficult, and nearly impossible  to judge pitches.  And this game commits the greatest crime of all, the  fielders on your team field automoatically and there is no way to change  this.  It is ridiculous.  Even NES baseball games let you field the ball.  What were they thinking?",2.0
"I had to wait all this time for this?  I was VERY disappointed with this game!  It just isn't fun to play!  Sure the graphics are pretty realistic,  down to the player's faces, but that's the only strength of the game.  The  sound effects and announcing are terrible, the crowd in the stands looks  very fake, and the game play is the worst.  The computer does all of the  fielding for you, including running to and catching all ground and fly  balls.  All that's left for you to do is to throw the ball after the play  is done.  What fun is there in that?  I love making plays on defense, but  this game doesn't even give me a shot!  The pitching is pretty bad too,  requiring you to aim your pitch and select the pitch speed at the same  time.  It just makes pitching harder then it needs to be.  The hitting is  ok, but not great.
If you have Playstation too, stick with Triple Play.  It is much more fun to play than this is.",2.0
"This game has the best grapics ever for a baseball game. Its just amazing how real all the players and stadiums look, but that's about all the  positive things that can be said about this game.  I will never buy another  game again without renting it first. This game has the worst game play  ever.  Someone in Sega decided it would be more fun if the person playing  the game could not take control of a player and field the ball.  Yes that's  right all the defenders are automatic.  Its a baseball game that all you  can do is hit; there's no defense involved at all.  If I wanted that kind  of game I should have bought a home-run derby. The hitting is strange  instead of pushing a button you release the R trigger to swing.  This makes  timing the ball near impossible.  And almost all the other controls feel  unnatural and not in the right places.  I was disappointed to hear ESPN  baseball got pulled, because this game proves why Sega is a second rate  video game company.  They hype up a game saying its the best ever and  deliver nothing at all.  I felt ripped of when I got the game home and  played it, I wish I could have gotten my money back.  I'm sure everyone who  pre-ordered it and ran out to the stores when it came out feel the same  way.  Don't make the same mistake I did, just wait till next year and hope  they do a little better the second time around.  This would be a no star  game if it wasn't for the grafix.",2.0
"At first sight the game looks fantastic.  However, upon playing it, it gets more boring with every inning.  First of all, you don't have any  control over your defensive players aside from positioning them before the  pitch.  Once the ball is in play, all fielding is automatic.  You only  select the base to throw to once the ball is fielded.  Secondly, many of  the throws are entirely unrealistic.  Pitchers backhand a ball and then  jumping, firing a laser to first while in mid air on a slow roller back to  the mound?  Hitting is equally ridiculous.  You need to hold the R button,  position the circle where you think the ball will be, and release when you  want to swing.  Most of the time your either early or late.  And how about  a home run derby, or batting practice.  This game has none of it.  The  sound is poor at best.  The graphics are good, except for the lollypop  throws the outfielders make to the infield.  Your trying to tell me Griffy  Jr. can't throw a pea to second from mid-center?  If you buy a game for  looks, buy this.  If you want to play the game, wait for something better  to come along.",2.0
"yes i have had this game for about a week and i have allready completed all three dics. I give this game 2 stars becouse in the book it said to have the object of the game by april 1987 and you start in dec. 3,1986. Now don't get me wrong the game is great and the game play is great,but any game that take's 6 years to make sould take at least 2-3 mounths to get threw. If the people that made this game plan on have more dics to buy that's great they would get more stars but only god knows how long that will take,look it took 6 year for this one if it take another 6years for the next by then you will have no clue on what's going on in the game.",2.0
"With all of the hype surrounding this game, I thought it would be a whole lot better than this. Of course by now you've heard about the great graphics. Okay, I'll give you that, but I want a game not a movie, so I care about how it plays and that's where 'Shenmue' falters. The gameplay consists of punch-punch-kick style action and at times it's restricted to you hitting one button along with the movie scene. 'Yawn'. I actually dropped off a little during part of it; no joke. While it is certainly a technical achievement, it's more movie than game.",2.0
"Well I have to tell you that I couldn't wait to get my hands on Shenmue.  Then I did get my hands on it and I was quite disappointed. How long can you walk around and have the same people tell you that they will talk to you tomorrow? Don't get me wrong, the graphics are incredible on this game. Better than any of the current PS2 games that are out there, but it just didn't live up to all the hype given to it.  Some people love it.  Some people hate it.  I found that it is a beautiful game and a kool concept, just not for everybody.  And mine and my friends both started freezing up at load points.  So, on a final note, I think that shenmue is a testimonial that game companies should stop worrying about how kool the games look, and focus on just giving us good games with good plots. Like how about some more F.F. games. PLEEEEEEASE!!!",2.0
"when i bought this game, i expected it to be full of action, as well as puzzles, but when i popped it into my gbc i was disapointed. unlike past wario or super mario games , there is no action, only very difficult puzzles. you are invinsible, which might seem cool at first but, no you have to get hit by a certain ememy to get some dumb power like being flat to solve a puzzle. i cant even get past the 3rd level, and i DONT suck at video games. only buy this game if you like puzzle platform games, my friend loves it. i gave it 2 stars because some people will like this, just not people looking to replace a real SUPER MARIO game, such as mario word or mario 64.",2.0
The joystick on this thing was far from being a little loose. It was completely broken. I tried playing Zelda and he can't even run when pushing the joystick all the way up. The only reason I gave two stars is because I can replace the joystick and I like the color. That's about it.,2.0

"It's time that Nintendo realized that their Game Boy system needs to be upgraded. Rare did a good job before with their original game squeezing 32 bit technology into the 16 bit Super Nintendo. Unfortunately they had to remove some of the best features that made this game so popular: Superb stereo soundtrack and both characters on the screen at the same time. There are also many places in which the game slows down significantly because the poor little Game Boy can't take more than 5 moving characters at once. The playability also seems to have declined.  If you have long since gotten rid of your old Super Nintendo, why not download some Super Nintendo Emulators from Plasticman.org and get the ROM and play it exactly the way it was presented in 1994? Not as compact, but you get the idea.",2.0
"When I first bought this game after getting my Dreamcast, I thought it was decent. I really didn't like the time limit, I didn't like the fact that the ""spray"" button and the ""center camera"" button were both mapped to the same button, and I didn't like the mediocre frame rate. But I liked the graphic style, and the soundtrack was pretty cool.

After playing the Xbox-only sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, I realized that it had everything this game was missing. Why put the primary function that needs a clear view on the same button as the one that resets your view - especially when there's no manual camera control (a problem with many Dreamcast games)? Answer: Don't, especially when there's a whole other button (the right trigger) that isn't being used. JSRF fixed that problem easily.

Why have a time limit when your character both moves slowly, and is always being chased by police? Answer: Don't. Get rid of the time limit, speed up the character's movement, and restrict the police encounters to certain areas. JSRF fixed those problems easily.

I'll admit, the better graphics and frame rate are the result of moving to a higher-powered system instead. So I won't fault the game for not being on better hardware when said hardware didn't exist at the time.

It might seem like I'm just bashing this game for not being the second one, but...actually, that's exactly what I'm doing. Jet Set Radio Future is more fun, less frustrating, has better controls, and (since it was briefly the pack-in game for the Xbox) is going to be cheaper. Buy it, and leave this one as what it is: a rather uncomfortable stepping stone to a smooth rock that's aged far better.",2.0

"Okay so if you played the first Medievil game you will notice the difference in overall actions and screen panning difficulties this game has. I notice that when trying to kill a zombie or are being surrounded by a few of them you have to run, dash around and swipe them with your sword and this gets annoying because the sword isn't soo quick or swift this time which can result to your life gauge being eaten up so quick. Which brings me to my only positive remark about this game is that when you go to refill your life gauge it is quicker than before. This game isn't worth the money and the levels aren't near as fun as from the first medievil game.

Sincerely,
an honest reviewer",2.0
"The 360 turning view in this game is just as bad as the first one. If you are standing next to a wall or tall object, the turning view gets messed up bad. You can turn your view with the L and R buttons but the game itself often turns your view automatically in a wrong direction which is really annoying. After you go thru a doorway you find yourself facing the opposite direction. When you make a jump the game will sometimes turn the view on you in the middle of the jump which makes Dan fall to his death. You have to fight the auto turning with the R and L buttons which subtracts from the enjoyment of playing.
  In the first one you could always replay the early levels to fill up on life. In Medievil 2 you cannot. The life fountains are gone for good once you use them and the life bottles do less and less. In Medievil 2 The missions are longer and more tedious. They are more ridiculous. It is virtually impossible to figure out what you have to do in many of the missions without a complete walkthrough. It is virtually impossible to beat this game without using the cheats menu because otherwise the game doesn't give you enough life to survive. The monsters in this one are harder to hit and it takes more hits to kill them. In ther first one Dan had a deep voice, in this one Dan has a higher pitched whiny voice which is also annoying.
  Medievil 1 is a great game that is fun to play. Medievil 2 is a tedious game that is only fun to play if you have the cheats menu. To get the cheats menu, first pause the game, then hold L2 the whole time while you punch the buttons in the following order: (TCT CCT LCU DRC LLT RCL LTC DCCR) Those are abreviations for Up, Right, Down, Left, Circle, and Triangle. Then cheats will appear at the bottom of the paused menu, then you can give yourself infinite life.",2.0

"At the time this game originally released I was a young teenager.  I was hungry for videogames and had all the time in the world.  At this time, I played and beat The Legend of Dragoon.  I loved it.  Since those days I've often thought fondly of this game.  Now in recent days, I've completed the game for a second time, putting in nearly 50 hours.  What I've realized is that this game belongs in the past and I want to warn anyone considering picking up this game.  If this game is ever remade I'll be in line for it.  Until then I suggest we leave it in the past.

Story 9/10
The greatness of the story is timeless.  Truly someone took put a lot of effort into writing this story.  There are a lot of great twist and the character development is wonderful.  You'll start to connect the with characters in no time.

Visuals 4/10
For the time these visuals were top notch. By today's standards these graphics are lacking.  This is to be expected.

Sound 4/10
The soundtrack is perfect.  I could listen to the menu them all day.  The music in this game blows me away every time I listen to it.  I didn't really notice anything wrong with the sound effects.  The voice acting in this game is really bad and often goofy.  Not to mention occasionally during cut scenes I couldn't make out what the characters were saying.  There are no subtitles available during some scenes.  Very disappointing.

Mechanics/Gameplay 2/10
Normal movement in the game is occasionally hinder by invisible catches which is slightly annoying.  The battle system is somewhat lacking and get old really fast.  You are required to do timed button pushes for your normal attacks.  It's fun for a few minutes but not 50 hours.  My biggest complaint is that you cannot skip certain battle scenes.  Every time you cast your dragoon magic you have to watch a short scene.  I'm pretty sure I could have cut my playtime down by a FEW HOURS if I didn't have to watch these things every time.  The final boss also has a lot of scenes.  Heaven forbid that you should die halfway through that fight.

Basically my play through this game as an adult netted me nothing but some nostalgic enjoyment and watching a great story unfold again.  The gameplay itself was little to no fun.  Almost like a chore.  So now I warn you, leave this in the past.",2.0
"I played it on my PS2 and got to the 2nd disc after some lagging in the 1st disc.

"What a generic title. Given the game, that's par for the course. The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I've played on the Playstation. It's sort of sad, in many ways, that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX, and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.

What's generic about it? Damn near everything. The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire, and who is designated the ""chosen one"" by a pendant, previously possessed by a mysterious stranger. Can you even name how many other games that borrows from? Do numbers go that high? And I forgot to mention, his representative color is red. Of course, the empire is still on the prowl, and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.

And that's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors. Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII, which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing, but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it. The Legend of Dragoon wasn't just several years behind, it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.

While the story is generic and perfunctory, it's not really the problem. Let's talk about the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as ""additions."" When one chooses the attack option, a reticle focuses in on the enemy, and a button must be pressed to time with the animation. While this basic idea has been done in other games, like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VIII, and the Mario and Luigi series, The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat, and that's a fatal error. While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned, the important thing is that they didn't slow down the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack, and when you miss, you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy. Random encounters, which are the majority of the game in RPGs, take forever and feel clunky. The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.

The look of the game is very generic as well. While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine, the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated. The in-combat look is marginally better, and while the Dragoon transformations look good, the default character models aren't very detailed, and neither are the enemies. The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.

As far as I'm concerned, the great-looking cinematics don't count when we're talking about graphics, though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great. But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game, or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within, or Shrek for that matter, if that's all you care about. The art design of the game doesn't lend itself to Playstation's technology.

I hesitate to speculate on matters like this, but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII. The game looks an awful lot like that game, with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one. I wouldn't call that an improvement.",2.0

"I played this game for several days, because although I was having very little fun from the start, I couldn't identify the reason.

LOD had none of these problems, but I just couldn't get into it. I got all the way up to disc 2, and yet it still felt like pulling teeth just to turn on the PSone, so I put it away and bought .hack. I wound up having a lot more fun, even though that game's story didn't make any sense--go figure. By reading the reviews here, it seems that plenty of other people were disinterested too, so I'm not alone I guess :)",2.0
"Legend of Dragoon is one of those games that you either love or despise, I of course belong to the later group.

As one reviewer already mentioned, Legend of Dragoon was Sony's answer to rival Square-Enix's insanely popular Final Fantasy VII. I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that can't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.

I don't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread (I actually like the Wild Arms series the most), but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics, which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.

Outside the graphical engine, Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category. Lame enemies, lackluster story, generic locations, and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever (it's really that bad). Fights are also annoying due to the so-called ""Additions"" system which has you doing timed hits all day (yeah, that's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack).

Other problems also arise, such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations, meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items (which you become way too dependent on in this game, and can only carry so many). Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.

Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG. By that time you'll realize that this is not what any and all PSX RPG's should be compared against. Even if Final Fantasy is extremely overrated at times, even the worst FF is better than this. I don't think I'll play this one again.",2.0
"While Legend of Dragoon is entertaining and sometimes fun, the flaws make it a hastle to play, in my opinion.
The storyline is excellent, though I would have preferred they expanded on the history of Dragoons a bit more.  I can't complain about the dialogue or the storyline at all.  The problem is in the battles and the graphics.
Sometimes the graphics are just horrible, which surprised me considering how late in the PSXs lifetime this game was released.  I don't know if the designers just got overzealous or what, but the graphics turned out only so-so.
The battles......For example, before EACH and EVERY random encounter, you get around 10 seconds of camera shots, of the monsters and the characters and the scenery.  10 Seconds may not sound like much, but when EVERY SINGLE ENCOUNTER has this waiting period, you'll start to think about what else you could be doing with your time.  It doesn't help that the attack animations, especially of the monsters, get very repetitive.  One starts to wish the monsters would just hurry the hell up so you can end the battle.
The way to defeat enemies quickly and without losing is to use Additions.  Additions are combination attacks that you set in the menu before battle.  But, you can only have one addition set at a time, which means that every time you attack it'll be the same combo.  Also, in order to execute the addition, you have to push the controller buttons at EXACTLY the right time after the initial attack in order to pull it off....which isn't hard in and of itself, except it gets VERY old very fast.
ALSO, in order to get better additions (which do more damage and raise your power more) you need to use your older ones over and over - about 80 times each or so.  Which may not sound like much, until you take into consideration that additions may fail, or you could be interrupted with a counter attack....or that you simply have to go through HUNDREDS OF BATTLES to get all the best additions......each battle taking forEVER to complete thanks to the camera panning at the start of the battle and the long drawn out attack animations.
After getting about two thirds of the way through the game, I just put it down and didn't pick it up until a year had gone by and I had had sufficient time to forget how horrible the battles are.  Even so, I almost didn't finish the darn thing, but I wanted to see how the story ended, though I didn't want to read a spoiler.
The story was THAT compelling, and almost makes up for the horrible battles and sub-par graphics.",2.0
"Being a fan of great storylines and the classic RPG battle styles, I did not care too much for this game.  The story was good up to the end of the second disc, but then I just got bored with it.  I didn't like the whole battle system and the fact that the amount of items you could carry was very limited.  I will admit, the animation is pretty good, though, for PS one.",2.0
"Basically, this game...it's awful, I have never played such a horrible RPG game, actually, I've never played such a sorry game in my life.  Yes, Dragoon does have it's cool points, the plot is pretty cool, the music is much better than the traditional music in most RPGs, and I have to admit that I do LOVE the fact that the characters talk (Though the voice overs in the battles really sucked, they could have gotten better actors for those voices...)  . I give them credit for that, but this is where it stops.
The graphics: For such a recently released game they're horrible.  All squares and no curves.  my big problem with that stems from the fact that I played FF9 at the same time I was playing Dragoon, and...LOD's graphics never stood a chance against FF9, though from my understanding, they were released at about the same time. I'm a graphic's person, I expected outstanding graphics from the game considering it was in 2000.  What I got were graphics worse than the ones from FF7, which was released like...what? 5 years ago?
Battle scenes: two words: TO LONG. . .I mean, come on people, you don't have to spend 5 minutes to head to battle.  It takes approximately 7 seconds for the little screen to fade out (I time w/ stopwatch) which is entirely to long for an RPG, the average time for all the others is between 2 and 3 seconds.  And the battle music, that's horrible, I love most of the Dragoon music, but the battle music was awful. Additions where all right,  but pointless because it's just additional hits with a sword, nothing special.....
FMV's: There weren't enough.  There were at least 5 scenes I saw that should have been done as an FMV, all pretty and round and smooth and good looking, but no. Those five scenes are square people running around looking stupid like square people do.
My overall opinion of the game is that it shouldn't have ANY stars, but...because there were a couple of thigns that kept me pleased through out the game (Music, talking characters, a great plot, and wonderful FMV's when they actually got around to actual FMV's and not squares...) I'll give it a 2.
I found myself bored out of my mind playign this game but since I payed the 40 bucks for it, I decided I wasn't going to let it go to waste...either way, playing it or no, the 40 dollars was a waste in my opinion.  The game is DEFINITELY not my kind of RPG.

After Beyond the Beyond, Legend of LeGaia, Wild Arms, and Wild Arms 2, I thought that maybe SONY could get an RPG right, especially with the large production crew and time in development. But alas, they cannot. I would recomend that you pass this game over, or you will probaly find yourself putting the game on the shelf at Disk 2, and feeling like you had just been slapped in the face by SONY's iron hand....too bad.
P.S. ( it only scored a 2 b/c despite it's horrible plot and writing, the game contains wonderfully pre-rendered backgrounds, and stunning CG movies that rival Squaresofts.)",2.0
"Legend of the Dragoon is an extreamly long and noweher near as interesting as the TV comericials make it seem. There are afew areas where the graphics  shine. If your hoping for a role playing game that allows you to effect the  story line, this is not it. The nost challanging part of this game is  fighting a handfull of monsters (each of these battles takes a minium of  1/2 hour). This game pushes you though a horribly long story line, battel  sequences are extrealy repetive, and travel between towns is poorly  animated. I found the best part of this game is the attack additions.  Spells and time spent as a dragoon is extreamly limited and the endinig is  disapponting especially after playing for over 60 hours. My advice is save  your money and keep looking, better games are out there.",2.0
"I purchased Transformers Beast Wars Transmetals based on the great reviews I read from other Amazon reviewers.  After playing it, I wondered if they  were talking about the same game.
 I am a diehard Transformers fan, but  the gameplay and lack of characters in this game did not hold my attention  for much more than an hour. The fighting engine is probably one of the  worst I have ever seen.  The camera angles during the fighting sequences  sometimes makes it hard to figure out what is going on.  The different  fighting terrains was a nice touch but it doesnt help the poor gameplay.  If you are a fan of the Tekken based fighting games you will be highly  disappointed by this title.
As far as 3-D fighters go, you are better  off with Tekken 3, MK4, Dead or Alive, Soul Blade or Bloody Roar....these  games are much more fun for single or multiple players than Tranformers,  Beast Wars, Transmetals.",2.0

"This game was actually a freebie when I bought Star Trek Deep Space Nine Dominion Wars. I recently bought Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which was made a year before this Warp 2 sequel.
Starship Creator Deluxe has much more ship constructions to chose from than the new Warp 2 has to offer. In Warp 2 you only get Akira, Soveriegn, Intrepid, Constitution, Defiant, Galaxy, and Klingon B'rel Class Ships to construct. In Starship Creator Deluxe (which by the way includes Starship Creator and Starship Creator Add-on) you may construct from more than 10 different ships - Excelsior, Miranda, Constitution, Defiant, Akira, Oberth, Prometheus, Soveriegn, Intrepid, and Galaxy. Warp 2 has less ships and the missions are pretty boring. You could sleep through it and the mission would still be successful. The computer plays the missions out without any real play control from the player. You can however design that dream starship you always wanted to create. If you really want to buy a Starship Creator, I would recommend buying the Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which allows the player to create 10 federation ships whereas Starship Creator Warp 2 allows only 6 federation ships and the additional one Klingon B'rel. On a plus side, Warp 2 allows the player to export their designed ships of Akira, Galaxy, and Defiant into Star Trek DS9 Dominon Wars multiplayer mode for gameplay online. However the Galaxy class starships that are exported into the Dominon Wars Game turns out to be invisible (A really big bug/glitch!!!) Some ships appear to not have been modified at all during exporting - such as Akira class ships and they appear to be discolored (example: Engines powered down, and lights on the ship are off even during combat).

"For those of us used to the high-tech graphics of Blizzard Games or those of us who are die-hard Trek fans, Starship Creator Warp 2 leaves us wanting for more.  True, it's pretty cool to customize your own starship and then run it on various missions to ""take it for a spin"", but the starship choices leave much to be desired. What about the Miranda, Orbeth, Nova, or Nebula Class starships, or any interesting Klingon ships?  The strategy guide is a POSTER that only tells you the very basics in Starship and Mission creation and the website is completely useless. So unless you plan on using this program to augment your Dominion Wars game, I would not recomend it to anyone.",2.0
"This seems to be the general sentiment about this game and its true: It has all the problems that the first version has.
 You get more ship hulls to work with, that is true, but that's about it. The game still has the same lame missions that take forever to play and ARE NOT FUN! Also, the user interface is still pretty much the same.
 The developers needed to make some major changes in this version, such as being able to captain the ship you built (even in a limited ""Star Fleet Academy"" manner) and to unlock better hulls and equipment other than using the ""credit"" system. How about promotions to higher engineering positions? That makes more sense. I downloaded a money cheat so I could mess with different hulls without playing all those tedious missions. This extended the game's life on my PC by a week but I still got frustrated by not being able to fully interact with my creations.
I though that was the whole point behind this game.",2.0
"I had such high hopes with the first release of this game, which, while  intriguing, had the potential to be so much more. I quickly tired of the  execution and gameplay but not the concept, so I was excited to see a  revised version was out. Unfortunately, Imagery has done little to address  or improve on the problems I had with Version 1. Don't get me wrong: this  concept is top-notch: build your own Starfleet starship, with customized  ""parts"" available to make it look different (radically-shaped  saucers or nacelles), name it, staff it, upgrade it with equipment and  necessary engine parts, and send it off on missions which earn you more  credits to buy improvements, more ships, etc. Unfortunately, the execution  is poor and lackluster. My biggest complaint is the `missions' which can  take up to 7-10 minutes (even at double-speed play) and require no input  from the player: they are visually uninteresting with no challenge, and  even the exciting music stops after about 30 seconds. I was really hoping  that Version 2 would improve on this, with more fully interactive missions  and *more* of them...unfortunately not. There's a lot about the framework  of this game to admire, but even I, who's not a game designer, can think of  several improvements that would have made this top-notch in addition to  improving the mission variety and interactivity: give us an easier way to  customize our own officers and crew than programming in HTML-like  files--why not a series of `generic' Starfleet human and alien portraits  and an in-game entry section to add names, ranks, specializations,  background data, etc. How about giving your crew the ability to rise in  rank on successful missions (or fall, or die, on failed ones)? How about a  simple AI program that would help guide you through the construction and  refitting process and remind you what you've forgotten to install or need  to repair...maybe in the form of verbal hints from Scotty? (""Och, ye  need to add transporter circuits before ye head out of dock, laddie."")  And on and on. I could rant all day, backseat piloting a Version Three,  but instead I'll put the ""Star Trek Starship Creator Warp 2""  CD-ROM away in a desk drawer with Version One, and reflect on what Scotty  once said in the original series: ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me  twice, shame on me."" Got no one to blame but myself for buying this  game again. But I won't be aboard for any version three.",2.0

""Lotus Spring"" was aimed at women, as an alternative to regular PC games. I am their target market -- a woman interested in games, but not compelled by the majority of games out there, which are clearly aimed at young men. That is still a great idea, but this product misses the mark.

Or is it just that we aren't smart enough to solve real puzzles? I also found it odd that you were playing a male character.  What kind of message is that?

"okay the graphics are stunning and about as good as the humble ps1 is going to get but I've got quite a few criticisms of this game so here goes:
1) Its hard to know what you're supposed to be doing half of the time so a lot of the gameplay is spent running around doing nothing.
2) The combat is ok, but it can be VERY annoying a lot of the time due to the 'affinities' of weapons and the 'risk' system.
3) Weapons and affinities are a good idea, but the way they are implemented is dreadful. I found it infuriating.
4) The weapon creation system is appaling and it is almost impossible to find a combination that does anything. And when it does there is no way of checking so it ends up just as a (bad) time wasting issue.
5) The story is okay but its hard to get a feel for the characters and get involved with the story as in mgs and ff games.
Overall, I wouldn't buy this game(...).",2.0
"Quite frankly this game doesn't live up to all the hype.  I still can't believe how people say the graphics are so good since they are all completely dull dark and dreary, not to mention blockier than most SNES games I've played.  The sound is nearly non existant.  hardly any music in the game at all, just a plethora of drips squeaks squeals and puking noises.  Gameplay isn't too bad, though it isn't exactly the most fluid I've ever played, and the objects in a room tend to get in your line of sight all too frequently, no matter how you swing the camera view.  The battle system is a Parasite Eve clone thats been tuned up to the point of being almost too complicated to use.  it takes practice for certain.  The monsters are outrageously easy if you simply use hit and run tactics.  the bosses on the other hand tend to be amazingly hard if you don't know what you are doing.  Plot is relatively non existant in this game.  the opening movie pretty much gives you the basic run of the game.  the game tends to lead you around by the nose for the first hour or so and then you have a very limited number of option available for the duration of the game.  Its just another dungeon crawl.  I love Dungeons and Dragons but even that gets boring if you do nothing but one dungeon exploration after another and thats really all this game is.  the true value of the game comes from being able to find a multitude of weapons and armor and then being able to make use of various workshops to combine those items into more powerful armaments.  unfortunately this is tedious and time consuming, taking up more than 3/4 of the game.  Overall they just took a rather bland game and tried to cram in all kinds of technical stuff, taking nearly every RPG option you could think of and trying to put it all in one game.  If i wanted to spend all my time reworking weapons i'd have been a blacksmith in life.",2.0

"When you see the ""Vertical Stand"" and ""Horizontal Stand"" listed next to each other, you may think that they're similar products. Don't believe it.
If you stand your PS2 unit vertically, a hard jolt _could_ cause the unit to fall over, which _could_ cause damage to a disc in the drive. The vertical stand will prevent this from happening. This is A Good Thing.
If you stand your PS2 unit horizontally, it will not fall over unless you pick it up and drop-kick it. (And if you do that, the stand won't do anything but injure your foot, and you'll probably void the PS2's warrantee.) A stand is _not_ necessary for a PS2 in the horizontal configuration. The Sony PS2 horizontal stand will _not_ improve your PS2's stability. It will _not_ lift your PS2 by more than an eighth of an inch or so. It will _not_ make it easier to access any of the PS2's controller ports. It will _not_ significantly improve the PS2's cooling. In short, the PS2 horizontal stand has no practical use whatsoever.
So is it a completely pointless product? Not quite. If you look at the picture, you'll notice a raised blue strip at the front of the stand. When you install the horizontal stand, this raised blue strip covers the bottom half-inch or so of the PS2 (at least the parts of it not used by the ports). In my opinion, this _does_ make the PS2 look marginally better (though it looks perfectly reasonable on its own).
So if you're looking to make a minor fashion statement for your PS2, then by all means, buy the horizontal stand. Just don't expect it to be anything more than that.",2.0
"Most people who already have their Playstation 2 in a secure cabinet or on a table don't need this.  But, if you have you PS2 just sitting on the floor you might want to think about buying one these.  Some people might think that this is safer than vertical stand but it really isn't.  On the PS2's DVD-ROM there is an extra piece of plastic that holds your game in place if you have the vertical stand.  If you live somewhere there are a lot of earthquakes and you are paranoided about your PS2 then get the vertical stand.",2.0
"According to Sony, when the PlayStation 2 was first designed, it included the blue bar that comes with the horizontal stand. For whatever reason, they decided to remove this feature. Maybe to get to get us to dish out another 10 bucks, but most likely because while it looks cool in the horizontal position, the blue bar would look pretty bad when the PS2 is used in the vertical position. Asides from that, the horizontal stand is completely useless. It does not add any extra stability to the unit, and when you pick up the PS2 to move it you must move the stand too, they do not become attached. If I were you, (and I did the same thing), I would put the 10 bucks towards a vertical stand, which is both cool looking and useful.",2.0

"The System, itself, is fully functional. However the controller is broken(I mean this literally, since if you don't hold it right, it falls apart).

"I was one of the guys who bought this game the first day - I was that excited.  There are 3 things wrong with it, and they are wrong enough that there are better games to buy.  First, it takes forever to build up to a good car.  Truthfully, unless you want to spend hundreds of hours, be content with the little boxes.  But mainly, the controls are too touchy.  The cars have serious difficulty being controlled, and the only people who will argue with me, are children and people without a life - so they don't mind a game that is sort of like a relationship.  This game abuses you from time to time.  3rdly, the interface is so tedious, that you go from menu to menu.  Again, the only people that will love this are those who feel satisfaction for figuring out how to run it.  Forget it - get ""Test Drive LeMans"" = it's much better, or ""Test Drive V-Rally"" or ""Sega Rally 2"".  In my opinion - they all offer a better gaming time.",2.0

The game also left me cold with the way it drove,none to realistic. If U like your games heavy on the arcade side this game will please U, but if U have a drivers license and want to live out your racer's fantasies this game will disapoint!

"The graphics in the game are nice.  I think the visual models of the cars are not bad, although some of them reflect poorly and look like they are made out of clay rather then coated in high-gloss paint.  My real beef with this game is the handling of the cars.  When I first started racing the game, the 600cc car I drove felt like a marshmello, and I was excited, thinking that as I worked my way up through the cars, I'd get better and better handling.  But, after playing several cars, and racing ones that I'm familiar with in real life, I found that they were ALL modeled after a marshmello.  The handling is just awful, both with the hand controller or a steering wheel.  Sure, it is challenging to herd the cars around the detailed tracks, but I was hoping to actually feel like I was driving.  It is impossible to spin a car, even a 500hp car in 1st gear in sand!  Every aspect of driving is missing refinement and realism..  The only reasonably modeled driving games I've seen yet for Dreamcast are Monaco GP and Revolt.

".

Off the top... If you're a videophile, buy for gaming only... not as a DVD player. I'll explain in a minute.

The latest PS2 77001 series isn't going to have PS3 or 360 graphics - but for $129.99 its still impressive.

If you stay below... say a 37"" in a 16:9 format, maintain a reasonable distance from the screen you should be pleased.

And for $129.99 it does well... as a gaming machine.

I own a 47"" 1080p LCD.

Picked up the latest PS2 and am irritated the unit will play certain games (not all) in 480p but not DVDs. Secondly, if you have a HD 16:9 set as I do the unit only produces 4:3 (Standard) and 4:3 (Letterbox, NOT 16:9). Up-converting sets like mine taking 480i to 1080p simply looks like [...].

It does have an optical output and will send both DD and DTS.

It has an Ethernet connection... no WiFi nor BlueTooth. It has USB connectors. Yes, you can go on the internet and connect a keyboard and mouse.

Be further warned...

Sony states the PS2 should not be hooked up to a plasma and/or projection tv as it will cause burn (damage).

My experience so far... each game, if capable of 480p play, has to be instructed to do so manually and then the setting has to be stored on an optional memory card or each play will require the same setup.

Unit comes w/ a proprietary 3 pair cable (Left/Right/Video). If you want SVideo (SCPH-100060 U) or component (Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr) audio/video (SCPH-100100 U) you'll need to purchase an additional cable. I did and I'm not impressed. Granted its better than composite video but not by much.

"Although the PS2 was the leader of the last wave of consoles it was the least appealing in graphics and game play. I personally would suggest the Xbox if your into features like a internal hard drive with out memory cards, crisp graphics, custom sound tacks, online play out of the box, responsive analogs and controls, or the Nintendo game cube if controls, children's games, and even easier game play matter to you more. I would not recommend this to any one unless they have a soft spot for the controller which is comfortable but when it comes to game play it is the least responsive or if you really like kids RPG's or final fantasy games. The DVD player is an awesome feature but too beware of over heating on the smaller model but this is a very rare problem. Personally I think it has always been over priced. If you notice it is still the same price as the Xbox, which has greater features, or the game cube that has better graphics and better first party games. Now I did point out allot of negatives about the system but it really is the least impressive when it come to actual games. What is impressive is the amount of games in the library. I say age will play a factor. Online is available only on the larger version of the console.",2.0
"I am not a big video game person but these units are now below $150 and many games are available for around $20.  Because of this I purchased a Playstation 2.

The game system works well but has a slightly cheap plasticy feel.  The disc player portion of the game is verysimilar to a portable CD player with a spring loaded door and a snap-in disc loading process.

I only have two big problems with the Sony Playstation system.

First, most of the games require the use of a flash memory card that has to be the sony playstation brand.  Inexpensive flash memory cards widely available in electronics stores don't work in the playstation.  Even Sony memory-stick flash memory doesnt work in the playstation 2 console.  It has to be a playstation brand flash memory card.  An 8MB card will cost you at least $25 which is an absurd amount for 8MB of flash memory.  I recently purchased a 1000MB flash memory card for my camera for $50, the playstation memory is very very overpriced!

Second, if you have a television that is newer than 2000, the cables included with the unit are going to provide a poor video display compared to what your television is capable of.  I have a 2002 television with component inputs and I had to spend $25 for the cheapest component video cable on the market.  Playstation cannot use standard component cables which are available for a few dollars at Radio Shack, you have to buy Playstation 2 specific cables because the connectors on the playstation 2 unit are not standard RCA type plugs.  You will also have to do a bit of searching to even find them for $25.  The cheapest component video cable at a mojor electronics retailer near my home is over $50, but they can be found for $25.  The unit does include an antiquated video cable in the box but it delivers a much lower quality signal.

Because of the two above issues, you must spend at least $50 to make this Playstation2 work with most games and work with modern televisions.  The $130 price tag is very misleading.",2.0
"I bought a mini PS2 and was fashioned with it, it looked amazingly it was fantastic, until with a friend we realized the most interesting lie of our lifes, we discovered that this new PS2 has a lot of problems that the old PS2 block will never have. I traded 1 week after that the new Mini PS2 for an old Block PS2 with a hardly very difficult problem, cause they didn't want to get it.

The Mini PS2 has a lot of problems, first the lector lens is more at the open air, you can see if when you open the top part of the PS2, while the Big Block PS2 lector lens won't be seen, unless you open it. This makes the lens more weaker and it can get dirty more easily than the big PS2 lens.

Second the power source for the Mini PS2 is attached just next to it, while you are playing over an hour long the PS2 will overheat more than normal and it can get damage for that, even the lens can get overheated. Instead the old Big PS2 had a separate power source, so that it won't overheat the PS2 nor the lens.

Thrid the new Mini PS2 is more fragile, so if you drop it, it will break even if you drop it to the ground from 1 feet above the ground it can break or get damage. Instead the old block PS2 can resist all hard handles... so you just care it and mess with it.

To be honest, I prefer my new Old Big Block PS2. I been rude to that and it won't let me down, so if you need to choose, pick up the Big Block PS2. ITS WAY BETTER!

UPDATE: Okay I just got an update for you guys, there is a reasonable amount of Mini PS2s that are getting damage between the first 6 and 12 months, I have had friends that regreted trading or selling their old PS2 for the Mini one... as it won't last long, it will break, overheat or get burned!

When my big old box of a PS2 (one of the first to come out, mind you) up and died in November my heart was broken. But, thankfully, the PSTwo's were coming out the same day. What a great coincidence! I ran out and bought one.

Flash forward four months. Here I sit staring at the now-dead PSTwo. She will no longer play any games or DVDs, giving instead the dreaded ""The Disk Could Not Be Read"" error (modified up from the old ""Disk Read Error"" message--thanks, SONY!). Lens cleaners have failed and there's no little white wheel inside that a felt tip marker and some internet help can adjust (as was the case in the older models). Did it overheat? She gave off a nasty smell..and it's known that the PSTwos get very warm to the touch, despite being loaded up with heat sinks and yes, even a little fan that does a great job blowing the already scorching hot air on to critical parts. Was it just an unlucky, bad unit? Did it have something to do with Sony's rumored use of cheap parts? Do these new units have some inherent design flaw which results in a very short and terminal lifetime?

I don't know. You decide...just keep this in mind before you plop down a hundred and fifty bucks. The PS2 is still the best console with the best selection...buy criminey! Whatever happened to the days when you'd buy a product and it *wouldn't* fall apart after a few months??

Happy gaming...",2.0

"They release this thing at Christmas and can't even put enough in the stores to keep shelves stocked.  True it's a a good system but it's the same thing in a new package.  Do yourself a favor.  When you get the OUT OF STOCK message, buy an XBOX it's a technically better system.  The games always perform and look better on the xbox, and yes it has plenty of great no stop titles.  PS2, NO FABLE, DOOM 3, Knights of the Old Republic, or HALO for you.

Also look out for price gouging on the shops that still have it in stock.",2.0
"This new ""smaller"" ps2 is a piece of junk. Its sad to see manufacturers blindly follow the logic that ""smaller is better""

That is only true of device you carry with you all the time like cellphones, mp3 players/walkmans, PDA's, laptops etc. and that they function by themselves. For something that requires a tv to be useable, WHO CARES if its 50% smaller, really. Do u carry  ur PS2 with you all the time? I hope not, cuz otherwise u need help. I personally own an Xbox even though i sometimes regret it because i wish to play certain ps2 exclusive titles right away. I was considering buying a ps2 but now that this new redesign model is here and its nearly impossible to find the older one that i like, i'm changing my mind. If you already have a ps2 with the network adapter, don't buy this. If you dont, look for the older ""online pack"", and buy that instead. You'll get a good quality second generation PS2, the net adaptor and a game. As for me, the hassle of looking around isn't worth it, Sony has defintely lost the chance to have me as a customer.",2.0
"Sony did just fine with original PS2.  Sure its graphics aren't nearly as good as Xbox, or have a hard drive like the Xbox, but it has way more games, and allot of them are really fun.  Instead of optimizing the HDD, Sony has cut it out.  It made the system quiter, but reduced the size of the fan-which equalls more disk errors and game freezes and it happens faster than ever.  This system is completely pointless and insufficient compared to the original PS2.  I love Playstation, but I cant give this system praise like all the other PS2 fans out there because it was made by Sony.  Here is how it is-Xbox is a much better system, PS2 has many more fun games to play.  Put the two together and it would be impressive at least.  I suggest anyone looking to buy the new PStwo to spend the extra $40 and get the original, or an Xbox.  If you want to buy a present for your kids, this flimsy toy thing will be smashed within a month, waste of money and time.",2.0
"I don't see the point in this remake. For one thing the disc drive is now toploading so if people would buy this becuse they don't have much space in their cabinet can forget it. For example if you had slipped it into a small space you would have to remove it when you want to put a game in. Althought this is slim and great looking i don't reccomend it. What has annoyed me about sony is that the more popular the playstation gets the quality gets worse because they think that it is so popular that it won't matter. I own a ps2 (fat) a gamecube and a x-box. out of the 3 the x-box is the best then ps2 then gamecube (purely because of the amount of games) My ps2 was given to me about a year ago and it was one of the first ps2s made because my cousin bought it on the launch date. I havnt had any problems with it at all but most of my friends who own ps2s have had something go wrong with them. I think that the more popular ps2 gets the cheaper sony makes them for so they break more. I reccomend the fat ps2 because it has sliding disc tray and iy is sooooo better. One of my friends has the slim ps2 and it is tiny, About the size of a ps2 game case. But the disc toploader feels flimsy and when you open it it is not a smooth action. If you have buy a ps2 buy a fat one because they are the best in my opinion but buy an x-box because they are the best or just buy an x-box.",2.0
"Granted I have spent countless hours holding a PS2 controller, but this just seems stupid to me.  The PSone was a cutsy remake of the original, but the PStwo just seems like it's asking for trouble.  The ""70% quieter"" function isn't just because they figured out they should remove some parts that were banging together, they are using a smaller (or no, I haven't opened one up yet) internal fan.  You know those famous disc errors you hear about?  A lot of thsoe are because of excess heat... and they are making the fan smaller, that means even more heat for your disc error pleasure.  Secondly, I understand the power source is now on the cable as opposed to being in the PStwo box itself.  That means there is a bix box on your power cable, but it makes the actual console itself smaller and lighter.  Well, for all those touting how great the smaller box is, slap that big ol' power box on there too, because you are not traveling without the power cord if you actually want to use the PStwo for anything more than showing off.

I fortunately didn't drop the $90 on Final Fantasy XI and the accompanying HDD (which was hyped up hugely that it would make the PS2 comparable in function to the xbox) only to have Sony remake the console without the ability to actually use the HDD!?!  That makes absolutely no sense to me.

Sony: ""Lets make a new game in the series that is the most widely known in the world and bundle it with a piece of hardware that you need to play it... then make a new system that runs all the other games we have ever made... except this one!  (maniacle laughter)

Personally I look at it like this... was your old PS2 drowning out the sound from your game?  Were you traveling so much that the not-so-huge PS2 was inconvenient to lug everywhere you had to go?  Did you buy FFXI?  Do you want to possibly deal with the overheating and disc error issues that Playstations have had for years, but now with less fan to help?

Don't get me wrong... the sheer volume of games for the PS2 makes it a great console to own, but this smaller, sleeker, sexier design junk just sounds like an attempt to make more money.",2.0
"Sony continues to impress with its attempts at living off its name.  I bought the new PS2 because my old one crapped out, it stopped reading dics.  Well i have been playing video games most of my life and i don't really worry about detailed stuff like whether or not the xbox or ps2 produces better quality images.  However, I am very concerned with craftsmanship and Sony products have really begun to lapse.  They need to stop living off their name and begin making quality products again.  I hope that all these people who have raved about this new system (it is no better than the other PS2, just buy the ethernet adaptor and u have everything this one does)are not in for a shock when the new PS2, reminiscent of the old begins to have disc read errors.  That's right after less than a week of owning the new ps2 the thing stopped reading discs.  I tried Madden and GTA and other games all to no avail.  I am pretty good with electronics so after hearing the machine making a clicking noise i was fairly certain the system was shot.  I will be returning it to Circuit City.  Hopefully this is an isolated incident but with the recent track record of sony products i doubt it.  In a few weeks or months we may well see a recall on these new systems because from an electronic standpoint these systems appear to have problems from the start.  Yeah they are small but guess why?  Mostly because they moved the power adapter outside the system and eliminated the cooling fan.  Problem being the system can overheat.  Nextly they removed the cutoff switch, the only way to completely turn the system off is to unplug it from the wall and I suggest you do this so that ur system isn't damaged by excess heat.  Who's dumb idea was it to remove a cooling fan from a closed electrical component?  I have a lot vested in staying with ps2 I love the GTA series and GT4 comes out in December but these lapses in craftsmanship have brought me to the point where i will not buy anymore Sony products.  They use crap components and it shows.  There aren't nearly as many complaints about Xbox or Nintendo.  Because Sony is on top right now they have gotten lazy and their products are starting to show it.  So beware of the ""new"" ps2.  First it is a waste of money if u already own one.  Second, the craftsmanship with sony is always suspect.  It is hit or miss whether u are gonna get a craped out sony product so u might even be better buying one used and saving ur cash because the new ones are no better and certainly aren't worth 150.  Sony is just tryin to skim off the top with this new ps2.  I was a die hard ps2 fan but this second ps2 collapse really leaves me questioning sony products.",2.0
This game wasn't quite what I expected it to be.  The game is not as user friendly as the Elite Force and other Star Trek games I have played.

"As a die-hard Animorphs fan, I really, really wanted to like this game.  Unfortunately, the game just has too many flaws to make it worthwhile.
First, and perhaps most importantly considering the license, this game just doesn't feel or play like an Animorphs game; it plays like a fairly bad Pokemon clone that had the Animorphs license grafted onto it at a late stage of development.  If you want to acquire an animal morph, do you do it by sneaking up on it in human form and touching it?  No; you do it by beating the tar out of it in morph form, just like you would a Taxxon or Hork-Bajir.  If you get the tar beaten out of you while in morphed form, do you die?  No; you revert to human form (and must immediately morph into something else to continue the fight), and you lose the ability to ever use that morph form again, unless you can find and beat up a different animal of the same species.  If you lose all of your morph forms in this way, the game is over.  This isn't Animorphs, Ubi Soft; this is Pokemon--only the Pokemon games got the mechanics much, much better.
The plot isn't actively bad, but it's certainly uninspired.  The graphics and sound are at least passable for a Game Boy game.  But the game contains one simply unforgivable technical flaw; there's no battery backup system--instead, you must write down and re-enter sixteen-character passwords to save your progress.  Hello, Ubi Soft?  The 1980s are over.  Please join us in the 2000s at your earliest convenience.  Thank you for your cooperation.
Animorphs fans will find this game to be a major letdown, and non-Animorphs fans will probably find it simply pointless.  You'd be much better served buying Pokemon Gold or Silver along with a few Animorphs books.",2.0

"Out of the 3 NES Double Dragon games, I think those of us who played all 3 and weren't just stuck with owning one of the 3 back in the day would probably overall agree Double Dragon II is the best of the series. Double Dragon 1 was tough, but fine, Double Dragon II was just about perfect, and when we heard DDIII was about to come out, anticipation was at a high to play it.

However what most of us found was a game not equal to DDI or II. I think like many at first who played this after the first 2, wondered why the heck the game was so hard and lacked options to make it easier. Both the original games started off on the street, this one starts in  a Dojo... okay, maybe they wanted to try something new, but it seemed to be wrong from the start. Straight away you start off against 1 opponent, once you beat them you have to go talk to a friend dieing on the side of the screen who tells you he tried to stop the new bad guys, but he couldn't, and the main person to beat is... that's what it says, ""is..."" leaving it like a mystery as he dies. I guess that would be fine, but it's the way its shown... DD1 has a cut scene of Marian being kidnapped before you play, DDII explains it in the intro that you can skip, but in DDIII you have to wait a few seconds for this on screen dialog/talk to hurry up and finish before you can resume, and that is just an annoying step backwards.

Next up you find your moves you got used to from DDI or DDII are again something different. I used to think the only way to improve DDII would be to have included the ground punches and head-butt moves back into the game. Now DDIII has a few familiar moves, but lacks in them. In Double Dragon II you relied a lot on your jumping 360 kick that you could preform from the jumping up or down, or jumping to the left and right, in Double Dragon III you can only perform it by jumping up and down, you can not execute the move jumping in either direction, which is a shame. Also needed was the return of the jumping-power-knee and super-uppercuts from DDII, but they are sorely missed in DDIII... even the reverse elbow smash from DDI would have been a nice addition.

So what has been added to the 3rd one, move wise? Apart from regular kicks and punches, the only returning move is the jumping 360 kick, which you can not do jumping left or right now. A run feature has been included and a move where you can jump and flip over your opponent, grab their hair and throw them across the screen... you can also now do a move where if you run at a wall, you can bounce off the wall with a super flying kick, which is a decent move if you can do it.. and there is also a couple of double-team moves for 2 players; one is a flying kick your partner helps throw you in, and the other is a joined hand dancing spin kick fest that is probably the best move in the game, but can only be done in 2 player mode... Double Dragon 3 really had lacked in quality from the other Double Dragon games as being a great game on 2 player, or single play.

It almost seems like this game was being designed, and new ideas where just not working; so instead of scrapping the game or improving what flaws it had to be a great game, they released a demo and forgot to tell people to send in their thoughts to help improve the game. Even in the 2 player intro screens, the game says the two heroes are Billy & Bimmy Lee... Bimmy? A spelling error like that in a NES game? Or maybe it is correct, maybe Jimmy Lee refused to be in this sarky game,  so ACCLAME asked their retarded cousin Bimmy to be in it instead? The other thing that bugs me is your enemies are not supposed to be Shadow Warriors from the previous Double Dragons... then why does Linda, Williams and whatever other enemies make a return?

What makes this game harder from the previous DD games is the lack of options, there simply isn't any. You can make the game even harder by selecting 2 player B and beating up player two so you can solo play against twice as many enemies... but if you wanna make the game easier, you will need a pro-action-replay or something to help you cheat.

The biggest issue with this version is extra lives... there isn't any! You get 1 life... you die, you're out! Do not pass go, do not collect 2up hundred dollars... nope, you're screwed. If you can manage to beat two other character in the game, some slow and fat ninja guy and a samurai, these guys will become your extra life. You can choose to select these guys by pressing select and choosing them to take over, or if you die as who you are in the game, one of these guys will take over as your main character... what I do not get is why the heck couldn't Jimmy be selectable in a 1 player game as your back up life? There is a little trick you can do to make that so, what you do is start the game on 2 player B and beat up Jimmy, or should I say, the retarded cousin of the Lee brothers, Bimmy, who accidentally misspells his own name on the game-play screen as Jimmy. Anyway, beat the first baddie, then beat up JimmBimm until your next hit will be the one that kills him. Then position him sort of in the middle of the room in a way that when you perform your jumping spinning 360 kick, he lands on the guy you have to talk to. If done right, Jimmy will activate him talking to you guys, instead of dieing. Then, make sure BillyBobJim doesn't die during the battle with the next few bad guys. Once the Dojo enemies are gone, have Jimmy exit the room first, then Billy. When you emerge from the room on the street, Jimmy will be gone, but if you press select, Jimmy is there as your 2nd option of character and your backup life.... however, don't use Jimmy till you have reached level two, as he will still have the ready to die energy he had from your beating until it regenerates in level two.

Now, as I was saying about the extra guys you can choose. They are useless, what moron thought it would be a good idea to allow you to use two extra characters that are just about useless? As boss enemies, they are decent, but to play as them is pretty weak, especially if you lose Billy/BimpDaddyJimbo and are stuck playing the rest of the game as one of these losers... as I did, getting stuck with the Samurai guy to finish the game off and yet somehow the dead Jimmy still gets the glory in the end.

So, I haven't said many positive things about the game yet... one option I do like is your option to swap characters during game play and have a special weapon you can choose to use at any time... however, unless you know how to rom hack like I did and add Jimmy as your second character by default play, and also have unlimited use of the special weapons... not to mention invincibility... then they are more something you have to plan and use strategies for when you are going to use them and how. Using cheats like that was the only way I could beat this game. Maybe you are good enough to do it without using any methods of cheats... but being someone who can beat Double Dragon II with my eyes closed and then coming into DDIII like someone who dies on the first goomba of Mario Bros, it really pi..cheesed... me off.

Once game play was over and done with, I was not impressed one little bit with the ending of the game. At least the first II Double Dragons showed something that made you feel like you had passed the game.. but this ones text ""where are they now"" screens really do show the lack of thought and imagination put into this game ..""Billy & BJimmy rode off into the sunset to teach Kung Fu, while FuMan Chu and Tom Cruise become emperors of Kmart discounts"" what kind of ending is that? No scenes, no decent ending, just a ""what happened to them, bye"" screen. I hate these games that are so hard to beat, and reward you with nothing once it's over. I suppose it's not quite nothing, nothing would be a single screen with no pictures saying, ""thanks for playing, sorry you wasted so much time to see this text, bye"". But this game here may as well have said just that.

So I guess that's why I don't particularly like DDIII. Not on the NES anyway... least the Arcade version was pretty decent and even allowed a 3rd player... but most importantly, had extra lives for as long as you could drop coins into it. And you know what the worse thing about it is? It's one of those rare times when you can truly say, even the Sega had a better version the NES. Sure the nes version isn't as bad as the GameGear version, but it's sad when even the GameBoy has a better version then the NES.

I think with the lack of effort put into the game, and it's terrible reward for beating the game, that is why it is so hard. The game makers don't want you to be able to beat it, so you can see just how unrewarding it is. At last moment before they decided to release it, like I was saying before about it being a demo... I really think game testers where thinking that the game is so bad, give people 1 life so they can't advance to the end and see just how sh/badly we have made this version, but because DDI & II sold so well, this one is guaranteed to make us a few bucks anyway, so just release it as it is now, no one will see the end of it anyway.",2.0
"That's right, folks! This is another beat-up-the-bad-guys-and-save-the-girl video game from the makers of. . . actually Technos made this game. I know next to nothing about Technos. Double Dragon is a game of three distinct trigger actions: jumping, punching, and kicking; and seeing as how the standard NES controller has only two trigger buttons, Tehcnos decided in part 3 (as with the previous games) to make jumping accessible by through pressing the both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously (there is lenience so both buttons do not need to be pressed at the exact same time). From a jump, you can perform one of three attacks as Billy or Jimmy: cyclone spin-kick (A or B), arial kick (left or right and B), or monkey-flip your opponent (left or right and A). When monkey-flipping your opponent, you somersaut over your opponent, grab his/her head or hair, and toss him/her through the air. This is especially fun when fighting on ledges -- just make sure you don't get too close and fall off, yourself.
On the downside, there are no playable females (which seems to bother only myself). You can still fight against a few female thugs though.
Another hex is the high level of difficulty that stems from the questionable play-control. For example, the first boss (who somehwat resembles the Jack of Hearts) has a long reach which makes him hard to hit and he often ducks when you try to whack him with your cyclone spin-kick, leaving you open for attack, thanks to a lagging recovery. You also cannot monkey-flip some enemies.
As for Chin and Ranzou, these two have slightly different attack methods from the Double Dragons:
Chin has a diving Kamikaze head-butt which is activated through jumping towards your an enemy and then pressing A. When your press A or B after jumping, he does some weird air dance that only attacks from one side. His weapon is the iron claw, similar to Vega from Street Fighter.
Yagu Ranzou is (in my opinion) the best character. He uses a katana instead of his bare fists and he can use his other weapon 20 times (as opposed to Chin and the Lee brothers who can only use their's five). Ranzou's weapon is the shuriken (or flying ninja star).
You can play as Chin and Ranzou only after you have beaten them.
Billy and Jimmy's weapons are the nunchukues.

This game is brutally and unfairly difficult. It is a side scrolling beat' em up similar to Double Dragon or Final Fight, though nowhere near as good as the ladder. The moves all work and some are quite funny to watch. However where the difficulty comes in is in two player. This is often considered to be almost unplayable, as there is one huge, unavoidable flaw- Friendly fire. Yes, you can actually damage your teammates.

While the graphics are nice and the control works, the difficulty alone and the broken nature of two-player mode make this one of my least favorite of the Rare's NES offerings.",2.0
"I have bought two of these with the standard (new) buy button, and both cases were eerily similar.
I ordered this, expecting to get an original NES controller or at least a tolerable 3rd party controller. The NES knock-off controller that comes in the box looks fine at first glance. Pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing, visually, except a QC sticker on the back and the red-lettered Nintendo above the two face buttons is gone. However, when you pick up the controller, you start seeing the problem.

The first thing you'll notice is that the paddle is heinously lightweight. It's paper-light. If you put this down with any tension in the wire, or if you accidentally touch the wire, the controller will shoot like a rocket towards the console / floor. And you will be accidentally hitting the wire often, because the wire is several feet shorter than the original controller. That means you'll have to get creative on where you place it - no stashing it next to the TV, it's gonna have to stay near the console. And you are, too, while you're playing.

Now I can tolerate how it handles out of play just fine if it plays well. But this is where the generic is just shameful. The original NES controller had a very reasonable roll to the control pad, and some respectable size tolerances on the face buttons. The control pad, for starters, is way too sensitive on the diagonals. You cannot play Contra with this controller, because you will accidentally get up from the prone position with bullets at standing-chest-level on a regular basis. And it's just flat out uncomfortable anyways, being a very hard plastic that has a very sudden ""give"" to it, as opposed to the original, which was more gradual about the downpress motion. The start and select buttons are plastic instead of that rubberlike material, which makes them clicky and feel far less pleasant than the originals (I wonder if it'd be nice to have all the face buttons be rubber...). The red face buttons are loosely moulded and wobble quite fiercely, but besides the obnoxious rattling won't present any gameplay issues.

It's a terrible controller, only good if you need to have a quick Nintendo fix on a left-or-right only game and you just can't stand the thought of buying used. Otherwise, pass on it.",2.0

"Battletoads
2 Stars - So much potential, but the difficulty really prevents most players from getting very far

Ah yes, ""Battletoads"".  In gaming culture, this game is home to one of THOSE levels.  You know, the kind that appeared impossible when you first played it, and then . . . after a broken controller and lots and lots of swear words and three hours later STILL appears impossible.

Then you YouTube the level, and like watching someone play Eddie Van Halen's Guitar Instrumental ""Eruption"", you see someone pass the level with (oh God) apparent ease!  These players must be cheating!

There are lots of levels like this in the NES catalogue.  ""Adventure Island"" 8-3.  ""Ninja Gaiden"" 6-2 and then the end bosses.  ""The Legend of Zelda"" Dungeon Six.

Pretty much the ENTIRETY of the nightmare that is ""Ghost and Goblins"".  Also ""Silver Surfer"".

Of course the level I am referring too is the speed bike level, which is the third one early on in the game.

""Battletoads"" is one of those games that Tradewest, the developer, had crafted in hopes of turning into a TMNT type franchise.  Colorful characters, over the top villians (in this case a Darak Queen), and anthromorphic toads.  For early 1990s the concept fit right into popular culture.

There's only one problem.  The game is hard.  As hell.

Yes, you want challenges. But honestly, so many people stop at level 3 because they can't get past the friggin' stage.  And this was a game marketed for kids.  By the time you give up you're so beat and humiliated you don't want to see another battle toad as long as you live.  It's kind of hard to feel connected to a franchise when you can't even get past the third level.

What is so unfortunate is that beyond Level Three there are some intrinsically intriguing, well designed game play (the Surf level, the Elevator Shaft, the Dark Queen's Tower).  Unfortunately most people never saw that game play.  Then there is the Snake level, which is almost as insane as the speeder bike level.  Of course, there is a SECOND speeder bike level, and this time the stones you crash into are MOBILE!

An earlier reviewer said that ""Battletoads"" isn't a game, it's a sequence of memorized button sequences.  While that could be argued for a lot of games, it gets to the heart of the main problem with ""Battletoads"".  For a game primarily marketed for kids, the game is simply too difficult for its main audience, and for most other players as well.  Of course, TMNT had similiar difficulty issues, but that was already established.

Another rather famous attribute to this game is the co-op game play.  Although Nintendo has said in recent ""Iwata Asks"" interviews that they have been trying to get co-op gameplay in ""Super Mario"" titles since 1988 with ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", other developers were able to get co-op play without issue (this game, ""Contra"").  However, given how frustratingly difficult this game is, there is a gamebreaking bug which if you get to the Dark Queen's Tower with two players (which is highly improbable to begin with - you think the Speeder Bike level is hard with ONE player?  Try TWO!), apparently there is a game breaking bug that completely freezes the game.  That would be so rage inducing I'd probably just throw the NES out the window.

Tradewest who owned both franschises did a cross over title, having the ""Battletoads"" team up with ""Double Dragon"", another legendary video game franchise with the 1993 title ""Battletoads & Double Dragon"".  Although Tradewest owned the ""Double Dragon"" franchise back in the early 1990s they have since sold the tile..  Although a genuine cross over, the focus is largely on the ""Battletoads"" franchise.  There are also some inconsistencies between the ""Double Dragon"" canon proper and this title.  The game is also very difficult, just like the original ""Battletoads"", though thankfully there are no God-awful speeder stages or snake stages this time around.

Overall, decent game that is marred by its most famous attribute: its difficulty.  And the fact the difficult stages come so early on, it prevents most players from really seeing what the rest of the game has too offer.

The video game website IGN rated this title as the 76th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.

(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play ""Moon Crystal"", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive. The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ""Ninja Gaiden"", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline. Absolutely amazing!

"First of all, be aware that these are not the actual controller made by Nintendo. If you notice the picture given it IS of an original Nintendo controller, hence the Nintendo type above the B/A buttons.. these are not pictures of the product you will receive. While 3rd party replicas of controllers are nothing new, these don't quite work the way they're intended. The responsiveness of the buttons is lackluster and unpredictable. Quite often making a sudden directional move with the directional pad will result in movement in any direction.. it's a matter of luck, haha. This being said, I KNEW when I made the purchase that these were not original ""NES made"" controllers, but I still had the expectation that they would in fact function properly. If they had, the misleading photo of an original controller would be forgivable. Maybe some people have been luckier than myself, but it seems that this product is cheaply made and can not be relied on to work consistently. So if you choose to give these a shot, keep your fingers crossed!",2.0
"The NES controller is a pretty great one. The one I ordered looked alright when I got it; it may have had a little yellowing, but it looked decent. However, once I hooked it up, the only button that did anything was ""A"". Not only that, when pressed, the button would do almost every function of the controller EXCEPT ""A"" (It would act like I was pressing Start, Select, B, Down, and Left all at once). I'm not sure if the controller is simply showing its age, or if this is one of the ""refurbished"" controllers (controllers that had their buttons/insides replaced with cheaper alternatives) that another reviewer said something about.",2.0
"This is probably the hardest game I have played & most tedious. I'm a fan of the Metal Gear series I prefer Metal Gear Solid for the ps1 over this,  but with that being said this is an ok game that is CHALLENGING & has a super long password for each time you get a new item so you better break out a lot of paper lol.

"Adventure Island seems cute and innocent when you play it just to pass time. When you get the ambition to beat it, however, it reveals itself to be an exceptionally frustrating and unrewarding experience. A difficult game it is - and in a very bad, bad way. Released two years after Super Mario Bros., Adventure Island quite obviously apes after that game - 8 worlds, 4 levels each, recycled palettes, damsel in distress, big bad guy to defeat - and yet it lacks everything that made that game so enjoyable.

Master Higgins is the hero; a weird, chubby little man in a baseball hat and a grass skirt. He has to rescue his girlfriend Princess Leilani/Tina from the evil Witch Doctor. You know, I actually think the Witch Doctor on the cartridge is really cool. How deceptive. Everything about this game just feels... bland. And weird. Coyotes that appear when you jump over flowers and eggplants hidden in eggs are the least of the weirdness. Super Mario Bros had an imaginative setting as well as a host of imaginative characters, from the minions to the boss. This game seems to lack imagination; the enemies are everything from bats to octopi to frogs - that's right, frogs. And the in-game Witch Doctor just looks terrible; he seriously looks more like an out-of-shape wrestler than an anthropomorphic rhino, and it's a real shame.

The music isn't anything to shout about either. My favourite is the march tune that accompanies the wasteland levels, where an already difficult game becomes even more frustrating. The forest tune is also fascinatingly eerie. The rest is standard platform stuff. Not bad, but nothing that really stands out, either.

Now, I love a good challenge, but that's precisely what Adventure Island isn't. It's a bad challenge. What I mean is that you are not allowed to make one mistake, ever. Unless you're riding a skateboard, bumping into any hostile entity (be it snail, frog or bonfire) will kill you, end of story (and getting knocked off the skateboard usually hurls you into the path of an enemy). Your only weapon to begin with is an axe. If you manage to stay alive long enough, you may be able to upgrade to a fireball. You really want that, because Adventure Island is just full of enemies at almost every turn. However, when you die, you lose EVERYTHING. And not every level even has a weapon.

But of course that wouldn't be hard enough, now would it? There is a heartless energy bar that constantly depletes. If it runs out, you die, and it doesn't take long for it to run out. You constantly must mitigate this by collecting fruit scattered across the levels. However, in later and particularly sadistic levels, you must pass entire areas between the (admittedly merciful) checkpoints without obtaining any food at all! Consequently, you are practically forced to run rather irresponsibly through levels, as well as avoiding any enemy which you may (and most probably will) run into. This means that you must develop a habit of premature action, because it's usually too late to retaliate to danger by the time it rears its ugly head. The controls make an already difficult task even harder. Master Higgins is extremely unresponsive and difficult to manoeuvre. And this game is just full of parts where precision is essential. It's incredibly easy to fall into a pit or run into an enemy, even if you see them coming.

If this wasn't bad enough, you only get a 1-up when you collect 50,000 points - which usually takes about 8 levels to obtain. And unless you find the hidden Hudson Bee at the end of the very first level, there are no continues. Yes. Many necessary power-ups are in hidden and usually quite not obvious locations. Even with visible power-ups, it's impossible to tell what's in which egg. If you're very unlucky, you'll release those horrid eggplants, which will stay on your tail and zap away your energy until you only have a couple of energy bars left. This goes beyond challenge and just becomes horribly unfair; not only can you not make even the most understandable mistake without being severely punished for it, but you practically can't find the few things which will help you!

Ironically the bosses are the easiest parts of the game, even if they increase in difficulty. At the end of each world (you will learn to tell when it's coming up), you will enter a palace and battle the Witch Doctor. The same strategy can be employed to defeat him each time, the only difference being that he changes heads (his only weak spot) and that he shoots his fireballs more rapidly. Still, those short bouts with him are as close as the game gets to atmosphere.

Isn't it strange that Adventure Island was released two years after Super Mario Bros., and that it tries to imitate it? It's strange because this game absolutely lacks everything which still makes SMB so much fun to play; good graphics, imaginative setting and characters, good controls and gameplay. There's no big climax waiting at the end, either; the King Quiller mentioned in the manual (sort of a master Witch Doctor, I presume) was never manifested into the real game, and I can tell you that he was the only reason why I completed the game. There's no sense of reward for enduring all the hell the game puts you through; you get a congratulatory screen and little else.

It just isn't fun to sit through this game; in fact, it's hard to imagine it was intended to be a fun experience at all for anybody who's not an absolute gaming wiz. It would be talent wasted anyway. The thing is, while Adventure Island can be a cute time waster from time to time, it's almost unplayable as a proper game. There is nothing rewarding about its so-called challenge; 100% attention is required at all times, and yet your few power-ups can be taken from you faster than you imagine. Adventure Island is undoubtedly a rather unremarkable and wickedly-hard game. If you actually beat it once, you probably won't want to go through it again. I know I don't.

The very best thing I can say has nothing to do with the game itself - new versions of this game on the PS2 and Wii make excellent work of the Witch Doctor.",2.0

"...Bad Dudes is a lack luster game. Once you beat it, it goes out of rotation and eventually gets traded in. I would not suggest this to anyone. I would prefer Double Dragon, River City Ransom or even the TMNT Arcade Game before this one. Don't waste your time or money.",2.0
"I don't quite get the appeal of Maniac Mansion.  It's strictly about solving puzzles while roaming the rooms and hallways of a really small mansion.  It's not action-based or interesting in any way other than the ironic and comedic portions that involve aliens and their many hilarious one liners.  There's strategy in making your way through the house but it's kind of tacky due to the game being so short and feeling incomplete.  There's no action whatsoever so the replay value is nonexistent which is another major issue with the game.

Maniac Mansion feels like it's caught between Home Alone and A Boy and His Blob except it lacks the suspense of Home Alone and the clever puzzle solving and adventure of A Bob and His Blob.  I'm not sure whether Maniac Mansion is based off a movie or not because the music is memorable enough to reach a level higher than video games.  It's fully developed and well-written enough to be comparable to a TV show theme.  That's what makes me suspicious that the game may be a video game version of a movie or show (or perhaps cartoon).  Each selectable character has their own theme song, and with the orange-haired guy the music is exceptionally memorable because it's some kind of groovy upbeat, danceable tune multi-part song that sounds like mid 80's Frank Zappa.  The orange-haired lady has a theme that reminds me of the late 70's/early 80's rock band the Cars.  Really awesome and catchy music at least.

Though the story doesn't make a bit of sense and the game is based entirely on solving clues Scooby Doo style, at least the occasional dialogue provides a few short laughs.  Otherwise a really forgettable and highly overrated video game that you'll never play again unless it's 20 years later and you're looking to take a trip down memory lane.",2.0

Mega Man V is definitely the weakest of all 8 original Mega Man games.  It's so easy that you can beat it with the Mega Buster all the way through.

"This is actually a pretty dull version of the game. I think there's a 64 version too, pick that up instead",2.0
"This is a dull, near impossible flight simulating game. Its not all that based on the movie, there is no real story, you are just a F-14 fighter in hostile territory. You have guns and select the rockets and missiles to use before each mission (level).

It is a nice flight simulator, but its just dull with long periods of sky, no clouds, no sea, no land, no obsticles. Then there is the challenge. Enemies firing rockets at you from sea and air. One rocket and you're dead, I suppose its like that in real life. Enemy jets get behind you and you need to shake them before they destroy you with their rockets or missiles.

Then halfway through a mission, you will need more jet fuel, so the flying fuel tanker flies in and you need to get the fuel just right or die trying. At the end of each mission, you need to land on an aircraft carrier with perfection. Too fast, you crash, too slow, you crash, too high, you crash, too low, you crash.

Its a prescise game, so if you love prescision, this is your game! However, for casual gamers, this is a frustratingly difficult and unfun game.",2.0
"My recollection of this game is that it survived a *very* short time in rotation as the lead Mario property. SMB had taken America by storm and changed the way NES was packaged and sold. People - *old* people of 30 years or more would get the thing out at parties and challenges would start, to the point that some wives would hide the cords when hosting guests.

SMB2, however, was a damp squib. The game play was so radically different to SMB's run-jump-and-squish that people were not happy with it. Hell, I sat with one guy and we couldn't figure out what we were supposed to do from the start screen. After a few minutes we just played something else.

I recently scored a copy of this for the Wii (with the other Mario Bros games) and started to explore it. The vertical drop start was stupidly annoying but I did eventually get it started this time around - after an inordinate amount of time wastage.

In fact, it is no accident copies of SMB2 for the NES are rare. NES hurried SMB3 into production that featured a more natural SMB mechanic and added a sort of modest exploration mechanic too (and stuck in some ace puns like the flute from Legend of Zelda which has a *very* different effect in SMB3). SMB2 faded into well-deserved obscurity.

It wasn't just that the game wasn't as much fun as SMB and SMB3, it fought you when it came to figuring out what you were supposed to *do* and that is just poor design.

Yes, I get that the game has its fans who think it is the best thing since sliced bread. Good for them. I wouldn't have it any other way. There was a short-lived buzz of interest in the early Nintendo Fun Club magazine (which became Nintendo Power later in life) to prove they are not alone. But to claim this game has all the appeal of its predecessor or successor is stretching the point as far as the buying majority is concerned. Even Spy Hunter is more fun than this game in my opinion.

I also know the eventually unveiled ""real history"" of this game, which was irrelevant to me by the time it was made public. I always knew it as SMB2. Excuses about it not being a ""real SMB game"" are lame and beside the point.

This is the only SMB game I am never tempted to re-visit.",2.0
"It is a side scrolling game where you play as all 4 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and pause the game to select a different turtle. Donatello has the longest ranged, slowest and most powerful. Rapheal has the quickest, shortest and least damaging. Michaelangelo and Leonardo are somewhere in between. This game is more difficult than fun. Difficult as opposed to challenging. Most everything can kill you quickly. There are top down areas (which seem almost pointless) where you wander from sewer to sewer where the real side scrolling action is. Foot soldiers and various other enemies that don't quite make sense for a turtles game.

This is a game that requires some prescision and the turtles control pretty poorly. There is quite a bounce back when you get hit. Jumps are tough to control. Not a good game at all. It is just a missed oppertunity for what could have been a great debut for the turtles on the NES.

The next two turtle games for the NES were much better.",2.0

"Mickey Mousecapade
Three stars - somewhat playable by today's standards, but there's better fare out there

""Mickey Mousecapade"", the first of a series of highly successful Capcom games using Disney trademarks, was published by Capcom in Nintendo but actually developed Hudson Soft in Japan. It the only Capcom published Disney game not actually developed by Capcom. Several sprites from the game are directly lifted from other Hudson Soft games.

""Mickey Mousecapade"" is certainly one of the more obscure titles in the Capcom library. The game has some rather ugly graphics (even for an NES title), but the game certainly has its own style of charm.

There are numerous regional differences between the Japanese and North American versions. The stage bosses are all different between the two versions, and so is much of the enemy roster. The Japanese version is more heavily based on ""Alice in Wonderland"".

The plot of the game is to rescue a friend of Mickey and Minni, who turns out to be Alice of ""Alice in Wonderland"". The final boss is Maleficent from ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the US versiona nd the Queen of Hears from ""Alice in Wonderland"" in the Japanese version. Pete, who is often the final boss in Disney games, is the fourth boss in the American version.

Strangely enough, there is a Hidden Mickey embedded in the circuit board, clearly visible when the game cartridge is disassembled.

Like the NES ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"", the graphics are ugly and primitive.  Although published in Japan in 1987, ""Mickey Mousecapade"" was published in 1988 in North America, the same year ""Ninja Gaiden"", ""Blaster Master"" and ""The Guardian Legend"" were published.  The grapchis are so bad the game looks like an NES launch title rather than one published later.

Ultimately, Capcom's other Disney games far outshine this title.  Unless you are nostalgic for this title, the NES offers much better fare than this.  Although to be fair, the NES also offers much WORST fare than this game as well.

While Mickey Mousecapade does offer some enjoyment, I would recommend ""Duck Tales"", ""Duck Tales 2"", ""Chip and Dale"", ""Chip and Dale 2"", ""Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", or ""The Jungle Book"" over this travesty.

The video game website IGN rated this title as the 877h greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.

(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play ""Moon Crystal"", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.

"Capcom usually creates awesome games after Disney titles, but when they came out with this, it was questioned whether or not Capcom were capable of licensing Disney titles since Mickey Mousecapade was its first.  Its a s**tty game!  It starts off as a ok game (you find magic stars in a Fun House and shoot random animals and moving deadly furniture), but the formula goes on and on and on...  The levels do get harder (too hard for a kids' game), but the repetitiveness and cheap deaths doesn't fair too well.  The cheapest death is when Minnie falls off the ledge, your character (Mickey) falls with her.  She is a liability throughout the whole game so controlling her while playing as Mickey can be a b***h!  The second cheapest death is getting hit and stopping in midair (especially when you're over a cliff or water in mid-jump).  This doesn't give you much time to steer your jumps, but its better than the ""backwards hit"" bulls**t found in other games.  The game frustrated me as a kid and I never got past the final level because the damn eagle is always kidnapping Minnie and rescuing her is always a hassle.  Also, on the pirate ship level (Level 4), you might as well turn the game off if you didn't happen to get the second magic stars for Minnie in level 1.  Pegleg Pete will throw a zillion of knives at your direction so it will be impossible to deck him without loosing a life.  The only trick is making sure Minnie has her stars because she'll be immune to Pete's attacks (making sure she jumps on the ledge of where Pete is attacking is kind of a hassle).  Without a word of mouth from a friend who happened to make this trick work through trial and error or with a Nintendo Power magazine, you're stuck.  Though the internet will may now give you a clear walkthrough on this frustrating abomination, its not worth a dollar (go buy a McDouble cheese burger with it instead of this s**tty game).  Other Disney titles that Capcom will make in the future would be a huge improvement in gameplay and graphics such as Duck Tales, Rescue Rangers, and Darkwing Duck so try those out and stay away from ""Mickey Mousecrapade,"" please!",2.0

"I ordered this product expecting it to be lightly used, and even though the picture of the product's box was displayed I took notice that a box was not mentioned anywhere in its description and expected not to get one. Even though my expectation was right, I still find it to be deceptive that the product would be displayed in its original box and not shipped with one. That, however, is not even my primary complaint.

This product is absolutely gross. When I received it I found a bit of yellowing, but this is expected in old game controller plastic. What is not expected, however, is the appalling level of dirt and grime found all over the controller. Absolutely no attempt seems to have been made to clean the product before selling and shipping it, and I should not have to take on that responsibility myself for a gift I paid for. The stick is in poor shape but I am sure that ""acceptable condition"" for a twenty-five year old product is going to be up for debate, so that one just remains my opinion. The buttons all seem fine, at the very least.

Again, quite unprofessional to not be so courteous as to make your product presentable and clean before charging someone money for it.",2.0
This game for me is a weak attempt to copy the game 'Tetris'. It just  isn't as fun or challenging as i had hoped. The only plus that i see with this game is that it would be preferred over tetris by children because of the colorful graphics and cartoon look. So if you have children and are looking for a good clean kid friendly game to keep them entertained and expand their hand/eye coordination then this game might be a good choice.,2.0

"I grew up in the early 90's playing Mario, Punch Out, Zelda and the like on the NES. Honestly I was never truly that fond of it. I was never impressed or blown away by any games for it, I only played it to pass time as a kid. It wasn't until the release of the PS1/N64 that I became a hardcore gamer. Then the further graphical development of the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube only solidified my love for gaming. I never enjoyed the countless side-scrolling titles, I was always wanting something more in graphics and something less tedious. Not to mention the failure rate of the NES, not reading games, having to replace the 72-Pins over and over. It was an unreliable hunk of mediocrity.

I'm sure many consider it a classic and that's ok. I however don't share those same fond memories. I have chosen to let it die with the times and can't say I've missed it.",2.0
"Love the opening scene showing a knife charging down from the sky and landing in the eye of a skull!

This game is really bizarre.  I'm not a fan of the concept but it does blend RPG elements with side scrolling in a way that's not completely awful.  With better execution it probably could have been a great game.  You can choice between 6 characters called camp counselors (because the story is that these counselors have been selected to look after Crystal Lake for the summer not knowing Jason's out there).  3 boys and 3 girls, each containing their own abilities.  Some characters can run fast while others are slow with terrible jumping.  They can all do the basics at least which is run, jump, use weapons and row canoes.  Right away this seems like the game is trying to be more complex than necessary.

The object is to walk to different areas of the lake preventing Jason from harming children (15 in total) and you also have to keep the 6 playable (counselor) characters alive as well in your quest to keep the children safe. You have to kill Jason at least 3 times, but perhaps the game is random and more deaths are required.  Not sure.  Gather weapons to face Jason, strategize by finding health potions, keys to unlock hidden cabins in the woods or lake and distribute weapons among the counselors so everyone remains alive and well.  Nice strategy.

The difficulty is high due to the confusion of figuring out where to go and Jason popping up and causing problems (he gets faster and harder later on).  It's hard to figure out where to go because the game wasn't worked on long enough to differentiate one area from another, so many places look exactly the same.  Probably my biggest problem with the game (though to be fair you are given a map even if it's confusing, inaccurate and sends you heading the wrong way).  The map is useful in determining where Jason is however- a green dot on the map will indicate which cabin he's in so head over there as fast as you can or he'll kill a counselor.  I don't like the limited moves during the cabin fights with Jason- you can only move side to side or duck.  Well besides using a weapon too.

Your weapons include rocks, knives, machetes and torches.  You have to be close to enemies when throwing rocks to land your shot because the aim is in an arch direction which means a lot of times you'll miss.  Near the beginning you come across a lighter need to light fireplaces and a knife.  Whenever you hear a beep it means Jason found a counselor or kid, and you only have a limited amount of time to find the cabin containing Jason.  If you don't find the cabin in time he'll kill a counselor, but if you DO find the cabin in time a kid will say ""Thank You"".  Speaking of cabins you often have to enter them for a variety of reasons.  This is where the strategy comes into play.  Inside these cabins you can battle Jason for one thing, or help your counselors perform actions such as cure an injured character, switch between counselors, give a weapon to someone in need or pick up notes.

The way you search the lake/forest area is by finding paths north and south that you'll often see as you walk across the screen.  This is really clunky and awful level design in my opinion because, again, the paths all look very similar, and every path you take is dominated with the same few enemies (mostly zombies) that it turns into a bundle of confusion after a while.  To be fair the backgrounds offer nice variety using different colors to accurately show different times of the day.  This sort of helps differentiate one area from another.  The scenery approaching nightfall is the most interesting, but it's only temporary since the game uses a day/night cycle.  The caves and forests look okay but I've seen my share of those over the years.  Plus they can be confusing too.  While I normally never base a game on graphics, the way you take these many paths and end up on different screens is particularly clunky and low budget looking.  An NES game though, I get it.

Jason isn't the only boss fight either- there's also a purple haired demonic head that appears sometimes.  I should mention that the boss fights aren't like the ones you'd find in most 2D games- these ones are positioned near the top of the screen as the camera changes into a first person view which is probably supposed to capture the tension-filled feeling of the bosses being in front of you (I don't feel the tension though).  I don't mind the different view but the boss fights themselves are *really* mediocre.  With only Jason and a demonic head, the game feels incomplete.

Also, LOL!  For a while I had no idea the purple monster coming after me was Jason.  I thought it was just some purple monster.  Running from Jason (or Jason running from you, heh) are a numerous and redundant occurrence throughout this game.  Wherever you go you're treated to more zombies (geez haven't seen enough of those!)  Other enemies include wolves and diving black birds (all poorly animated).  That's about it.  Really bland small selection.  Also you come across Jason WAY too many times for such a short game.  This is clearly because the game doesn't offer enough variety in levels and enemies, so they throw several Jason appearances your way to make up for it.

Not that it matters much, but the game doesn't follow the movies at all.  I understand for the sake of a video game stories are often changed, but I think more suspense could have been implemented such as say, changing the concept so you're constantly running or hiding from Jason.  However maybe that would have backfired in a big way if Home Alone is any indication (one of the worst games ever).  Then again Home Alone would have been a lot better if there had been more ways to take out the robbers, and the home itself was bigger.  The same problem here too- Friday the 13th just needed to be a bigger game.

I think my biggest gripe is that Friday the 13th just isn't long enough.  It's just not enough on all counts- not enough enemy variety, not enough stage variety (really feels like I'm going through the same 3 or 4 areas the whole time), a sophisticated concept revolving around fighting Jason that was okay but could have been made better with more places to explore and more dangerous predicaments, Jason not being intimidating whatsoever (unless you count how fast he gets near the end which of course increases the cheapshots because your character can't move nearly as fast as he can), etc.  It honestly doesn't make sense that Jason wouldn't feel like a threat considering he pops up unpredictably a lot of times, but he's just so laughable sporting purple that it's hard to take him seriously.  Well until he gets faster with better weapons near the end- THEN I take him more seriously!

Others might see the underrated appeal in the game and the sophistication behind the concept, but it could have been done a whole lot better had the game simply been bigger.  A lack of a map in the woods and caves is just bizarre and only contributes to the confusion.  The lack of a scary atmosphere is favor of more straight forward music is another strange feature of the game.  It really feels like the concept behind Friday the 13th was worked on very well until a certain point, then the game was released incomplete.  The game feels 60% done.  Perhaps the release was following a strict deadline who knows.",2.0

"When reviewing the online sale page for this, it said that the 72pin had already been replaced and the unit was functional(slightly stained). I was completely fine with the visual appearance issues simply because the unit was functional. There were at least 7 other ""functional"" units available to buy at the time, but this one said that the pin had been replaced. I received the unit, took it home, and found that it DOES NOT function as advertised. I have multiple games, so I attempted using every game and still wouldn't work. So I contacted the seller, and they seemed dismissive about it, but suggested that I clean the game connections and try again. So, I did that and still did not work. I am going to repair the unit myself just because I know that I can and I don't feel the need to hassle with a company that wasn't exactly honest about the condition of the unit to begin with. My thought is that if you have to take a Q-Tip and a cleaning solution just to play the thing(which is what the told me after I already had possession of it and was frustrated that it wouldn't work), then I would've just moved on to the next unit to make a purchase. I personally just don't believe all the facts were posted when this item was placed on Amazon. I feel no anger towards the seller, and I'm sure they probably do sell quality items, I just personally believe there was some bad judgement on this particular one and I refuse to give someone a good rating when I'm the one who has to spend even more money just to fix this mistake at the end of it all.",2.0

"Although the first in a popular series, this isn't the best and is incomparable to Super Metroid. Granted the game is big, which means there is lots of exploring, there is one set of closely related problems that make Metroid less than steller, all related to attacking: Samus curls (or does nothing if you don't have the ball) when you press down so she cannot duck and shoot, disabling her from attacking small anemies on the ground until she has the ball-bomb or wave beam much later in the game. Additionally, Samus cannot shoot diagnally in any direction and she cannot shoot downwards. In my review of Super Mario 64, I said that one shouldn't only complain about what a game does NOT have; however, these features would be practically essential to the game.

"Back in ancient times, when gameplay was more important than graphics, Final Fantasy set the RPG standard and went on to become one of the largest franchises in gaming history. It all started here, though now it seems hard to understand exactly why.
The storyline is simple: pick four characters and save the world from the four Fiends. That's it. No intricate backstories for each of the characters; no interaction; no side quests. You have very little control as to how the story progresses. In this category Final Fantasy is no more impressive than The Legend Of Zelda.
Graphics and sound are barely worth commenting on in this day and age, though the music is very good. It's all standard 8-bit Nintendo. You know what to expect, and it works just fine.
Gameplay is generally good, but there are a few flaws. In battle, for example, when you choose which enemy to attack, that character is committed to do so, even if the enemy has died or run away. One could argue this adds a level of strategy to the game, which is true. However, it can also be annoying. Another major drawback, though not in battle, is the merchant system. For many of the dungeons you practically have to fill up on Heal potions. The bad news is that you can only buy one at a time, which means that to buy one hundred Heals, you have to go through the sequence as many times. That comes to almost three hundred button pushes(297, to be exact) to fill up from zero. I can't imagine it would've been very difficult to add an extra menu to give the option of purchasing five or even ten of the same item in one sequence.
Altogether, I'm not nearly as happy with this one as I am with #4 or #6. It just doesn't have the personality or heart of the later entries. Without this, the gameplay is pretty bland. If you're eager to see how one of the greatest series of games began I highly recommend Final Fantasy. To everyone else: be warned; it can get very tedious.",2.0
"A lot of people think any game with Final Fantasy in the title is a great game, but with this game it's not the case.
First of all let's look at the story...oh wait a minute, they're basically isn't much of a story. There is a story, but it's the simple sort of thing you'd expect from a platformer(not that platformer's are bad, but this is an RPG). Not only are your characters generic adventurers, but they don't even have default names.
There gameplay also isn't very good. You travel from place to place collecting items, but there really isn't much to distinguish the different places. You also don't learn magic by leveling up. You learn it buying it, which takes the fun out of learning new spells. When you're in battle, if someone attack an enemy, but someone else kills it first that attack hits nothing. You also have magic points for each magic attack, but that's not really a bad thing.
The sound is pretty standard NES, but the game has some pretty good songs and some classic ones like the opening song which appeared in other Final Fantasy games.
All in all this game is very outdated and if you want to play a decent NES RPG, I'd suggest Destiny of an Emperor or one of the Dragon Warrior games. I'd also stay clear of the Japanese Final Fantasy 2 & 3. They're about the same as the first one, and it's no wonder they skipped 2 & 3. All other Final Fantasy games are worth playing.",2.0

But for the original NES? Well....it probably would've been better if the same development team was behind it. Rare was behind this version of Super Off Road, and unfortunately, it suffers quite a bit.

It's not exactly a BAD game, but it's very weak in comparison to its 16-Bit counterparts. All of the cars move too slowly for any enjoyment out of speed, and the races tend to drag. The music is also a big step down. Gone are the gritty, catchy, and radically memorable tunes, and in are exclusive, just okay-ish songs.

All of the game's mechanics are still there, though - Using nitros to move a little faster and purchasing upgrades are all present and accounted for, and they work just as fine. Just a shame the sense of speed and the audio department are really lacking. It hurts the game as a whole.",2.0

"Being a fan of the previous versus games, I was initially exited when i saw this installed in the local arcade; and it kept my interest, for a short time.
I've read the other reviews, and spent a large amount of time playing it also, and everyone's greatest praise about the game is the fact that it has so many characters, 56 total.  One of the many problems with having so many characters however is that there are a lot of glitches.  Glitches you ask, where?  Everywhere.  Everytime someone does those ""great"" infinite combos, they are abusing invicibility frames.  And the very sad thing is, the infinites are not even hard to do.  Oftentimes, they requires jump-ins followed by pop-ups and juggles, making it like a game of tekken, whee! It would be okay if the game had some glitches, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike has the kara-throw glitch, and Capcom vs. SNK 2 has the kara-cancel glitch, but this game has far too many.  I may sound bitter about the use of infinite combos, I will let you know that I know how to do them, and have done alot of them against other people, so it is not like I've had a few pulled against me and I hate them.  I just find them very cheap play, and in the end lack a lot of skill.
Another thing, many of the characters were shafted in their port from their respective games (ie. The Darkstalkers crew, and, dare i even say it, many of the Street Fighter crew).
Control:  The whole 4 button thing.  All other capcom fighting games (excluding Capcom vs. SNK) work with a six button controller, why change it to four.  Strong and Forward were always necessary in every other game.  Peoples tactics revolve around the two medium buttons.  With characters getting shafted left and right, I guess it doesn't matter right?  Shoto-scrubs can still pull off their Shun Goku Sastu (Raging Demon) with Akuma.  Less buttons to get confused with, right?
Music:  Not the greatest, not the worst.  The jazz isn't as fight inspiring as other fighting games like Guilty Gear X, whose music is fast and invigorating.  The music however is not what judges a fighting game.
Replayability:  As much as i dislike this game, i have to say there is a large amount of replayability.  With so many different available characters in order to form your teams there are near endless combinations of characters.  Sadly however, people will end up forming a team they like, and never stray.  And with infinites, it means some of the lesser know, less cheap character won't see much play time.
Overall:  If you were a fan of the arcade version, and want to shell out the money to play this thing at your home, by all means, feel free.  I however, reccomend buying Street Fighter 3 Third Strike, which takes much much longer to master, and is so much more rewarding winning in the arcade using tactics than a winning with an infinite trap.  Or if you are willing to spend the money to import (or have a ps2/gamecube/x-box) get Capcom vs. SNK 2, which with its 48 characters is shy of this game by 8, except in CvS2, every character can hold their own, and it is a treat for us SNK fans because we get to see a lot of our favorite characters with medium punches and extra animations.",2.0
"This game takes no skill whatsoever. I won't get into the semantics of what Capcom games rise above the rest, but I think it's generally agreed upon in the fighting game community that the 'versus' series is for morons and children. I will admit that at first, I liked the game somewhat, but the noveltly soon wore off when I realized I could either carefully execute team moves and supers or just close my eyes and mash buttons and come out equally in the end.  Another problem I had is that I don't have ADD, which is apparently needed to keep track of the (at times) 6 characters on screen.
Aside from the tired game play, the music is the worst ever composed for a video game. Capcom isn't known for it's scores (as is it's former rival SNK), but this piece of s**t takes the cake. From the obnoxious ""I WANNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIIIIDE"" to ""DRIVE ME CRAAAAZAAAAY BUT I WON'T LET YOU GOOOOOO"", you'll need to put your TV on mute if you bother with this.
If you like fighting games with some level of skill involved, play SF2T or any of the SF games. Hell, pick up Capcom Vs. SNK, the only GOOD versus game EVER!

"Although I'm not too impressed of the cover art of this title, but what I found to be much unimpressive is the horrific gameplay.  For those that don't know, the famous Italian actor name Fabio Lanzoni is the model posing with the sword on the game's cover like a bad-ass and its a common marketing tool to get kids' parents (including a horny middle aged housewife or single mother - lol) to waste their hard earned money on a mediocre game for their kids.  For starters, the character's (Kuros) sword attack is very short range and awkward (you don't stand a chance against any melees when neccessary).  There are other alternative attacks like projectile spells, but they deplete your magic very quickly and they must be conserved for the elemental boss battles of which swifter than lightning strategies are mandatory.  Weapon upgrades don't help as much and you can't perform a jump attack which is neccessary for those multiple airborne creatures that must be warded off.  The jump configurations are useless and I thought it was me, but its hard to steer while in the air. The game's music is pleasing and so are the graphics and color schemes.  The game's objectives are simple and to the point - defeating all four elemental guardians who stand in your way to obtain the iron sword you must use to defeat the evil Malkil in the Icefire Mountain.  To progress through each level, Kuros must find a golden artifact for each Animal King for each elemental domain and they will help you advance toward the domain so he can find the neccessary magic spells and armor/weapon upgrades (range of the weapon still sucks) needed to defeat each Guardians.  As I said before the controls are very flawed and adding on the the difficulty is the absent ""after hit"" invisiblity, fast depleting life bar, difficulty in seeing whats ahead before its too late due to the screen's influent pace, and limited continues.  Iron Sword looks like it could've been a very good game, but due to the mild success of the previous game and the cover art of the game, it misleaded many gamers and kids wasted their money and time on this mediocre title.  The game designers are laughing their heads off and collecting their money while many frustrated gamers like myself are biting the controls as early as level 1 because we die from multiple enemy attacks due to the cumbersome controls.  The game designers didn't want to repeat the same formula as simular themed great games like The Legend of Zelda, Gauntlet, and Castlevania, but I think they took three steps back by trying to emulate an average game like Capcom's Ghosts & Goblins, but they failed.  I wasted a good $5 on this title and I can't take it back.",2.0

"What a shock. That's all I can say. Secret of Mana (SoM) and it's ilk that used the same game engine (most notably Secret of Evermore) defined, in my  heart, what a live action RPG should be. There where several key things  that defined the SoM game.
  One was the co-op play with another player  (up to three players total). This allowed the game to be put into the  ""play at parties"" pile. Games are fun by yourself, even more fun  when two skilled players are in on it. Sadly this is poorly implemented in  Legend of Mana (LoM). It's bad enough when the other player has a hard time  interacting with the game world. Worse when you have to go to a  ""special"" place for that second person to join. Even lower still  when the NPC's are unstable. By that I mean in SoM the two NPC characters  only left the main character alone for any great amount of time once, after  joining the party. LoM NPC's don't stick around for very long. At least the  other player can ""import"" their characters.
  The other was  the incredible item wheel. This gaming innovation allowed the player to  quickly select any item or spell in the heat of battle. This wonderful  innovation in gaming is sadly missing and once again players are forced to  suffer through menus.
  And finally, the battles stink. SoM allowed  complete and total freedom when dealing with the baddies (Except for the  level bosses). You chose to stay and fight or you chose to run for cover.  LoM battles are loaded on an area by area basis and running is not an  option. This isn't a problem at first but your patience will wear out very  quickly after you fought the same dang monsters for the 26th time.
  I  own the Japanese sequel to SoM. Suffice to say it is not fair to make this  kind of punishing leap to the American market when the American market  expects a sequel to SoM and not Seiken Densetsu 3. ALL of the key elements  that made SoM a sleeper hit in the US is missing in this one. LoM is  nothing more than an empty collectors item. Although this game does have a  few redeeming qualities. I gave one star to the eye-popping eye-candy,  which make this a great game to watch. And the colorful world is a joy to  explore, but strip it all away and what do you have? An empty game that is  trying to cash in on the underground success of SoM.
  I give another  star to the insight of ingenious programmer who configured the controls for  one-handed use. You'll need it when your brain reduces it's operating level  to a minimum while playing.",2.0
"The first Mana game, Final Fantasy Adventure, was awesome. So was its remake called Sword of Mana. And Secret of Mana, for the SNES, was an amazing classic beloved by many after all these years. So what happened with Legend of Mana?

First off, this game doesnt have the free flowing world and fighting of the previous games. There is no linking areas to travel between. Each area/dungeon has its own little space and must be found by doing quests. After you have obtained the new area you can place it anywhere on the world map, for reasons not wholly known or cared for. Its a very strange concept at best.

And the battles. Oh, what a terrible system!

When you enter a battle, all of which are preset and cannot be avoided, your character moves in stutter steps. He/she moves somewhat like a fencer, a pace at a time. This makes for awkward movement. And if you want to dodge enemies you have to move up and down. Want to attack? You can only attack the left and right. This two-way dodge/attack system was totally uneccessary compared to Sword and Secret of Manas free moving combat.

And the difficulty of the game... or lack there of.

In battle you can hide in a corner and slowly replenish life. Have a teamate? Stand close to them and you will regain life about 3x faster then normal. And sometimes defeated enemies drop candy which replenish all or most of your life. Oh, and after every battle you regain ALL of your life.

There are more ways to heal your character in battle than to attack!

All in all this game is a garbled mess. Its a failed attempt of Square to make a 'unique' Mana game which strays from the original formula. I cannot believe this game came from the same company as Secret of Mana, the Chrono games, and the Final Fantasy games. Avoid at all costs.",2.0
"I love RPGs they're very constructive and many of them have a good plot. I play all kinds of rpgs and i don't discriminate them if they're graphics are lousey or their music stinks as long as their story is off the wall. Being a mana fan that was what i expected legend of mana to be. Of course my expectations were shot when i played it, it is the most depressing game out there, you a play a soulless protagonist who goes on depressing adventures, which for the most part end up in a sad ending. The worst is when you have to face the last boss man why they make us fight that person i don't know. It truly destroys the beauty of the mana series.",2.0
"For those of you who remember the original Secret of Mana, and even other games in the series such as Final Fantasy Adventure (Seiken Densetsu) and Seiken Densetsu 3, this game brings back the feel of those games with its battle system.  However, a new plot system has been implemented allowing you to place your lands, affecting your quests and ""mana levels"", which increase or decrease the power of elemental attacks.  Over the course of the game, you learn skills such as weapon and armor tempering, instrument creation, and golem animation.  It is possible to create ultimate weapons and armor using these skills.  However, these skills can be frustrating and time consuming, and often detract from the already somewhat slow progress of your gaming.  The battle system also has its flaws.  You can move in all directions just as you can in the other games- but you can only attack left and right.  Bummer.  All in all, this is a nice game if you want to spend lots of time experimenting tempering weapons and armor and spending endless hours pouring over what button combination to try next to find how to use that stuped Ragnarok attack and pouring over guides on how to place your lands and when to place your lands in order to get every single quest and item you possibly can.  Simply: ugh.",2.0
"When a Rainbow Six game would come out, I would be excited because I liked the game. Yet now it is losing ""brownie points"" with me.  Game after game, each one only has a few new weapons and places to kill people.  That's the other thing, the gun shots to the players and enemies are not  realistic.  Most people, when shot, bleed more and die in much more painful  ways. The game's AI and weapons are the only reason I give this game two  stars. If you are a Die Hard fan like I was, then you'll like this.  But  sooner or later, you will be fed up with this ficticious game. If I were  you, I would try Soldier of Fortune. As realistic as can be. It's explosive  realism makes it difficult to tell the difference between it being a game  or real life.",2.0

It's a good game if you're in to serious philosphies and wonders about life.",2.0
"Beyond Atlantis is a game in the spirit of Myst and Riven.  Unfortunately, Beyond Atlantis doesn't have what it takes to make a great game.  While the graphics are very good (I won't say breathtaking, because they weren't quite that good) what makes or breaks this sort of game is the puzzles, and the puzzles in Beyond Atlantis are horrible.  They are mostly inventory-based (i.e., you have jump through some hoops to get an object that allows you to activate something or talk to somebody.)  However, the puzzles just aren't logical.  For example, why does one character only speak incoherently until I bring him a particular slab of rock?  Or why does clicking on some pictures on the wall result in the wall giving me a pearl?  This is never explained.  Furthermore, there is no continuity in the game--you never have any idea what you are really trying to accomplish.  Now, there are some positive aspects to the game (very nice graphics, and a couple of good puzzles) but I suggest that if you play this game, keep a hint manual or a walkthrough handy, because without it the only way you will beat the game is just through dumb luck...",2.0
"I found this to be an average puzzle-solving adventure game, much like many of the other games of the same caliber that are out there.  I did, however, question the rating on the game.  The game holds an ""E"" rating which states that it is suitable for any person age 6 and older.  I believe that a young child would not be able to solve many of the puzzles and challenges in the game, unless they purchased a cheat book or went on the internet (like I did) to get hints for the puzzles.  Plus, some of the creatures encountered in the game may frighten younger audiences, and a scantily-clad priestess in the Maya scene may not be suitable for younger eyes.  You can use your discretion on this, but I gave the game a two-star rating.",2.0
"Everything in this game is confusing, especially with no instructions. The game almost expects you to know what to do and how to solve clues. I struggled through this game for a long time and could not understand what was going on. The only thing I give this game credit for, is the graphic's and exotic and ancient soundtrack, otherwise, this game is needle in a haystack!",2.0
"The graphics were great, but it was difficult to figure out where to go. The puzzles were exrtremely hard, and there didn't seem to be much of a point to the game. So, if you come across this game, think twice before being grabbing it off the shelf. However, if you like Puzzle games, such as Myst, then you would probably enjoy the shere boringness of going in circles around a stream or trying to talk to a giant spider, or pheraps you would like walking in a sheep's field? Maybe talking to monks? Watching a fox chasing chickens always excites me! And don't forget the shadow outside the chinease gates, too scary for words, and remember that spinning the turtle in circles is the way out!!",2.0
"The only saving point for this game is the graphics...I have to admit that some of them were absolutely astonishing.  That out of the way, THIS GAME WAS A WASTE OF TIME!  Far too many of the puzzles were either too pixel-sensitive or too obscure to grasp the concept without tearing one's hair out!  There was WAY too much backtracking to accomplish tasks, having to talk to someone on the other side of a world to finish a particular puzzle, with no hint whatsoever of having to do so.  Necessary objects to complete puzzles often just blended into the scenery, almost as if they were not even objects.  Also, vital clues to solving puzzles were stashed away in one, little, unobtrusive graphic that could have been easily missed.  Cryo and Dreamcatcher seemed to spend all development time on the graphics, but relied too heavily on them instead of integrating the puzzles into them.  Much like some of Dreamcatcher's games, The Crystal Key (just as maddening), The FOrgotten (the first in a series that seems to have been forgotten, thankfully), and others.  I just finished Myst : Exile, and was thoroughly impressed that I solved it without the need of a walkthrough.  Much more satisfying.",2.0
"I have liked every game Dreamcatcher has ever released, but this one was a little tough to swallow. In typical Dreamcatcher fashion, the graphics are wonderful and the music is very relaxing and laid back. I think the reason for the calming music was the fact that this game is very annoying. Now. I consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games, and if I get stuck, I call a couple of friends and we work these out together. But neither of us liked this game very well. the clues aren't detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious. You don't know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence. Very annoying. when they speak to you, it's like your speaking to Confuscious. Very hard to discern the clues they are giving. My suggestion is spend your money on another Dreamcatcher game: Traitors Gate. That is a game worthy of all point and click puzzle solving game players.",2.0
"This game provides a real experience for a PC gamer  - the graphics are terrific, and the whole ""mystique"" of the theme intices you to try it. But shortly afterwards, the frustration that sets in will make you sorry you did!  I am not into PC games as much as some of the other reviewers are, but I am an intelligent person that enjoys a challenge, and a diversion once in awhile. I picked the WRONG game for that! This game required my finding a ""cheat site"" on the web so I could continue on with it, and I have needed to refer to it throughout my attempts at it. And the ""cheat"" info was not always enough to get me past an obstacle. There are very few clues for you to know what you're even supposed to be looking for, ridiculous blocks along the way, and slow movements that only add to the frustration level. Find another game!",2.0

"The 7th Guest has a good premise, but the inability to escape out of boring (and useless) dialog is almost enough to make me cry in frustration.

When this game first came out it was outstanding.  We have come along way since then.  The story is very weak.  There are way too many puzzles closely resembling chess.  The piano puzzle is overdone and the Basement maze is from hell itself-even with hints.  The scenes are gross but fun.  It is fun watching the scenes unravel eventually.  It is a nice house.,2.0
"I would have given it two and a half stars, but I'll have to give it two.  There are some fun puzzles in this game, but it lacks a lot.
One -- some of the puzzles are badly unoriginal.  The worst example of this is a player piano that imitates the game ""Simon"", where you have to remember the tune and play it back.  Other puzzles almost repeat themselves
Two -- the puzzles do not interact with the game play at all.  The game is basically just a walkthrough movie, with puzzles here and there to solve so that you can make it to the next part of the movie.  In this respect, it is somewhat like the game ""Fool's Errand""
Three -- the animation moves too darn slow in the puzzles.  When you click on a move, the characters or icons on the screen move annoyingly slow.
Overall though, if you buy it cheap off the rack, it will be worth it for you.  But it is still not a great game at all.",2.0

"Like other reviewers, I've had problems with this game on both Win 2k and Windows XP. On 2k, the game installs and loads, but stalls on the first screen. On XP, the game installs but does not load.

I originally bought this in China (legally) and thought that this may be the reason. I used to play it on a Windows 98 machine until that machine crashed, and I had to upgrade to 2k, and have not played it since.

I also contacted EA Tech Support who insisted that this game is/was designed for Windows 98. They suggested I run the compatibility wizard but this was a failure.

Why they're still selling this game escapes me. Maybe they've corrected things on later versions though.

If you can get it to run, this really is a fun game. There are plenty of improvements from Sim City 2000 that I enjoyed, especially the more logical traffic and crime patterns, and the huge increase in map size.

All in all though, don't buy this.",2.0

This is the only PC game I have ever encountered that my CD drives scratch just by using it (mind you I have no clue why. I excanged it twice already).  It only works correctly running windows 95 or 98, none of the 2000 editions (ME, 2000, XP).  If you are a fan of the Sim City Franchise, buy this game and make sure you have the reccommended requirements for best gameplay.  Otherwise, I wouldn't reccommend it.",2.0
"This game should be lowered by at least [amount]. This game takes up a lot of space on your hard drive. Sim City 3000 Unlimited isn't much different then Sim City 3000, the biggest difference of all is that its ... more exspensive. It runs slow on almost every computer, and it will sometimes have a few bugs. Example: every once in awhile me and my friend will see people walking across water where a bridge was a long time ago. This game also crashes very often. Now I'll explane the advantages:
Sim City 3000 Unlimited has all the features of Sim City 3000 plus a bit more.
You get to select from hundreds of new buildings, or make your own with the new Building Architect Plus tool.
You get to chose from more disasters such as whirlpools, falling space junk, toxic clouds, and swarms of locust.
Play 13 new scenarios or make your own.
This game also includes famous landmarks including The Statue of Liberty.

"SimCity 3k has great graphics hands-down, but if you've played oyther SimCitys then you've played SimCity 3k. The gameplay is identical with minor tweaks here and there, but with most of the hype that went into this game left out. You can't tweak individual buildings, or really get into the management of a city as you would like to. Once again things like subways and buses operate without an revenue generation (what country in the world gives away public transportation?), thus tying your economic fate to basically taxes (which are a simple model as well) and some policies. Graphics are great, but the gameplay is the same as before.",2.0
"I live in a rural area with only one ISP available and this has presented a BIG problem when attempting to play Quake III Arena online.
If I lived in a city where I could get Sega.net or had other options for Internet access this game would probably be fantastic to play but the constant *Connection Interrupted* with my lowly rural ISP has left me highly frustrated with this game.

"Quake for Dreamcast is a HUGE disappointment!!! The games has a useless, irrelevant single player on par with Outtrigger and since online in no longer available the game is all but virtually useless except if you have friends over.
The game play is a little too fast and control on the controller (although it can be customised) is difficult. Aiming and tracking enemies becomes unbearably difficult with the controller and brings the game down more than anything else!! Nothing is more frustrating than trying to dodge and return fire through strifing, it is accomplished much easier in Outtrigger!
Overall Quake Arena is a serious let down!! I have Quake 2 on my PC and enjoyed the single player missions which are in NO WAY found in Quake Arena! I was really excited to get this game as I read all the over-hyped reviews on this site and others...but my heart was broken by frustrating and frantic speeds coupled with annoying aiming or lack of aiming mechanism.
I was first introduced to the genre through the multi-player Deathmatch of Rainbow 6: Rogue Spear on the DC and that was a much better experience with my friends. The idea of stealth, sniping, throwing grenades around corners and planting c4 all made that title a much better investment. Quake Arena lacks ALL that and exchanges it with fast running... shoot... run out of ammo... run... run... shoot with no strategy... run etc. You get the point. The game simply has you running VERY fast and struggling to process all the action.
On the plus side the game has good graphics, sound and the ability to turn blood OFF...thats it the positives end there!
My final word is simply this...""Look elsewhere for a good FPS""",2.0
"I rented this game with some of my friends mostly because I think Sonic is really cool and I thought this game would also be.  I couldn't believe it!  Besides this game being Mario Party with different characters it has a huge learning curve.  I will explain...Sonic Shuffle is basically a board game in which you get cards that have numbers from 1-6 & S (S is a random number from 1-7) in which you use to defeat enemies and screw up your oponents.  A gem is placed somewhere on the board and it is a race to the jewel...as soon as you reach the jewel you have to face an enemie that defends the gem and if defeated you win the gem.  The learning curve is not knowing where to go.  The computer knows exactly which way to go, and even shortcuts to the gem!  I'm not saying I am a sore loser but they could atleast make it an easier learning curve AND not have putten a N64 game onto a 128-bit system (mario party).  If you are looking for a fun party game, look else where and see what other 4-player games they have out for Sega Dreamcast.  Good luck shopping/browsing.",2.0
"Before I wanted this, I expected this to be a fun, entertaining experience.  Instead, I got this: bad AI, boring gameplay, and only 8 playable characters.  I expected more out of Sonic Shuffle.

On paper, Sonic Shuffle is great:  picking out cards, moving to spaces, and getting the most Precious Stones.  In practice, it is the opposite.  This is a very boring game, and with the AI, they can be very hard to beat, even on the Easy difficulty setting.  The game's story is horrible:  A fairy named Lumina asks the Sonic team to help her get Precious Stones and save everyone's dreams from Void.  Yeah, it's a baby story.

The graphics are suprisingly good.

The sound is so bad.

This game doesn't live up to its full potential.  Add minigames that are either frustrating or confusing, and you've got one of the worst games ever made.",2.0
"I read reviews before buying this game and thought it might be fun. Boy was I wrong. What sold me was the possibility of finally playing a Sonic game with more than one person at a time. There is no action in this game. It's basically a child's poker game. Slow and boring. I wish I could return it, but you all know the... return policy. If you like playing cards, buy someplaying cards. If you like playing video games, don't buy this game.",2.0
"I'm gonna get this out of the way right now: this game is aggravating. It starts off slow and does not pick up. I first got a taste of it at my friend's party last weekend. We were both pumped to play it and couldn't wait for other guests to arrive so we could have four people playing at once. Well, the excitement wore off as soon as we started playing. The game board was right out of Mario Party and didn't look too exciting. The mini-games were dull and too short. Before too long, the other guests watching were getting bored out of their minds. And so were the people playing. But it's not like we didn't give it a chance! We persisted. We wanted to like it! Then, my friend did us all a favor: he turned off. Sadly, the rest of the guests cheered. Not the sign of a good game. I'm sticking with board games.",2.0
"NFL 2K1 is a fun game if you're just looking for a good football simulation game with no basis in reality.  The menus are quite intuitive, the learning curve is quick, and the player movement is pretty good.  That being said, I cannot believe that the NFL gave the approval for use of their player names and trademarks on this totally unauthentic effort.  Some of the really obvious problems: EVERY kicker in the game is right-footed, including Oakland's star rookie, Sebastian Janikowski.  There is NO player-specific commentary by the announcers (who ARE these guys, anyway); every comment sounds something like, ""Doug Flutie (insert pregnant pause for disc scanning) really threaded the needle on that pass"".  The Madden games for PS1 may not have commentary directly relating to the play on the field, but it felt a lot more authentic because Pat and John were referencing specific traits of individual players. If you're like me, you'll turn off the commentary after about three series.  The PA announcer isn't much better, either yipping ecstactically when the home team runs for ""No Gain!"" or howling that ""the pass is incomplete!"" on a two yard RUN.  The roster and line-up shuffling is also extremely limited.  Tailbacks and fullbacks are lumped together as generic ""running back"" (not that it matters, because I challenge anyone to actually find a play where the FB carries the ball...), and there is absolutely no way that I've found to change who your kick or punt returner is.  The injury simulation is also lame; first a window pops up at the beginning of a play when someone is going to get injured (BEFORE they actually get hurt), then a few plays later, some crazy message like ""Randle out for four plays with torn groin muscle"". EXCUSE ME???  A torn groin muscle only keeps someone out for FOUR PLAYS???  Much has been said of the revamped running games, too.  Well, here's the scoop: it's impossible to gain more than five yards by running inside, and it's impossible to gain less than fifty by running outside, and those rules apply whether you're running Marshall Faulk or Sam Gash.  The sound effects are also weak: since when does the sound of colliding masses of 300 pounds flesh, bone and shoulder padss sound like popcorn in the microwave? It's obvious that ... nary a football fan was consulted. I'll stay with my Madden 2000 for Playstation for yet another year.",2.0

"Where do I begin? I had been anticipating the release of NBA2K1 for over six months, and when I finally received the game from Amazon and fired it up, I saw a game that paled in comparison to its predecessor. Anybody who can honestly claim that NBA2K1 is a better game than the original NBA2K is clearly more interested in playing 2 on 2 street ball rather than simulating a full NBA game. It's true that the street ball mode is relatively entertaining as a novelty experience, but the greatness of the original NBA2K laid in its awesome fast paced gameplay. NBA2K1 is a game that has been robbed of the intensity that made the original so fun to play. Granted NBA2K had its share of bugs such as: ridiculous shot blocks(Robert Pack rejecting Shaq's dunk), a passing bug where you could not throw a deep outlet pass, too much computer fouling on dunks, and various other annoyances. NBA2K1 fixes many of these things but in doing so the designers also integrated features and behavior that are far more egregious than the faults in NBA2K. For example, the computer will take the vast majority of the 24 second shot clock, standing in place dribbling the ball without taking a shot or calling a play. This is incredibly frustrating because it slows down the pace of the game and makes it much more boring. There is no longer a low post spin move, so you can't terrorize opposing post players anymore. Ridiculous shot blocking has been reduced, but at the cost of your players' intelligence. NBA2K1 defenders seem unable to grasp basic laws of physics, and they feel like they can block shots by jumping straight up in the air and swiping randomly rather than attacking an opponent who is slashing towards the basket. Overall, this game is a weak sophomore effort, and I would advise that you go rent it first before dropping ($) for the real thing.",2.0
"As another reviewer has observed, this game is prone to give your team a strike even when you answer correctly, but with a synonym. When the teams are tied at the end of a round, the ""virtual Louie Anderson"" still gives a message that indicates one of the teams is winning.

"I was pretty disappointed. The big install had me expecting a lot, but they spent way too much on the appearance of Louie and the animation as it is just like you were watching tv, but your not, so don't. They needed to pay more attention to the answers you make, meaning they need to know you know the answer when you answer police and the correct answer is police officer, give me a break.

"OK, I just bought this today, on the day of release- very excited because I love formula 1, and all the hype suggested that this was going to be a  classic game. I never played the two that came before this one, but many  people are really big fans of them.
Your first impression will be:  ""Oh no! The graphics are a bit sub-optimal!"" (lack of texture  filtering, horrible mip-mapping, blocky shadows, 2d pit crew). You will  continue to have negative thoughts as you see cars through the barriers  (What Z-buffer?), *drive* through barriers, grapple with a stupid keyboard  setup because the game won't let you use the cursor keys (yes, really!),  wonder why, if you have auto gear-shifting enabled you have to press the  gear up key to change gear down to reverse, then use that same key plus  accelerate to change back up to first, curse the fact that you have to  drive in cockpit view because you don't get any kind of speed/position/gear  indicators in external views.
The game has plus points, however: the  reflections on wet tracks look nice, the dynamic weather system actually  works, bits falling off cars look really nice, and the whole thing runs a  lot faster/smoother on the same computer compared with F1-2000. (It just  looks like ****).
Overall I would suggest that F1 fans try before they  buy. I can't suggest an alternative however, though I hear that the  fantastic (but somewhat old) Grand Prix Racing Simulation 2 is to get a  sequal soon... ------------------------------------ Beware also, that this  game is based on the 1998 season, which can be a bit confusing when you see  Frentzen driving for Williams instead of Jordan etc.",2.0
"Well, somehow they managed to make a follow-up that is not as good as the first.
Please note that the people who made this sequal are NOT the people who made the original, even though Sierra handles the production.
Pay attention to the negative reviews this game has received, many fans of the original feel a bit betrayed by this one.
Yes, there are some tweaks that are good: waypoints for movement, you can make vessels fly around in circles, some different ships.
However this game does NOT have the magnificent ambience of the original, the voice overs are sickeningly American-accented, it simply does not have anywhere near the class and atmosphere of the first.
Don't get me wrong, it is a good game and if you are starving for more Homeworld then go for it, but don't expect the beauty of the original.
If you do not have Homeworld, GET HOMEWORLD. It's better to enjoy the original first. You won't lose anything by playing that one first. Then play a demo of this one, and if you can stomach it, go for it.
Sierra, get your act together and make some cheap original Homeworld mission packs, thanks, that would be well appreciated.",2.0
"The original Homeworld blew me away.  From that amazing opening sequence with the Addagio for Strings music throughout the rest of the game.  Everything about the game was revolutionary.  Game play and intense storyline.  Which is why I was greatly disappointed with Cataclysm.  Cataclysm didn't invoke any sentiment and failed to completely draw me into the story as did the original.  The Catacysm story is a complete waterdown compared to the original.  The possibilities in ship building and technologies becomes limited compared to Homeworld.  The game is a complete step in about every aspect from the original, except for some nice surrounding graphics. I was very very very very very very disappointed with this.  A definitive second rate sequel.  I wish I had never heard of this sequel, worse yet played it. I recommend sticking to the original Homeworld.  This one will only mar the memory of the original.",2.0
"A disappointing sequel.  The graphics are pretty (if too flashy) and the new characters add some interest, but it's a hollow effort.  The game requires none of the skill that Hasbro's first Frogger did.  The only challenge here is playing the game against a timer--personally, I'd rather be asked to do something well than to do it fast.
One thing I cannot understand here is that the game lacks a save/restore option in Story mode.  This would come in handy if you have more than one person in your household playing the game (i.e. more than one child.)  The scoring system is also irritating--to obtain the one high-score slot for each level, you must compete with some unknown program tester's high score.
Overall the game is entertaining for a few days, but little more.",2.0
"Greeting people. Home World 1 is one of the best RTS (real time strategy) games that I have ever played. It is absolutely awesome and I think that everyone should have it. I will most definately rank this game 5 out of 5 *****. This game is worth its money. I am looking to purchase it again because I have played it for so long that my original CD I bought when the game came out 5 years ago is so scratched up. I am even using a burned copy of my original right now and even my burned copy is getting scratched up.

  I at the moment in Home World1 am in the Lost Souls clan. My name is ViciousLS. I design and develope strategies for the game. I have designed over 5 strategies within the past year. One is SSS known as Sphere's Scout Strategy. The other is VGS, the VicaGaran Strategy. I have gotten more than my money's worth of this game and I can assure you that everyone who plays it right now has as well.

  The people of Home World range from ages 10 all the way to 60. They all get along. There are also many clans. One clan consists of just people 35 years of age and older. They are known as the OMO (Old Men Online) They however, play many many games besides HW1. HW1 far out ranks HW2. Many of us HW1 people do not like HW2 because of its lack of strategic planning and the skills needed to rush the enemy and over come what he or she might have in store for us. Some of us HW1 players get on TeamSpeak, a voice chat. We play the game and stay on the voice chat to coordinate and plan attacks in the game. I myself have voice chatted with many of the people from HW1 and many from other countries. These countries include: USA, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany, UK, Holland, Bosnia, Belguim, France, and Russia. As you can see, it is indeed a wide variety of countries and it is very fun to chat with people of different cultures and to experience how they play on HW1. I a 16 and have chatted on voice chat and played in HW1 with many many people throughout my career. In time we grow and learn to respect eachother in the game. There are some wiseasses and morons in the game yes.. But most of us still have respect for others. New players are allways welcomed by most and I hope that if you get this game, to PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! Learn the basics of the game... Play the single player missions... Read the manual, it provides a good knowoledge of the game.

 I hope to see you soon playing HW1!

"This is by far one of the most boring RTS games I have ever played, and I have played alot of them.
Just like in most RTS games, you have to collect resources. I spent most of my time waiting for the resource collectors to bring the resource. It was so boring. The single player mission was spent over half the time waiting. Waiting for resources. Waiting for your ships to build. Waiting for researches to finish.
The graphics were ok, but given the fact this was a 1999 game, I can see where the graphics would have been pretty good though I believe Total Annihilation, Starcraft, and especially Age Of Empires (which all 3 came out before Homeworld) looked better. The ships looked cool, but if you zoomed in on them, they looked pixally. And the cutscenes were just ok. It was cool to be able to see a 360 view of every ship though.
The battles weren't anything spectacular. You couldn't really see of hear any of the fighting going on. Just the same droning music over and over (the music was cool the first few missions, but gets rather boring later). It was also impossible to follow the battles as your camera follows one of units or the other.
The best thing about this game was the story. The story goes like this: A spaceship was found buried in sand here on Earth. Using that technology and the history found on the ship, they built their own ships so that they could head to their real Homeworld. As the story unfolds and new enemies and friends are made, the story keeps this game going. At least for me, that is the only reason I continued to play this game.
I read all of the reviews on many gamesites including Gamespot and Gamespy and many of the reviews here, and maybe my expectations were high, but one review said that no has since done what homeworld has done. And I believe the reason is who would want to. The idea about completely 3D space game is good in concept, but it takes away from the gameplay too much. This is definitely nothing like the games I mentioned before, but having played over 50 RTS games, this one didn't do it for me.
Next up is Homeworld Cataclysm. I bought all 3 Homeworld games at the same time because the price was cheap. So I don't feel like I was cheated too much. Game wasn't for me, but maybe it is for you.",2.0
"This was more of a point-and-click movie than a game.  With fine graphics  and a variety of characters to interact with, I expected more than what  this short, easy game offered. While the storyline was interesting to a  point (rescue-the-girl is not very original) the end was simply an opening  for a possible sequel rather than a satisfying conclusion or even a  showdown with Dracula or his henchmen.  The most interesting thing to do in  this game is to laugh at the unfortunately named character, ""Dorko,"" when  she says ""Tremble before the rise of Dorko!""  In short, beginners and/or  people who like pretty graphics more than a challenge will enjoy this  game--seasoned gameplayers will likely be disappointed.",2.0
"it was not what i expected. it's so easy...I'm on the second cd withing two hours. Well, i have to confess that i stuck at library of the dracula a little and don't know what to do. It has some interesting graffics, so well  created. Anyhow, it's not one of the best adv.games and i wouldn't recomend  it.",2.0
"Very, very, dissapointing.  The graphics are great but the story line and game play are menial.  The puzzles are not challenging at all and the game is too short. (about  3 hours of gameplay) Save you money and buy something else.",2.0
"I was extremely disappointed in this game.  This was the easiest game I have ever played....it was essentially just a game of connect-the-dots with fancy graphics.  There was never any doubt about what you had to do next, or how to solve a puzzle (if you can even call them puzzles).  75% of the time the items that you needed to solve a puzzle could be found in the immediate vicinity.
However, this game does have one or two things in its favor (hence two stars instead of one). 1) The graphics and cut scenes were well executed. 2) It had a fairly interesting story. 3) This would be a great game for a beginner- they could get the hang of playing a computer game without getting discouraged.",2.0
"How anyone could rate this game above two stars is beyond me.  I was thoroughly disenchanted with this game.  Although the graphics and the cinematic seens were impressive, the fun factor was VERY disappointing.  Don't expect for this to be a high action, role-playing game with lots of shooting, explosions, and weapons.  The actual gameplay is limited with too many cinematic scenes.  Player interaction with the game is severely low. Don't expect to use a gamepad with this game:  the player is limited to the use of the mouse without the keyboard.  This game has left a very negative impression on me toward the makers of this game:  Dreamcatcher Interactive.  I'll think twice before purchasing another game from this company.",2.0
"awkward controls, lame plot, and horrible storyline......",2.0
"Let me explain this game....  however bizzare it may be.
Basicly you are some business tycoon building shops, renting different businesses, and getting rich. Perhaps some 60 yr old retired business man may enjoy this, but definately not the general public.
However, it still has a good side.... starting shops, apartments, ect.. but that becomes boring and repetitive after about 1-2 hours. Definately not worth more than $5",2.0
This game gets boring after an hour or two.  The interface is a bit confusing at the beginning.,2.0
"When I got this game it was fun.  But, after you finish the first level of game scenes it can get pretty boring. I found myself fast fowarding frequently. It's not very replayable. Maybe if they would come out with some additional game levels then you could expand but right now once you've got it you've got it.",2.0
"Step into the real world with a new and highly competitive version of Monopoly. This is not competitive like you roll the dice, see where you land, buy the property, then build houses once you get a monopoly. This is a game where at any given second you can lease a property from the city (where then it goes to auction instead of you just buying it) or you can build a residential or retail area without owning the land (you just rent it). It makes for some interesting things, such as someone will build lots of buildings on rented land, then another player will buy the land out from under them. Once you start enjoying the game, then it unfortunately ends, because this game goes in scenarios, not full-length games (like playing a demo that cuts off after 10 minutes). Its also very tedious, because its the same city over and over, so you basically go build the same stuff over and over. The scenarios sound basic (make 100 sales, earn $3000 profit in one day, reach an empire of $20,000, have the most money by 1945), but they are difficult at times because the game does not offer insights as to how to complete the scenarios. There are nice smooth 3D graphics to the game, but the tools to create buildings are troublesome.",2.0
"At this very moment I am suffering from a terrible headache.  I usually  endure this type of pain when I am stressed out at work or when I encounter  a stress enducing videogame.  Yep, you guessed it, playing this game has  steered me straight to my medicine cabinet.  Let me begin by warning fun  oriented gamers to avoid this nerve grating game at all cost.  It is a  hideously executed game filled with arduous task after task after task. I  feel I'm being punished each time I play this game.  With Ecco, the only  thing that matters is the stunningly gorgeous environments.  Of course,  this is inadequate.  Where's the fun of completing a long task or the  reward of enduring a difficult challenge?  If you want to punish a child  for a misdeed, force him to play this awful game.  For those of you brave  enough to withstand Ecco, I advise you to buy a hint book, otherwise DON'T  WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.",2.0
"This game is very difficult for beginners to pickup. After playing the home version with the DC controler I realized how much I miss those twin sticks. Trying to get use to the controls takes a very long time and the pay off isn't worth it.
Graphics are only as good as the arcade version (perfect port of the arcade visually), which is now dated.
Hardcore Virtual On fans seem to like it a lot, everyone else should pass. There are better rewarding games that take less time to figure out. Oh yeah, where is the Internet play Activision?",2.0
"When I bought this game I thought that it was going to be something fun to play. IT WASN'T! It is very slow, it takes forever to get your airport active, and you always end up going into debt. I got it cheap(dollar amount) but it was a waste! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!",2.0
"well i am a big fan of tycoon games but this one really bites the dust.  Now i think it is a really great concept and i don't mind the graphics.  All the buildings are pretty cool but there is one problem.  One of the things that i like most about tycoon games is to watch the people in the game.  Well in this game the people don't do anything and it gets boring to play, in fact its depressing.  There is no noise and sound, its boring to watch and even more boring to play.  If you want a good tycoon game, one that i think is much better is airline tycoon.  It is the same concept but a much better game.  Take my advice and don't waste your money on this game",2.0
"I bought this game at wal-mart (for half the price...), and I've done the tutorial, read the instruction book, spent a few hours trying to play...not very entertaining.  It has BASIC graphics, very simple (not user friendly, basic programing).  Very difficult to master, but if you've got the time, you could possibly enjoy this game.  One of the other reviews said looking online for strategy guides, again...how much time do you really want to spend playing this game?
I buy a lot and play a lot of these 'tycoon' or simulation games, and I can tell you by experience, this game would be at the bottom of my list of favs.  Hope that helps!",2.0
I bought the game with high hopes having played Roller Coaster Tycoon for many months. This game is just a disappointment. It takes a long time for one year to pass and the game just creeps by. I start the game and then walk away to do other stuff and then come back and clear up any trouble that has developed and then walk off again. It doesn't hold my interest. The graphics are poor to say the least and there are not any instructions to help you get started. This game is not worth it. Go buy RailRoad Tycoon instead.,2.0
"It was a great.  You can't beat 10 dollars.  But when Amazon claims your getting a new copy, obviously you should be sceptical.  With right reasons.  First the game should no longer be in production.  I looked at the case before opening the loose shrink wrap.  You could see prints and markings on the case, a disc was loose since you could hear it.  Open the case and you can see more markings and the internal part of the case was broken.  The second disc didn't fit properly.  I would at least expect it in better condition.  But like I said, definitely be sceptical since it says new.  Should say used.",2.0
"Wait for the patch. This game has far too many bugs, very disappointing.  But it is otherwise a cool game.  You can manage everything in your airport.  I like how you can negotiate contracts with businesses to place  things like fast food joints in your terminal.  I'm waiting to find a patch  (something you can download that will fix the bugs) for this game so i can  finally enjoy it.",2.0
The game is self-explanatory it's phenomenal. The product of that I was sent on the other hand well... The to insert the one in the front and the one of the back that hold the game disc in we're both completely broken. They fell out as soon as I opened it. Now I have tape holding them in. It's disappointing because I do love the game but the only reason collector's by the physical copy is because well that's the whole point. The game gets a 5 star rating hands down but my physical copy well giving two stars is very generous unfortunately.,2.0
"if your looking to play something similar to the amazing and legendary game chrono trigger.. this isn't it.
its by far the furthest thing from it

"I purchased this to be a shelf ornament, never to be opened.  If that's not your thing then at $9.99 you really can't beat it for an amazing game.  But I already have an open copy and wanted a clean sealed copy.  The plastic on it looks like a repackage, is loose and almost falling off.  The box it was shipped in was extremely well cushioned to the point it wasn't sliding around inside yet the front was scratched and had holes in the plastic.  I can only assume this happened while being stored in the warehouse.  Bummed out but not worth the hassle to return.

So re-cap.

"I have played almost every rpg ever made for almost all systems, thats how long I've been a gamer and Chrono Trigger will always be in my top five, not for the story but just for sure fun-factor and inventiveness. In hindsight, I don't actually believe Chrono Trigger is nearly good as I once did when I was a kid, but it still blows this game out of the water.

I didn't hate this game either, don't get me wrong, but its just not there. The graphics for the time were amazing I suppose and the battle system is different(often to the point of annoyance), but different isn't always good. They tried to create a plotline as lofty and intricate as something like Xenogears. You go to so many places and meet WAAAAAAY too many party members to the point where they all seem to lose their respective ""face."" You only really need the first two main party members and then pick one more from the other gazillion to form your party. Honestly, I thought the choice to add so many potential members was quite stupid. Also, I feel the storyline is too confusing. Havign beat this game a few years ago I remember almost nothing of what actually happened except for the fact I had already forgotten about most of it before I was even doen with the game, which usually doesn't mark a very enthralling affair in my eyes.

Many people love this game, and I suppose if you try to play it as a game set apart from the Chrono ""franchise,"" as it were, it is a fair stand-alone outing. The Chrono tag is merely a means to an end, however, it is there to sell the game. This game has nothing to do with the original except in name and the use of timetravel. I would not recommend this game as a good rpg to start off on if you've never played one before. If you want the best of the best rpg's then go pick up Persona 3, FF7/FFX/FFXII, Xenogears, Star Ocean, or Suikoden 2/3/5, to name a few. This one can easily be bypassed.",2.0
This is a great game and came on time. Everything was great except for when I took the game out of the envelope I heard a clunk and knew right away that the new battery they put in it came loose and to make sure I tried to save it and the game did NOT save at all. I was able to open it up and resauder it in place but the reason why it came loose on delivery was probably due to the fact that the new brackets that they used to hold the new battery were very thin and weaker then I would have suspected.,2.0
The game is a great game but I bought from this supplier thinking that this one would save and it does not at all.  I will have to replace the battery again.,2.0

"Chrono Cross starts off much like its predecessor, with the protagonist Serge living a carefree life in his home village. However, adventure comes his way, and Serge is whisked off into a tale of adventure. The game takes a while to pick up, but when it does, you will be engrossed in it. The music is brilliantly coordinated with the story of the game, and the presentation assures this as a worthy sequel to Chrono Trigger.

There is one problem...

The game freezes!

The disc freezes during a cutscene towards the end of disc 1. Apparently, it's a widespread problem with Greatest Hits copies of Chrono Cross. This doesn't come up until well past 30 hours in the game, so it is hard to test for it. Keep this in mind when buying Chrono Cross.",2.0

So i did and it said new game, so my friend did what he did to his about two days ago. He took it apart and he and I had to buy another battery that coast $54.36 thats with tax included. He fixed it for me now I'm having fun playing it and it works now. So don't waste $13.95 on a game that doesn't work because you may have to pay $54.36 into fixing it.

"As many of you may already know, Second Generation Pokemon games (Gold, Silver, Crystal) use internal batteries to allow players to save data. The batteries in most of these cartridges are dead. If you're going to buy this game or any of the others, you should plan to have the battery replaced.

That said, if you can find someone or someplace to cheaply replace the battery, you should buy this game if you are even remotely interested in Pokemon. You should also buy it if you have an old Blue, Red, or Yellow cartridge lying around with your old data on it, and more than one Game Boy unit. You can trade all your old favorite Pokemon to the next generation (about mid-way through) and they will level up nearly twice as fast. You can also teach them new moves.

This game is almost twice as long as the original, because you get to go back to the cities in the original after you collect the first set of badges. It also has an internal clock, and some Pokemon can only be caught at night, in the morning, etc. It's a really interesting concept that more games should take advantage of.",2.0
"As a huge fan of Chrono Trigger (best RPG of all time) and a long time fan of RPGs in general, I was eagerly awaiting this title. All of the reviews gave it the best scores. But when I finally picked it up, I was perplexed. I seriously had to wonder if Square was bribing the reviewers.
The game is simple. The story is easily forgettable. The game is easy and the action is boring. With a ridiculous number of playable characters, you aren't given any motivation to really care about any of them. The only reason to get the characters is for a Pokemon-type collector's fix.
I don't write reviews often, but this game is so overrated that I felt compelled to speakout. On the other hand, I guess if 95% of people loved it, chances are you will too. I just reserve the right to say ""I told you so.""",2.0
"This game falls short when it comes as a sequel to the illustrious Chrono Trigger.  The weaknesses/strengths with this sequel are as follows:
Story & Characters: No connection is made to Chrono Trigger until well into the game, also very few characters from the original CT are mentioned, or shown.  Espeically the sorceror Magus (you do see a passing mention to his real name in a letter to Kid, thats it, o and he may be one of two guys in the game), not too mention they got his sister Schala's face structure and skin color ALL wrong at the end.  Also the first ending is quite weak and dumb.
The 40 character roster is ridiculous, having this many characters stresses quantity rather than quality.  Many of the 40+ characters have no personality (besides an accent or odd way of speaking) or story or plot threads behind them.  Most of the characters in this game have no individuality.
The sory is somewhat confusing (as well as the two Dimensions, see below) as its hard to keep straight what happens between the two nearly-identical worlds.
On Dimensional Travel: The dimensional travel back and forth between worlds would of been great, that is if Square would of put at least a little bit of distinction between the two worlds so they do not look nearly identical (perhaps give different continental shapes as in the first CT).  This adds for a lot of confusion when you are completing tasks when going back and forth between worlds.
Levels & Magic: Instead of leveling up (like in normal RPGs) you gain stars for defeating bosses.  So the game leaves you wondering if you ever got stronger at all or if you ever will.  Also magic is not learned it is assigned by ""color"".  And this gives the game even more of a completist ""pokemon"" feel (not too mention the 40+ characters) by classifying the characters all by color, again ruining any chance of individuality between characters.  About the only individuality characters have are different tech skills.
Sound & Music: The opening, well-orchestrated theme ""Scar Of Time"" will blow you away.  The other music in this game is very well done, some of it being slight remixes or remade versions of music in the original CT (except this time its played with real instruments and not synthesized).  There is one point in the game however where you will want to turn down the volume. Although accompanient lacks in some areas (like the acoustic guitar themes) the sound overall is great.
Graphics & Animation: Absolutely breathtaking!  The animation for the spells during battle are well detailed and flow very smoothly, this section along with the sound are the game's strong points.
The game for a hardcore CT player (I swear I played Chrono Trigger so much I had every detail memorized) is somewhat below average.  For one thing there are too many characters (keeping it at 10 max would of been fine), secondly this game was developed to begin with not as a sequel to CT but rather for a Japanese Satellite System called BS where players in Japan can play together (it was called Radical Dreamers back then), and many of the developers and designers said in interviews it is not a true CT sequel (if we are lucky the loyal CT fans might see a real sequel, we can dream cant we?).
The bottom line is if you never played CT you'll enjoy this game.  But if you are like me and were expecting a good sequel to a great game youll be disappointed like me, for some of the many reasons Ive stated above.",2.0
"This game was a mistake, yeah sure there are new pokemon and some new features like the watch and backpack and cell but after that don't expect much.  This game might go under the RPG catagory but if it did it would be an insult to the catagory.  This might suit a 4-11 YEAR old but not older then that.  Real gamers and hardcore RPG gamers would think that the level of diffulculty in this game is a joke.  This first game was an pretty good RPG only because it was a kind of new thing but the theme in a sense of a video game got old fast.  I'm not sayin that pokemon got old and boring, heck you coul put the word pokemon on anything from underware to breakfast cerial and it would be on every kids christmas list.  What i'm trying to say is that the GAME theme got old and this is just a facy re-hash",2.0
"...Being a fan of the legendary Chrono Trigger, I was enthralled by the coming of this game.  ""Chrono Cross"" is actually not a true sequel (as said by the creators), but originally a game called ""Radical Dreamers.""  Anywho, this game DID NOT live up to my expectations at all.  Read on to see why.

THE GOOD
First of all, the graphics are actually quite colorful.  The backgrounds are well colored and animated.  The battle graphics also flow quite well.  Even if some of the characters are not all that great, they are nicely created.  However, these are the only good points I can say about the game.

THE BAD
About the characters: there are about 40 characters jammed into this game and they virtually have no personality.  It's like the creators wanted to boast about the character quantity as opposed to MEMORABLE, AWESOME characters that we play the game for.  Who cares about 40 characters?!  The music: The remixes of Yasnuori Mitsuda's themes from CT are actually excellent, but the rest of the game's music is strictly mediocre.  Quite a shame, considering the same musical composers from CT are here.  The battle system many have boasted about is not that great at all; You virtually don't even level up.  It's pretty much a Final Fantasy Materia/Xenogears combination of a battle system, but it comes off very heavyhanded (not to mention the colors are annoying).

THE UGLY
The critical point about this game is the fact that it doesn't really transcend well into CT.  The Glenn here is NOT Frog (as many have said), and is a very vindictive character that we quickly dismiss.  Schala was VERY MESSED UP at the end of the game, being blonde and in different physical shape.  Lavos was supposedly killed in CT and yet, he somehow survives... something which the game doesn't even explain it well at all.  Which leads to the worst part about the game: the storyline.  What could've been a unique storyline is muddled by inconsistencies and loopholes (examples: humans evolved after apes, BUT in CT, the people were human LONG BEFORE Lavos entered Earth; Lucca supposedly gave up her purpose in life, that is creating machines, to be the head of an orphanage, which goes against Lucca's character.  She also talks about regrets, which contrasts the more confident Lucca from CT; The game states that Guardia was destroyed and the Masamune was stolen, but why even bother when it doesn't even appear as ruins in the game??).

AND THE ULTIMATE SIN...
Robo appears in the game VERY BRIEFLY, and once you find him, he dies!  He was my favorite character in CT (in a close race with Frog) and killing him off like a worthless character was the ultimate sin.  Speaking of Frog, the game assumes that he died and the Masamune was stolen from him.

OVERALL
If you take away the references to CT, it doesn't hurt nearly as much, but it's still a rather generic RPG.  RPG fanatics no doubt love this game (which is why this game is very overrated) and I would've given it three stars.  However, since it blatantly defies the CT legend with a muddled storyline, unappealing characters, merely average music, and just for being VASTLY OVERRATED... this game doesn't deserve anything above 2 stars.  You'll hate me for this, but I demand that an RPG has a decent storyline, a decent battle system, and appealing characters.  This game fails in all three departments.  ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE AN RPG FANATIC.  Otherwise, pass it on, ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of the classic Chrono Trigger.

On a closing note, don't get me wrong, people; The majority of Squaresoft's games are excellent.  The point I am trying to make (by the statement at the very beginning) is that there are TOO MANY fans out there that are blindly devoted to the company; they make hits and misses like everyone else.  Fortunately, this is one of their few misses.",2.0
"Sadly, this was a very poor RPG from Square. Usually I am satisfied with their products, but not this...
Basically, this game trys to pass itself off as the ""sequel"" to the greatness that is Chrono Trigger. In reality, it retains none of the fresh, fun feel of the original game and instead takes itself much too seriously. The mediocre, inane plot agonizingly drags itself along throughout a huge portion of the game, and then dumps loads of information on you at all the wrong times. Worse still, you have to deal with an uninteresting battle system, INCREDIBLY LITTLE character development out of 40+ characters, and a really disappointing final boss. I can't see this game appealing to any Chrono veterans or new fans of the series.
Chrono Cross's only redeeming qualities lie in its music score (composed by the same person that produced Chrono Trigger's music) and graphics (good graphics make for nice eye candy, but I'd take good gameplay over graphics any day, wouldn't you? ^_^).
If you want something good from the Chrono titles, either buy the PSX version of Chrono Trigger that Square had the good sense to release (Final Fantasy Chronicles), or go get the Chrono Cross Original Soundtrack. You won't be sorry!",2.0
"Let me say that I love trivia games, and I still love watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire on the tube.  As for the playstation game though I have  to say this.  First of all the game has a very limmited variety of  questions that start to repeat after only a few plays of the game making it  bore to play after only a couple of days.  Number two, this game could not  load more slowly from question to question, its like sitting and waiting  for your death.  I can get a right answer and wait a full minute untill  Regis is reading the next question, its just so slow you will want to  scream.  My advice, watch this one on the tube, leave the playstation game  alone though.  Try You Dont Know Jack on your computer or Playstation  instead.  Its a better triva game suited for at home play with pals.",2.0
"Well heres my opinion on this game, i personally didn't think it was all that great. NO exp NO leveling up NO Magic Points (MP) WORSE story than the origanal. Sorry im getting ahead of myself. this is what happened i went to the video store and saw that they had chrono cross in i was so excited! i thought this game would be better than the origanal Chrono Trigger was but i was highly dissapointed.  the story is EXTREAMLY slow and dull.  and im not a novice RPG player so i know a bad story when i see one and THIS was a bbbbbaaaaaadddddd story.  I really don't see why they had to dump Chrono and all the other charactors for the new 40+ Charactors!  why the heck do we need 40 characters when you can only use 3 at a time? anyway thats my opinion.  if you really wanna see how much this game stinks buy chrono Trigger or one of the classic Final Fantasys that game is the best RPG ever made!",2.0
"I've been playing RPG's since I was 6 and I loved Chrono Trigger but lately RPG's have been a little stale. Chrono Cross is no exception.
The graphics are great, the world is big, but the game lacks what so many RPG's over the last 5 years lack and thats solid depth. The story line is your typical cookie cutter, wanna be dramatic, that you have come to expect from square.
The music, though the quality is better than games on the old SNES, is not interesting and kind of bland... it will drive you nuts after 60 hours of gameplay. Personally if they can't create any enjoyable music for these 100 hour RPG's than they should just recycle the tunes from the old games.
Character devolpment is horrible, I wish they would bring in a playwrite or psychologist or something to give these bland characters a figment of humanity. Humour could also use a plus in these games, if a game makes me luagh more than 5 times it's gold as far as I'm concerned.
The concept behind the game is excellent, parallel worlds or time periods (depending on which chrono game). Thats great and worked great in the first game, but did square have to change it? Why fix something so stable if it aint broke?
Probably the one thing I enjoyed the most about this game, considering most RPGs run about 70 hours on average nowadays, is that you don't have to fight every enemy like in the first game. But since it is on the playstation this time around there is an annoying load time for battles, which can get tideous after the gizzilionth time.
Lots of shallow side quests and boring mini games (why can't square add a solitare program to there mini game stuff, I'd enjoy that)
When it comes down to it, the technology has advanced so grphics and size and length of the games have increased 3 fold. But it seems to have come at the cost of storyline, realistic character development, complex enviroments, and good music. Basically Chrono Cross was as big a disappointment as most RPGs I've played over recent years with only a minor few exceptions.
I think I'll just stick to strategy games until the vid game industry gets their acts together.",2.0
"This was the worst game that i ever played. If you think it's going to be a continuation from TOY STORY 2, IT'S NOT! First of all it's more like a race car game than an adventure game. I bought this game for my seven year old son, and he is a buzz lightyear fan, but he can't stand this game. You have to collect all these items to advance to the next level, and that was fun, but even when he collected all of the medals the game still wouldn't let him advance. I thought maybe he was missing something, so I gave it a shot,and I couldn't get past the fourth level. I collected every coin and beat the big boss at the end of every level and the game still wouldn't advance me. what fun is that??",2.0
"This game is OK, but there is one big problem with it. My friend brought his to my house the other day and I began playing it. And in, at the most, 2 hours, I beat it! No memory pak needed. There are only like 5 or 6 bosses in the game and the rest is just mindless slinging from one thing to another killing all the baddies. There are so many mini little puzzle type things that are just too easy and useless. He brought it over again last night and I beat it again--on hard difficulty. This game was a great idea, and the graphics and sound are great... but c'mon guys, you coulda done better than that.",2.0
"This game has an extensive bunch of moves, maneuvers, special items, secrets and it has a huge amount of Spiderman memorabilia in it. This is a very detailed Spiderman game because it is a whole 3D world, you as Spiderman or one of his six playable alter egos can swing from building to building, hang upside-down, create a web shield, web the band guys or create web boxing gloves. Everyone is included, like Venom, Carnage, the Scorpion, Rhino, and a 50 ft Mysterio. You must beat them each in a unique way, rather than just beating them up. There are twenty-five levels, however, the big downfall is that you can beat the game from beginning to end in only two or three hours, which makes it like a movie. To add playability to the game you can pick up secret outfits, characters, 3D profiles on bad guys and even comicbook covers documenting the history of the comic.",2.0
the game doesnt save,2.0
The battery inside the game was dead when it arrived and because of this I couldn't save. It was simple to repair but obviously I shouldn't have had to.,2.0
"This game could have been quite good, but unfortunately, it seems to miss all possible target audiences.  It's too easy and annoying for adults and too hard and annoying for kids.  The games big drawback is its clunky controls, which don't allow for the careful movements you'll need to land Simba on the next highest ledge or get rid of those pesky hyenas.  Speaking of which, your anti-hyena arsenal is fairly [bad].  As young Simba, you have a roar with [little] range, a pounce which looks more like a bellyflop, and a rolling attack which can easily send you rolling off one of those narrow platforms.  As adult Simba you have....the exact same attacks.  You would think that maybe Simba's roar would become more effective, his pounce more impressive, or at least that he'd trade that roll in for a maul.  But no, he's just bigger.
Storywise, this game doesn't have much to offer.  Nine levels or so take you through both the original Lion King and the direct to video sequel.  Clips from the movie, looking a bit high on pixels in their translation, attempt to bridge the segments, but unless you've already seen both movies, it won't make much sense.  The shortened plot of the two films omits everything from Mufasa's death to the first half of the sequel which, it seems, is actually about Simba repeatedly rescuing his adult daughter and having a final showdown with Zira.
The graphics department doesn't offer much either.  In polygon form, the characters look chunky and uninteresting.  None of them are animated too well, making the game seem even more dated.  The music and sound effects are all right with a few pretty good choral pieces.  But someone forgot to compose a final battle score, so Simba fights Zira to an uninspired ""doo dee dee doo"".  Only Timon and Pumbaa seem to retain their original voices; everyone else has been redubbed with varying degrees of sucess.
Playing through the game allows you to discover mini-games and eventually a puzzle game (the type where a picture is broken up into squares that you slide around to complete the image).  The mini-games consist of a matching game with young Kiara (who looks a lot llike young Simba who looks a lot like young Nala), a bug catching game, Rafiki fighting off hyenas, and a whack-a-mole game with Timon and Pumbaa.  Some of these are kind of fun, but the controls are still so unresponsive that the enjoyment is diminished.  The puzzle game is about what you'd expect.
I played through the easy mode of this game in a few hours.  After that, I felt no need to pick it up again.  Kids and adults who really love TLK might like this game.  But adults are better off saving up for an eventually DVD release of the film and kids will probably have more fun just watching the movies.",2.0

"Wow I was expecting to love this.  Unfortunatly that didn't last long.  The problem is that there isn't enough time in the Sim's day
to do everything they need too.  To keep my Sims going to work and paying the bills they got behind on socializing and got so
depressed that they wouldn't answer the door when a visitor came over.
The real problem is that if left alone they would never do anything that they needed to (like work), so you can't leave the game
going overnight unattended - like other Maxis games.",2.0

But instead of trying to top it, which makes most companies succesful with a video game franchise like turok, it looks like acclaim thought using the same trick twice would do it, unfortunatley thats not the case. the boss fights were awful and didn't make any sense. The weapons were the same as turok 2 with a few upgrades, most of wich are useless and uncreative. The graphics were excellent for this games time though. Theres more but i cant name them all. If your a casual first person shooter then avoid this game, but if your a turok fan then this game should be in your collection.",2.0

"I absolutely love racing games, and I've never given bad reviews about a game before, until now.  I was heartbroken when I rated this game 2 stars (the graphics and my passion of racing games had keep it from being given a 1 star rating).  The game is not all that bad, it is not all that great either.  The racing needs more speed, it feels that I am racing in slow motion.  More cars to choose from would be nice, and along with more courses.  Is that so much to ask... (I'm getting teary eyed again).",2.0
"I thought this game would be better than it was. The back made it sound soooo cool. The concept is cool but the actual game isn't.
There's one level where you snowboard. You go sooooo slow, it was tooo easy.
There's another one where you have to chase these boys and try to get a picture of them with you in it. That was boring and one shot was too hard to get.
The fashion show was actaully fun, it gives you lots of choices of cool clothing to dress the twins in and then you get to take pictures of them during a fashion show.
There's a food one where you work at a resterant and have all these customers coming up to you with their orders. You have to skate around and get them their order. This one really hurt my fingers (from pushing all the buttons) and went on for too long.
Lastly, I thought it would be soooo much fun to make my own dance video but it was not. It gives you a bunch of moves to choose from and you have to pick like ten. Then when you're actually shooting the video you have to do the effects but all it really is, is pushing the same button over and over. The video is impossible to get the jewl for, I don't know what they're looking for.
Overall I'd definently recommend renting this game before you buy it, who knows, you might even like it but the chances are you won't. I think all the other reviews on this page are from big Mary Kate and Ashley fans who don't want to admit that this game sucks.",2.0
I see this game as boreing and just to gimcky,2.0
Strictly OK.,2.0
"First, let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damnit it was fun. Then, inevitabely, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.

Today, server admins are, for the most part, humorless dictators, and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game's undeniable, monotonous drone. People are still playing the same maps from the 1.0 release, that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential. It always feels as if I've played the same round a thousand times before, and I probably have. Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony. fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds. Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way, and all look disguisting. I've played on probably over 500 servers, and downloaded probably over the same amount of *quality* custom maps, and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation, or voted on by the players. Furthermore, people are still playing the game using dial-up, and CS veterans are always complaining about camping, even if its a tactic used to complete the objective. As far as the objectives are concerned, Counter-Strike has basically become a deathmatch game. No one will listen to anyone's plan (on the rare occasion there is one), no one tries to rescue the hostages, and everyone always calls someone a ""p***y"" or ""nub"" if you use the auto shotgun or AWP. And to top it all off, Valve cancelled the outstanding won.net and replaced it with this Steam garbage, a utility soaking wet with incompetence.

L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter-Strike culture, and has become its own incessant frustration. But I won't even get into that. If you're new to CS, don't bother, veterans of this game are far from friendly, and you'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you're a beginner. For now, if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game, check out World of Warcraft, Battlefield 1942, Sven Co-Op, or even Team Fortress Classic (a dated game with an *awesome* community that has yet to lose its initial charm).",2.0
"I'll make this short and sweet for you.  I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this ""gem"" and see what all the fuss is about on this game.  OVERRATED.

"I started playing Counterstrike nearly when it first came out, beta 4.  The game used to be fun, but eventually, do to cheaters, the game deteriorated.  Many people play this game in ways that many would consider cheating, or unfair play. Due to the frustration caused by this, the game has lost its value.  Also, many people don't play as a team, but instead go solo or ""rambo style"" as I like to call it.  Considering this is a teamplay game, when people don't play as a team, it really is no longer fun.  Another thing about this game is that it has optional voice chat.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to hear some little kid barking orders to me, let alone do I want to hear some people talking about anything while I'm playing this game.  In conclusion, this game is not worth it anymore.  It'll be fun for a few weeks, but once you get used to it, the game is no longer fun.",2.0
"Before you waste your $20 there are some things you should know:
1. The game is full of cheats. Because the game was 'Beta' tested by the general public there are lots of skin hacks, wall hacks, aim-bots and other cheats already developed to make your gaming experience rotten.
2. The game is buggy. Models are drawn wrong, people look like little kids wanding around the maps.  Gun animations are mostly wrong. Guns have ammo bugs where they won't report the right amount of ammo. The rounds system has bugs where people can get money at the start of the round and you get nothing. Players can exploit non-player characters to position themselves outside of the map borders making it impossible for you to accomplish mission goal, or to even find them.
3. The game is a computer hog!  Unless you have a spankin' new video card and a good processor and a good internet connection you will get the most frustrating gaming experience you can imagine. You will have problems connecting to server, the game will lag when people shoot, when people throw smoke grenades, you will get this annoying CL_FLUSHENTITYPACKET errors that will cause you to disconnect from the server. The Sierra/Valve Netcode doesn't work well either, which means you get shot behind corners and get killed by people you don't see.
4. The guns in the game have nasty recoil, terrible recovery times and in general, they are HARD to shoot anyone with. Which means it takes a long time to figure out how to shoot, and even then hitting someone requires luck!
Now, someone might aruge that most of these will all be fixed in the 'official' release. But be aware that some of these items are intentionally put in (Items 3 & 4) while others have been around for SEVERAL betas and the mod maker has shown no interest in fixing them (Item 2).
Spend your money wisely! Because I personally would never spend a cent on this game, even though I enjoy it for free because I own a real copy of Half-Life.",2.0
"Okay. Consider this the horrible negative review of the game. I've seen all the other reviews which are like ""YAH BEST GAME EVAR"" but personally.... *sigh*.  I have a Pentium 3-650, and a Matrox G400 video card, and this game runs very poorly. In fact, in order to match the smoothness I had in Tribes 1 (with a P2-350 and Voodoo 2 video), I had to turn the detail levels ALL down and even then it was choppy if there was another character on the screen.  (and when you have all the detail levels down, the characters look like triangle skeletons and the ground and buildings look like blurred vomit).
So, I guess... judge for yourself. I really like Tribes and I like the gameplay in Tribes 2 (they made a lot of advancements that make sense, although vehicles are still a pig to drive), but unless I go buy a GeForce I don't forsee this as getting any better.",2.0
"I'm an avid FPS (first person shooter) fan, and I was very much looking forward to playing Tribes 2.  I'd read many glowing reviews and heard lots of buzz about the game.  Unfortunately, after three separate attempts to get through the tutorial, I was hopelessly bored with the game and annoyed with the physics engine.

 Bottom line is that this is a complex game that is probably a lot of fun for people who are big into teamplay and resource management, but if you're a die-hard shooter fan like me, I think you'll find that this game's lack of polish and emphasis on complexity is not your cup of tea.",2.0
"I was really excited for this to be released, as I had heard so many positive reviews of the game hitting the shelves.  I had never played Tribes, in fact I grew up on multi-player FPS games off of the Half-Life system like TFC and Counterstrike.  And as I installed Tribes 2 I got even more excited looking through the player's manual at the various options available like the tanks and different weapons.  And then it happened, the game installed and I opened the program, only to find that the game wouldn't play on my system, an unimpressive yet still adequate 450 MHz with a 32 mb video card.  So I sold the game to a friend with a superior system, and got a chance to see it played.  It looked somewhat impressive, but he wasn't too happy with the gameplay or missions invovled and now has it sitting on his shelf.  It seemed as if Sierra released this game while it was still in a beta testing stage, we encountered several bugs and so did players from several gaming message boards I frequent. Overall, this game is probably enjoyable if you have a really top of the line computer system.  Otherwise it might end up collecting dust sooner than a game should.",2.0
"If you have a Voodoo card (don't believe the box which says it is 3dfx compatable), don't buy this game regardless of your machine specs. I am using a Voodoo5500  and I am lucky if I get 20fps out of it(not unplayable,but not worth it either). The game is so fogged in, that you might as well be playing indoors. It does play ok over the internet though. If you have an Nvidia card(Geforce,Geforce2,TNT) you will probably have better luck. I really liked the first Tribes and thought this one would follow in its footsteps.",2.0
"But if you didn't dig it that much, this isn't gonna change your mind. I bought it expecting something different and mindblowing, but I should have known that companies don't change winning formulas. And rightfully so. And I do respect the fact that there's a lot of people out there that do enjoy this game. But the Tribes franchise is not newbie friendly, even for seasoned FPS gamers.
I didn't have a single problem running this game like some of the other people who gave it a bad write up; Tribes 2 works flawlessly on my setup. It also boasts some pretty cool features; after what seems like dozens of patches, they finally got the community features up and running in the game browser. I wish every game had as many cool features in its browser as Tribes 2.
But once you get into the actual game, it's the same old disclauncher fights and turret avoiding as the first Tribes. The learning curve is massive, and I haven't been able to play this game for more than 30 minutes without getting bored or frustrated and turning it off. I had been looking forward to he single player in T2 so that I could better hone my Tribes skills, but the single player ""tutorial"" is a joke, and playing with seasoned Tribes players online doesn't exactly encourage you to get better either.
The only thing I even slightly enjoy is the vehicles, and unfortunately even they are seriously flawed. They're about as maneuverable as dead fish, and eminently more frustrating. I only have fun in them when I'm trying to run over unsuspecting people. Which I might add is also extremely difficult, but usually the only challenge in this game I find remotely worth pursuing.",2.0

In T2, my graphics were choppy, each day brought a new online bug patch, weapons seemed outdated, and all in all, it just wasn't a pleasant playing experience. Counterstrike still rules and Serious Sam (brand new), is a refreshing, low priced, treat. Oh well- maybe this summer when I upgrade to a 1.1 athlon and get cable...",2.0

"Sierra is well known for getting its customers to Beta test their software AFTER they buy it. Remember Tribes (1) and all the patches and upgrades and bug fixes? Tribes2 is no different and if anything, it's much worse. When you first insert the cd you have to endure megabytes of upgrade (repair) patches before you can even start the game. The game play concept is fatally flawed. The idea is that up to 300 (150 per team) people can play and therefore teamwork is absolutely essential. People don't work that way. Imagine trying to get even 50 on your team to cooperate! Ages running from say, 11 to 55. It won't happen. EVER! Gameplay itself is identical to the first Tribes. No difference at all. What IS different are: new maps; better graphics (if you have the high-end hardware); different weapons; changed and more time-consuming invo procedure. The bases are so far apart that play is boring for grab-the-flag. It takes FOREVER to get the game loaded and playing even when it works. The vehicles I tried, like the grav-sled, skitter all over and are nearly impossible to use. Overall, this game is not worth the price unless you have at least a 17"" monitor with a minimum 100 fps refresh rate, a 1.2 ghz cpu, mucho RAM and a hot Geforce2 card. I have a 500 mhz AMD, older 15"", VooDoo3 3000. After MANY HOURS of dealing with downloads, messing with .cs files and changing drivers, I did finally get the game to run fairly well. However, more than 12 players in the game caused me to lag. It wasn't worth all that effort, and definitely wasn't worth the money.",2.0
"I will give an honest review and personal opinion that makes sense. I love playing these first person shooter games and I play things like Unreal Tournament and counter-strike and rogue spear most frequently. I was expecting a great game from what I read on reviews and from word of mouth on the internet (can you really trust it?). I have a P3-667 Mhz with 128 MB of RAM using a Voodoo5500 AGP card.  The game runs pretty decent going on 800x600 (16-bit) on Direct3D mode.  However, OpenGL is a different story.  Even on 640x480, it was really choppy and unplayable.  Although the graphics looked superb in OpenGl,  this game is a machine hog, as everyone has stated earlier. This game sort of reminds me of Team Fortress Classic and how everyone needs to work together. Problem is, nobody does.  Everyone just runs around shooting and killing anything.  I played on several servers and there is no team work as people mention about.  Even though it's a team based game, team work is not there because everyone wants a piece of there own action.  So it was not fun in that sense.  The weapons, to me personally, are like 'whatever'.  They just shoot plasma, lasers, rocket, etc.. and you just hit people.  People are just flying and driving vehicles everywhere and turrets are firing everywhere.  For some reason, this game just wasn't fun.  Sure, I got the hang of the game farely quick, but I found myself wanting to play Counter-Strike instead.  The thrill is just not there as in Counter-strike. As for technical problems - none for me.  Everyone else, on [...] on the forum have so many problems.  But I have not seen any serious problems on my computer.  My personal recommendation is to wait for this game to drop in price and get Counter-strike, if you haven't done so all ready.",2.0
"After the very classic Super NES title ""Super Castlevania IV,"" Konami released another Super NES game in the form of ""Dracula X.""  I'm not sure whether the Genesis game ""Bloodlines"" preceded it or not, so I'm not going to make any judgments in terms of which came first.  I will, however, state that Bloodlines is a FAR better game than this... thing.  It's extremely rare nowadays and for good reason.  Here's the lowdown:
THE GOOD
The graphics are VERY GOOD FOR THE SYSTEM.  They are ALMOST, OH SO CLOSE to the graphics represented in Playstation's ""Symphony of the Night.""  I'm not kidding.  Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the level designs; they weren't perfect, but they certainly weren't terrible.  Unfortunately, these are practically the only two things I can say positive about the game.  Wait, three things: It's rare, so many people didn't waste their money with this.  Ha.  Didn't think I'd find another one, did you?
THE BAD
Oh man, with so much potential you'd think this would be a classic with its storyline that links to Symphony and its high-quality graphics and level design.  The bad comes crashing down on this one; you play as Richter Belmont (like in Symphony), but the whip doesn't twirl around (it only stays straight) AND IT NEVER UPGRADES OR CHANGES WHEN YOU DIE.  I could've spared this game some dignity with the lack of movement for the whip, but why did they make it to where it's always the same?!  That's going against Castlevania tradition!  You've always been able to change your whip and why this game doesn't is beyond me.  Also, the music is very subpar, mostly consisting of rambling techno noise and heavy metal-ish music (which normally would've pleased me...) that doesn't really go anywhere.  Richter also walks VERY SLOWLY, almost like the Game Boy titles, and the jumping is horrid here.  It's almost as bad as controlling your character in the N64 Castlevania's.  I can't emphasize how bad this is.  BAD, BAD, BAD.
OVERALL
I HIGHLY -DO NOT- RECOMMEND THIS.  I'm a huge Castlevania fan and I even know not to buy this game.  If you do buy it, get it for a decent price.  I saw this store have it for 80 bucks with a torn label AND CARTRIDGE ONLY.  My friends, Super Castlevania IV was FAR BETTER than this piece of plastic.  Ultimately, this game had great potential but it comes off as rushed and uninspired.  I hate to bash on a Castlevania game, but I had to.
I also noticed (and apparently reviewer Ted did as well) that many Castlevania fans seemed to like this over Bloodlines.  I can't fathom a reason why since Bloodlines is a better game.  Sometimes, you people make me sick.",2.0
"As a fan of the Karaoke Revolution (K.R.) series, I purchased this game hoping to have something to keep me until the next release. I found myself disappointed with the lack of ""game play"". It did not hold my attention for long.

This game seems to assume that you've played others in the series.

CONS: There are no songs to unlock; the thirty listed are all you ever get.

I found it a bit more difficult to play than K.R.. There is no real-time pitch information for those who aren't spot-on which means if you aren't familiar with a song, there is little hope of scoring well until you become familiar. (I was able to sing songs I'd never heard before with K.R. and score in the platinum range)

The easy level seemed to be a bit more picky than K.R.'s easy level.

Occasionally the game throws you for a loop by forcing you to sing the harmony in addition to lead.

There is no tutorial or training mode to help you learn how to play and what all of the markings on the screen mean (you can read the manual but even that doesn't appear to explain much).

There is no microphone setup to adjust the input volume (although you can play with the volume that is output).

The ability to effectively mute the original singer appears to be missing.

PROS: The actual artist sings each song as opposed to re-recorded (albeit easier) versions of your favorite tunes.

If a video of the song is available, it is included behind. If one isn't, they've made video collages about the band and song to keep your interest.

You can playback your performance and even add sound effects to it like robot and reverb (there are four different ones I believe). These performances can even be saved to the memory card.

The microphones work on my Apple Macbook.",2.0
Doesn't come with a memory card and the remote control was broken,2.0

Bad language,2.0
"I purchased this game bundle because I enjoyed playing my friend's ""Karaoke Revolution"" game, and I thought this would be equally enjoyable.  First off, the microphones only work with the Singstar games, which is a bit of a rip-off.  Second, the game isn't much fun.  In challenge mode, you have to sing along with the person you're up against, which isn't as good as singing solo.  There are no extras to unlock, either.  The playback feature, where you can listen to your version of the recording you just sang, is nice, but overall the game is quite limited in its appeal.  It held the attention of my group for less than an hour before growing stale.  Purchase one of the ""Karaoke Revolution"" games instead.",2.0
"I used to like syphon filter, so I got this game jus to trythe newerversion of it.. aand itwasn't myfeel anymore! a good game for syphon fans, (ifya STILL like it..) but.. not for me!",2.0
"a total waste of money, graphics are not good, and the over all game was boring.",2.0
"This would be a great game, had Konami already not released five (six when the American Idol one comes out) better Karaoke games for the PS2. You would think that when releasing this game in 2006, Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better. They did not. I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series, but it's a natural comparison, and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks, as SR is by far an inferior product.

I have a lot of the same complaints as others. There are no unlockables. Even though KR's strange costumes are seldom used in our household, it's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better. Singstar Rocks does not do this.

The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports, why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter. This renders the mics useless to the KR games. If they're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics, maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead. It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary (of sorts).

Another complaint is the lack of adjustments. In song, KR (dating back to the original) allows you to adjust the vocals, mic and music. Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that doesn't see to do much.

It's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists, as they are missing out on a ton of others. The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc. There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense. Of all the Rolling Stones catalog, why would Forty Licks' ""Paint it Black"" be the one to appear. Lame!

In a vacuum, the game is fun, but its song selection, lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution. Don't waste your time with this one. Get *any* of the KR series over this one.",2.0
"Oh, yes. I forgot. Sony wanted to keep the cost of the system down. Yeah, right! A poor excuse for having to make countless gamers shell out an additional .... dollars for a multi-tap. Sony could've better spent their money putting an additional two controller ports into the system, instead of giving it a moterized tray. Sony could've also made it so that the original PsOne multi-tap, that many people already owned prior to owning a Ps2, was compatable, but they didn't because their new Ps2 memory cards are too big for the slots.  They could've just made the card smaller.  The one for the Game Cube is even smaller than the PsOne memory card! I think Sony just went with whatever decision would put the most money in their pockets.
I once owned a short-lived game consule that was made by Panasonic called: 3DO. It was the first 32 bit system, which was later beaten into the ground by its high price tag, lack of third party support, and the combined strength of the Sony Playstation and the Sega Saturn. However, there were some qualities about the Panasonic 3DO that I liked, that I'd never seen before on any other game console. The 3DO was a system capable of allowing as many as 10 players to participate in a game at once, with only 1 controller port, and no multi-tap. How? The answer was in the controler. At the top of each controller was a controller port, that a second player could attach his/her controller to, and so on, and so on. It was like building a chain, and the gamplay never slowed down either. I also liked how each controller featured an earphone jack and volume control. Its too bad Sony didn't take a few lessons from Panasonic's 3DO, or the Sega Dreamcast, or Microsoft's X-Box, or Nintendo's Game Cube and 64 system.",2.0
When I bought it the description did not mention that it did not come with a controller and it has stickers all over it witch takes away from the value. I'm also not sure if it really works do to the fact that it turns on but has not loaded up yet. I'm being generous with two stars but I'm really not sure.,2.0
Received the ps2 console only had no idea it did not come with cords or a controller. Nice condition but I'd rather spent the money at game stop for the same price and received more. Very disappointed,2.0
Description said it came with a controller.  It did not. Who do i contact to get this item?,2.0
"This game I bought used, but I'm ready to rid myself of it. The graphics are OK, but the amount of play it takes you to master this game is pathetic.  I beat the game after only 10 minutes of plays and Game Overs.  Even the HARD MODE wasn't, ummm, hard. The part that really got on my nerves was that you can't save your game on say, level 6, turn off the system, start it back up, and have it load your save.  Even if it only saved when I got the extra options, I'd be satisfied, but it couldn't even do that.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!!!!",2.0
"Before playing this game you should play the preceding title of the series ""The Mark of Kri"" which is a truly fantastic game. It introduces a beautiful atmospheric world, unique controls, great action, and an interesting story. One of the best title's I've played for the PS2.

That said, I have a bone or two to pick with the sequel here. I really wanted to give this game a shining review but I have to be honest with you. For the record I found this game to be quite beautiful like MoK and the controls were very much alike. I became accustomed to fighting alongside a computer controlled ally and learned to like it. I played as the new characters and came to like them too.

The painful things about this game are the bugs/glitches! I've played a lot of PS2 titles, I can safely say that even among the worst titles I've played, none of them had this many bugs. What happened Sony? Did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves? Here's a list of bugs I have experienced commonly in this game:

1. In stealth mode, half the time, enemies somehow magically see you when you're completely concealed around a corner.
2. Floors disappear and stay gone during play, and make you appear as if you are walking on air. Sounds cool but it isn't. It's sloppy.
3. Sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too, door jam closed instead of opening for you.
4. Your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently.
5. When attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies, the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts. (this one really irks me)
6. You computer controlled partner freezes in place
7. The entire game freezes.

It's heartbreaking really. I love the series and the story but I can't help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game. I expect more from Sony, especially since MoK was such a wonderful game. Try it at the very least.",2.0
"This is a very unique game, as you compete as a unicycle! Does that sound bad or what? You compete in four circuits, each having five different races. The races are head to head races, time races, and trick competitions. Yes tricks, to go faster in this game, you must do a trick, like a backflip, front flip, rotating flip, or several combinations of tricks to earn points and to go faster. The game is very fast paced and it will raise your reflexes just playing it, or it will make you really dizzy because of the backgrounds to the race levels. This game is also played from a side view like a Mario game.",2.0
"This is a racing game, which features the first set of 3D racing track. However it only offers eight racing tracks, so the game goes by quickly. Another downer is that there are only three cars to select from (a dragster, a stock car and a monster truck). As much as this is the first and only 3D racing game for the SNES, there are no textures on the vehicles and walls. So it looks like your driving a box. The racetracks themselves are not difficult at all and anyone can breeze through them. Skip this game and go for a real racing game like F-Zero or Super Mario Kart!",2.0
Case and manual were in great condition but the game was damaged and in affect the game glitches majorly throughout the entire game.,2.0

"Honestly I enjoy the ridge racer series. Ridge racer 5 did not turn out as good as I hoped. The driving mechanics are bad, I felt it was difficult to race with the vehicles. Drifting is difficult to control at times and the steering can be fustrating. The soundtrack was a bit annoying to me but honestly the backround voice doesnt bother me. Ridge racer 6 and 7 have better driving mechanics in my opinion so I can say it was more fun. Overall, I did not like this game.",2.0
"When i first got this it was hard. Then i played it more and more, I used the slowest car and i beet the game in about 3-4 hours. The game is to short, when you beet it all you have are the time attacks and the races were you try to beet a fake computer guys(time attack).
And how the hell do you get medls!",2.0
"I've got to admit, I love going 311 mph on the airport oval. I also like the morning, evening, and night racing, but that girl has nothing to do with anything. The graphics are remarkable. When you are going as fast as ever and you let off the gas to make a corner, it decreases your speed by atleast 20-30 mph. I don't like the fact that you cant adjust your car and it doesnt give you money, just the next race to complete. It doesnt have enough cars to choose from, but atleast you can win faster cars, engines, and body styles. The track selection is not very impresive it seems as if they just kept the same track and modified it with inly 2 or 3 different tracks to choose from. It certainly wastnt worth the $50.00. The speeds are impossible to reach in real life( I went 311 mph) although that is kinda fun. When you are going that fast it has a major problem of understeer.",2.0
This game was just a reminder to me why I switched from Ridge Racer to Gran Turismo.  The graphics are decent especially in the replay but thats it.  The controls are horrible and if the announcer would show himself on the track I would gladly run over him.  The game itself has 14 courses (that includes the reverse)and 18 different cars.  But there are only 2 different views to choose from.  When I bought this I was excited and thought it was the racing game that was going to hold me over till Gran Turismo 3 comes out but I was wrong.,2.0
"RR V came with my PS2 bundle so I can't say I wasted money on it. I was just happy to finally get a PS2. Anyway, the graphics are amazing as you would come to expect on the PS2 platform. The music is fantastic. There are some awesome techno tracks. The car selection is cool. You can even choose a little modified Honda Civic Hatchback. I have played this game for about two months, off and on as I get bored with my sports games (madden, fifa, etc...) and it is decent. I am not a big car racing person so I guess my review is a little more negative than most but this one just has more negatives than positives. I hate the following: 1) The announcer is lame. The whole deal is some radio DJ announcing the race coverage in a ""So Cal"" voice. I thought I had one of the members of Blink 182 in my TV...Dude! 2) The steering sucks. I like to have a car that hugs the curves not one that slides around like a pig in mud on a rainy day in July. 3) The car never gets damaged. I hit a wall going 110 and the car just slides off...wish my real car did that. 4) The game is hard, but hey I already told you I am not into car games. I will take you on in Madden any day of the week! My advise: Rent before you buy!",2.0

"I just picked up my PS2 last night and I was so impressed with Madden 2001 and NHL 2001 but when I played RR5, I felt like I was being cheated.  I am also a PS1 owner and RR came with the console when I bought it.  This is the same game with a new paint job.  Yes, the graphics are better and there are more cars and tracks to choose from but this is the same lame game.  They really didn't take advantage of the PS2's capabilities. Don't waste your money on it.  If you don't believe me, do yourself a favor and rent it.",2.0
I am very dissapointed with this game. I thought that maybe playing it a lot would make me like the game but no. It has poor graphics. All the cars are the same what changes is only the motor so you can't identify the cars. This game is a bit boring. But I'm thinking to change for DOA2: Hardcore. Before I got Ridge Racer 5 I had Midnight Club but that is the worse game ever made by human.,2.0
"I got this with my PS2 Action Gamers Pack, otherwise I would likely never have bought a racing game.  The last racing game I actually purchased was Test Drive I for the Commodore 64, so suffice it to say that I'm not an expert at this genre.
This game is sort of fun, but _hard_!  Frustratingly so.  On the first Grand Prix, I've managed to pass the first three of four races, but I'm so far from passing the fourth that it's not going to happen soon.  I'll probably have to play the game for 10-20 hours before I have the skills and reflexes down to be able to do this.
And, until you pass the first Grand Prix, the game [is not good].  You _have_ to keep racing the same cycle of four tracks.  If you fail 3 times on a track, you have to start the cycle over.  You don't get your own car until you win the first Grand Prix, so you can't tune your car, race in time trials, or even do the freestyle races with no cars on the track.  There's nothing I can do but keep trying this same, really hard for me, progression of tracks.
I'm sure this game is fun for fans of the racing genre, or people with really good video game reflexes.  But don't give this to someone who is a more casual gamer - I'm going to have to invite over one of my insane friends to unlock the game enough for me to play around with it, and I'll still probably never be competitive.",2.0
"In brief, a bummer game to have purchased as one of 3 to go with my new console.  As others have said, yes, it is pretty, but the gameplay blows.  I'm a gamer from the word go, but I couldn't win on the first track in at least 10 tries, the physics are so bad.  And if you can't win the first track, you never get to see the rest of the tracks or modes.  Control is sketchy, due in no small part to how poorly the developer makes use of the PS2 controller (x button = go, left & right arrows = steering - that's about it - gas is ON or OFF, you're very much just TUUUURNING or your NOT, no finnesse, period - I'd rather play Midtown Madness 2 with my keyboard). The announcer really needs a smack in the mouth, he's so annoying (in his defense, the vapid dialog is what kills the entire voiceover effect).  I love driving games, and expected this one to be THE ONE, as it was a top seller on Amazon and listed as a ""must have"" on ebworld.  It was very much NOT the one.",2.0
"In short, this game is poo. The graphics are awesome, but then that is nothing unexpected.  It looks like you are driving a real car and watching the replay on the TV.  It's that good.
But then you are not watching a replay, you are playing the game. The idea is that you are supposed to drive these cars and win races.  The controls are horrible: there is no realism to the gameplay.  You simply cannot round hairpin turns at 120mph!  Oh, wait, sure you can.  I just now did it in Ridge Racer V!  I suppose I was spoiled by the realism of Gran Turismo on my Playstation I.  I simply grew bored with this game within 0.5 hours of tearing the plastic from the jewel case.
The announcing grates on my very soul.  When you are in 7th place in a race of 20 cars, a good 2 miles back from the leader going into the final lap, the announcer simply should not state you still have a chance!!  Whatever, that is a small complaint. I just found myself cursing the woman who popped out the child which developed the lispy voice of this games announcer.
If you are looking for a great racing game, get a different one.  GT has better graphics, more realistic game play and does not have a hell-spawn announcer.  Namco had better titles out when I was 12!",2.0
"I heard that the graphics were as good as Gran Turismo so I was excited to play this game. Needless to say, my sources were wrong. GT2 on the PS1 has better graphics, just a little slower frame rate.  But the real disappointment in this game is the lack of feel in the cars.  The physics are that of the original Pole Position on Atari. I am a real driving enthusiast and this game is not up to my standards, or the standards of PS2. And I also concur that the music and announcer get old fast.",2.0
"The RR series has always been sort of self-explanatory.  Realistic looking cars in a realistic environment, but playing like an arcade racer.  No great amount of depth (like the Gran Turismo series) but not quite as cartoony as Beetle Adventure Racing or Top Gear Overdrive.
This is just more of the same.  Is it the best looking RR ever?  Yeah, and it should be, given that its the only PS2 version of the bunch.  And, truth be told, it should look better.  It does score above-average marks in the style department, but the highly Japanese flavor to it might turn off some gamers.  Basically it is what it is: another Ridge Racer game.  Type 4 was good for PSX, and a lot of people expected more from this one, but didn't get ""the next level"" of RR games, just another in a series.
If you want a decent racing game, wait for Gran Turismo 3, or if you've been a RR devotee, then by all means go for this one.  For most gamers it's a ""been there, done that"" kinda thing.",2.0
"Haven't played Twisted Metal since I was a young child. I decided to pick this up for my newly bought PS2. The game is simply pretty boring. Not too much going on, not a lot of pick ups spread throughout the map. It's also very hard to kill other players. In the matches I played, I was easily the first vehicle killed.",2.0
"I was a huge fan of the original Twisted Metal games, but this one is just ridiculous. A fundamental flaw in the game is the car acceleration rates. One second you have a car in your sights, and the next that car has apparently jumped into warp speed and has disappeared from the screen. The game is impossible to play with this flaw.",2.0
"Any time a strategy game comes out with as many complexities as Settlers IV, you have to applaud the imagination and thought that inspired the creation of such a game. However, when you can't play this game because of incessant crashing, needs for multiple patches, and a latent fear to play because you're not sure if the save function is working today, you put that game back on the shelf, and wait for the game producers to come out with a working game. Did I mention one of their patches needed a patch?  That's a first for me, a patch to get the patch to work, think about that for a moment, and contemplate the frustration you'll feel, and the time you'll waste.  Save your money.",2.0
"I would warn anyone to not purchase this game due to the increasing problems I've had with it. I found the game to be a bit plodding over time with no real end goal in sight.
As I continued to play the game it began to glitch more frequently and for longer periods of time to the point where the game would not load but would spool without end. I would have to reboot my computer to disengage the game. I tried the downloads from the net, and that didn't help either. I have sufficient memory etc. on my computer and don't believe I have a hardware problem, Windows 98, 128 ram, 600+ pent processor, 100 mhz clock, etc. I believe this is a poorly designed game. I hesitated buying the game based on prior Star Trek game revues which said the same thing that I am writting now.
If this is the extint of Interplays software capabilities I won't be buying any of their products in the future, as it would be a waste of money.
Oh yea, I am a bit of a Trekkie, enjoy the shows etc.
I very much enjoy the Star Wars simms and have purchased all of them. Needless to say they have all performed flawlessly, hoping that the Star Trek game might do the same I gave it a try.
Be careful what you buy and good gaming.",2.0
"Once you actually get to fight other ships, the game is a blast. Complicated, but learnable. You will spend time mastering stratagy and controls. Unfortunatly, the game crashes A LOT. As you progress through the campaighns, the time between battles stretches to 10 minutes, as the computer does ""something"" (800 mhz athalon is doing something, as the hard drive and CD aren't doing anything, and the graphics it is changing are minor). It will crash to the desktop with unacceptable frequency. You will reinstall it at least once. And, if you are like me, you will put up with this because the actual battles are visually awesome and really fun. Stratagy is challenging and not covered by any documentation real well (trial and error).

"Bought this game hearing that it was in the style of the old Fallout titles, a kind of spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations. Outside of the numerous bugs, there are issues with movement which make the game tedious, quest problems that make the main story difficult to navigate, and the game is so unbalanced that the purported ""Use magic or technology"" system may as well be ""use magic or die."" Would not buy again.",2.0
"This game seems to me as if it'd be a good game, however, it's buggy in the extreme in multiplayer.
The solo play adventure is pretty good about stability, but the multiplayer is NOT up to Sierra's usual standards of excelence.
First off, the main multiplayer chat interface itself is buggy, often returning games that have nothing but 0's for stats, like ping, players, up time, et cetera.
The chat menu's lobby list tends to pop up over other nessessary things at times.
It crashed a few times while trying to make a new character.
And consistantly crashes whenever I try to log onto a multiplayer game, sometimes after just giving me a split-second game view, sometimes not even letting me get that far.",2.0
"I should probably preface this review by saying that I felt that Fallout fell far short of its spiritual predecessor, Wasteland (one of my favorite games of all time).  Although very similar both philosophically and mechanically, I found Fallout's story arc so much less compelling that I never actually finished the game, and never bought the sequel.
Arcanum suffers from many of the same storytelling flaws as Fallout did.  Although its world purports to be driven by a mixture of magic and early-industrial era technology, the former dominates the storyline completely.  And although there are side plots galore, some of which are actually more interesting than the main, all the quests in the game follow the same formula set out in the original D&D RPGs of the early 90s: slay this monster, retrieve this item, come back to me for a reward (in this case, experience is generally the incentive).  The roleplaying aspects of NPC interaction are similarly formulaic, as each conversation is scripted by canned lines and differentiates at most two possible PC personalities (which I've unflatteringly come to think of as ""mouthy jerk"" and ""flowery suckup"").
Now, many games have managed to succeed in spite of weak or absent storytelling (notably Diablo and, to a lesser extent, Diablo II).  One can, for example, view the RP part of RPG as a framework for combat, which can be a compelling enough aspect
to carry a game.  Unfortunately, Arcanum provides hardly any variety in its combat opponents.  There were only one or two instances I can remember in the game where opponents used any kind of ranged weapon...
I consider this last to be the single most telling flaw in Arcanum.  The combat and monster AI in Diablo have spoiled me as a game player, perhaps, but it seems a huge waste of Arcanum's complex skills matrix and character advancement system to hack away at spiders and wolves for hours on end.  Is this really the best they could do?
I thought about playing the game through again.  I really did.  But even though Arcanum offers very promising flexibility in character design mechanics, the prospect of testing that character out on either the tedious combat or the one-dimensional NPC community leaves me yawning.",2.0
"I hate writing negative reviews.  I like writing positive reviews about things that have entertained or educated me, but sometimes something gets me frustrated enough that I feel obligated to inform others.
While I normally start with complaints, I feel it necessary to start with the good things about Arcanum.  Arcanum has the potential to be one of the coolest games ever made.  It has an original story, an immersive world with colorful characters, and a variety of playing styles to suit anyones prefernces.
Unfortunately, all of these positive things are shrouded in one of the buggiest pieces of code that has ever come across my PC.  Characters and Items either fail to appear, or disapppear for no apparent reason making the main plot impossible to further.  It's one thing to get stuck in a little subplot, but it's another thing to get stuck in the middle of the story simply because of technical errors.
I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong at times, only to visit the game forum at the official site and find message after message complaining about ""bug this"" and ""fix that"".  The current patch has done nothing to help me.  I think my bugs maybe a little worse than others, but almost everyone has experienced at least minor bugs and glitches.
If this were some impulse buy I would have just given up and moved on to something else, but Arcanum, when working properly, is a really great game.  That's what makes it SO frustrating, the fact that hidden under all that bad programming a great concept is dying to come out.  I expect more from the guys that created the Fallout series which are some of the most entertaining games ever made.  The guys over at Troika should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game as a finished product.
Hopefully you won't experience as many showstopping bugs as I did, but be warned, they are out there.  If you don't believe me, just visit the official site boards and look for yourself.  Hopefully, Troika will make this game playable, and if they do I will gladly come back here and edit my review.",2.0
"It may not happen to others, but I get a total screen freeze
about every 10 minutes. I have a high-end game machine.  I have the patch in, it doesn't help.
My other games don't have this problem. Sierra's tech support (the maker of Arcanum) are not helpful. If you like a pretty good RPG - it could have been a great one - buy it. Otherwise, keep your money.",2.0
"Gretzky NHL, made by 989 sports, the worst of all sports games makers, is a sad excuse 4 an NHL game. If you are used to the EA or ESPN games then you'll just love the button set-up(sarcasm). Most of the buttons r the same but instead of square being to shoot, you're stuck with square being to check and deke. Circle is now the button for shooting and there is no option because you're not allowed to change the controller setup. Sure, that's not really a big deal, but it gets better. Player movement is extremely unreliable since you push the analog one direction and your player goes another. The reaction time when u press to shoot is very slow and often results in unwanted slapshots giving their goalie plenty of time to get prepared. The opposing team, no matter what skill level you have it on, has complete advantage, always. They are faster, they have faster passes, more accurate passes, instant shots, no fatigue etc. Meanwhile your players... are completely stupid, your defense basically does not exist. Computer controlled teammates won't help you at all and your goalie rarely stops anything. All in all this is a poor game and should be overlooked if you're buying a PSP.",2.0
"This game takes away from the reality-like feeling you get in the first 2 rush games. In those games you can look in Vegas and see the Stratosphere Tower, or drive through San Francisco and see the golden gate bridge. This game is too futuristic for my liking because the cars are futuristic and so are the scenarios. Stick to the first 2 games unless you like the futuristic feel. The one good thing about this game is the battle mode where you can battle your friends. That is where it earned it's 2nd star.",2.0
"This well-reviewed game hasn't withstood the years as well as some other games of the same era (Homeworld comes to mind.)  I'm a great fan of strategy games, but I just couldn't get into this game.

The minimap is small and difficult to use, but it becomes a major focus of your game, as the main screen - your third person over-the-shoulder view - really only helps you in the immediate tactical fight you're in.  I found it hard to visually distinguish between some types of units, and having to click on them to identify them was quite annoying.

If you're a fan of Battlezone style gameplay, then by all means, give this game a shot.  But there is a reason the experimental hybrid strategy-action genre died away in 2001 or so; it just isn't as fun as a pure RTS or pure action game.  Instead you've got more successful hybrids flourishing - like grand strategy / RTS hybrids (Star Wars:  Empire at War, Sins of a Solar Empire), RPG / Action (Oblivion, Bioshock), or Racing / Action / RPG (Grand Theft Auto.)",2.0
"At first this game is jawdropping. Beautiful graphics, a fast engine, original ideas and a unique premise. After playing through a few games, however, one quickly comes to realize that every session is essentially the same. There is little variation from mission to mission in the actual gameplay and it rapidly becomes a very repetitive experience.",2.0
"This title has a ton of potential, but the fact that it's loaded with bugs and took me over a week just to figure out how to get the dang thing to run (hit ESC while the story is being told) without it locking up.  I like the interface and the graphics are great, but it's about time software companies start putting out a quality product.  If you like downloading patches and reading tech support bulliten boards, buy this game.  Otherwise, wait for the next Blizzard title.",2.0
"I spent some time with this game and had some very definite reactions to it.
First the good:
The graphics are fantastic.  It's not often that you find a game nowadays that follows the first- or third-person perspective that's not set in a dark, dank dungeon or citadel someplace that you don't have to see further than the next stone-lined chamber.  Sacrifice is not one of those.  You get to run around outside and see the rolling green hills, bright sun and blue sky.  The game engine is extremely well done with smooth scrolling, fast framrates and snappy performance.  The graphics design is also just as good, with interesting characters and maps.  Special effects are pretty impressive and the engine is capable of doing massive real-time geomtry deformations quite well.  Which means in English: when you hurl a powerful spell and leave a crater, the crater is really a hole in the ground instead of a texture map of a crater!  You get to interact with more than just the other creatures and characters in the world - you actually get to interact with the world itself.
But now the bad:
Notice I didn't mention anything about gameplay in the ""good"" section.  With everything this game *could* have been, it wasn't very much at all.  It's a lot of glitter with little substance.
I'm not sure what type of game genre I'd classify Sacrifice; somewhere in between real-time strategy and action/adventure.  However neither aspect of game play is strong enough to pull the game through as anything more than mediocre.  The storyline is long and drawn-out and tends to interrupt actual gameplay entirely too frequently, but is too linear to be taken as anything terribly interesting in terms of role-playing.  On the other hand, the action is interesting, but tends to be in terms of long periods of running around between checkpoints seperated by brief, intense periods of purely finger-twitch fighting and spellcasting in which I found myself dying an awful lot of times only to have to start the mission over again.
For as difficult as I found it to win, the combat scheme is extremely simplistic.  You have basically three creature types, each of which is capable of one type of attack: hand-to-hand, ranged ground-to-air, and ranged air-to-ground.  That means to defeat ""hand-to-hand"" creature types, deploy your ""air-to-ground"" creature types, and so on.  It's kind of like rock-paper-scissors with better graphics, and not too much fun.  (Well, ok, rock-paper-scissors where each side of the game can also throw spells, which is why it's any fun at all.  And the other side always seemed to have more powerful spells than I did...)
As the main character of the game, you are given the choice of being a representative of one of five gods, each with powers over a different element of the realm, however the spells you learn and creatures/henchmen you gain by choosing one or another god really aren't very differentiated - essentially being the same powers with different special effects attached, and same creatures with different texture maps.
There are interesting aspects of the game, but after spending about four hours playing it in the first sitting, I haven't picked it up again since.
If you want an interesting first- or third-person action/adventure in the same genre, Giants: Citizen Kabuto is much more enjoyable, and if you just want to be a God, then Black & White is worlds and universes more engrossing and fun.",2.0

It is the most thorough game yet with more spelles and classes than ever before it is lacking somthing however. It feels like an action game. The plot is boring and uncomplex, it failed to hold me for even an hour compared to icewind dale witch I was able to play all day. Also the way it is set up, it just does not feel like an RPG it feels like a shooter. All the plot points involve killing somthing. All in all this was a disapointing game for a hard core RPG fan.",2.0

NWN is a little more than Dungeon Siege, but that's not saying much. At least games like Diablo knew what they where and perfected it. NWN lacks direction.
I really enjoyed Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. This game is not nearly as enjoyable.",2.0
"Attention Read Before Buying!!
If you are searching for a replacement to your old button smashing RPG(Diablo 2),then this isn't the game for you.
The game's controls and graphics are weak..I was running a P4@ 2.8Ghz with ATI Radeon 9700 and the graphics were still choppy.
To even attack an enemy,it wasn't the same traditional point in the general direction of the enemy to send your charater swinging. You had to have your mouse precisely on the target to attack. And,since the game runs on D&D(Dungeons and Dragons) rules,your character doesn't just walk over and start blasting fireballs or chopping the badguy to pieces,the game has to calculate your character's stats,meaning that your character slowly swings,then win he misses(he usually does)he casually steps back. That gets very boring after a while. It take minutes just to kill one enemy.
The graphics are pathetic. I realize that NWN runs on a more 3D basis than older RPG,but the characters look choppy and blocky.
The game does have it pro's though. The toolset it just awsome,allowing you to create and control your own world. And the multiplayer expierence is awsome,but the games weak controls only become more evident.
The toolset and multiplayer is the only thing going for this game. Don't buy,hoping it's an incredible button smashing RPG to get addicted to,,,because it  just isn't.",2.0
"I didn't try the multiplayer, but the single player is really really boring. Its very slow.. and dull. Its more like a BOOK, than a game. There is alot of reading to do. I played for about an hour, and I have no urge whatsoever to play it again. The graphics are very poor. It is alot like IceWind Dale, which I thought was equally boring. If you like action and most importantly: FUN, I would definately suggest Blizzard titles like Warcraft3 and Diablo2 instead.",2.0
"i am a dnd player, so i have been awaiting this game for quite some time to see if it lives up to its promises. i bought the game the day it came out, bout a new video card, and was nearly shaking with joy that it was finally here! i went home instlled my new video card, plopped in the game, and plopped in neverwinter.i started the character creation and it was skippin like crazy.i thought, hmmm maybe it is just that part. so i went into the game, and magicaly my character would start teleporting across the screen. so it has been a few months, patches and so forth, and no fixes. i updated all my drivers, and still dosnt work. so i became sick of the game and turned it in for a great game, Morrowind. this game has depth, u can do anything, i have played over 100 hrs and still havnt touched the main story line. def. get this game instead of neverwinter. oh yea and i know that this game is mainly for the editor, we'll at at least morrowinds open'd for me! unlike neverwinters, which gaveme some error message. def go get morrowind.",2.0
"So here's the scoop.  Black Isle Studios is the king of computer D&D games, hands down.  It's games all find the niches that make playing D&D fun.
Baldur's Gate 1 & 2: Fantastic single-player; you role-play, cast spells, fall in love, kick dragon [bottom], great story.
Icewind Dale:  Devoted to combat, and the combat is challenging and imaginative
Planescape: Torment:  Unique setting, novel quality story, exotic locales and NPCs, just a fantastic RPG.
Then there's Neverwinter.  Its single player falls short, though they do implement the 3rd Edition fairly well.  Unfortunately, since this is a digital game, some of the intangible feats had to be dropped.  NWN is supposed to be about the multiplayer and the ability to write your own modules.  Again, it is unfortunate you are so limited to the selection of the tilesets, creatures, etc, and the execution is a bit suspect.
The multiplayer modules are limited to the skill of those who create it.  Hopefully there will be those who can use the Aurora toolset to its fullest.  But right now, it leaves much to be desired.  I would suggest WarCraft 3 or Morrowind as an alternative.",2.0

It's an interesting concept...I can't think of any other game quite like it. The  box is very appealing and even coxed me into buying the product, even  though I was well aware of Wizard Work's shaky reputation. The graphics on  the back of the box are not the same as on the game. The scenery is very  pixelated and dull. In general, the grpahics are very early 90's in style.  The gun turrent you operate can be manipulated via keyboard, mouse or  joystick. The mouse control is terrible, and there is no real way to  control it. One move too quick and the whole turrent spins around. I spent  more time trying to line the gun up right than I did shooting. The keyboard  commands seem to stiff and non-responsive. The gameplay is very monotonous,  with a constant wave of troops lands on the beach. Higher levels include  helicopters and jets, but they are equally unimpressive and monotonous. The  game does have a save feature, which is handy. I will give them credit for  that. I gave the game two stars because it is an interesting concept, but  poorly implemented. I bought the game hoping it would be a quick fix for  the times I want to just blow up everything. But you'll spend more time  trying to master the controls than enjoying the gameplay. With a little  more work, this could have been a great game. But like the game itself,  that is the most frustrating part.",2.0

"Koudelka was a game that I really wanted to love. I picked it up during my old game store raids as a kid, during the golden era of RPGs (1994-2001).

Koudelka sat shining on a shelf at my locally-owned video game store. As a unique blend of role playing elements set to a gothic timeline, I was immediately hooked. When I got home and popped the disc in, I was so ready to dive into this unique world.

Unfortunately, I never truly had the chance. The graphics were only decent for the time, with even lesser-known titles showing much more polish. The music was very disappointing, especially given Hiroki Kikuta's wonderful tunes in the Mana series. What really ruined the experience for me was the battle system. It was jagged, slow, and quite bland - the polar opposite of Sacnoth Games' intentions.

As a person who bought and beat almost all of the role-playing games of the PSX era, this one stands out as a true let-down. Out of my 21 RPGs for the original Playstation, this is the only one I did not beat. It stands among my otherwise proud collection, a sad sign of good intentions scarred by poor execution.",2.0

All and all this game was a disappointment to Atari.",2.0
"Do you enjoy Rainbow Six for the action?  You will not find it in Covert Ops Essentials. I am a huge fan of the Rainbow Six series and have always enjoyed the series until this one.  Is this game the action-packed follow up to Rogue Spear with its exciting missions like the airplane hijacking?  Not quite.  Two major negative issues I have:
1.  The game description states 9 missions.  No, there are 3 actual missions, and 6 short training events, which do not count as missions.  I was shocked after completing the 3rd mission to be presented with the game-over credits, thinking there were 6 more action packed missions waiting.  Granted, the 3 actual missions are well done, and give this game two stars instead of one.  But is the game worth buying for 3 missions?
2.  The box gives the impression this is a special training edition, meaning much more training missions to fine tune your tango raiding skills (similar to Metal Gear Solid: VR missions).  This is only a problem because it is not stated clearly that this is a game requiring mostly readings.  The interface is very poor on the training disc, and as a reviewer states in videogames.com ""looks like the work of an 80's holywood special effects artist trying to visualize computer interfaces of the future"".
And here is one positive note:
1. If you're not expecting action and hostage rescues, the training disc provides good reading on your computer monitor.  It explains the terms terrorist and counter terrorism at a good level.  Even though the multiple guess questions do not change they are fun to take.  Just don't think the medals you win for passing the test will qualify you as a hostage negotiator :)
To conclude, the training disc's readings and video clips could have been put an a web site and have you take the tests online, minus the futuristic 80's special effects.  A good book on terrorism and counter terrorism, or even Richard Marcinko's Rogue Warrior series would serve the same purpose of this game.  If you're looking for some missions, wait until the next true expansion pack or when Red Storm Entertainment releases the level editor in the following months.",2.0

This games high point is the 9 man royal rumble where 9  people are in the ring at once instead of the usual 4.  But only being 20  playable characters (the game is missing a lot, 2 cool, Dudleys, Cactus  Jack, Blackman, Crash etc.) you will definitly see Rikishy in there about 5  times, it gets repetitive INCREDIBLY fast. Maybe fun with 4 people. So then  I tried the ONLY other mode, Exhibition, yes there are no create a player  options, there are no match rules and no arena changes. Exhibition may be  entertaining til you fight the incredibly hard not very exciting last  wrestler (Vince or Shane...big whoop...). So you go through hell to beat  them and ooo you get the credits...... In way of graphics, the lighting is  sweet but the wresters look like smooth textured Smackdown wrestlers.

"What was once a great adventure series was essentially turned into a bad Diablo clone when Cendant took over Sierra Online. In King's Quest 8, you play a Daventry peasant (which, unlike in King's Quest 3, has no relation to the royal family) who curiously speaks like British royalty. As the game begins, the Mask of Eternity is shattered, resulting (among other things) in a bunch of monsters appearing and everyone in the human world turning to stone. Everyone except you, that is; you managed to grab a piece of the Mask as it was happening (alternately, a piece of it scarred your face when you were born - they can't get the story straight). The rest of the game comprises of you fighting monsters and occasionally using various objects to try to get all the pieces of the Mask to restore the worlds.
The graphics are mediocre, even when you take into account the time the game was made. The gameplay is horrendous. Between this, the badly thought-out plot, and its overall betrayal of the series, I wouldn't recommend getting KQ8 except in the interest of completeness (and of seeing the end of the series).",2.0
"I grew up on King's Quest. My parents were playing King's Quest I when I was in the womb, and every time a new King's Quest came out they would play it. When I was very little, it was exciting to watch them play the games. As I got older, I would be very eager to help them solve some of the puzzles. By the time King's Quest VII came out, I could practically play on my own and it was such an amazing experience to explore the lands, meet characters, and solve problems with all of the items in your inventory. I learned a lot about mythology and fairy tale lore. I had very high expectations for King's Quest VIII. It was to be the first of the series I could play entirely on my own, without my parents' help. I anxiously awaited its release. Only to discover it had turned into a hack-and-slash game. I couldn't bring myself to play past the first level.",2.0
"I bought this game when it first came out, excited that there was another game to the King's Quest series.  I've played all the games except 2 and 3, and love the story of King Graham and his family.

So this game introduced a new character.  That's fine.  But other than a brief appearance by King Graham in the intro and a flash of him in the finale, and the fact that the first ""chapter"" of the game takes place in Daventry, this bears no resemblance to the series I loved.

Ambiance - a large percentage of this game takes place in a dark, hard on the eyes environment.

Animation - People say this is good animation, but compared to the easily flowing cartoon quality of KQ7 and the animation used in Quest for Glory 5, this is pathetic.  Most of the time your character is half walking in a wall. Yes, I downloaded the patch.  But still when you walked alongside a wall or mountain, your foot or shoulder would go through it.

Controls - clunky and hard to manage. You have to use your arrow keys.  Manipulating the character's movements is difficult.  Then to fight, you have to use the mouse.  Also the character doesn't seem to have any automatic avoidance of obstacles, particularly corners and protruding walls.  To pick up an item, you have to put your weapon away.  Then you have to take it out. To get things out of urns and barrels, you have to smash it with a weapon, put the weapon away, take the item, and then take the weapon back out.  Also, gone are the shortcut keys to save as well as autosaving.

Interaction - what interaction?  Half the fun of the earlier KQ games (especially 6 and 7) was interacting with other characters to find out hints and clues.  Here you mostly wander around mazes to find the right rooms to find the right items.  Even the monsters are limited.  Kill them from one area, and you don't get any new ones next time you pass that way.  In the first 2 levels there is minimal interaction - 3rd level you start to get some more.

Humor - except for some comments by some characters near the end, none.  This is basically a dark story.

Plot - minimal.  The basic concept - Daventry (and the world) is plunged into dark times by the destruction of the mask of eternity.  Connor has to battle through several levels to find the pieces of the mask and return them to their proper place. That's it.  The first 7 games could be turned into novels with rich stories.  Until levels 5/6, you're really not interacting, not doing anything but fighting and finding what you need.

Music - it's OK.  That's it.  Nothing spectacular.  Nothing memorable.

Sound Effects - annoying.  Every time Connor pulled out the war hammer, there was a loud ""oof"".  The same noise came every time he ran into a corner, a wall, or protruding item.

Overall - if you like the kind of game where you run through a maze, shoot baddies, and find objects, this is your game.  If you're looking for a sequel to the rich history of the King's Quest series, skip this.

Personally, as I played this I kept comparing the game to Quest for Glory 5 and found that KQ8 paled in comparison.  They tried to copy many of the game elements and failed miserably.",2.0
"The final game of the King's Quest series is definitely the worst installment. I am hesistant to even call it a King's Quest game, due to the fact that it fails to adhere to almost all of the fundamental rules of the series. It is not even the same genre as all the previous games. King's Quest 1-7 were all adventure games. With King's Quest 8, Sierra decided to take the series in a different direction, and make it a hack-n-slash action game.
Despite the fact that in every previous King's Quest game the protagonist was a member of the royal family, Mask of Eternity begins when every person in Daventry (the land in which the royal family dwells (actually, just King Graham and Queen Valanice)) prompty turns into stone, leaving only a peasant named Connor to save the world. While all other KQ games have awarded the player for finding non-violent solutions to problems, Connor must carve a path through the corpses of his many enemies, mutilating them all in gruesome ways (certain foes are only defeated by decapitation, etc.)
But I go on. Mask of Eternity is not in actuality a terrible game. I'm sure it could appeal to many people. But for it to bear the coveted ""King's Quest"" title is borderline blasphemy. Don't hesitate to purchase if you like the Doom-esque ""not much plot- kill everything that moves"" genre. But don't ever mistake it for a King's Quest game.",2.0
"I love a good RPG.  Their is nothing like exploring a new world.  Taking on a new life.  In short getting away from yourself for a while. A good RPG will do that.  It's too bad nobody told the people at THQ about any of that.
This game could be summed up in one word.  Boring. Nothing much happens.  When it does, you hardly notice. It's story does nothing to draw you in.
 The graphics are ok at best.  Not the game to show off your PS2 that is for dang sure. Pop-in is horrible and I am surprised how Sony let this little gem slip by for the launch. Not really a game that shows off what the system can do.
Some odd things make it into the game.  The people for one thing. They are in a word, ugly and so is the guy you control.  I am not sure what the artists were thinking but ... These are some ugly folk!  I am not saying they are not well done, they are.  The problem is that they actually look ugly.  Very odd choice.
 The game play is so boring you may find that after about 20 min, you just don't care anymore.  The Quests are boring. The locations are boring.  Even the story is ho-hum. Nothing much is going on in this world.
The music and voice acting are quite good but the game just never gets any momentum going. It feels lifeless and your role in that world seems aimless.
A good RPG is a work of art.  A gentile balance of game and story line. If FinalFantsty and Zelda are like a Pollock or a Picasso then this game is paint by numbers portrait of a clown and some balloons.",2.0
"I got a PS2 the day it came out. There was a lot of games but I had to leave quickly so I just grabbed the most interesting looking box. I found ""Summoner"" and I thought, woah, this game is gonna be amazing! I popped it in, and let a rip. Before I knew it I was bored out of mind! This game is no way up to the PS2s standards and it gets kind of repetitive. I like the story and the sub-quests, but I just couldn't get into it. Bottom line, I should've got SSX.",2.0
"I don't mind the barely-better-than-ps1 look of the graphics.  The graphics were good enough.  I was getting into the story, combat was interesting, I liked the way characters leveled up, the side-quests were often amusing, looking forward to summoning all sorts of monsters until...

I couldn't even get past the first big city when one bug after another combined the make the game distasteful.  I'm sure it's possible to work around some of the bugs except, at MOST, this is just an average RPG and it's not worth trouble to fight the bugs when there are dozens to hundreds of playable RPGS that AREN'T so buggy.

I was impressed enough by what I did see in the game that I'm likely to give Summoner II a shot - very few bug complaints on that game.",2.0
Not very good. Sort of vacant in places. Graphics are blocky. Dont judge a game by its cover. :),2.0
"While the voice-acting is decent and the graphics are passable, the game is sorely lacking in the key areas of gameplay and story. Combat is slow-paced and boring and the landscape is a snooze with very little of interest. The plot is about as generic as fantasy plots come and fails to generate a sense of urgency or empathy...although you can see the character, you don't care about him or his plight. Dry pseudo-historical facts thrown at the player (""this is the xth year since the battle of generic name, the yth year since king blah started to reign"") were probably designed to be a Tolkien-esque backstory to the game but only serve to confuse the player with a litany of pointless names and meaningless events. In short: there are too many games out there which succeed where this failed. Play one of those and don't waste time on this one.",2.0
"This was one of the first games I had for PS2.  In the beginning it was fun and I really didn't mind the now tedious load times.  But after running back and forth from city to city and going between zones in the castle, I couldn't bear to play the game any more.  The game needs to load: 1) when entering battle (from the world map), 2) when leaving a city and going to the world map, 3) when entering a city from the world map, and 4) sometimes in the cities and dungeons between zones.  As I said, in the beginning it doesn't really bother you, but when you're looking for a certain person and can't remember which city they're in or which zone of the castle they're in, it gets frustrating watching the game load constantly.",2.0
"Summoner is a good example of a game that starts out wonderful, then seemingly loses the interest of the people producing it. I honestly loved this game when I first got it. If I had written this review the first week, I'd have given it 4.5 stars. 45 hours into it however, finds me hating it more with every pixel. Here's why:
CONS: 1) Highly irritating choppy draw in on the scenary. Really kills the suspension of disbelief. 2) TERRIBLE camera controll makes you lose much of the granduer of the settings the creators put in. Case in point: the city of Lenele, where you spend most of the first part of your game, locks your camera angle in at a high, directly above view, making navigating the streets and seeing signs and people highly difficult and irritating. Tie that in with the fact that you spend most of your time going from point A to B, and that's alot of boring time spent staring at the top of Joseph's head and the pavement. It also SEVERLY detracts from enjoying the often great scenery they put together. 3) The advancement system breaks down at higher levels. In the beginning you are frequently leveling up, aquiring new skills, getting new armor and weapons etc. This is what makes RPG's fun. After level 20 (which is reached under halfway through) leveling up requires HUGE amounts of experience which is not made up for by larger rewards from creatures and quests. The weapons and armor you aquire also tend to be at best as good as what you have, and very rarely are better. This lack of character advancement leaves the weight to be carried by the story alone, and it doesn't cut it.
I am running out of space. ... ... ... for the rest of the review.",2.0
"Hmm...I'll start with what's good: the game is fairly fun, it has a reasonably cool skill system, there's enough side-quests to keep you entertained much longer than the game actually takes to beat, the characters have some amount of depth (and differ rather greatly), the graphics are fairly nice, the music is quite good, the voice actors fit very well with their characters, it's the best rpg-ish game on the PS2 (which, honestly, isn't saying much at all), and, most importantly, it has a great hidden movie (press X in the credits).
Now for the bad: there are enough random side quests to make the most hardened player of BG2 cry, and very few of them give you the option to not take them on. That means if you only want to do a few of them, you'll have to sort through the ones you don't want in your quest menu. Also the character AI is the worst I've seen since Warcraft 2. Characters will run off on their own to initiate a battle across the battle map, or will throw fireballs at enemies that are healed by fire while your other characters in the blast radius get hurt (after the same attack on the same enemy has failed to have a positive effect the last 20 times it's been tried). The sound cuts out all the time (probably one out of five areas/encounters has only the background music and footstep sounds) and I have yet to hear the sound from the Dragon summons. Probably the most frustrating thing is the messed up experience system. I won't go into great detail here, but after 20th level, you need 20 times as much experience per level, but still get it at the same rate....and you're getting fewer skill points.
So why does this get such a low rating? The real reason is that while it's on the Playstation 2, it seems like it was given as much effort as the average Super Nintendo game....from graphics to sound to depth of game, it's an inferior game taking up the shelf space of a superior system.",2.0
"I purchased this game with the expectations of something new.  I was terribly surprised when I loaded SUMMONER and although it had some impressive graphics much of the gameplay was as simple as POKEMON Silver Version that I purchased for my 7 year olds' Game Boy.
The problems start with the horizons and move right into your first RPG conversation which is all in text.  You would think that for a game of this generation that many of the characters would at least talk to you, even if your response was text scripted.  The fight scenes are distant and not that exciting once you've mastered the chain moves.
I did like the story board and once in town the game was playable but, only until you have gotten your 50th or 60th quest (far too many).  I gave this game two stars because I am not a true RPG fan but was hoping this one would win me over...It didn't.",2.0
I think the game is a entertaining idea. I am very disappointed in the fact that I think the game has a bug and can not be switched to solo play. This is very important because you can not complete the quest.,2.0
"I just can't beleive the game doesn't let the characters talk, it's all reading and very (1 at a time) slow fighting scenes. Is this game always in the tutorial mode? Because I can't seem to get out of it...... The game seems like it has possibilities, but it just doesn't do it for me. Am I doing something wrong in the setup? I don't think so..... and If I am, LMK because this game might as well be the Parasite Eve of PS2.... I was disappointed when the characters weren't capable of talking. That takes away the emotion.....",2.0
"I initially thought this would be great for my 10-yr old. He is heavily in to Pokemon both cards and Nintendo games. It was too high a price to pay for something that was played so little. He was easily bored after just a few times. At (this price) you really can't go wrong. Some kids may love it. But if your child is looking for the usual ""Pokemon action"" in a game, don't waste your money.",2.0
"Alright, I may not be the biggest Pokemon fan there is, but I know a flop when I see one. I don't know about you, but I'm sick of seeing those little Japanese toys that you have to feed and take care of, and if you leave it for a second it dies. I suggest pulling out one of those old Tamagotchi's, it will save you some cash.
Overall, I give Hey You! Pikachu 2 stars. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because even though this game is pointless, that Pikachu sure is cute! I would only recommend it to people who's kids are die-hard Pokemon fans.",2.0
"This is a boring game.  I just couldn't get into it at all.  The characters' conversations seem to go on FOREVER, and there's no way to break away from someone talking to you and move on.  The ""battle mode"" is also something that I found to be distracting and frustrating; however, if you're a big fan of the old-style RPGs that use this feature, you'll probably like this game.  On the other hand, if you want fast-paced action or thrilling gameplay, I'd stick to another title. The graphics and story line are the best parts of the game.  Still, I wouldn't spend sixty bucks on ""Aidyn Chronicles"" unless you're a hard-core RPG fanatic.",2.0
"This game is bad but if you only own a N64 and you've beat the Zelda games and want another RPG this is the best your gonna get. I found this game to be too boring and tedious. Conversations in it are often far too long, with characters taking two paragraphs to say something that could have been said in one sentence. Graphics are terrible also. I noticied one reviewer constantly comparing its graphics to Final Fantasy 7's graphics. This games graphics just slightly edge out FF7's but that isn't saying very much since FF7 came out almost 5 years ago. I cant really remember if Aidyn even had music so it must have been pretty bad... Battles are annoying, traveling is annoying.... Only reason I didn't give this a one is because the plot is kinda original.....",2.0
"A diamond in the rough... covered with bugs
Gosh I so wanted to like this game.  There's a lot to like.  The gameworld is huge - you could spend hours exploring it.  The story is immersive enough to keep you interested.  The combat sequences can be kind of long, but never get boring.  Plus you have a large number of party-member combinations which changes the direction of the story.  I could go on, but others have extolled about the virtues of the game better than I could.
The game feels kind of unfinished, like a piece of coal that isn't quite a diamond.  THQ boasts a gameworld larger than both Zeldas combined, and this is certainly true.  I spent about an hour trekking from the castle town to the first village - travelling takes a LONG time - and while the scenery changes alot (from forest to lakes to snow-capped peaks) there's not all that much to DO.  After the initial ""Gee that's pretty"" factor, traveling from town to town becomes an effort in patience.  The towns also feel kind of empty.  There are a couple of people walking around, and about a dozen houses (only a few with people in them).  I know that the memory constraints are tight, so they couldn't have included everything they would have liked, but that's the sacrifice you make for such a huge gameworld.  I'm not sure this is a good thing.  A smaller, detailed, more interactive gameworld is always better than a huge, sprawling, empty one, in my opinion.
Aidyn Chronicles is also, I'm sorry to say, a bug ridden mess.  A few times my main character got stuck in scenery (trees & walls) and I wasn't able to get him out.  But, the most unforgivable thing was the huge number of errors & crashes I encountered.  I played for an hour, gathered & equiped my party, and set off on my quest, only to talk to a villager and have the game give me an error message and die on me.  I started over, this time saving frequently.  I reached a certain point and my saved game became corrupted, forcing me to start over again.  This time I kept a back-up saved game.  I reached a bit further only to have BOTH saved games get corrupted.  By this point I was so frustrated tip-toeing around the game's bugs that I gave up and put the game up for auction on eBay.
This is a major shame, because the storyline was interesting enough to make me want to continue (long treks and empty towns nonwithstanding).  Maybe if you've got more patience than me, this is a game worth having.",2.0

"I've rented this game, and how I regret that I didn't pick up a different one! The graphics are absurd. The faces are detailed, but Brendan Fraser looks chunky in the cinemas and there is lots of polygon pop up. The control is a pain. Why does it take forever to walk backwards? And why does pressing the jump button take you so far? Some jumps seem impossible to make. The camera can be a problem too. Whenever I start shooting, the camera goes over my head making it difficult to see the enemy. I can't even beat the second level, so I'm not sure what the rest of the game is like. But with the problems I mentioned it will probably just get worse. The only things this game has to offer is the satisfaction of shooting or slicing mummies like Brendan Fraser. The music is pretty cool.",2.0
"Okay I don't have the DC version of course. It isn't out yet. But I do have the PC version and it isn't very fun. Sure you blow heads off and there are gutts flying everywhere. But they truth is that there is no strategy behind the game. You just go around shooting. I like stratagy games like Metal Gear Solid though. But I am telling you this game isn't worth buying. It gets old really fast. It is exactly like DOOM except against humans and better graphics of course. But remember how DOOM was so awesome for the first 5, 6 maybe 7 days then it got really, well then you didn't play it anymore. Well that is how this game is. I haven't played it since the 1st day I got it. I recommend not buying this game!",2.0
"I got this game hoping, with my writing skills, I could create a masterpiece of an RPG game. But I was wrong. At first I had fun with storyline, making dungeons, characters, and naming and making enemies, items, and all that. I titled it, chose the opening theme, and stuff. I test played it and found out how hard it was to make this game. A great game like Final Fantasy series, Xenogears, Chrono Cross or Breath of Fire series must take ages to make because this is the most time-consuming game I have ever played.
The graphics are very NESish, and old, but I liked them at the beginning. Then I got very annoyed with them and how old they looked. It was like I was playing a classic Zelda game, or the great PS1 game Tales of Destiny. I quickly grew bored with this game. Check out some other reviews, one guy from Chicago tells all that I cannot type for my hands are very tired. I had fun at first but it all gradually fell down on me and I gave it up. The Anime Maker is very difficult to use and Scenario mode is even harder. A very very difficult game; you'll need a strategy guide for this but of course they don't make one. They include 2 instruction booklets in the CD case that are even difficult to understand. The magic system is horrible and it is all too confusing and hard. Do not buy this game thinking you'll make a masterpiece. I don't even know how some people do so.",2.0
"You'll need a lot if your going to make a serious adventure.  You have a simpler concept to use, since it is mapped out for you in text windows.  The game itself is simple too annoying to play.  After seven hours, I completed one half-finished village.  Imagine how long for the whole game.  Plus you need to use the playstation controller to write out anything that your characters will say.  Scripted events are near impossible to make, bug testing is not fun, and you will start to go insane at the point of 20 hours.
Whenever you hear someone say ""I Could Make A Better Game Than That!"" shove this game in their face.  It ought to put him (or her) in their place.  Only recommended for the extremely super patient.",2.0

"Alot of people are going to say that two stars is unfair for a game that has such great graphics and playability...i understand where you're coming from if you think that, because this game looks great and is VERY fun. But it is way too graphically violent for me. I don't have anything against shooting games in general, I love Counter Strike and IGI, and Unreal Tournament was good back in the day, but Wolfenstein ups the ante way beyond simple kill and be killed gameplay, going to extremes like depictions of torture and mutilation. Even though i can spend hours shooting enemies in the head while playing Medal of Honor, and enjoy lopping off limbs in Rune, playing Castle Wolfenstein is, for me, completely demoralizing and dehumanzing. I don't play it because of that, and any game I won't play can't get better than two stars.
By the way, this game is banned in Germany. But that might just be because of the anti-German sentiment as much as the violence.",2.0
"This game lacked substance. It played just like a mini version of the t.v. show, which sounds like a good idea, but the creators were completely unable to pull it off. Between levels, there are long dialogues between the characters which set up a plot line. After the dialogues, Buffy goes to patrol and, of course, is attacked by vampires. Unlike the t.v. show, Buffy only fights vampires. I was hoping for some vicious demons to shake things up, but no such luck. The game lacks choices. There are no weapons and you follow an arrow which points out the next vampire. The graphics and action are awful. Sometimes when fighting a vamp, you don't know if you are successfully hitting it or not. I would recommend this only if you are a hardcore Buffy fan.",2.0
"In my opinion, I wasted my money upgrading my computer at a cost of nearly $600 to play this game in it's 'full glory.' Although it is a nice game, it certainly doesn't live up to any hype and in many aspects it feels like a rehash of Doom and the Quake series.

I spent $350 on an Xbox and Halo, and I can say without a doubt that was the best investment I ever made in the games industry.",2.0
"With other first person shooters like Aliens vs. Predator 2 out and legacy shooters with rich story like Half-Life and superb graphics like Unreal, the bar is set pretty high these days for this game genre.  Return to Castle Wolfenstein has stormed onto the scene in recent months to much fanfare, but I don't think it deserved what it got.
Many people talk of its superb graphics, but I was unimpressed.  The game is very noir, every level is a dimly lit something-or-other.  There are no vibrant high contrast awe inspiring scenes.  They are all dark.  This is probably because in low contrast you can get away with fewer polygons per scene.  The rendering engine looks to be the same unimproved Quake3 one which on all my nVidia-based cards create strange patterns in the textures up close.
What shocked me the most though was the AI.  It's terrible.  Low on health?  Thinking of sneaking around so you aren't heard?  Forget about it.  There is even a mission that requires stealth, and I thought I was being clever using the trees as cover and crawling along so that the guy in the sniper tower wouldn't notice me...  Doesn't work.  The AI in this game is about as the most simplistic I've seen in a recent game.
Even the very little things were missed in this game.  The hot spot of the pointer in the menus is so far off the arrow tip that you can easily miss menu items.  They don't save more than one quicksave so when you find out that you were seen 20 seconds ago right before you quick saved (on a mission where you are supposed to get around without being seen), you are in serious trouble and may end up falling back on an autosave that is an entire level back.
The only reason I don't give this game 1 star is that the multiplayer is lots of fun.  It isn't original or notably different from any multiple class mod for the other first person shooters, but I still find it fun.",2.0
"I bought this game primarily for the multiplayer action, and they really didn't reinvent the wheel.  Similar to any game with ""Classes"", like Half Life mods Day of Deafeat and Team Fortress.  Although the game is visually stunning, the grapics don't make the game play any better.",2.0
"Maybe the game had too much hype, but after nearly completing the single player and playing the multi-player for several weeks, I am rather disappointed.  The single player missions for the most part are boring and repetitive.  I'm comparing it to Half-Life and it is nowhere even close to the quality of the single player.  What is really shocking are the graphic defects present in the game - guns appearing through walls, dead soldiers hovering a few feet above ground, some cheesy AI, but better than most.  The multiplayer is much more enjoyable, and uses many of the single player maps.  I'll be selling it and buying Medal of Honor when it comes out.",2.0
"After the greatly successful N64 game Mario Golf, Camalot Software decided to cook up a new sports title for the year.

It took me a little over five hours to complete in its entirety,  so that will give you a clue to just how bad this game is.",2.0

Compared to some of the older FPSs out there like quake and unreal the levels are interesting and fun.  About on par with half life or HALO.  Multiplayer beats the older generation of games, but is about on par with some of the shareware half-life mods.

"I've owned every generation of hockey since Activision released 2-on-2 hockey for the Atari 2600.  I believe, and all of my friends agree, that 989 NHL Faceoff by far has the best game play of any hockey game ever created.  If you appreciate ""realistic"" game play that is.  While EA is esthetically pleasing, and has a lot of neat gimmicks, the actual game play doesn't compare to 989.  The checking is unrealistic and exaggerated, fighting is a joke, players do not go to the net as much, and you have to skate around the zone for half the period waiting for a play to develop, and it rarely does.  I'm so disappointed with the game play that I've gone back to playing 989 hockey for the original Playstation.  While I don't dispute that the graphics on this game are like nothing I've ever seen, it means nothing without the game play to back it up.  The day that 989 releases Faceoff for the PS2, I'll be the first in line to trade in my EA NHL 2001.",2.0

"I got the game as a part of a 3-game deal coming with my ps2. It wasn't the main reason why I bought the package, but I was really hoping for the game to bring hockey to a new level. It doesn't. Technically, the game performs pretty well, with only occasional lapses in the announcers' speech and a bunch of other small errors. Stylistically, though, the game is a disaster. It misses features that hockey games should have. Example: no scoring or penalty summary. You want to find out who just got that assist, you have to sit through a replay of the play before the PA guy will start announcing it. It gets really frustrating when you try playing a whole season like that. Another thing that really bugs me is the difficulty levels. It's a joke. I went to all-star levels after maybe a week at most, and I have no trouble beating the computer. The goalie is pathetic. You stand behind the net and pass it into the back of the net, and the goalie goes sprawling to try to block it.

"I'll make my point right and say: DONT BUY THIS GAME. The only good reason to buy this game for the outrageous price these people ask for is that you played it when you were a kid and wanna relive memories with it. If you have never played it on console, let me tell you this, I have been playing it for a while now and I can say that the gameplay is awful. The first half of the game shows potential of a cool platformer with nice challenge. Then you get to the dinosaur world (about half way through the game) and you find out that you've made a mistake in starting the game. It becomes insanely difficult to do every little task in the game. Around the spooky level, every task requires perfect timing and most enemy's will kill you in seconds. Then you get to the war level and if you're skilled enough to get through it and finish a boss, the game developers reward you with near impossible ""exit the area before it explodes"" task. The task requires you to jump through lazer trip mines that can kill you in one failed move. You have to jump through these lazer mins several time and if you die you have to start from the begining. Then after you get to the end you have to fight a final boss that shows challenge at first but then turns into another near impossible moment in the game. Then the ending blows because nothing is resolved. The game s*** on you the whole time just to s*** on you again at the end. One positive side to this game is the multiplayer which can be fun! But it usually bores you to death after a few rounds with friends. Even after reading this you still think you want this game? Don't buy it, play the emulator first. Then decide if you wanna pay about 100$ to get pissed off for 8 hours",2.0
"Sometimes a movie based game comes along and is enjoyable because it reminds you of the fun you had seeing that film, others make you just wish were watching the film instead.  This game falls into the category of the latter.  It is just barely playable suggesting that it needed either more time to fine tune or an almost total overhaul.  Visually, the game is inconsistant.  The back grounds are rendered and look reminiscent of the film only minus the creepiness.  Appearance-wise, the characters are decent but feel too low res and outdated, especially in front of the rendered backdrops.  Still the graphics don't give the player the gut tightening thrill they should.  The game play is similar to Resident Evil, not the series, but the first game.  It reaches to the Playstation's past for a game engine.  The enemies are too difficult to kill in conjuction with Ash's attacking ""skills"", being ineffective hacks, slashs, and pooly aimed gun shots.  They regenerate ad frustratum.  The story is rehashed from the plots of the film trilogy. From the beginning it just seems thrown together.  The voice acting held promise as it features the star of the Evil Dead movies, Bruce Campbell.  But unfortunately even that is ruined by a half-hearted delivery.  The game is just not what I expected.  The concept sounded good a year ago, but the final product isn't enjoyable. Don't get burned on this one like I did.",2.0
"Don't buy/rent this game.  It is bad.  The control is awful, players stop moving completely when they come into contact with an opposing player.  Secondly, they will not move after you fake out a defender, the ""killer cross-over dribble"" is far from ""killer"".  The create a player is cool, but the gameplay is awful.  There is no draft like advertised.  Just don't get this game, you have been warned",2.0
"After playing the demo version of this game, I was sure the complete game would be a blast.  The demo offered clean graphics and quick gameplay,  though it was hampered by an incredibly simplistic story.  Still, it made  me want to play the game.
After renting ""Threads of Fate,""  though, I have to say that Square has let me down again.  Though this one's  not nearly as bad as some of their other bombs (""Legend of Mana""  and ""SaGa Frontier""), ""Threads of Fate"" is still a far  cry from a good game.
The major faults of ""Threads of Fate""  include the boring dialogue, skimpy storyline, bad camera angles, and  awkward control.  To put it simply -- you have to get through a lot of  nonsense just to get to the gameplay, but even that isn't so hot.
You'll  run into lots of annoying features in the battle mode, such as zoomed-in  shots that prevent you from navigating effectively and annoying jumps or  unclear exits.
There is some fun, though -- the battles themselves aren't  too bad, though they end up as hack-and-slash fests more than anything  else.  Having two characters to play is one of the game's few saving  graces.  It's especially fun playing as Rue and changing into the enemies  you just killed.
All in all, Square is starting to slip, in my opinion,  and games like this only prove my point.  ""Threads of Fate"" is  worth a rental, but don't expect anything grand.

The graphics are good and so is the music. The controls aren't to confusing but you honestly can't beat this game. Its very difficult. I tried to get some where in it 3 times but I finally gave up after the monsters kept killing my person.

If you're one of those people who love really difficult games that are hard to get any where in then this game is for you. But if you're one of those people who would at least like to get some where in the game this probably isn't the game for you.

"The first foray of the cult Evil Dead horror movie series into video games began here with Evil Dead: Hail to the King.  Using the Resident Evil formula of pre-rendered backgrounds with 3-D animated characters, Evil Dead suffers from poor polygon designs, clunky controls, and the same ""find the key to open the door"" type gameplay we've seen in games like the Resident Evil series and Alone in the Dark.  Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell lends his voice to Ash and breathes some life into this otherwise dismal game, but the terrible control layout and configuration really bring this game down.  The Dreamcast version was a bit better with improved graphic and sound quality, but all in all Evil Dead: Hail to the King is worth checking out for fans of the Evil Dead series or survival horror games only.",2.0
"I cannot wrie much on this game as I just cannot get anywhere with it. Unfortunately you cannot save just anywhere, only @ the cabin. You are ALWAYS out-numbered severly and your chainsaw uses up fuel very quickly. I know 4 people who have had it for over a year and have still not passed the first task. Apart from the impossibilites it is quite a good game",2.0
"The story is something like this: after the Army Of Darkness movie, Ash gets a new girlfriend. But he has nightmares, and he decides to go back to the cabin (which was destructed in Evil Dead II), to end this once and for all. The cabin is well-clean and everything (where's the connection with Evil Dead II, partners?). But Ash's girlfriend is kidnapped by Bad Ash (more like Evil Dead II's then Army Of Darkness'). Your objective is to find six Necronomicon pages throughout the game, a boring task, I must say. And you also have to save your girlfriend. That's what you have to do... While you move on, you might notice that, if you're a hard fan like myself, the game is only fun while you're walking inside or around the cabin, those familiar scenaries. All the rest is boring... The graphics are OK for a PSOne game, for all I've played.. Trees move, the fog moves.. No big deal, but it's ok... The sound is good too, Bruce Campbell does great voice acting (as seen in other games too). But it's not fun. And that's a big problem. Deadites keep coming and coming, some enemies are really tough, and you don't feel like you've finnished a masterpiece when you beat this game... It was a try, but I wish THQ can learn from its mistakes to make a cool sequel. In the educational point the game is not approved.. It's Mature-classified, you see.. There is a little blood, violence.. But no big things, you can let your grown-up children play it...

"Being a fan of the Gradius series, especially G3 for the old Super NES, I rented this title to see what it was like, and I was a little dissapointed.  The gameplay was exactly the same, but something was just missing.  The Super NES version of G3 is the superior, as it had better music and a kickass intro of the Vic Viper launching.  Here, all you get are still shots of previous Gradius box artwork.  But the newly-created into cinematics were awesome.  Maybe Konami should look into creating a new Gradius game, one designed to take advantage of the PS2's power.
So pick up this title only if you have all the other games and need Gradius 4 to finish your collection, which, being a newer game, has much better graphics and sound.  Plus, everything is polygonal instead of sprites so it looks 3D.",2.0
"My problem with Conker doesn't have as much to do with the idea so much as it does the follow-through. In all honesty, I was thrilled to hear the company had recognized their own flaws and were attempting to reconcile for them by releasing a shockingly robust title that seemed to spit in the face of everything they'd done since the debates caused by the home release of the original Mortal Kombat. However, I left my initial playing with the sense that the while idea itself was exactly what the company needed, the execution was more than a tad lacking.
The story plays out like a theatrical feature, which is appropriate considering the number of situations the game eventually borrows from popular films. Glass of milk (or is it a white russian?) in hand and a scowl plastered upon his face, Conker is immediately reminiscent of the kind of anti-hero popularized by Bruce Willis in Die Hard or Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. Surrounded by his supposed friends and acquaintances, this introductory scene was a great way to set the tone of the story and introduce a hardened, slightly older version of the title's namesake. The moment the king's flashback begins is when the player begins to take control of the action.
There's a lot of Hollywood inspiration in Conker's tale. From the little nuances and cliches such as the opening scene, to borrowed scenes or tips of the hat to films like the location of the King's throne at the end of the game, to straightforward rip-offs of memorable scenes or films like the unquestionably Matrix bank heist, this cartridge is chock full of film-lore. And, to its credit, the vast majority of the game's quirks, nods and thefts are handled very well, with just enough originality and additional humor thrown in to make it work within the broad confines of its storyline.
For the most part, the story is successful. Its film parodies are spot on, while its original threads tend to lag behind a bit and force a joke just for the sake of it. It feels like the game was rushed, and rather than waiting for the inspiration to create something undeniably funny, the writers instead went with whatever they came up with the fastest. In addition, there's little if any direction as to what you should be doing at any point in the story. Bad Fur Day is a big fan of putting you in the middle of an immense area with no visual clues as to where you should go from there, then erecting giant invisible walls out of thin air and hoping that their placement will corral you into the exact area in which you should be. Successful or not, this method is employed over and over and over again, from the game's start until its finish.
While the storyline is competent for the most part, the actual control and gameplay itself is nearly unforgivable. Physically controlling Conker is a complete nightmare. Even the use of the N64's well-designed analog joystick can't save this horribly imprecise setup, as the squirrel will occasionally veer left or right without explanation or mosey over the edge of a cliff moments after you've told him to stop moving entirely. Conker does have a sort of double-jump feature, in that through the use of his tail he can hover in the air for a couple additional seconds. He can also perform a high jump and a long jump, by crouching or running for a few second before leaping, accordingly. Unfortunately, these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it. I've been running for upwards of a full minute, jumped, and watched Conker perform a weak little sissy jump and fall to his doom. This game really feels like something that wasn't fully tested before its release, the controls reek of incompletion.
Add onto that one of the most horrific cameras in the history of 3-D rendering, and you've already got a pissed off gamer. Seriously, you're given supposed control of these angles through the use of the C buttons (similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time), but as soon as you find a vantage point you're comfortable with and release the C button, it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful, useless view. This camera cannot pass through walls, so if your back is against one and you're trying to prepare for a complicated, lengthy, precise leap, you've got to do it blind. Better still, once you've made up your mind and attempted said jump, the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as it's got room to get behind you, effectively reversing your controls in mid-air and introducing a loss of direction to your life.
The audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one. The voice acting is tremendous, Conker's voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material. The music is the usual fare for Rare platformers, light and bouncy, and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it. Little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when he's drunk, or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience, and are things I wish more games took the time to incorporate.
When push comes to shove, there's really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by Conker's Bad Fur Day, and that's disappointment. There's no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship, and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the N64's lifespan. This game wasn't created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy, frustrate and defeat.",2.0
"No offense to old-school shooters or their fans, but this is a pretty weak excuse for a PS2 launch title.  Sony's ""ultimate game machine"" (or whatever tagline they're using) should be able to easily handle the first and second Gradius installments, along with these two, on a single disc.  Where are they?  I hate to say it but Konami isn't giving us a whole lot of bang for our buck (which is unusual for them).
Sure, the new intro is nice, but what about the games themselves?  I think Father Time has a way of exaggerating our sense of nostalgia, especially where video games are concerned.  Some games simply do not age well.  In the battle between pretty graphics and solid gameplay, I stand firmly on the latter side, but next to the best shooters of the post 16-bit era (such as Einhander and G Darius), Gradius III and IV just aren't much fun.  The actual shooting is downplayed while too much emphasis is placed on memorizing the enemy patterns and maneuvering your ship so as to avoid becoming instant space junk.  Before too long, it ceases to be challenging and just gets annyoing.  Get killed and you lose all your power ups.  Good luck beating a boss with just a speed-up bonus.  Plus, there are no continues in Gradius III!  Instead, it uses a lame stage select mode.
I know, these were landmark shooters in their heyday, but we should be playing more advanced games that learn and borrow from them, not just recycling them for a new system.  I fully support the continuation of 2-D gaming in the 3-D era, but this is not the way to go about doing it.  If you really want a traditional shooter for your PS2, try Silpheed: The Lost Planet instead.  Not as much of a challenge, perhaps, but MUCH more enjoyable.",2.0

"This game a foul - the long cut scenes are full of disgusting humor. Those were the best bits. The actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment. The 'puzzles' wouldn't stump a four year old and the game play is tedious and repetitive. If I hadn't borrowed the game from a friend I would have put it down the garbage disposal by now.
The game suffers from many of the problems that Nintendo games have. You have long and tedious jumping sequences in which the character will often fail to jump for no apparent reason causing you to have to repeat the sequence from the start over and over ad nauseam. The direction the character moves depends on the camera angle and, as the camera will swing around unpredictable, the character will suddenly start marching off in a totally different direction when you haven't moved the joystick. As much of this 'game' involves walking along narrow paths, this is a real pisser.
I picked up the controller exactly three time with this game and each time I threw it down in disgust 30 minutes later. I guess I'm a slow learner. If they the game out and just left the cut scenes you'd have something I'd probably pay $5 for but at least I'd think I'd gotten value for my money.
The game seems designed to irritate and annoy the player. Don't buy it unless you really enjoy repeating the same boring stuff over and over.",2.0

"I am a 24 year old mom of two children; five and four year old.  This game might be fun if you like to walk in circles and doing things over and over again.  But it is very frustrating and hard to hardle specially for little ones.  I played it for hours but never got more than 4 goldens tickets, got 201 red tickets but what's the POINT! They are not worth anything.  My brother bought this game for his 7 year old daughter who kept calling me to help her play, because she kept saying ""it's too hard"".  Kids loose interest in extremely difficult games, since you can't get much proggress playing for hours and IT IS hard to get golden tickets!  And you can't do anything without them.

"All Evil Dead fans can agree on one thing. We were all very excited to see this game. BUT as we are all finding, it leaves a lot to be desired. You have horribly awkward changing camera angles while fighting, sloppy fighting animation (I just didn't get a good eviscerating feeling from using the chainsaw), Unfufilling story line etc. At the end I found myself just thinking ""That was it? That's all?"" I played and finished this game once and have had no desire to put it in and play it again. The only saving grace (making it two stars instead of one) was the entertaining voice over from Bruce and his cut scenes. I felt pretty cheated that this was sold as a two disc game. There just isn't that much there. Hopefully as another reviewer put it this won't kill a possible franchise in games for Evil Dead. They just need to make it a lot better. If Sam Raimi can't see it to make more movies then we want more games.

How hard is it to record a few different statements?  The graphics are okay and the physics engine is pretty good but not good enough to make up for the rest of the game.  They should have added more to the career mode, like getting offers from sponsers depending on how you're doing.  Hiring and firing crew chiefs and spending your earnings to keep you car running and to buy upgrades and stuff.  When the ... will game developers learn that they are leaving out most of the reality in these games?  Rent it, beat it, and buy something else.

At critical moments in the game, your controls can simply become unresponsive. Unfortunately, you never know when this bad programming symptom will strike.

"well, for starters, hahaha. you know, i'll never recommend this game to anyone that already owns gauntlet legends (GL). Why you ask. because it'd be no different than going to the store & buying the exact same game. same game you say? well, maybe not entirely, but it could've been a whole lot better..
for starters, the game engine used is a HARDLY tweaked version of the GL engine. they added a few (4 is it, and it doubles the cast of characters, but hardly improves upon them, as the ""3D"" models are SO low on the poly count, i'd gladly sacrafice them to see graphics up to par of.. any other PS2 game?
Also, the game gets horribly boring after a very short while, degrading into a sad display of button mashing in an eventually disinteresting game. The game has a measly 1, yes, 1 new area for you to easily conquer.
Why easy? because the A.I. is horrible. I don't think the enemy character's ability to fight back has improved since my first encounter w/ Gauntlet, back on my Apple IIc.
The enemy characters (either a standard sized zombie/undead walking type, or a smaller, crawling spider/dog type) do nothing more than walk towards you. yes, that's all. when they get to you they swing/bite/sting/whatever until you move towards them and ""kill"" them, or do a normal attack and hit them before they reach you. The 2 exceptions being a suicide ogre/goblin type that occaisionally shows up w/ a exploding barrel on his back, and he'll blow up when touched/shot. also, there are either bomb lobbers or acchers that offer the only ranged enemy attacks.
more you ask? well, to make the game unnecessarily longer, you have to not only go through all of the different ""lands"" in the kingdom to defeat each boss character and steal their key, but you also need to find 2-3 rune stones in each ""land"", these are necessary to be able to unlock the fight w/ the final boss of the game, without them you have to basically start over. (to be able to travel to the last ""land"", you have to sacrafice your keys. so if you're missing any stones when you do this, you have to replay the game to be able to fight the final boss..

"I have to agree with the review titled ""Any Car That Drove Like This Would Never Be Bought."" While I thought the pedals were acceptable, the steering itself was horrendous. It claims to have ""multiple sensitivity levels"" but the three that it comes with are ""way too insensitive"" (you steer and nothing happens), ""unacceptable"" (waaaay too much dead space in the center of the steering) and ""wild oversteer"" (you can look sideways at the wheel and do cookies). It also didn't help that there's actually a sort of ""notch"" at the center steering position that the wheel snaps back to. If you just want to steer a little, you end up oversteering when you pull it out of the center position ""notch."" The positioning of the wheel was highly adjustable, though, and could be put into a comfortable position wherever you wanted it, so I have to give 'em points for that. And the fact the pedals stayed pretty much stationary on the ground. But that's all. I'd hold out for the GT Force wheel - I've tried the PC version Logitech put out and it's MUCH better.",2.0
"I have played lots of adventure games, and I usually enjoy them, even if many of them are a bit clunky or goofy compared to their sleeker cousins.  ""The Riddle of the Sphinx"" is definitely in the ""Myst"" family of games, the best of which (in my opinion) are probably ""The Journeyman"" series, or ""The Longest Journey,"" because they have such a good sense of humor along with their solemn ""save the world"" messages.  Most of these games involve aliens, popular mysteries such as Easter Island, the Pyramids, etc.  Some have a sense of humor, with funny and self-conscious dialogue, and characters who are appealing and interesting.  ""The Riddle of the Sphinx"" takes itself very seriously throughout, which is one strategy for building suspense, imitating the ""solemnity"" of the Myst series, and it's fine if you don't take it toooooo seriously.  But the game also has a hidden agenda which appears at the very end, and is, to my mind, insidious.
I played this game with a walk-through because the puzzles, which mostly involve wandering from room to similar room picking up similar objects and dragging them around with you, tend to resemble each other. (By the time you ""solve"" the ultimate mystery, your inventory bag must weigh about 400 lbs!) I didn't have the patience or energy to solve the puzzles, and I admire players who did!  Other reviewers have commented on the game's tendency to crash (it does freeze a fair amount), but if you save frequently, this is not such a problem.  The game uses a tremendous amount of computer resources, and you have to be careful to close all applications which might be running in the background.  You can do this during game-play by hitting Ctl-Alt-Del, and closing various applications as you go.
But it's the conclusion of the game which was really problematic for me.  All adventure games give you a ""reward"" when you solve them-lights come on, music plays, and all the mysteries come together in a big, satisfying, ""bang.""  Usually, you are smiling at the end, pleased as your computer takes off into never-never-land.  Unfortunately, the ending of this game veers off into a grey area of religious doctrine which I think many gamers might find offensive--I certainly did.  Without giving away the ""mystery"" for those who still want to play ""Riddle of the Sphinx,"" suffice it to say that the creators of the game suggest (without much subtlety, and with little or no humor) that there is a literal biblical basis for much of the world's history, and that non-biblical cultures around the world (""pagans"")have been ""cursed"" for meddling with the ""true"" (i.e. biblical) plan of the world.  While I respect the beliefs of those who wrote this game, I think this kind of suggestion is inappropriate in any product not sold as ""religious.""
A line has been crossed here which many alert gamers will not appreciate.  Most people play computer adventure games to be carried into a self-contained fantasy world. Whatever ""preaching"" goes on should be ecumenical and in the spirit of fun.  I suggest that the game's creators might want to consider revising the ending of their game, or advertising it differently.  And for gamers thinking of playing ""Riddle of the Sphinx,"" beware the true curse at the end!",2.0
"Okay, the graphics were nice, the music was dreamy, but this was an incredibly boring game. I almost quit the game during the cheoptronic sequence. Going through that long tunnel for days was unecessary and incredibly booooooooring! I don't mind a puzzle game being difficult but don't bore me to death. I hope Atlantis was better than this. I'm going to try that. It's a shame programmers spend all their time and talent making beautiful scenery and tantalizing puzzles and make the in between stuff so boring you want to quit the game before you finish.",2.0

"After playing ""The Longest Journey"" (sigh-I loved it) I was getting edgy for something new.  I wanted to see if there were any games out there like it. ""The Longest Journey"" is still my favorite game and I wanted something similar or better (if possible).  I read all the reviews of THIS game.  Half of the reviews seemed favorable and the other half hated it.  What to do...I contacted, via email some of the reviewers to ask them if they think I would like the game.  Consensus showed I should get it. Okay so here goes.....The game began with little graphic and exciting scenes of what to expect and then BOOM! The actual game had horrible graphics. I mean real bad.  It's so pixilated you can barely make out the Sphinx itself.  I proceeded anyway because I was kind of feeling the Indiana Jones hype and went further..to the first and obvious puzzle.  It seemed hard at first but I ""unlocked"" the puzzle in 5 minutes! That's right! 5 minutes.  Okay, I gave it one more chance...I tried to find my way to the next step and the 180 degree turns and slow ""Myst"" click and move steps got me so annoyed and lost it took me an hour just to figure out where I needed to go.  I could never get to the spot I needed to, because apparently I needed to download a patch to proceed.  I found out after calling some game stores at the local mall that you need a few of these patches to improve the game.  It is playable without them, but extraordinarily difficult.  I really wanted this game to succeed. I had done my homework, giving it a fair chance and it failed.  It really was like an Egyptian ""Myst"" minus the beautiful graphics, intellectually challenging puzzles and lacking a great plot.  I am still remaining open to new ideas from anybody.  I have since, returned ""The Riddle of the Sphinx"" and am looking forward to suggestions from other game reviewers.  If anybody has ideas for me please feel free to email. Thank You.  And to those of you who were so kind and helpful...I'm truly glad you liked the game..I guess it just wasn't for me.",2.0
"I loved the movie, The Grinch, but this game is just bad.
First of all, the graphics are very bad for Dreamcast. They look more like Playstation's graphics.  Second, It gets annoying. Every few steps, you will have to wait a minute while they recite a cute little DR. Seuss rhyme about the place. Third, the missions you have to do are very poorely explained. Fourth, one of the most annoying things were that every time you go near a kid in Whoville, he'll try to hug you and say,""Hi big daddy!"" and you have to shake him loose. This happens a lot.
I have to admit that they did do a good job on Whoville.",2.0
"With ""Zork"" in the title you'd expect the game to be set somewhere in the original Zork underground; but there are only passing  comments about such places as ""flood control dam #3"" etc.  I  would have dissmised that as marketing if the game had been even half good,  which it ain't. The graphics are ok, and the 360 deg scroll thing is nice,  but in my opinion the Journyman #3 did a better job there.  The one area  that I'd give 4 stars to is the movie clips, pretty good. My main complaint  though is that the story line sort of sucks... I'm a gammer not a soap  junkie.  The whole storyline smells of a really, really bad soap opra  chliche.  A tragic love story, an affair, murders... give me a break. And  sticking severed heads on electrodes isn't my idea of ingenious puzzle  content.",2.0
"I really hate to say that this game is thoroughly mediocre since it does have a few things going for it, such as the gorgeous graphics and somewhat interesting storyline.  However, I cannot recommend Mafia to anyone who has already played a truly great driving/gangster game such as Grand Theft Auto 3, or who doesn't like attempting a single mission 30+ times. Overall, the idea of letting you play a Mafia don in the 1930s is a good one; however, it's just poorly implemented in this game.

Gameplay: Your character is a taxi driver who is forced into a career of crime.  By completing missions (driving, killings, vandalism, more driving, etc.), you rise in the ranks of the Salieri crime family.  Much of the gameplay, from the controls (mouse, keyboard, and optionally a gamepad) to mission design, is easy to pick up and much like GTA3.  Nonetheless, the big problem with Mafia is that the gameplay is tedious and at some points down right boring.  While the city you do your dirt in is very beautifully rendered, it's rather dead and does not have the bustle and liveliness of GTA3's Liberty City or Vice City.  There's no reason to ever get out of your car as you are driving between missions, since there are no ammo shops to visit, mini-missions to unlock, or other things to do. You can literally spend 20 minutes driving from Salieri's bar to the next mission site, and there is absolutely no feeling of accomplishment once you finally arrive.

On the good side, the developers of the game have tried to make it realistic, which is both the strength but also many of the weaknesses of the game.  The cars look fantastic, though they handle poorly. Also, unlike GTA3, you can't commit outrageous traffic violations without drawing the police, and you can't just jump in and steal any parked car.  The animation of the character models look realistic and scenary feels authentic.  Also, though it has the automatic save system that GTA3 has, Mafia saves the game at more points, so that you don't have to do too much backtracking if (I mean when) you fail a mission.

Now, for the bad side. The cars are just a chore to drive. Bad handling, low horsepower, slippery tires, you name it. And given that there is so much driving required by the game, the developers should have allowed you to skip some of the non-eventful driving scenes. To make matters worse, many of the missions are timed and the in-game map is useless.  You'll lose a number of missions just searching for the bridges that connect the city together (no roads or bridges appear on the in-game map). It is hard to imagine why the developers of this game thought that beginning and ending missions with such annoyingly long and tedious driving sequences would be fun to players.

And now, for the ugly. Yes, the racing mission (#6) is as awful as many people have said. Even though I have the patched version of the game that includes a difficulty slider for the race, it was still too hard on the ""very easy"" setting. The race is way too long, the track has way too many sharp turns, the race car is way to prone to spin-outs and roll-overs, and the controls (gamepad or keyboard) just don't cut it for what is required.  I tried this mission over 30 times and never won the race and thus never finished the game (which is rare for me).  The race was the worst instance of the frustrations of gameplay, but there were plenty more.

Graphics: The real shame is that Mafia, as tedious and poorly designed as it is, is a beautiful game. The cutscenes, though a bit too long sometimes, are well done and even the lip-syncing is better than most games I've played. The cars are shiny and sleek and show damage when they are abused. The city itself is well rendered and driving in the countryside is just heavenly.  It's just too bad that some of the energy that was expended on creating such realistic graphics was not used to make a truly exciting game.

Sound: Everything is cool in this department.  The voice acting is well done; cars, weapons, and other things sound as they should; and the music is fine.

Replay/value: Since I only paid $10 for this game, it's hard to feel cheated, even though I was able to complete only 5 of the 20 missions.  My disappointment is largely about what this game could have been with just a bit more effort and testing.  If you are a very patient player and don't mind long stretches of repetitive gameplay (such as all of the dull driving that you'll be doing) and can find a way to beat the racing mission, then this might be worth your while.  However, if you are expecting a game with a lot of exciting car action, very original missions, and anything approaching GTA3's funny, openended mayhem, definitely look elsewhere.",2.0
"Don't get me wrong.  This game is fun, however, the frustration factor is about to make me go on my own killing spree. First of all, there's no in-game save.  The game saves after every level so if you screw up you have to start over and over and over and over...  The vehicles are fun to drive, however, the control is difficult.  I seem to slide on invisible patches of ice.  Why is it that when I'm chasing someone, no matter how fast my vehicle is, they get away? and why is it that when I'm being pursued, no matter how fast my vehicle is, they're always riding my tail?  I found the race to be most challenging and you'll use a few colorful words before you win.  I would have won sooner, but again, al I did was skid at after turn and spin out to end up facing the wrong direction.  The story-line is entertaining but the game is just too frustrating for me to just sit here and play the same level over and over and over and over.  Two hours of the same level is not worth my time.  I have a life.",2.0
"Pretty much everything has already been said and I think it just depends on the person, but I got bored with this game...so bored that when I upgraded my system and the game stopped working with the new configuration, I didn't really care even though I was only a fourth of the way finished.
 So, if I have anything to say about this, I'll speak to that problem.
Without getting into specifics, basically when I upgraded my system from mid-level to high-end, the game stopped working. It will load and begin, but then it just completely quit. I lowered the clock speed on my processor and selected the lowest graphics settings: that got the game to work for about 30 minutes before it just crashed again. That was also after I installed the patch. None of this makes any sense to me and I fix and build computers for a living.
At that point, I was only playing because I'd spent good money on this game and was hoping there was going to be something other than pretty graphics and a good story to make it worth while. It takes up too much space on the hard drive (IMHO) and the game play is seriously lacking. There's no incentive to explore-it's entirely too linear.
Perhaps if I had a chance to really get into the Free Ride part I'd like it, but since you have to play the regular part of the game before all of the Free Ride is unlocked...and since the bloody game won't hardly work anymore (even though all of my soft and hardware is `supported') I guess I will never know.
I'm not at the point of asking for my money back, but close. I'm very disappointed and I really wanted to like this game. I tried to like it. I like driving games and I like mafia and old `Chicago' type of stories. I did not like this game, though...even when it was working.
Download the demo before you buy. If you do buy, download the patch because you'll be glad you did when you get to the race. It's absurdly difficult without intermediate saves.",2.0
"I was thoroughly disappointed in Mafia. I hate to say this, because I really wanted to like this game, and for the first hour or so I really did. But as the game progressed so did my frustration.
It's true that Mafia has it all - wonderful graphics, engaging story, interesting missions, action, even music. But there are a few pitfalls that turn it from a great game into a so-so game.
First, even though I did not really mind all the driving, most of it bears absolutely no purpose. The racing mission was absurd. If I wanted to race sports cars I would've bought a racing game. C'mon, people, NOBODY liked that mission! What was the point of it? But I stuck with it, forgiving them for the obviously annoying and pointless part, yet it never really got better. If anything, it got worse.
While I can see they've tried to make many aspects of the game ultra-realistic, it's really anything but. Here are some points about that:
Point 1: I understand that the vigilant cops and traffic violations were put into the game to make it seem more realistic. But how come that running people over or bumping into other cars leaves the cops indifferent?
Point 2: The police cars are the fastest cars in the game. No matter what car you're driving, even a race car, they WILL catch up to you and arrest you. Yet when later in the game you get to drive a police car, the other police cars are STILL faster than you. Makes any sense? To me neither.
Point 3. The game is happening in the 1930s. How in the world would a cop measure your speed? How could a cop walking on the sidewalk know what the speed of your car is? Yet they all stop you, cops in cars AND cops on the sidewalk.
Point 4. The cops only seem to be after YOU. Whenever you have to chase after someone in your car, of course you have to speed if you want to catch up with them. Yet if you do the cops will run you off the road and arrest you for speeding. Never the other guy. Same goes for the ""hide weapon"" feature. If the cops spot you carrying a gun they will arrest you, yet there is one mission where you start with the gun in your hand. The sequence loads, you don't even have a chance to hide your weapon, and immediately the cops spot you. Forget trying to get away. The only way to finish either mission is to pray there are no cops around when the mission starts.
Point 5: If you reload while your gun still has bullets in it, you lose those bullets. Only a fool would discard their half-used magazine in real life. In fact, in the military they encourage you to reload as often as possible, because this way there's less chance to run into an empty magazine.
Another thing that might not be a problem for other games but is a huge one for Mafia is that it's a very linear game. It gives you very little room for creativity. In one of the first missions you have to collect money from a gas station and then carchase and kill the guy that stole the money. Before going into the gas station I shot the tires on the car, just in case. But when the very nest sequence loaded the car was driving just fine. The game consistently points you in the right direction, and there are no rewards for exploring on your own or deviating from the main plotline (unlike in games like Morrowind, in which you can progress any which way you want).
And of course, the most frustrating aspect of the game is your inability to save games. Honestly, I can't comprehend why game developers do that. Is it so difficult to put in a savegame feature? Mafia is not simply a game where you cannot save, it's an _extremely difficult_ game where you can't save. Who wants to spend two hours going through the same mission over and over again? Did I mention that the conversations written into the missions repeat as well, and that you cannot skip them? After spending 2,5 hours on one of such missions only to get killed in the last two minutes of it and have to start all over again, I finally gave up. Sure I want a game that's challenge (I play all my games on ""hard"" or ""realistic"" difficulty setting), but I don't want a game that's a total frustration roller-coaster.
Mafia could have been a real gem. It could have easily been an epic classic of the gaming world if it wasn't for the aforementioned downsides.",2.0
"Tropico is a decent simulation of what it takes to successfully run a country.
The ease of use and learning is great.
The idea of becoming a semi-modern Caribbean Dictator was a nice change from the existing games available when this game came out, however, the game play is not very good. The options are EXTREMELY limited. You have roughly 10 political options to choose from, and essentially your only other choice is building. The buildings are nothing special, and the game clock moves too fast, even on the slowest setting.
Maybe the best modern political simulation, but you'd still be better off buying AOE or Civilization.",2.0
"This city building idea certainly has significant visual qualities, there's just too many over sights that make this game difficult to get into. First of all, it move very slowly. I run a P3 with 550 mhz with all the graphics rendering and it is very choppy. Another major dissapointment is that you don't have control as to the direction to place most of your buildings. I personally like city building games to create a certain aesthetic feel.
This engine might have worked just fine for Railroad Tycoon II, but that game didn't involve human characters. Lack of improvement to there existing engine causes the game to move too slowly for satisfying play.
Time moves fast, but the people move slow. Maybe they wanted to capture the feel of real Carribean life, unfortunately it's tough to get things done. That may not be a negative for some people.
The graphics are fantastic, the music is great and the characters are interesting. I still like to play the game, but probably not for long. I just can't get over how slow it is!",2.0
"How a great concept went this bad is unbelievable.  The interface is awkward.  The statistics are presented in such a way that you are never quite sure what exactly is going on.  There is no easy way to change anything, you must hunt around the screen to find anything, for all the micro managers out there it might be worth trying.  Soundtrack is good for the first game or so then it must be turned off or a headache will occur.  The manual is the type that requires the purchase of an ""Official Strategy Guide.""  There are no real explainations in the manual at all.  The final problem is the appearance, the graphics were great in Railroad Tycoon II (Tropico uses the same ""Engine"")because there you really didn't have to hunt around the screen to play the game, there was always a menu choice.  In Tropico the muddy graphics muddle the mix and just make it frustrating to have to click on the smallest building to change its settings.  Wait two weeks it will be in the bargain bin.",2.0
"I love the game when I get to the snowboarding parts, but its way too much work getting to ride. The graphics are really sweet. I love the way snow gets kicked up into the camera when you land, but I don't know if I can get over the glaringly annoying features of this game:
 1) I feel like I am playing one of those Barbie dress-up games when I get to buy coats, pants, and goggles, give me a break. New equipment such as boards and bindings make sense, but jackets?!?!
2) Too much menu wrangling to get to the actual game play. If I lose a competition, there is no retry button. You have to go back to the lodge and walk over to the cheesy box head guy and enter all over again. Then at the end of the run you have to choose between replay and proceed, with the default always being proceed. Its just a major hassle. They should learn from Tony Hawk. They have it down.
3) Too much loading, especially in multiplayer session stuff. Nobody likes spending more time loading than playing.
4) Not enough thought put into the session competitions. For instance, there is one race with rails and windy, narrow lanes that have huge drop-offs on either side, if you fall off either side, you lose. It ends rather abrubtly this way, right before either player can get into it. Why not just send the rider back to the beginning of the course?",2.0

"Seriously, does there have to be a command for everything. I mean you have to have a list of comands sitting right beside your keyboard if you are to have any success, and to make things worse the default commands go against the standard configuration of every shooter that has ever existed. If you to have any success it is required that you map it out yourself. Something as simple as picking up a dropped gun requires the use of space bar, one, and then i for inventory, and while being shot at, you slowly steal the ammo from the dead guy.

"This cable hardly has any improvement over the Sony cable that comes with the PSX and the PS2. If not demagnatized it creates crazy interferance and sends things that look like vertical damper wires all over the screen.  You're much better off with a Sony S-Video cable, a Monster Gamelink S-Video cable, or Interact's higher quality cable.  I personally suggest Interacts better one because it offers better quality at a lower cost than Monsters.  The cables themselves are thin and badly shielded, thus the audio performance is also sub par.  The only advantage is the ability to un-join the cables, so you can send the audio to your stereo, and the video to your TV.

"Let's just start by saying I am a Trekkie at heart.  That said, this game makes me embarrassed to admit to loving Star Trek.  This game takes place during the Deep Space 9 Star Trek series and, much like the series it is based on, is absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to Star Trek.  The plot is weak, the voice acting is paper thin, the gameplay is worse than a second grade play, and the game suffers from what I call ""too much, too soon"" syndrome.  What I mean by that last part is it attempts to ""drawn"" you in Star Trek by throwing far too much at you at once.  It doesn't even get the conventions of its genre right.  I don't really remember much about it in detail, but I do remember this piece of junk left me cold after playing for just the first 2 or 3 levels.  I regret playing it and owning it to this day.

"After waiting so long I finally received my copy of Dominion Wars. I am writing this short review because many of our fleet members want my opinion the game.  This ""short"" review will cover the Graphics,  Interface, Concepts, and stability.
Graphics:
Think of this game as a movie with great special effects.  Like everyone else, I like to go to the movies; however, I prefer to see films with great stories and lest special effects.  Too many producers spend millions and millions of dollars on the special effects and spend only a few thousand dollars on story development.  These types of movies usually have no depth and never wins an oscar.  Such is case with Dominion Wars, the graphics are the best but the games itself lack depth.  The graphics are very sharp and clear - all StarTrek games should have graphics like this.
Interface.
It is a pleasure to be able to rotate the camera at any point around the ships and to view all ships in detail.  The interface to the game is not that bad - in fact,  it's good.  The interface is not as detailed as the standard set by StarFleet Command - you do not have control of all aspects of the ships, but it does provide a true feel of the LCARS system which is the Next Generation standard interface.  Unlike Klingon Academy, you can not truly control  your ships.  At best, you can issue very ""General"" orders of when and where to attack. The Mini Map looks nice, but is hard to manage if your ships are not together.  Is it also difficult to know the attack vector of the enemy  ships;  they sometimes come out of no where and start attacking - You would think doing a sensor sweep would help but that does not always work.  This would not be a problem if the Dominion uses cloak ships, unfortunately that is not the case.
Concepts.
This is not Klingon Academy or Starfleet Command - it is not a star ship simulation game! It is a strategy game - That's the bottom line.  You must spend more time planning your strategy before each mission in order to win.  If you like Starfleet Command or Klingon Academy because of there great detail, stay away from this game you are not going to find that in Dominion Wars.  If you like the ability to ""Generally"" control a fleet of ships like  in a game called Startrek Armada, then you will like Dominion Wars.  You will also like the ability to choose captains and special devices for each ship, if you can afford them.
Stability.
I began to like this game a lot...... then it began to crash on me; forcing me to reboot my computer.  I then began to hate the game!  I  downloaded the latest patch so that game crashes a lot less.  I would prefer for Gismo Games to release the game 5 months late and have a stable product than to release an unfinished product to the public!  I have to literally save the game in the middle of the action so that the next time is crashes  I would not have to do the mission over.  Needless to say....this is a real pain.
In short, this could have been a great game but is it not because of the lack of thought, depth and stability.  Game development companies really need to spend serious time with people who actually play these types of games so that they could get an idea of what the public is look for.  Dominion War has proven that they do not have a clue.  We have been disappointed with so many startrek titles.  Only Klingon Academy and Star Fleet Command Version 1 did a good job a representing the Startrek universe.
I give it 2 stars.

"....The interface is extremely confusing, the view is always from the outside of the ship, the movements are again 2 dimensional, and to top it off, there are no instructions with it. When you finally figure out how to make your ship do anything there is no room for thinking or tactics, just click ""attack"" and it gors through it's motions while you sit back and wonder if you're going to win or not. All in all, not well thought out, challenging, or fun. Now I have to countdown again for ""Bridge Commander"" to come out.",2.0
"Contrary to popular belief, this title is not part of the Civilization series. This is Activision's attempt at a Civ clone. In some areas it succeeds, but in most it fails. This game had no affiliation with Sid Meier, creator of CivI and II (the latter arguably the best pc strategy game ever).
Pros:
Good government selection. Some new governments are included, like Fascism, Technocracy, Theocracy, Ecology, Corporate Republic, etc.
Armies and Fleets. In CivII a stack of units could be killed in what attack. This is not so.
Automated Improvements. The government automatically does terrain improvements.
Diplomacy and Trade: Both are well planned and fairly extensive.
Cons:
Diplomacy and Trade: Neither are used to their full extent, and if you try, other civilizations refuse. There's all types of stuff, like trade embargoes, etc, but the AI never does them.
Civilizations: Over 30 Civs to choose from, but there's really no difference in between them. Also, whenever I play, I'm always up against the same Civs: French, British, German, Irish, Scottish, American, and Native Americans. That gets boring very fast.
Slow: The interface is slow, even on a 128MB Ram P3 500mhz machine.
Scenarios: Only 4 of them, and none are any good.
NO CUSTOMIZATION OF UNITS OR CIVS: In Civ2 anyone could make their own units, terrains, technologies, scenarios, maps, etc. You can't do any of this in CTP2.
Conclusion: Civ3 should be out in the US within 2 months, it's coming to Mac, and to Europe. Civ3 has Sid Meier working on it. Civ3 has elaborate diplomacy and trade. Civ3 has culture points, great military leaders, many unit animations, civ specific units, new paths to victory, total customization of units, civs, techs, maps, etc, has better graphics, more realistic, more units, will ship with 12 scenarios, and so much more. The bottom line: save your cash for Civ3, it's just months away.",2.0
"hi
i bought this game hoping for a really improved civ2 type of game. I have to be honest the AI of your passive computer opponents is absolutely horrible. Once you fortify your cites the computer opponents just lay back and wait for you to attack and that's it. The diplomacy in the game has many options but they usually have the same pat answers for everything. activision has promised some text to come out on how to tweak the ai but no mention of a patch for this.
can't recommend this game. try alpha centauri instead.

"This would be an EXCELLENT game if they'd managed to ship a light gun with a scope on it with the product.
Instead...I think it's best played at the arcade.",2.0
"Silent Scope is a good port of the arcade game, but lacks the thing that made Silent Scope so fun, the gun.  This aside the graphics aren't very good (even for a launch title) in the Story mode.  The sound should be turned off or replaced by a CD of your choice.  All this wouldn't matter is the ""FUN"" was there. but it's not.  It's difficult to target moving objects with the analog stick and the control pad is too jumpy.  The stick doesn't let you move the scope fast enough when you get to the bosses.  There are too many enemies to deal with.  It gets frustrating.  The training mode is more fun to me than the story mode.  If you like shooting games rent it, but if you're looking for an introduction to the genre I'd choose another.",2.0
"what happens when you take a successful arcade game and translate it to a console? success right? WRONG- in this case that is. This game was great in the arcade due to the inovative use of a rifle and scope. But when you take that away all you have is a very bad ""Area 51""-esque game. This game should have never been translated to ANY console and you will notice this quickly after playing for a minute or two. The controls are sluggish and just like any other shooting game that doesn't have a gun peripherial, it gets boring FAST. Only get this game if it is the only game you can find when you are buying a PS2.",2.0

Luckily I was able to get up and go to a retro gaming store and buy one from them(which is generally a better option since they test everything). I'm not going to be one of those people who say don't buy it, because there's not really enough reviews to know if I just got the unlucky one. And honestly, they did ship it out real fast(that's why they got an extra star),but just giving a heads up I got a broken one.",2.0

"when you start playing you start yawning.
The problem with games with pre-rendered backgrounds is that it completely ruins the pacing of an action game. If you look at any action film these days the camera and the elements being filmed all move.
This kind of cinematorgraphy goes back to the days of film before D. W. Griffith. Ie set the camera down and let the actor run around until he leaves the room. Then set the camera down in a new location and repeat.
If you like games like Resident Evil or Fear Effect this game is for you. Also if you like solving awkward puzzles, this game is for you. Any time one has to put an awkward puzzle into a game to mix up the game play means that one is totally out of ideas for the game. Like still cameras, awkward puzzles break the pacing of the game.",2.0
"Extremely cheap AV cord here. It worked to replace our totally broken cord, but it got damaged quickly. One of the sides of the part you insert into the Playstation cracked and bent, making the device very loose in the console. The other side quickly followed, and soon after, the sides of the plastic insert just broke off. This caused the device to fall out when the console was moved even a little. It also resulted in only one speaker side working because the device no longer fit into the console and it messed up the sound. We ended up having to prop up the device by inserting a video game case under it.",2.0

"I bought this at the store hoping it would solve the problem of running my PS2 through my VCR (my TV doesn't have audio/video inputs while my VCR does).  Playing DVDs through the VCR degrades the picture, as I'm sure most of you know.  After hooking up the adapter, I noticed that it did a good job with the picture, but the audio was horrible.  So I went out yesterday and bought a Sony adapter (originally made for the first Playstation, but compatible with the PS2), and all my troubles seem to be over.  Skip out on this one.  There are better adapters out there.",2.0

"After reading some of the Hornblower, Lewrie, and Blothio books, I was really craving something like this. Unfortunatly the game has so many bugs and the documentation on how to play is so bad, I ended up wasting what free time I had frustrated over the whole thing.
Since the documentation was so bad, once I got the game somewhat stable, I thought purchasing the strategy guide for the game would help. It didn't. The guide was so full of pictures of ships and useless data that for my $20 I only received about 6 pages of actual strategy buried in all the ""life of a sailor"" garbage. In a strategy guide I would expect a lot more strategy hints and tips. Perhaps I'll find a book on ship tactics that I can apply.",2.0
"If you absolutely love naval warfare circa 1800, then this game should be tolerable. However, if you like a game with pacing, then skip this turkey by. Yes, it does have lovely graphics and the attention to detail is admirable. But it all boils down to maneuvering your ship(s), firing your cannons, then waaaaaaaiting for the reload so you can fire another volley. That's the whole game. One-on-one battles are decent to kill 15-25 minutes, but multi-ship battles are nearly impossible to manage.
Summary: buy this game if you LOVE naval warfare from 1775-1815, otherwise, skip this.",2.0
"Age of Sail 2 has some of the best graphics I've seen in any genre of computer games.  It's too bad that the graphics are the only good thing.
The gameplay is horrible.  All you do is keep clicking on a ship to shoot at it until it sinks.  It's virtually impossible to play when you're expected to control a whole armada.
My suggestion is to spend your money on another game.",2.0

The game has an excellent story line...too bad they ruined it by getting off the point, non clear directions, and well whoever made this game needs help concentrating! well the graphics are OK....not anything good, but bearable although a few times I couldn't tell land from water and died. then there is the camera (viewing) is way too weird! I mean half the time I couldn't see where I was going! but the worst part of this game was the errors!... this happened several other places also! and if you didn't save your game you lose everything! one other thing was some of the rides like the rollercoaster (if you call it that) will make you sick to your stomach...on the rollercoaster all you are doing is spinning very very fast. and they set it up so it appears on the screen that you are sitting on the seat ...still get headaches from just the thought of it. if you want to try the game be sure to rent it first!!! and make sure you get pretty far in the game (past the first mask) because that is where the trouble starts.",2.0
Beware everyone this game is extremely addicting at one point in my life it was taking up almost all of my leisure time. I would have gave it one star because of its extreme ability to make people lose their lives over this game but its such a fun game I had to give it 2.,2.0
"I am extremeley disappointed with this game because it will NOT run on Windows 2000 or higher.  If you have Windows 95/98, this looks like it could be a really great game.  I was really looking forward to playing it.  But I spent 2 weeks dealing with techsupport at Electronic Arts and Microsoft, and can't get it to run.  I wish EA would stop making their games only compatible with Win 95/98.  They said it MIGHT run on XP, but I'm not about to go buy it just to play a game.  Don't get any of the other expansion packs either if you have windows 2000, apparently NONE of them are compatible.",2.0
"The game play is clumsy.  For example, if your units are all bunched together, trying to select a specific brigade is difficult.  You may click on a unit of that brigade, but for some reason, it doesn't select the brigade.  Secondly, selecting a brigade commander is supposed to allow you to move all units in that brigade at once.  That works - except your brigade commander doesn't have the option to move your units 'double quick', so you end up needing to move each brigade separately if you want them to get to their destination quickly.

The historic accuracy of the game might be there as far as the landscape and units available, but as far as how the units were deployed, it fails miserably.  For example, in the pickett's charge scenario, the confederacy starts  very close to the union and the union army is not dug in (what happened to the stone wall that protected the union forces which Longstreet used as one of his main reasons not to attack? He reminded Lee that the confederates had one a battle in the past because they were protected by a similar wall).  Even in the intro, it says the confederacy needs to march 1 mile to reach the union (this is false - in reality they had to march 2 miles).  In the real battle, the confederacy were slaughtered long before they reached the union - part way along the march, they had to get over a fence, which bunched up their forces and made them especially vulnerable to union cannon - none of this is reflected in the game.

By distorting such crucial strategic points, they can not hope to claim that this in anyway puts you in a true historic battle.  One may dismiss these descrepencies, but these strategic points are exactly why one side or the other succeeds.

Speaking of cannon, there is very little variety - cannon at the time, if they did any research for this game, would show everything from grapeshot to cannister.  The game doesn't offer any options for what to fire.

I don't understand these other reviews that give so many stars to the game.  Its clumsy and historically inaccurate.  Maybe the other reviewers are so desperate to finally have someone pay attention to their hobby by making a civil war game that they are incapable of  reviewing it critically.",2.0
"Using a 466 with 128 ram, this game puts one to sleep between shots. I loved the '99 version, but was extremely disappointed when I saw how slow play was on the 2001. I also found many of the graphics to be too dark on certain holes and courses.",2.0
"I enjoyed playing the older version of the Sims, I bought the 2nd new version a few weeks ago and was overwhelmed at 1st.  The Sims eatting noise  is very annoying, though I could have turned off the sound in the game.  Another gripe is it's more eye candy, it does teach you a person sometimes  how to make friends and such.  But with eye candy of new job skins, it's  like a race to see what they look like.  The good points is more  neighborhoods to build more Sim houses, the genie lamp does help and the  crystal ball does give you a few more points for each trait.  The buidling  of the pool is a semi-bad thing, if a Sim gets lonely in the red bar zone,  I tell them to call on of their friends, they do and than they head to the  pool and spend all day while thier poor friend is still waiting by the  front door. You need so many pool ladders, and they still do not climb out  to meet a friend or even get to the car pool.  The other items are great,  the machine shop and chem-lab and such.  Though I agree with some other  reviews, just download the items to your 1st Sim game.  I would give it  more stars, but it seems the game get's to be a memory hog on the hard  drive.  Making me take out some of my other favorite games.",2.0
"[This review is based on the console edition of the game that is packaged with the sequel Alice: Madness Returns.]

When American McGee's Alice first came out, critics considered the game to be possibly the best-looking of the year. They praised the breath-takingly gorgeous visuals, saying the game looks so fantastic that you'll trudge through the mind-numbingly dull gameplay just to see what the next area will look like.

Unfortunately, ten years later the once innovative visuals now look quite dated, leaving the focus now on the aforementioned mediocre gameplay. The result is a game that, honestly, isn't very fun to play. The unique world makes for an enjoyable experience for awhile (if you can look past grating dialogue that seems very pleased with itself, mistakingly believing itself to be more clever than it is -- ""entering the skool requires a leap in logic""? No, it only required pressing A to jump into a window, no logic involved!), but after the first few hours it becomes so tedious and dull that there really doesn't seem any reason to continue playing.

Fortunately, it comes free in new copies of Alice: Madness Returns, so you won't be wasting any money on it (only your time). However, if you bought a used copy or rented it, and are wondering if the original game is worth the extra $10? I would advise against it.",2.0
"The premise of ""Alice""'s plotline will certainly offend the sensibilities of die-hard Lewis Carroll fans; the Alice of American McGee is a delusional mental patient haunted by the fiery death of her family for which she blames herself.  If you can accept that this is not meant to be an accurate representation of Carroll's vision and is instead a derivative work, it's a deliciously twisted and original take on the whole Wonderland universe.
While the graphics are truly eye candy, the music appropriately creepy and complex, and the Quake III engine impressive, a game with this much plot potential is rendered flat and uninvolving by the strictly linear progression of the story line. Even if taken as a straight first-person shooter, the game still does not vary much or require significant strategy to progress.  I also found Alice's dependence on the jump-but-don't-fall-off hurdle to be overused and annoying; it certainly was not so heavily depended on in any Quake incarnation and did not need to be Alice's only substantial challenge.
It seems as if ""Alice"" tried to merge the fast-paced action of a first-person shooter and the compelling plot of an RPG with stunning visual and auditory embellishments, but fell far short of the engrossing experience that a game such as Half-Life accomplished.",2.0
"Grandia II is a beautiful game - in much the same way Skies of Arcadia is.  Where it lags behind Skies is in the depth and breadth department.  Skies is simply a much larger game with much more detail.  While Grandia's playfield is a 3D environment - the camera view is eternally fixed above head.  You are never given the option to sweep in and take a closer look - which is a shame - because you wind up missing many of the artistic details in the game.

The battle system is really fun.  Slick menus and interfaces remind me of a fast paced action fighting game.  The battle system is flexible enough to even allow for some strategy and planning.  Unfortunately the battle system casts light on another of Grandia's shortcomings - lack of compelling monsters.  Indeed the monsters are severely lacking in originality in this game - more so than almost any other RPG I've played.

Like most Japanese Role Playing Games the plot is hopelessly clueless and vague.  If you've just come from playing AD&D based RPG's on the computer (such as Baldur's Gate) you'll be repulsed by this game linear play and murky story line.

Grandia II is a pretty game with a descent musical score and the combat system is entertaining.  Sadly the game is not challenging and often I found myself seeking the next save point because the game routinely bored me....",2.0

"Beautiful graphics wasted on what is fundamentally a Nintendo game from the early 90's: all you do is run, jump, get power-ups, kill monsters. I appreciated the concept, the insanity and twisted dark world these folks (EA) have created, but their talent would have been better applied to a less linear, more intelligent gameplay design.",2.0
"While the thought of playing a psychopathic twisted horror version of Alice in WOnderland appealed to me at first, it quickly became tiresome.  Surely the original story is twisted and psychopathic enough and this version tries very hard to disturb players but it's plot just goes nowhere.
When I loaded up this game I expected some sort of stunning adventure, only to be greeted by what seemed to be a first-person action game, such as Thief or Unreal...but no...it wasn't that either. It was 3rd person in the style of Tomb Raider.
As I started meeting NPCs I realized where I've seen this interface before:games like Banjo Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, Zelda and other N64 and Playstation platform adventure games...which is just what Alice is...a spooky platform game.
Platform games being what they are, they are obsessed with coming up the most difficult way for the player to jump from point a to point b so that you can then get on with the story. After the 23rd time of falling off the checkerboard, you finally  make it and are allowed to proceed with the story. But what story? There isn't a very strong one. You are just lead by the nose and it isn't even very interesting. Just lots of fighting cards and flying spectre things.
I must admit this game IS indeed visually stunning. I absolutely love the cheshire cat. He floats in and ouut of the game quite eerily and his voice is perfect.  The scenery and odd backgrounds of vortexes, huge stacks of books, and such are used to try and make the player a bit uncomfortable or spooked and yes they do their job...but in the process, though, we are not given anything interesting or challenging to do except for jumping from point a to point b 23 times.
I was very disappointed with the ""puzzles"" presented. Nothing was really a challenge but merely an entrance to the next test of patience.
To give the game credit, the graphics are impeccable, the gameplay (running, jumping, etc) is flawless and easy to pick up, and the mechanics of the game flow very smoothly. It's just a pity that the creator saved all the fun for himself.",2.0
"I must say out of all the YDKJ games I've played, (1, 2, 3, the ride, sports, and this) this one is the worst. I found it both very slow paced and boring.

"When I first heard of this game, I was looking forward to it.  By the time I had played it, I was really disappointed.  The AI is horrible, and there are glitches all over.

American McGee should have stuck with level design, he's obviously way over his head here.",2.0
"There is no dought in my mind that South Peak rushed to get this game out before this Christmas. Play it, you will see. The graphics are somewhat better then Racing for Home, but the controls of the cars are worse.

In my own opinion, Racing for Home is much better.",2.0
"Basically this is the same game as last year's Madden with newer rosters,  but still not completely up to date.  Slightly better graphics, but there  seem to be some bugs like: on punt returns the AI for your blockers getting  in front of you is TERRIBLE...occational problems when saving/loading a  game...kicking a FG/PAT takes WAY too long for the kicker to get set  up...the franchise mode isin't as nice as last years game (not as easy to  navigate, still haven't found out how to sign free agents mid-season).  In  the end, if you're a die hard fan like me you'll enjoy the game (once EA  fixes the bugs), otherwise look elsewhere.",2.0
"This game stinks...The graphics are terrible, choppy and simple, even when they are all actived.  The play selection is weak.  I had a very hard time adjusting my controler settings to be compatible with Madden's configs.

"I enjoy animals, and this game makes great use of them.

However, I have found this game to be a bit lacking in the entertainment department, and the creatures in the beginning are quite strange, to say the least (a cow...?).

I want to like this, but I'm sorry EA Games, I just can't.",2.0
"Black and white is a very appropriate name for this game.  Some parts are really good, then they become repetitive and boring, and you soon realize that you just wasted your time.  I usually don't rate games low, so when I do it says something about the game.  I am almost mad at gamespot and other review sites, for once, for giving a game--that didn't deserve it--such a high score.  If you want to get a couple hours of fun out of a game then go ahead and buy this, but I would advise you save your money and go buy a better game.

The gameplay for this game is fun for around 4 hours, then you get to the 3rd  level--oh and just so you know there are only 5 'levels' in the entire game--the game breaks down.  They take away your pet, who may I say is pretty stupid and just copies what you are doing, albeit in a very inconsistent manner and half the time just ends up doing more harm than good.  Once your pet is taken away and you start with such a small village it is pitiful, you then come to realize how much time of your life you just wasted.  The villagers in this game are mindless, they can't even make babies without you telling them to and when you do they always over breed.  Also it is almost impossible to be a good god in this game, my people would always keep dying and they were too stupid to even farm right.  The list of annoyances goes on, this is a lame attempt at being an RTS and it ends up falling flat on its face.

The graphics, for the time, were good, though the people in the game did look slightly odd.  Also, I don't know if it was my computer or the game, when you zoom into things, like mountains, they start to mold and change shape as you get closer, a very ugly effect that I never got used to.  Other than that most of the spells worked fine and looked pretty good; though nothing was spectacular, it was solid nonetheless.

The sound in this game is okay, though the first time one of your villagers die and you hear the ""deeeaaatthhh"" voice, it will take you a while to figure out what it is trying to tell you or whether it is another god speaking (which would make it much more creepy).  The sounds for the people are really annoying and I would rather have text than hear them talk, wait till you hear (or don't hear) the fake Irish accents, they are a pain as is the rest of the voice-over.  Other than that the sound is solid, with the different spells having nice sounds to them, from the rain to the fireball, that help differentiate one from the other.

Overall this game will not give you any lasting value, unless you find this sort of cheap imitation of the RTS formula--with a tacked on pet simulator--enjoyable, then you might have some fun.  Lionhead is a company that promises and doesn't deliver; I hope in their next outings that they learn to make a great game, then praise it.",2.0
"I purchased Black and White on the advice of a friend and was told about the fun aspects of training a pet. After playing for several hours I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.

While the game's graphics were good, and I had fun for about an hour playing around with my pet and the world, there was little to keep my interest. I quickly moved onto other games and forget that I had purchased Black and White. For me, there was little substance and little to get me ""hooked"".

While I do not deny that there is a market for games like Black and White, I do believe that this market demands more challenging and compelling products.

If you make it past an hour, tasks become tedious, lifeless and dull.",2.0
"Black & White in theory sounds like a really fun game and for some I guess it is.  I found the game so tedius, repititious and devoid of fun that I never even bothered to finish the first level.  The idea of the creature is interesting and the AI on it is impressive but that in itself could not hold the game together.  The controls are awful.  It is interesting that the developers spent so much time on the ""feel"" of the game and making it so it was like no other that it seems that they didn't stop to think at the cumbersomeness an impracticality of the vast array of controls.  Another factor to this game is that if you are going to stick it out and play the entire thing you will definately need time for it takes for what seems an eternity to complete some of the tasks of the game.  All in all, this game was not for me but I could see the ultimate attraction and some people who are willing to stick it out might enjoy it.",2.0
"Very Very interesting idea and one of the buggiest games I've ever played. The auto-save feature is necessary because of all of the crashes BUT after you've been playing awhile the auto-save can take up to several minutes per save, which can be very annoying when you are right in the middle of something interesting and then, bang, auto-save, go take a nap and come back. After looking at Lionhead's site on this software and seeing some of their comments about Quality Assurance (ie: they basically seem to think that it wouldn't be necessary if EA didn't make them do it), I know that I will not be paying full price for any more Lionhead games until they fire whoever is in charge of QA and actually put in place a real QA process. The idea is VERY interesting and that's why they get some points for originality (or at least an original spin on the populas model of games). But they really need a debugger. Quite frankly I'd be happy to play a FUN game with less then state of the art technology, if it is stable and fun. Bells and whistles are great but I'm looking to have fun not get frustrated. Also, the micromanagement required to keep your people alive is very excessive. It takes alot away from the fun of the game. ...
Buy The Longest Journey instead, if you are looking for a great (stable and visually appealing) game at an excellent price!",2.0
"This game recieved a colossal amount of hype, and from all the hyperbole, was destined to be as large of a step forward in gaming as Populous, also created by Peter Molyneaux.

I am a huge fan of open-architecture games. I am very excited about AI in gaming on a philosophical level. I was profoundly disappointed.
It is true, my animal learned. And my animal seemed to think. But, and this is the crux of it, my animal was EXTREMELY BORING.
city maintenance was the essence of tedium. picking up trees one by one and placing them into the lumber depot = not fun. Teaching my pet to do this for me = not fun. Fighting other creatures = not fun.
Additionally, encountering the level that reverese ALL THE TRAINING YOU HAVE DONE TO YOUR CREATURE = wiping it off my computer. I have heard that there was a patch to remedy that particular insult to injury, but I do not care. My creature was already damaged goods.

"...but even my optimism couldn't help me on this one. I was really excited about getting this game, I'd heard some good things about it here and there with the innovative AI and all, but I wasn't really that impressed.
Of course there are good things about this game. I love the fact that you can basically do what you want, there's no set-in-stone mission at all times. Now this isn't true throughout the whole game, but at least in the beginning they let you explore and play around.
Its a very challenging game at times. This is both good and bad. The worst part, I think of the whole game is the fact that you're supposed to be playing God, as a human being, but you're expected to be an actual god! I'm not omnipresent and I can't be in 18 different places at once. If I'm throwing wood and food miracles at my greedy worshippers and villagers who are constantly in need of something, then I miss my creature over behind a hut eating a villager and I don't punish him, he'll just keep doing it.
This game is like trying to raise quintuplets while housebreaking a puppy. Its crazy. Then they expect you to take over and manage more villages and get more creatures.
Don't get me wrong, I'm always up for a good challenge, but this game gets so challenging, its broken past the fun barrier.",2.0
"At first glance, Blacka and White looks like the everything-killer.  The graphics and sound will crash your jaw through the floor.  Creature interaction is wonderfully entertaining and challenging.  The story is good and the interface is ingenious.
Unfortunately, this all wears off after about 3 hours.  You will soon discover that the game simply isn't fun.  You are forced to manage your whiny villagers endlessly and unless you train your creature just right, you will be picking up after it's obnoxious little self for the majority of the time.
All in all; a great start trips on it's own AI-encoded toe and falls crashing to the ground",2.0
"Ok, I read the reviews here and on game sites for this game.  It sounds like fun, but my god could it be any harder to play?  I gave up on this game due to its overly hard to use interface and overly annoying tutorial!
I am they type of gamer that likes to get to the action not watch 20 minutes of video about the game.  Of course the first time I ran the game it crashed luckly I am running Windows XP so I didn't need to reboot.
To do simple things in this game it takes great skill and the learning curve is a pain.  Having to remember where eveything is, becuase damned if I can fine a small map to show important things like Age of Empires has.
The concept of the game is really cool, however attempting to play it well that is another story all together.",2.0
"Great concept, poor delivery.  Once again it seems a game maker just can't seem to finish a game putting it on the market.  Yo! Game maker, Test you code and them release the game.  Don't unload some piece of junk that needs a mondo 90meg patch before it even begins to resemble a final product.  If this game had been tested, debugged, and made playable before it was put on the shelf I probably would have given it 4 out of five.  Sorry but black and white has struck out.
Cheers.",2.0
"I was excited about B&W in concept, and started out with great intentions of enjoying it. It is beautiful! However, I quickly learned that my creature was obsessed with its own [bathroom] habits . . . that I really hated my obnoxious ""good"" creature . . . that the wood'n'food were more arbitrary than not . . . and that it is almost impossible to get some of what are supposed to be simple puzzles (the early ones) to stay solved.
I'm disappointed and don't recommend this game.",2.0
"First of all let me begin by saying that anyone who has not played this game should not be saying that it is a five star game because the PACKAGE looks cool, or they THINK its gonna be good. (which was the case in several reviews).
As far as the actual game itself. I must admit i was very excited to get this game, because the fact was that the idea and the hype about the game were out outstanding, and appealed to me. Hence i got the game.
At first it sucks you in and is very fun to play moving around your island and being able to control everything down to the locations of flora. The game even tells you you can move the game along at your own pace, (not necessarliy true).
But very shortly you hit a wall. You realize that the game is more tedious than fun. My creature spent more time defecating in my village, than helping my villagers with their needs. Not to mention he was fond of munching on them even after the game had said he would do that sort of thing anymore.(because of my training, which obviously was grossly ineffective).
I spent more time throwing trees into the store then anything else. Not to mention the irritating villagers with their ""we need food"", ""we need....: etc. i understand that this information needs to be communicated between a deity and his people, but in this game it gets repetitive and annoying.
I did give the game two stars though. Like some other reviewers i think the graphics are outstanding, the fact that you can zoom out to an arial shot of the island or down to the snout of a pig is very nice. Also the ""defecating creature"" was amusing the first time i witnessed it going behind a tree. but thats it, just the first time, not the the first 50 times.
Overall, my opinion, don't get this game. And if you don't trust my review to be accurate, save yourself some $$ and wait till the price goes down.",2.0
"Way too much micromanagement, and inside tricks you have to learn about via the internet or a strategy guide. It does have great graphics, and is interesting to look at. I personally don't agree with their interface choice when casting 'miracles' which require you to draw out a symbol with your mouse - just give us a key, or a key that pulls up a menu.",2.0
"Enough has already been said of the creature avatars in this game. Their AI is fantastic and they are truly fun to play with. Once past that, however, one realizes that there isn't much else to this game. Movement is awkward and difficult, the cities are unmanageable, the citizens whine constantly and irritatingly about things that they should be taking care of themselves and the missions are poorly designed. One mission simply requires you to follow a monk to his secret prayer spot by staying behind him as he walks. This is a mission that seems desinged to capitalize on the challenge presented by the horrifically innacurrate movement controls. In another mission some of your people are kidnapped by barbarians who demand animals as a ransom so they can start a circus (?!?) And where does one find folk with the unmitigated gall to make ransom demands to a very visible deity and not expect to be smited for it? Yet another mission has a pied piper figure leading away the village children. For some undisclosed reason, you can't simply pick this problem person up and toss him far out to sea; you have to have your creature capture him. Great ideas, poor execution. But did I mention that the creatures are fun?",2.0
"Short and simple, folks:  It's a nice experiment- a nice buncha folks tossing their creative effluvia into the gaming market, but it just doesn't cut the mustard...  Far from being the ultimate ""god game"", it's a standard RTS pain-in-the arse, with your good guys always wailing for stuff you cannot provide, and ""bad-guy"" vilages that you have to provide these same commidities to, in order to impress, and in turn, make ""good villages"".  The documentation is almost comically inept and insufficient, the system requirements for optimal play are absurd (they say they created the game on 800 MHZ comps, but I SERIOUSLY doubt it), and in the end, you can't help but feel let down.
It's a GREAT step in the right direction, but there are better games out today that make use of the full 3d format, and are far more entertaining and system-friendly.
Buy it if you want a piece of gaming history- a relic- a laughable trinket that was left by the wayside during a pivotal epoch in game development.  On the other hand, if you want something FUN, there are dozens of titles that will fulfill your needs, and not leave your system frozen, and your mind numb with boredom.
  Innovation will only carry you so far, Peter M...  Ya gotta DO something with it...",2.0
"I've had this game for a few months now. At first I loved it. Learning about each individual element of the game (e.g., the miracles, the creature, the villagers, the islands, the opposing gods) was fun and promised for exciting gameplay. Unfortunately, knitting all of the elements together into a comprehensive whole is one area where Black & White needs work. For instance, in order to accomplish anything, you are forced to ""increase your influence""--that is, you cannot interact directly with any area of the island that is not under your influence. To gain influence, you have to demonstrate to the neighboring villagers that you are a powerful god by tossing rocks, trees, people, fireballs, whatever over their heads so they fear and/or are amazed by you. This becomes very tedious. It takes ages to gain the influence you need and the process to gain it is not very fun.
Alas, I wanted so much to love this game, but it's just too repetitive and slow.",2.0
"This game has been tremendously hiped by the professional reviewers and I would, indeed, like to have the game live up to the reviews.  It doesn't.  The game is unusual and that makes it interesting at first.  But it soon becomes tedious trying to make headway in it with the difficult mouse interface and trying to keep all of the villagers happy.
The manual is extremely shallow considering all of the fine nuances to the game.  At least an indepth online manual should have been included with the game.
Perhaps the most vexing part of the game, though, is it constantly crashes on the two systems on which I have run it (A dell and an HP, both with 128 meg of memory).  This is despite installing the latest upgrades and shutting down everything else on the systems when I run it.  If the game ran well, I would be more willing to learn all the nuances of the game and perhaps enjoy it.
If you are looking for a very unusual and indepth game, consider this one after the bugs are worked out and then only buy it with a second party manual.",2.0
This version is only enjoyable if you prefer the classic graphics of the PS2. Or....If you don't own a PS3 since the upgraded one is exclusive to it.,2.0
"I bought this game and I am sorry that I did.  The game gets very repitive and playing with your creatures isn't all that fun because you can't really make them do a whole lot.  It is cool to watch them do there own things.  Another problem with the game is that is gets really repititive after awhile.  Converting new tribes to advance in the game gets boring after awhile, especially since it take awhile for each one, meanwhile, your followers are never happy and you always have to keep helping them, making the process even longer.
The pros to this game is that is has very different game play than any game I have played and the graphics are top grade.",2.0
"Despite the months and months of anticipation and saving up the 50 dollars for the game AND the 80 dollars for a 3d card, this game arrives on the store shelves and falls off with a pathetic  plop.""
I know many people consider this one of the best games ever made, I am sad to say, despite the paragraphy above, this probably is one of the best games ever made but at the same time it is one of the worst.
This game is jam packed with little goodies and neat programming tricks.  Some of which have never been seen before, but this game lacks the very essence of what a game should be.  That is fun.
This is one of the most un-fun games I have ever played before in my life.  Every quest and tasks assigned to you in this game is a chore.  From playing with your animal to just completely the tutorial.  The only thing that compelled me to continue the chores and tasks in this game that were assigned to me was the naive hope that something neat might happen if I do it fifty million times.  I fit the classic characteristic of an insane person.  At least I got something out of this game.
And no, the creature that you get in this game is not neat or cool.  My tamagachi had more character than my stupid cow.  And I cared when my tamagachi died.  When my creature died I felt as though a burden had been lifted.  Stupid useless cow.
I would advise you to get this game ONLY when it is in the bargin bin at your local Fred Meyers.  That way you can see for yourself, at a lower price, the new standard of what a game should not be.",2.0
"I really enjoy strategy games.  They can be intellectually challenging and provide an environment where you can step outside your normal, day-to-day life, for a little while.
I have played many different games as the industry has evolved over the years (my first computer was a Commodore 64-how many of you have heard of those before?!).  In all my years of computer game interaction, B&W is, by far, the buggiest program I have ever encountered.  I feel uncomfortable being so negative because I really want to like this game.  But I have had the privilege of being a Beta tester for some other commercial releases and I can not think of a single instance of testing where I have been totally unable to play the game.  In contrast, I have tried, sincerely tried, to run this game only to be completely disappointed as the game froze, time and time again.  I thought the problem might be my system, so I tried installing on multiple systems and multiple OS, all with equally poor results.  As a consumer, who shelled out ... for this game, I can only state how very disappointed I am in Lionhead/EA.  This is the type of experience which causes me to doubt whether or not I will ever risk ... on another one of their products.",2.0
black and white is a fun game with great graphics which could have done well.the main problem is you buy the game and find you cant play it for all the bugs and glitches.the games support is also poor.there is talk of a patch but i think b/w is gonna be one of those games that will never run as it should no matter how many fix it patches lionhead/ea come up with.i give it about 5 out of ten .but if your computer is not at least double the recommended minimum requirements stay well clear,2.0
"That's the color of my forhead after banging it against a brick wall while playing this game.
So much potential just flushed down the pan, great concept, great visuals, great sound effects, lousy gameplay.
I soooo wanted to like this game but in the end its a bitter disapointment, buy a Settlers game instead or even better check out Startopia, the demos great and the game is out any day now.",2.0
"Boy, I really, really wanted to like this game. It has SO much potential. Incredible graphics (among the best I've ever seen in a game). Excellent sound and voice acting. Great concept.
But boy does it fall flat. I gave this game a good solid week of playing, and I just couldn't get into it. Here's why:
1)The interface!! Despite lots of practice, I could never get 100% comfortable with the whole grabbing/twisting/zooming mouse work. I ended up setting it up for keyboard use, and that helped a little but not much. This really, really made playing the game frustrating.
2) Stupid ""quests."" I got tired of having to wait 5 minutes for my ""creature"" to walk all the way across the island to pick up something. Or slowly moving around every inch of the island just to pick up a sheep that I couldn't find. The leash interface is just stupid.
3) Too much micromanaging. I could never get my villagers to do enough on their own. You either have to spend all your time micromanaging them, or all your time training your creature. It's impossible to do both well. Every time I was building housing for my villagers or giving them food, my creature would eat one of them or poop on a farm or something.
4) The creature ""training"" is simply not fun. I would give him feedback but he never really learned from his mistakes. You have to give him the feedback IMMEDIATELY after he does something in order for it to register, which essentially means you're watching the creature at all times. And of course, if you're doing that, then you're not micromanaging the villagers.
There were lots more problems as well.
I really wanted to like this game. It is one of the big disappointments of the year. If you're into resource management games you'd be much better off with Alpha Centauri or even on of the Settlers games.
Buy Baldur's Gate 2 or Planescape Torment instead.",2.0
"...for at least two hours.  I'm not going to beat a dead horse by repeating the multitude of complaints found...oh, wait...yes I am.
Black and White is not a completely terrible game.  Its just not a very good one.  The length of time Lionhead Studios spent in development and the intense hype surrounding the game act as salt in the wound once you realize ""there's no there there.""  The AI is not what was promised--how could it be, given the constraints of contemporary computer languages?  The villagers who worship you, rather than acting as sentient beings, are basically passive objects that must be manipulated continuously lest they die or stand around uselessly.  One would logically assume that the worshipers of a particular deity would gladly wage war on behalf of their god, capturing rival enclaves and bringing them to the faith via the sword (this is featured prominently in god games that predate B& W by years and years, ala ""Populous"" I and II.)  But no, in B & W there is no intervillage conflict.  New worshipers are acquired either by manually making your own villagers procreate (lol) or by impressing nonworshipers via miracles or your creature's antics.  Speaking of which, the creature that is meant to be your avatar is for some reason not imbued with even rudimentary intelligence and must be potty trained and hand-fed like a baby goat; when it behaves well you pet it and when it disobeys you beat it like a mule.  Later, you can use the game's spell system (which requires some of the most convoluted and counter-intuitive mouse movements I've ever made in a game) to teach your creature to cast miracles (spells).  For all intents and purposes, however, the creature is basically an in-game pet that can be allowed to die or wander off without much loss to the minimal gameplay.  If your that in need of companionship, save your hard-earned cash and pay a visit to the local humane society.
I haven't even touched upon the numerous bugs that plague this game.  As of this date a patch is not yet released, though Lionhead Studios has reportedly began work on a new game sporting the same engine behind B & W.  Absolutely disgraceful...",2.0
"Basicaly the game is good but it has not been tested properly.  There are bugs that will cause it not to work with Win2K at all.  I was told to contact EA for waranty Info on returning it.  The Patch situation is just as bad as when ME came out.  BWgame.com has very little info on patches.. basicily they are giving excuse after excuse.  no real sincere apology, or indication that they will deliver a patch soon.  Just empty promises.",2.0
"Black and White is an incredible game. I was completely blown away. The game is based on brilliant and wonderfully executed ideas. It is a rich and engaging game with many different levels of play. The gameplay is so varied, I sometimes feel like I'm playing five games in one.
It's addictive, it's fun, it looks nice, it has a great interface, wonderful sound, and I'm pretty sure people will be talking about this game for years to come.
BUT... It is also perhaps the most buggy piece of software I've ever personally encountered. Several features that were supposed to be in the game at release are not even there at all. The game crashes constantly. A lot of things simply don't work right. Many little issues with gameplay balance combined with countless bugs stack up to one big problem: a barely-playable game.
I wish I'd returned it to the store at which I bought it before my thirty days were up. Fans have been waiting for a patch for two months. And just learned they have another few weeks to wait on that patch. The game is absolutely not a final version; it's a beta. Don't pay forty dollars for a beta (really, everyone who has bought the game so far should be compensated for finding the bugs).
My advice: Get this game, once the patch comes out... and once you've heard about whether or not the patch works.",2.0
"I used to love Populous, and a friend told me about this new game by the same designer, so I had to try it.
Well, the graphics look great.
The second thing I notice is that you HAVE TO go through this really insipid introduction.  You know; how to move, how to rotate the view, really elementary garbage like that.  I find out from the website that you cannot skip this tutorial at all!  What if you want to start over, try out a different creature, or (heaven forbid) play the game more than once?  You have to waste an hour while wading through that silly intro again.
There has been some complaint about how you move around in the game.  I can get used to that - I don't like it, and it is more difficult than it could have been, but it is not a deal breaker.
One reviewer pointed out that when he tried to reload a saved game his creature was not the same as when the game was saved.  I wish I had this problem, because I can't even load a saved game.  Every time I try, the game crashes.  The website suggested a fix: disable internet play.  So I tried this drastic measure, and it still didn't help.  I tried to go back to the website, but it is down.  It seems to be as buggy as the game itself.
I like micromanaged games (I wish whoever owns MicroProse now would make Master of Orion III), buy having to constantly baby-sit these brain dead villagers wears thin, even for me.
This is a clever and unique game, and I would play it despite the frustrating movement and tedious micromanagement - if I could get my saved games to load.  (Please, please don't make me sit through the tutorial again!)  As it is, the CD has set on my shelf unused for two weeks now.  If the web site is ever back up, and they have a patch that will fix my problem, I may dust off the CD and give this game another chance - but it is doubtful that I will buy anything else from Lionhead Studios.",2.0
"I bought this game two weeks after release, and played it relentlessly for two weeks.  The unique gameplay and perspective on gaming I believe will revolutionize the god game genre, as well as many other aspects of the industry.  The graphics were great, the music incredible, and it all ran like a dream (for a little while) on my P2 400.
During those two weeks, I restarted six times, and reinstalled the game 4 times.  I finally figured out why.  It was not my system, many other people on the internet were reporting similar issues to my own.  I waited for a patch, sent emails (unanswered or auto-responded to) to support, and talked with others on the internet for possible solutions to the problems.  Nothing ever would work, and I shelved the game for a month and a half.  During that month and a half, Lionhead promised a patch, gave many release dates, and never followed through, always having to add a new feature to the patch and therefore having to test it further.  The lack of support is disappointing, at best.  Maybe fixing things and releasing a series of patches would have made me feel like Lionhead and EA cared about their customers.
Pass on this one, unless a patch is available, and even then I would be wary",2.0
"The longer you play this game the slower it runs with load and save game times being from five to ten minutes. Lots of crashs to desktop while saving, which means you get to start the game again and endure the tutorials. After four or five times this gets rather annoying.  Lionhead and EA have been slow in providing a game patch and have given only usless technical help.  It is a shame that a fun game can be ruined by the very people who create it. Well, they did get their money from the sale of the game. Is this all they care about? Maybe they should start to worry about future sales.",2.0
"I bought Black and White mostly because of the hype, and was intriqued by the gameplay.  Unfortunately the many technical problems with the game and lack of support from the developer have made the game unplayable after only a couple of weeks.  It's become clear that what is on the shelf is a beta version of the game.  I stongly recommend holding off on buying this game until a new version is released that has the bug fixes and missing features.",2.0
"At first, I loved this game.  The graphics great for such a game.  The town in the first land was easy to deal with.  I progressed through the first land rather quickly and moved on to the second land.  At the second land I realized that I had not trained my creature well and started to get some hints that this game had a lot of micromanagement.  At first I thought that I could train my creature to deal with the micromanagement but that is false.  I restarted and trained my creature for over 4 hours to help me take care of my towns only to find that there was little improvement in how my creature ""thinks"".
In this game you are constantly taking care of both your creature and your town.  This can get overwhelming.  When you get to the second land you also have to deal with the other gods.  While at the same time take care of your creature and your towns.  I was spending around 75% of my time taking care of my towns such as feeding them, making forests for them to chop down, making buildings for them, etc.  This game is like playing simcity, tomagochi (is that how you spell it?), and warcraft all at the same time.  If that is your idea of a great game then go for it.  I personally don't think that this sort of combination works well.",2.0
"While the concept of the game sounds inviting,I found it to be way too tedious and slow. The awkward movement methods and constant script interuptions makes for a very frustrating game experience (I thought such games were supposed to be fun). I made it to the beginning of the second level and decided that it was time to quit the game for good since any further effort would only add to my already high frustration level. Perhaps I was expecting too much as a result of just finishing Myst III Exile (an awsome game).
Oh well, I tried it. Perhaps I can find someone with more patience and gaming skills than I who would appreciate a freebee.",2.0
"The game has an incredible look and feel to it.  However, gameplay is repetitive and becomes boring rather quickly.  There are only five levels to complete, and while each level has its own challenges and quests, there is not enough action and most of the challenges are too easy.  Additionally, there are ""bugs"" in the program and some promised features are not activated.  I have been unable to complete the game because of the ""Land 5 Creature Curse"" bug.  (For more information about these problems you can check the bulletin boards at [...]  A patch has been promised by early June, but it seems too little too late.)  I would not recommend this game other than as a curiosity.  It has been overhyped and does not deliver enough bang for the buck.  If you think you want to buy this game WAIT FOR THE PATCH!",2.0
"The game seemed to play waaaay better on the arcade.  Sure the graphics are great, and the new moves are cool enough, but the speed of the game has been dropped.  If you play TTT and then try out Tekken 3, you can tell that there is a significant speed decrease in TTT.  Plus the ending movies are absolute [crud] and Tekken Bowling is a joke.  Buy this game only if you wanna impress friends or if you actually like the slow play.  My best opinion would be to wait for Tekken 4.  I have Tekken 2 and Tekken 3 and I've completely beaten both of them, so I'm not bias towards the series at all.",2.0
"This game is beautiful to look at but frustrating to play.  I'm currently in level 2 and have lost all intentions of playing it anymore due to the sheer difficulty in getting anywhere, moving around, having to micro-micro manage everything and everyone (including the creature) and not doing what I REALLY want to do instead of having to follow the script.  This the the biggest flaw of this game...instead of actually being able to influence my world and surroundings (like The Sims, which I also played for a while then got terribly bored with), I am actually at the mercy of a script that wants me to do certain things in a certain timeframe.  Things go wrong and you can't figure out how to fix:  My poor tiger creature is always overheated, but I don't know why (despite it drinking water).  The graphics are lovely.  I like the touches of night and day, and the changing 'scenery' but simple things like being able to exit or save require so much maneovering and back bending it just does not make for a very elegant game.  Getting anywhere or even getting used to it requires so much of my too little precious time that it is not worth it.  Maybe I'm biased against true RTS (Age of Empires/Age of Kings is the best thing since sliced bread, IMO...its executional elegance makes you appreciate it more) but things don't have to be this overly structured, overly constrained and overly difficult for gaming.  If you have tons of time to waste and/or like to look at pretty pictures, then get the game; if you want truly want to be in control and be God, then run away from this game as fast as you can.",2.0
"While Black & White contains some entertainment value, it becomes tedious after awhile. It starts out fun, but too much of your time is gradually wasted with micro-management for your worshipers. The AI creatures are very cool however, they really do learn and are able of performing some neat tricks. However again too much time is spent teaching them basic actions that should have been a lot easier (2 hours of potty training is not really fun). Additionally the game is too short if you want it to be. You can blaze through the included scenarios fairly quickly if you put your mind to it. While playing with the creatures is indeed fun, the game bogs down too much in micro-management details, that should have been dumped in favor of more fun gameplay.",2.0
"Black and White is a brilliant and engrossing game, no doubt about that. Unfortunately this game isn't nearly as fun as it should be. One of the fundamental problems is the designers decision not to use a traditional icon based interface. To cast spells you have to trace symbols in the air, this is definately a interesting Idea, but clicking a button, or pressing a key would undoubtably be easier. Worse still is building creation, where you have to gather wood, supply it to a mill, wait for scaffolds to be built, place scaffolds together in different numbers to create different buildings and then supply more wood to the buildings. The thing about the game is that the wood to make buildings task takes up most of the game. If it sounds tedious it is. Another fundamental problem is that well the Creature AI is phenominal the villiger AI is abysmal. Everything needs to be done for them. I really wishthe game eskewed its tenuous goal oriented structure for a more fluid sim-cityesque feeling where the user is free to define his own goals. Oh well, at least it looks pretty.",2.0
"It's been said by others, and I'll just reiterate all the same beefs: way too much micro-management can make this game seriously tedious after the first 40 hours. I mean like extreme, hang yourself with a noose tedious. While it's fun to play god, it's not that fun to have to continue to constantly, constantly build houses and tell people to farm for food when they're starving. If this applied in real life and everyone waited for God to build us houses and give us food, civilization would have ended a long long time ago.
I also thought that it was totally misleading to have a save game feature, thinking you can try different things out and then return to the way THINGS WERE (like most games), only to load your saved game and realize your alignment's completely changed and anything that's happened to your creature stays the same too. This really ticked me off when I saved, then accidentally left the game on while fixing dinner. After half an hour, my fully grown ape had been killed by the comp's creature at least 8-10 times, and had shrunk every time he'd died, so that when I came back he was 10 percent of his original size. When I noticed how small my creature had gotten, I figured no prob, I'll just load the save game and get him back to his full size. But nooooo, he stays the same size, leaving me with the immensely crappy prospect of facing another 15-20 hours getting him back to full size. I mean give me a break, no way I'm gonna spend that kind of time JUST to get him back to the size he was. Ridiculous.
I bought B&W the day it came out, played it like crazy for a week, (and loved it during that time) and haven't touched it in over 6 weeks. A shame, because it is perhaps the single most creative game I have ever played. Graphics and sound are stunning, and the creativity to come up with some of the gameplay was outstanding. This game has enough pros to kill a donkey, but its very few cons are REALLY negative and ruin the whole thing for me, and from the looks of most of these reviews, ruined it for a lot of other people too. Replayability? What's that?",2.0
"Granted, I've never been a huge Tekken, but this game doesn't exactly strike me as being as good as others seem to think it is. The characters just seems stupid to me. They all have serious design problems that just seems to make them unpleasing to look at. Come on, a Kangaroo? A Dinosaur? A Panda? Or even the incredibly stupid looking P-Jacks. Perhaps this seems like a bit of my own opinion, but Namco showed awesome character design in Soul Calibur, I wonder where that went in this game. The graphics are great. From the lighting, to wind effects, it all looks good. My only gripe is the backgrounds. They really aren't 3d, and you can even see the cheezy line where the foreground and the background scroll past each other. It wouldn't be so bad except that you can see this no matter what as there are not boundries to the fighting area. The game is not even really 3d. You tap up/down and you barely move in the appropriate direction. On that note, the control seems stiff to me. I know I have already made one Soul Calibur reference, but watch how smoothly the characters move around each other. Note that position in the arena is important because of the boundries of the area. In Tekken, there is no such thing. The game might as well be 2d with the ability to move to the fore or background. And the moves list, while very extensive, seem to be rather bland and blend togather. A lot of them have almost exactly the same animations and even hit the same. If you look at how many moves are notably different, as in, you would be able to use it differently in a battle strategy, there's fewer moves than you might think. The characters also seemed very shallow despite me trying to uncover their various storylines. Traditionally, fighting games have never been too big on storylines. None of this is more true than Unknown. While her name may say it all, all she is mearly a copy of someone else's style for a short time. That's not being original. In all fairness though, Soul Calibur did the same thing with it's final boss. The final boss should be distinctive, not simply something you've seen before with a little more power. Perhaps a lot of this may seem like personal gripes, but comparing Tekken to other fighting games just seems to show how truely lacking this game is. I would advise you to rent this and compare it to other titles that you would probably be better off spending your money on.",2.0
"After reading all of the previews and ad information for this game, I was convinced that it really was going to be a unique gaming experience.  Black & White is unique, uniquely frustrating, uniquely cumbersome, and uniquely over-hyped.
I want to start by pointing out that if you have read the previews and even reviews for this game, you are being misled.  The professional reviewers of this game base most of their opinions on the ""stunning graphics"" (that can burden even the best video cards) and the interesting God-game storyline.  The graphics, while well made, are nothing unexpected, and at the close in zooms show quite a bit of blockiness for such a supposedly ""revolutionary"" game engine.  As for the God-game storyline, this game differs little from your standard RTS (real-time strategy) game.  Resource management, and a semblance of a ""tech-tree"", in the form of captured village centers that offer different miracles, lead you down the same path as any other game in the genre.  Adding in the Creature makes the game a micro-management nightmare.  The creature starts off dumb and greedy, and grows smart and aggressive even when you actively discourage that behavior.
The interface is an exercise in frustration.  Attempting to navigate the map is like trying to drive a car with one steering wheel for each tire.  Turning can lead to being stuck on the sides of mountains until you change your zoom to get around it.  Moving through confined areas, like the mountain passes in the first map, can take a significant amount of time, zooming, turning, and tilting.  All this adds together to completely prohibit quick movement on the map, a major problem for any RTS game.
The job of managing your villagers, in their various villages, means that you will spend the majority of your time tending to these lazy people.  Instead of just providing their resources, you must begin construction on ALL of their structures.  The will whine about everything, and do nothing to fulfill their own needs.  This means that you will spend most of your time watering fields that your farmer disciples do nothing with.  Making forester disciples means nothing unless the trees are right in front of these idiots.  In fact, the only disciples, of the eight that you can create, that do their jobs well are the breeder and missionaries.  In the end, you will have to do most things yourself and leave your followers to sit on their blocky behinds.
One last note, if you are really intent on buying this game, my recommendation is to get every help guide and walk through you can find.  The manual provided is practically useless, and the in game help is more comic relief than help.  Your best bet is to wait for this game to end up in the bargain basket, and at least save yourself some money.",2.0
"For adults, the James Perkins review of Black and White nails this game.  Read it, then skip purchasing this game.  I was very excited about getting it after reading/believing the hype.  The creature and its ""leashes"" drove me insane, and detracted from the small amount of entertainment I had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game.  Maneuvering is (IMHO) counter-intuitive, especially which way the POV revolves based on the sliding of the mouse.  And the forced tutorial is mind-numbing.  The only worse ""forced"" passage in a game is the part of NOLF where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questions.",2.0
"I really loved this game when I first got it.  For about 3 days.  Then you begin to see the bugs.  Then you begin to see how scripted the game is.  Open-ended?  Give me a break.  The single-player version is irritating and boring.
The multi-player aspect of this game is even worse.  Even if you manage to find a game where the opposing creature hasn't been hacked using a trainer, there is simply no challenge.  How to win?  Learn how to throw fireballs well.  The size of your town?  Your ""helpful"" creature?  Irrelevant.  Multi-player is akin to the 8-bit NES game Duck Hunt.  Scratch that.  Duck Hunt was much more fun.
This game is a total waste of money.  I do admit that it is entertaining when you first start it up... I was crazy about this game for a short period.  Hence the incredible raves & reviews that are now littering the web.  Give it a couple of months, see if they patch some of the bugs, and let the hype settle a bit.  Most of the people who have spent any considerable amount of time with this game abhor it.  No replay value, and very limited appeal the first time around.  Good idea, poor implementation.
Oh and as far as the patches go... well the folks at Lionhead have apparently disappeared.  A month has gone by since release, and no patches.  I really wanted to give this game 1 star to drive the ratings down.  But in all honesty, it is worth 2 stars of entertainment.  Don't pay more than $10 for this game.  Else, you will regret it.",2.0
"I am the owner of a ps and a dc.  I have seen pictures of this gamein my official playstatoin magizine and pretty much every where else along with ps2.

THis game is just about like tekken 1, 2 , and 3, only hyped up to be the savior of all fighting games.  It is not.  I would rate tekken 2 batter than this piece of junk.  And soul calibur beats them all, so save your money, you could buy a much better game..or for that matter a better console.",2.0
"Firstly i wanna say that,when i saw this game,i was really shocked. I hoped i can see a fascinating game because most of the magazines sad ""This game is the best game of this year"".But i can only say that,this game gets a big disapointment.",2.0
"I was disappointed with Tekken Tag Tournament.  The graphics no doubt are great, but as far as the gameplay goes, players will be disappointed.  This game in no way compares to the gameplay of Soul Calibur for Sega Dreamcast.  Soul Calibur dominates Tekken, mostly because of the 3-D, 360 degree movement allowed.  Tekken does not use this, leaving the game too basic, and the controls frustrating.  Soul Calibur's player moves are amazing and quick, but doing combos in Tekken is a bit of a task, and the movements of the characters don't move as fast as you press the buttons.  This game could be a lot better, but for now, your best bet is to save your money and wait until Soul Calibur comes out for Playstation 2.",2.0
"Black & White is, without doubt, the most beautiful game I have ever seen.  The graphics are stunning and the ""cut scenes"" are gorgeous.  The basic premise and storyline is original and engaging.  The character AI is very sophisticated.  The interface/control system IS a tad awkward and takes some getting used to, but once you're comfortable with it, it's actually kinda cool.
HOWEVER......
... it's not fun.  It's really quite tedious.  The whole of the game is simply a endless routine of repetitive tasks.  To ""conquer"" villages you perform miracles for the villagers until they believe in you...  HUNDREDS of miracles.. and THEN once they believe in you, you still have to perform endless miracles so that they continue to believe in you.  And these miracles require worshippers to ""power"" them.  Which requires more villagers, which requires more miracles!  The whole game becomes a never-ending spiral of performing miracles to appease the villagers so that you can perform miracles to get more villagers which require still more miracles ... and on and on.
In any Role Playing game where you have to ""level"" up a character, there is inherently a lot of ""busy work"" ie. going out to the forest and killing countless beasties to earn XP, etc etc.
Black & White is NOTHING BUT BUSY WORK!  and at the end of it, all you have to show for it is a cow/monkey/lion/pig/whatever that knows where it should and shouldn't poop! (maybe!  I've still not figured out to keep it from eating people!)
If you like The Sims, you will love this game.  It is the same boring tedium in a much prettier package.
P.S.  Am I the only one who feels geniunely insulted when companies ""spam"" the ratings before a game even comes out, so the initial ratings are really high?  The first 20 or so ratings on this forum are so clearly the product of the EA Marketing Department that it should be an embarrassement!",2.0
"I got to see Peter Molyneux demonstrate and explain Black and White in person at MIT in February of 2000. I was intrigued by the concept and what I saw looked great, so I've had nothing but positive vibes toward the game, and snapped it up the day it came out. However, I've got to be honest, this game isn't for everybody. This is the first 'god' or 'sim' type game I've actually ever owned, so perhaps if you're more inclined or experienced with this type of game, you might enjoy it more than I did. However, as an action and strategy gamer, I thought I was going to collapse across my desk and cry tears of boredom.
Giving B&W its due, you need only read the other reviews here. Yes, these graphics are amazing, as good as anything out there. The AI is at a whole new level, and there are things going on here that have never been seen before and it makes my head spin to think of how on earth they could have programmed them, like the gesture-recognition interface or the intriguing learning ability of the creatures. This is, no doubt, an amazing piece of art and technology.
That having been said, is it any fun to actually PLAY? For me, I'm afraid not. The game very quickly degenerates into an endless cycle of repetitive actions like moving trees and villagers around, all in the name of expanding your 'influence' to encompass other villages, at which point you have even more trees and villagers to move around. Add to this your basic lack of story (do this and this and this to defeat the bad guy!) or characters, and what you have is pretty much a colossal bore in the opinion of this gamer. It's far less Clash of the Titans than it is Competition of the Woodstackers. The micromanagement that you have to perform, and the complete lack of functions, interface, or information to make it any more reasonable, is just out of control. Literally. There are parts in the game where you can't even access the basic functions of saving and loading because those are in your 'temple', and sometimes you don't have a 'temple' yet. And this goes on for EVER, like hours and hours and hours. I read one forum post from an enthusiast who had spent (he said) about 20 HOURS of doing tasks like this to get through a level. And I'd have to say, embarassingly, my own experience is similar. He didn't spend 20 hours because he was a bad player; he spent 20 hours because the game is really that slow.
The whole Tamagotchi-meets-King-Kong aspect of the game, the Creature, is an interesting idea but ultimately fails to deliver. The Creature becomes yet another thing that's only partially under your control and which the game doesn't give you the tools to manage. Classic example: the Creature eats one of your villagers. This is generally a bad thing because you need those villagers to increase your 'influence', so you'd want to punish the Creature so that the behavior doesn't happen again. However, the game never says ""Your Creature just chewed up a villager."" Instead it says ""Your Creature will eat that sort of thing more often."" Oh really? WHAT sort of thing? And unless you were ignoring the other twenty things that need doing and happened to be zoomed in close enough to actually identify what the Creature was eating, guess what? Your Creature goes on scarfing up villagers. You get labelled by the game as siding with Evil and you suck, and none of it was your fault. Considering that there are only about ten possible things that the Creature can eat, including his own poop, you'd think that the game itself would be a little more informative, or warn you before it was about to happen.
Unfortunately, the game is just full of deliberate yet bad design decisions like this. You're informed of things happening only after it's too late to do anything about it. The concept that there is no interface, just a hand, sounds good on paper but is lousy in practice, depriving you of control and information. It's ridiculous that you have to move the camera for miles over to the correct place on the map and then hold the hand over the right building for a few seconds just to get the one piece of information that you want. Couldn't we have put that on the screen? It seems like some of the fixes to make this such a better game are entirely obvious, but were deliberately ignored. Even the game's manual is quite vague and seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with this kind of game, and omits a great deal of information that you'd have to be blind lucky to figure out.
Additionally, any claims that the game is some kind of psychological tool, or that your Creature comes out as a reflection of your personality, are just silly. The game basically makes its own call as to what's good and what's evil, and your own intentions aren't figured in at all. In some cases even your actions don't seem to be figured in to that judgment. There's some hype that this is a game of moral and ethical choices, and that is just not so. This game may be a first step in that direction, but this is simply a game of micromanagement; in some senses, it's almost kind to call it a game, period.
To wrap up, on the technical end I had no problems with this game on a 1Ghz PIII with 256MB RAM and a 32MB GeForce2. It has crashed once while I was multitasking, but other than that has been flawless, with some frame drop in extreme camera moves but overall seems well above 30fps.
Anyway, definitely put some thought in before diving in to Black and White. It's an interesting piece but it's not for everybody.",2.0
"Well I sure hate to be a spoil sport, but I feel pretty much let down by Black & White. There appear to be several issues that I think bring this great concept down.
1) This is supposed to be a game where I am a god. As a god I should have a lot of control over the world. However in this game you are just part of the story and you have to follow the game the way the developers want you to. There are levels and ""missions"" in the form of scrolls that you have to accomplish before moving on, so basically I am just playing a role and trying to ""beat"" the game. This is not a god sim - it is an adventure game. Like another reviewer stated, if you want to have control, play the Sims.
2) The interface is very difficult to get the hang of, and it is mostly mouse controlled. I found doing mundane chores like unleashing my creature (you get a creature to teach), throwing stuff, and just moving around to be tedious at times. While moving, your perspective has a habit of changing which I do not like (at times I ended up staring straight at the ground for no reason).
3) About three hours into the game I got a Visual C++ Runtime library error and the game crashed. Now I can understand a bug due to my system hardware or something, but this appears to be just flawed code. In all the games I play, I have never seen a runtime error from code (I won't count applets here). Was this game ready for market?
4) I crashed and went back in. To my suprise I found myself all the way at the beginning. The game's Auto-Save feature had not saved anything (even though it said ""saving"" while I was playing). At this point I was too bored and frustrated to continue. Again I believe this game was not ready to ship. Instead of starting all over again, I gave up and went back to Clive Barker's Undying.
I eagerly waited for this game, and when starting it up it looked to be very well done. The intro sequence and graphics are awesome. But I felt this is a game that was a major hype turned letdown, and I recommend waiting until it is in the bargain bin before buying it.",2.0
"I was all for this game. I was convinced that BLACK and WHITE was not going to be the next DAIKATANA. No, I didn't want to believe that. But it is true. BLACK and WHITE is an over-hyped game. It was in development for about three years and gaming magazines and such labeled this game as something revolutionary. Well, BLACK and WHITE may be that, but did EA have to make it so boring?
The chance to play god should have been fun. In fact the opening moments of the game are the best. My two stars goes to the absolutley fantastic opening sequence of stunning visuals and graphics. And the music that plays really pumps me up for what I thought would be a special game. Alas, this was not to be. After, I choose my creature, the game really slows down the point of bordom. You make choices in the form of ""Silver Scrolls"". These are quests that happen on the little island your on. This is where the game lost me.
As for the controls, I think the folks at EA made them a little to complicated than it needed to be. This to me was the most frustrating part of the whole BLACK and WHITE experiance. If you can't have good control using the mouse with a game, then in my opinion, that game just cannot be fun.
Yes, this game is original, but I think some people will be bored. If you want to play god, I think THE SIMS is a far superior game, not to mention fun.",2.0
"I bought this long ago on PlayStation 1 when this version first came out.  It was released as a budget title ($20 new on first day of release), and was delayed a few times right before its release, probably over a few quality issues.  The AI was just plain terrible from what I remember.  I spent too much time watching the computer AI hide from each other while I sat and waited time to run out if I had already died.  For the same price or cheaper, just get Bomberman Generations for the Game Cube (get a Game Cube since they are so cheap now) which has very good multi-player, good AI, lots of differnet levels, more fun items (dangerout bomb -- like a little atomic bomb).",2.0

"The basic idea is cool, the point being that you are freelancing for some criminal organization running contraband across the border while competing against cops and other organizations. It's finally something new to the basic speeding/car-racing genre I love so much.
The problem is that all the skills I've developed in other racing games are pointless here...you start with a selection of two cars, a big heavy SUV (that can take a little more damage) and a cage buggy dragster type thing. Well, in one stage you have to show off your driving skills (no pick-ups or drop-offs of contraband) by beating the other crime orgs, and I was unable to do it in the fast car...so I used the slow heavy one, and finally won. Time and again the heavier car is as fast if not faster.
The cops always catch up to you, too. I'm quite good at out-braking and hand-break cornering, yet the cops in their Chevy Tahoes are able to keep up with me, even while driving a 'dragster'.
The inability to outdrive the competition coupled with a a fairly boring set of tasks makes this a great game to rent for the weekend, but not to own.",2.0
"The ONLY difference is the improvement in some of the graphics.  Everything else has remained the same or has even worsened.  The AI is SO SO bad I couldn't even beleive it.  Forget about hiding in the grass (a great feature about DF1 and DF2) becouse you won't be seeing anymore grass.  In sum, no reason to buy this.  DF2 was better.",2.0
"It might be possible that the multi-player would make this more fun to play and improve my rating however, I doubt I will spend any time bothering to get good at this game.  All the missions are virtually identical.  You start far away from a small group of buildings, prison, or town.  You snipe your way into the enemy camp picking off the few wondering sentries (that look like sticks from a distance)and possibly thinking that this could be kinda cool.  As you enter the buildings you are reminded of of the graphics of the most primitive first person shooters.  The worst part is the enormously ignorant AI. While you toss a grenade into a room killing the enemy, the enemy in the adjacent room ACT LIKE THEY ARE DEAF DUMB AND BLIND.  On one night mission I shot about four times at a guy.  Obviously the first three missed.  With bullets flying by this guys head, within inches, he never moves.  Most of the time when I get killed, multi-player or mission, I never know who or what killed me.  WOW, WHAT FUN! Heres the best part.  On one mission the dead bodies of the enemy became suspended in mid air, obviously a program glitch. LOOKS REAL STUPID.  Playing missions with a partner I noticed that sometimes me or my partner cannot kill the enemy.  You keep shooting but they don't die.  Finally after getting killed a couple of times the game starts to work.",2.0
"DF Land Warrior did fix the DF graphics problems, looks good. My concern is the terrible or non-existing support from Novalogic. They will not answer any question and if they finally do, their answer is not going to help you. They like to sell and forget about customer.
I have tried over years to get support from them but this is an eternal problem with out fix. They simply DON'T CARE, not even if you have bought them DF1, DF2, F22, Comanche, Comanche II and ComancheGold.

"Well, this definitely comes bottom of my launch title purchases. Get SSX. Get Smugglers' Run. Wait for Gran Tourismo 3. Get a Dreamcast and play F355. Don't buy this.
Good things about the game: * The cities. Having lived in both New York and London, I'm very impressed at the detailed reproduction of both cities. Its so good that driving around London I could find my way around based on how I knew the real place. * The speed. It doesn't slow down. At all. Ever. Zooming the wrong way down a highway at top speed is plain scary. * The graphics are pretty good. Especially when the road is wet it looks fine indeed. If you look closely you'll see repeated textures a lot, and some areas of town are very sparsley textured indeed though. The car models are relatively detailed and very very shiny. Perhaps too shiny sometimes.
Bad things about the game: * The *huge* load times. It grinds for what feels like forever loading the city map before *each* race - even if you haven't changed cities. I don't know why it couldn't keep most of the city data and just load course waypoints or traffic.. It feels like its reading data off vinyl, not DVD-ROM. * Its not like driving. Not at all. I guess it has what you would call a very ""arcady"" feel to it, but its not at all convincing. * Frustrating difficulty. Now I'm no loser when it comes to racing games. I worked my way through the whole of Gran Tourismo on the 'ol PSX. The annoying thing about the way this game plays is that at some steps you can only just beat the other guy - and I do mean only just. You can maybe go 1 mph faster, or corner marginally better, and its just a case of making a perfect performance, or retrying again and again until the other guy hits traffic. * Short 1-player game. I'm half way through after 1 evening. Now we're at the frustratingly difficult stage of beating a city boss, and then its rinse and repeat and its all over. * The sound. A minor gripe, but the cars all sound like lawnmowers, not beastly souped up cars. It doesn't do anything to add to the atmosphere.
I don't think this is a next generation title. There are definitely better PS2 games out there. If you have to have a racing title now, I'd probably plump for Ridge Racer V which at least is outstandingly pretty, but to be honest, the PS2 doesn't have its killer racer yet. If you're carefully choosing your 3 launch titles and minding your dollars, I suggest you don't include this one.",2.0

"After playing GT3 I was looking for another PS2 racer.  I saw that MCSR was a highly rated racer so I opted to get it.  Even at the reduced price of [money]I felt slightly ...
A Racer? Hardly, a good amount of time is ""cruising"" the streets for a race or performing other mundane tasks.  When you get to race you have to race against a few cars, the trick is to learn all the shortcuts such as which street to turn down first etc..  The car selection is ..., you have a cab, low riders, a couple other boring cars and it really leaves you wondering why this game was so popular.  The cars cannot be upgraded as far as I can tell.  The game play is responsive but not realistic.
If you enjoy the driving action in GTA3 you will like this game if you're a driving enthusiast and like the realism of Grand Turismo stay away from this game.  My kids who don't like GT3 prefer playing it over MCSR.  I will rent the next version of the game before purchasing it.

The auto-aim on the game really comes up short, The multiplayer is embarrassing. And Load time???? When did N64 turn into a playstation?  What really turns me off is the fact that after you fail a mission, it stops it.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I enjoyed wiping out innocent civilians.  I am really disappointed about this game. After playing an inferior game like this, I had to turn on Perfect Dark to remember what a real first-person shooter was all about. Don't waste your money on this game, I'll sell ya mine!",2.0
"There are many bad things about this wheel. For 1, whenever you turn it, it turns way to far to the side, and the car you are driving goes off the track. Another thing is, the pedals don't work very well. When you push even a millimeter dow on the gas pedal, the car speeds way up. Also, the brake/reverse pedal doesn't work at all. You have to reset the car if you want to reverse. On some games, the gas apedal and thebrake/reverse pedal don't work at all. When this happens, the car just speeds ahead, and there is no way to slow it down. Never the less, the wheel doesn't break easily, and it has rumbel built in. If you want a good wheel, then I advise you to by one without pedals.",2.0
"Well to start off the graphics are terrible.  There so boxy and have no detail whatsover, even when i run it on the highest resolution.  The controls are nice, but the gameplay sux.  I want to just wanted to drive and mess around in the city, but right when i push the gas the cop gets on me for no reason which get's really annoying after about....10 seconds.  And the street lights don't work correctly, when the light turns green the cars don't always go.  If you like games that are boring and full of many errors that could have been easily avoided, then i guess you like this game",2.0
"Midtown Madness offers a good, fun engine in wich you'll spend some time driving through two real-life scenarios. Period. If you are looking for a game for your kids, this is it. It's good enough and fun enough to keep a child happy. You will feel like playing Mario Kart in a city, without the weapons, but with real cars.
  Now, if you are looking for M A D N E S S, any Carmageddon series game if a better offering; even the mid-90's version. They all have better graphics with highly textured polygons, better soundtracks (the second one had Iron Maiden), much more interactivity (wreck the cars, the stage, and other cars), better scenarios that incluide highways, gasoline stations, parks, rivers, and toxic wastelands, to name a few, interesting power ups that go from ""Gravity from Jupiter"" and a Knight Rider-like jump to engine upgrades and, of course, the series trademark: blood, blood, and more blood.
  As far as the Madness, Microsoft's latest offering falls terribly short with no blood, no violence, and just limited mechanical rage. With twenty real life cars, the offering also falls short of the benchmark-setting, years old Gran Turismo (wich you can play on BLEEM) by about 100 cars, do the math. Do yourself a favor and get it for your kids, if you got the first one, stick with it, and if you want something new for yourself, grab a copy of Carmageddon 3: The Death Race 2000 (about 40 dollars) or Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now (about 20 dollars)...

"Why only two stars? PHYISICS, it's what makes or breaks a game. in the original, taking my mustang around a sharp corner at 140 MPH. would result in a spin-out and a lot of damage. in the secont release, you could take a two story bus at 140 MPH. around a sharp corner and not even tip it. trust me it's not as fun, when all cars have super glue on their tires. why? because its more exciting to push a car to or past it's physical limits like in every man's fantasy. the original game has a little meter called realism. where as this one does not. right in between simulator and arcade style made that game fun. this game has less realism than mario kart! if you bought the orignal, don't buy this one, you will be disgusted. but if you have not had any expereience, than buy it. also- if you have children they will love this game, because it's lack of realism (fish tails, spin outs, loss of controll etc.) are non-existant.and all of the other cars act like they are baloons. i hit a semi with a vw bug at 80 mph and launched it into the air, and lost 20 mph.

"This joystick was my last attempt at trying to buy a force-feedback joystick.  Without getting too wordy, there is just far too much deadspace in the joystick's center.  Even spending extensive amounts of time trying to calibrate with the joysticks calibration utility and manually adjusting the calibration with a directX calibrator it was still impossible to get a true center.

Unfortunately, that's only the first problem one is likely to come across.  The gyro motors used to center and move the joystick are very poor.  I found that after as little as 1 month of sporadic use, the twist function on the joystick failed to work properly.  After dismantling the joystick I found that the joystick was just shoddily constructed of poor components.

I wouldn't recommend this joystick for even the most casual of gamers.  Force feedback really, really isn't worth it.  Very few computer games are even programmed with Force Feedback in mind.  I recommend going with a more reliable, spring-based, joystick such as the Saitek Cyborg EVO.",2.0
"It's too complicated. Jumps around the screen. The one I bought from Radio Shack does everything the Logitech does, and is more stable, for less money.",2.0
"I got this joystick brand new from Amazon on Friday and am returning it on Saturday. This joystick puts a shame on the entire Logitech family of products due to it's lack in quality and style.

When I first got it, I expected a nice joystick. I hooked it up, and it worked, but I noticed it wasn't built up to specification or something. When I left the joystick in it's idle position, the stick itself could still wiggle around causing any center calibration to be null and void. Basically, if I were to play a game, use the joystick for a bit, then switch back to the keyboard, since the idle position wasn't stiff or locked, I may have it centered or it may be a little to the left, which is very disruptive.

The style isn't something you'd expect from Logitech either. To me, this joystick looks like something you'd get from the 1990's, when we've advanced way past that. The drivers haven't upgraded much since then either. While there is an update to them, the drivers are terrible. Even when calibrated to the best of my ability, the stick would still be disobedient and not do as I told it to. Configuring the thing for the latest games was a complete hassle.

All in all, this stick is not worth your time or money. The style is lacking, the build quality is terrible, and I see no good reason for buying this joystick.",2.0
"I recieved this joystick as a gift.  I have more gripes about this joystick than anything else.  The button layout seems like it's made for basketball players.  The centering is awful, out of the box this thing couldn't stay centered, even with the dead zone set and everything zeroed out.  Now it seems like whatever the stick is attached to inside the case is loose.  I can wiggle the stick around with absolutely no resistance.  My roomate has the $185 sidewinder and it is much better, it feels solid with no looseness. $185/$35.  If you can afford the Sidewinder, it's your only choice.  I'm saving up for it as we speak.",2.0
"So I read a bunch of reviews on here and gave this stick a try for Microsoft Flight Sim 2004 [the only ""game"" I ""play""]. Installation was a breeze. The force feedback was excellent, and simulated well the forces on the control surfaces! I had a horrible time trying to get a little simulated Cessna to fly level for instance - the centering on the stick is terrible, even after playing around with sensitivities and the null zone galore.  After 30 minutes of a short flight, my wrist was aching.  Trying to keep pitch was pretty difficult too, especially while landing. I must add that I'm a southpaw, and using a right-handed stick was probably a bad idea to start with.  I don't know if the experience would be different for right-handers. Anyway, I decided not to risk carpal-tunnel, and it's on its way back to Amazon.",2.0
"My problem with this joystick is that the center is very loose and wobbly.  I bought it to use with x-plane which does not make use of the force feedback.  I found no way to tighten the centering spring manually, and the software that comes with the joystick implies you can tighten it via the software interface, but this did not work for me.  Perhaps it was because x-plane does not make use of this option.
In any event, it might be a fine product for other games, but it will be in my garbage can as soon as as my new, alternate-brand joystick arrives.",2.0
"When I first tried out the Logitech Wingman Joystick, it was great.  Good control and feedback affects.  However, six months later, the stick has lost its x/y axis and can not be recalibrated.  So now I'm out looking for another joystick (as the shipping cost and hasstle are more than the replacement cost).  In summary, not a bad joystick, but not very durable.",2.0
"About 2 months after buying this product, which was as good as everyone says, it started acting erratic and would not calibrate back to normal. It was impossible to play with it any more (e.g. Flying along  straight and level,suddenly a full uncontrolled roll to the left). I then started an odyssey to upgrade drivers, read all tech support documents, called tech support (either busy or leaves you on hold for 40 minutes-long distance, no 800 number- until I gave up). Sent e-mails(only auto responses) complained to every one of Logitech's e-mail addresses (including one for investors) finally got a response from a very helpful guy who after a painful diagnosis process told me the stick was defective and told me to call tech suport! After a few more tries got through and they agreed to send a new one...great. however their Chinese shipment was late and it took a month to get it (all told this all took about three months,part time.) The new one worked fine for 2 months then started doing the same thing ,this time with the twist anf y axis) I don't know if I have the heart to go through it again. I would not recommend this product if you want long term reliability.",2.0

"My beef with this controller is that the calibration is continuously getting out of whack on the left joystick. The company has no fix for it, and it is not game specific. This can be temporarily fixed by resetting the calibration, but it's still a pain in the rear end.",2.0
"1) Stiff, clicky, small, inset buttons. Nothing like a PS2/PSX pad's nice buttons.
2) Badly placed throttle. The shoulder buttons (which are the clickiest of them all) are big, but if you're like me your pointer fingers tend to travel up while using the shoulder buttons. And that makes for a badly placed throttle above the right shoulder button.
3) Sticks will eventually break off. I got a free replacement LWMRP, but I'm afraid to use it because I know that one will break as well. I suggested to them that they use sturdy metal sticks if they're going to insist on the skinny necks of the sticks, but they haven't modified it yet.
4) Stiff D-Pad/POV pad. And it's hard to navigate with it as well since you can't feel the direction without looking down to see if you're pressing it right.
5) Inset Mode and Rumble buttons hard to press in sometimes.
Two great things? The handles and rumble feature. Very comfortable grips and very solid rumble features.",2.0
This would be a great controler with all the buttons and two analog sticks. Shortly after I started using it the left analog stick wouldn't register properly when I pushed to the right. I was using it to play Need for Speed Underground. If the stick had worked right this would be a great product.,2.0
"I usually like Logitech products, which is why I'm amazed they would actually put their name on this garbage. To start with, 2 out of the 7 push buttons have intermittent faults while pressing down continuously.  The 8 way directional hat, has a hard time detecting presses to the right. The left Joystick looses it's calibration after about twenty to forty five minutes of game play. After that, it simply will not go to the right.  Since it was decided that this stick was above mere calibration, none was included. The only way to resolve the problem is to reboot the computer when this happens. A real mood killer while playing  any game. I'm a avid gamer and have other game pads, wheels and sticks, so no it's not the computer or USB port. They all work fine, I just thought this one would be better. Next time I'll think a little harder if it say's Logitech on it.",2.0

I tried the Sidewinder and thought it was a better controller and as the old saying goes, "" You get what you Pay for.""",2.0
"Overall, I rate the Logitech Wingman Rumble Pad as a very poor controller. My largest complaint is that the buttons are stiff, with very poor feel.

"I found this game very disappointing...  I read all the reviews that said this game was the best, extremely fun, very real, etc.  So I was expecting a game that consisted of undercover missions and espionage, but instead all you do in this game is run and shoot.  You can't really sneak around because there's nowhere to go.  All the levels are comepletely linear, you have no choice where you go, there is only one path.
Aside from that it is practically impossible to sneak up behind enemies and  perform a ""silent takedown"".  Not that you ever need to, the enemies in this game are completely stupid and couldn't shoot the side of a barn.  You could run into a room full of enemy soldiers and take them all down with a handgun without losing any health.  In this game you simply end up running through the levels shooting human targets as you go.
This game is for people who just want to blow stuff up (although, some of the things you can do to enemies are pretty cool...) but the overall game is pretty boring.

"When I first saw the ""glorious"" fps Soldier of Fortune, I must say I really took a step back. The graphics were so so, for the time, but the very graphic gore and bloody explosions were in a class by themselves. I truly loved to watch arms pop off, and heads explode. It was very entertaining. But alas, it is so fake I really only laugh at there silly attempt at ""realistic gore"". As the forensic pathologist for Orangeburg county South Carolina, I can honestly tell you that this gore is anything but realistic. First off the shotguns blast range is far to long, and the 9mm causes far to much physical damage. Headshots often only wound opponents, whereas sometimes a simple 9mm shot to the abdomen is an instant kill. We found other glaring unrealistic wound physics, but I don't have enough typing room to get into all of them, but just so you know, we sat around the office one afternoon just trying to match up one of our Soldier of Fortune killings, with an actual shooting homicide victim, and none were even close. As far as gameplay goes it is a very take or leave it title. Nothing new or exciting. Multiplayer is pale in comparison to other top rate fps's. But don't be tricked into believing this title has realistic gore.",2.0

"After reading all the major reviews like avault.com and gamespot.com I was expecting a fun, engrossing, exciting flight sim about the historical battle of Britain. I was severely disapointed. I have a Wingman 3D joystick and even after alot of calibration the controls were still a little ify. The graphics were nothing special, the planes had reasonably good rendering the ground was a flat texture tiled over and over hundreds of time which is to be expected but still disapointing. The only real fun i could find besides taking my Spitfire into huge drones of Luftwafe bombers was playing the gunners on the German bombers. This was loads of fun. You can play as a tail gunner, top, belly, and front gunner. The interface for the campaigns(the primary portion of the game) was dificult to understand and took a lot of getting used to , and most controls were not exactly intuitive. Overall the game has strong and weak points but on the whole you would be better off buying a Jane's flight sim over this one. By the way don't even try this game if you don't have a joystick it is unbearable.",2.0

Unfortunantly, there are numerous issues with installation - and more with the campaign and computer AI. It is obvious that that Empire took what Rowan had at the time and dumped it on the public.

"Never underestimate the power of the playstation to mess up a game with a great concept. This game looked great all the way through the preview stage and must have stopped there because all the levels are extremely short and easy. The cars are fun to drive but that novelty wears out fast. Do not buy this game expecting to get a game like Need for Speed (eventhough it is made by EA). Expect more of a Twisted metal meets driver. Eventhough that in itself would be a good game, they don't even pull that off. Don't buy this game, instead buy Porsche Unleashed(psx) or 4x4 evolution(dc).",2.0
"Visually this game is terribly lacking. The car models are swarmed with nasty looking jaggies that I've never seen before in previous car games on the PSX. The models look somewhat decent, but their outward appearance is very grainy, thanks to the jaggies. Not exactly very nice car detail, and I'm frankly disappointed. The environments are very shabby, they flicker like crazy and on top of that look downright pixilated. When you look at the floor, or the backgrounds you should notice how incredibly ugly everything looks, it makes me even wonder if Eutechnyx spent any time on the game from E3 2000 up until the release date. The frame rates are fine, but at times may act up, and don't get me started on the pop-up 'cause this game is right up there with Driver 2. The game's collision detection is also a pile (...), and the overall look of the visuals looks hardly alpha staged, the only good thing I can say about the visuals is that they move and there are colors, otherwise everything else, including special effects look like demo titles running on a first wave PSX tool-kit. But I must admit that the CGs are some of the best in any PS game yet.
  The concept of the game is quite good, only if it was better executed. You are James Bond of course, except you are Pierce Brosnan not Sean Connery or the other Bonds, that is bad impact number one. The game's plot is totally unrealistic, you will see Pierce Brosnan in every single vehicle, including a DB5 and tons of other classic Bond vehicles. I believe that it was a stupid move by the developer to only put Pierce Brosnan in 007 Racing, because true Bond fans will be completely turned off by the game. Losing some critical points there, 007 Racing also suffers from un-balanced and boring missions, such as picking up people, shooting down a helicopter with only one try, escorting this person, that person, blah, blah, blah. By the second mission you'll definitely notice what kind of horrendously boring product your playing. If you folks want to know, there are 15 missions to complete, all of which are explained to you in a mission briefing, but none that I would like to listen to. There are a few decent stages, take for example the Highway Hazzard, what you do here is you follow an 18-wheeler and your goal is to pop the wheels on the truck using a hi-tech device. In case you're wondering, the two-player missions need not to be played, you just won't have any fun with them at all. Some of the weapons that James Bond will use are missiles, homing missiles and machine guns, he will be able to use shields and replenish his lives by picking up health kits. Through the game you will be taken through tons of different areas such as New York, Louisiana, Eastern Europe, and Monte Carlo. 007 Racing is a lacking game with a great concept, if only the developer had taken time to balance out the missions, and perk up the visuals, we could have had a great game, but there is always the PS2 version which is currently under development.
  Audio is decent, but the songs are far too repetitive and can annoy the heck out of you. The voice acting on the other hand is quite good, but it seems as if Q would rather have the returned in one piece instead of having James back healthy. While playing the game you'll hear Q commenting on your performance, and may give you some hints at times. Most of the time the voice acting is found during the mission briefings by M and they can be quite long, but the clarity is good though so there isn't anything painful to be dealt with. Not bad audio effects, but if the soundtrack was worked on we could have had something much better.
  Controls are just too sloppy, every time I try to make a turn it feels like the emergency brake has been hit. The cars have absolutely no realistic feel to them at all, so car enthusiasts must look elsewhere. I'll give the game its nice analog features, both analog sticks work and they have a good deal of sensitivity. I honestly can't say much more about the controls, other than that they feel very sloppy, there is no realism to speak off and the only thing that's good about the controls are the analog sticks.
  Sadly what was once a very promising game, turned out to be a miserable failure, 007 could have been a good game if its visuals were worked on more, because I know that PSOne can do so much better than this, the gameplay needs to adjusting and the controls should have been tightened up for better gameplay. With horrible graphics, unsatisfactory and tedious gameplay, and loose controls 007 Racing is barely worth a purchase, let alone a rental, just stay away from this game if you know what's good for you and the Playstation.

"What a tragedy this is. It has almost everything going for it. Medal of Honor: Underground sports the best sounds in any game I've ever heard. The ambiant noise in the background is just spooky! Sometimes I can't tell if those footsteps I'm hearing is just part of the track playing or if I have woken up a guard- which means they have seamlessly instilled a sense of danger just by their background music. Also, I like the fact that you are using authentic weapons. None of this ""alien lazer gun"" crap. The graphics would be passable for the game, but this is where we start running into problems.
  For one thing, you can wake up a guard halfway across the level, run all the way back to the starting point, and have him standing miles away from you, emptying clip after clip of ammunition into the walls. And the worst part is, a lot of these bullets, due to the HORRIBLE clipping problems in this game, pass right through said walls and hit you! Not only this, but you can expect to take a ton of hits in this game. True, health packs are plentiful, but doesn't that cut down on the realism? I want a game where my character is somewhat human. Any real person could not take 30 or more bullets to put down. Neither could their opponents. In fact, those Nazis must have undergone some kind of genetic splicing, as they all are some of the best crackshots I have ever seen. I could be standing at one end of a 50 yard bridge (as I have in one of the later levels) waiting to pick someone off, when all of a sudden bullets start whizzing out of the darkness right at my head! This is absolutely inexcusable. My enemies should have the same field of vision as me. And maybe, if it isn't too much to ask, some of their shots could miss their target once in a while.
  It saddens me that one of the greatest attempts at a realistic war game ends up being such a flop. I refuse to even look at the first game, despite the rave reviews. This is the closest I have ever come to breaking my PS controller. Back slowly away from this one...",2.0
"There are so many twitches and bugs to this game, I don't know where to begin.  Enemies have this uncanny and infintely irritating ability to swing one arm around walls while holding an eight pound rifle, aim it, fire about twenty perfect torso shots at you, and hit you after you have ducked behind a wall for cover.  This is inexcusable not to mention unrealistic.  Totally unforgiveable in my book.  Another gem is when you have the sniper rifle at night.  You can be crouched behind cover around 100 yards away from your target, and soon as you sight in on your target's head or chest, he will instantly turn and fire at you, even if he was completely unaware of your presence before.  Ridiculous!  Give me a break!  And the weapons!  You sometimes have what appears to be a model 1911 .45 cal pistol.  I have put 17 (yes, that's seventeen) torso shots into a German at close range before he finally died!  This is not uncommon, either.  [weak]!  Realistically speaking, one or two shots anywhere on your body from a .45 and you are going down, period.  End of story.  One in the chest or head and most die.  Whatever!  THE ONLY decent gun is the that looks like an HK MP5.  The game can be maze-like, repetitive, and simple.  You WILL GET HIT A LOT, but there are many health items.  I could go on and on, but I think the point is made.
This game is not even close to being the best 1st person shooter ever.  Please!  Not even close.  This review is the real smack on this game.  The narration and war scenes definitely add to the game, and the story is cool.  Overall, its ok at best.",2.0

Yes, it is true this game may have killer vidoes... but that's all it is basicly, When you start there is a tutorial that takes about a half hour to go through, (the whole time you're pressing X and reading) then you finally get to play and you are totally confused, And you don't really do much though the whole game but watch fights so it gets old VERY fast, because its always the same.
And for those people who think you can fight from a first person view in the battles that take place, just so you know you can't, and this game is for 1 player, (they could have made it two) The only thing this game really offers are good dvd films and a good sorty line.

"I recieved a Playstation 2 and Tekken Tag Tournament and Kessen for Christmas this year. I had never heard of Kessen before, or read anything about it. I popped in the game and watched the beautiful introduction video. Seeing that, I thought...cool game! That thought faded very quickly when the first ""battle"" started. It wasn't a battle at all, it was just a very long boring tutorial that you have to sit through if you want to understand the game because the manual doesn't tell you how to play at all. Thinking the game would get better, I sat through it for quite a long time. Apparently all that there is to this game is watch a movie, push X, push X, push X, watch a movie, push X, and so on. The actual gameplay was extremely disappointing. The main screen where you see all the troops was poorly made, and the ""troops"" are simply poorly drawn blobs that slide across the ground. And the DVD videos, while very cool, weren't anything special. I mean, come on, this is the Playstation 2, with DVD videos. Some of the videos I saw on the Playstation 1 looked better than these. So in conclusion, this is a good game if you're into war strategy games, but wait till the price goes down. There are much better things you can spend 50 bucks on than this game. All this game is is a graphical history lesson, so if you're into that, by all means, go for it, but I'm gonna pass...",2.0
"I'm not an avid Koei fan, but i was very interested in trying out this title, and in less than four hours i have beaten the entire Eastern Scenario, the controls to go from map to overview to ground level and back were cumbersome for me and it wasn't nearly what i had imagined from the reviews/previews i had read.  a game thats 1000x's more fun, and looks better is Dragon Force on Saturn, probably the most underrated of any system, it has so many amazing high-endthinking (rpg /stradegy) games..  soooo  uhm.. Koei seemed to forget people wanted replay value and lots of time/painstaking effort in enjoying their game... both Dynasty warriors and this were less than i expected.",2.0
". .  If it weren't for the fact that you just don't get that much in return for the amount of time you spend setting the game up.  The creator of the game spends a majority of the first 3 hours of ""game play"" giving you an in-depth look at Japanese history, and whereas this is interesting and all, it's not what I bought the game for.
I was looking for the old time fun of ""Nobunaga's Ambition"" (sp?) for the original Nintendo.  I used to spend hours tinkering with that game; playing and replaying different scenarios.  This game doesn't give you the option of deciding which battles to fight.  It just takes you to the next one and assumes that's where you want to go.
The animations are. . . good.  Not great; certainly not above the standard I've been seeing in other PS2 games.  The real drawback to the animations is that you get the same ones every time. .  If you fire a cannonade 5 times, you sit throught the same animation 5 times- and you can't stop it once it starts.  If your cavalry charges 30 times, you sit through the same animation 30 times. . .
On the plus side:  The whole game is attractive, with more detail per character (story-wise) than many I've seen.  And you DO get a MASSIVE  amount of history in the game (like it or not), not to mention a terrific glossary of terms and additional historical materials on the disk.
I'd have given this game 3 or even 4 stars if it had given more to me.  Unfortunately, more money and effort was spent on the animations than the storyline and playability.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE games that require a high degree of concentration, but this just got boring after a short amount of time.  Anyone have a copy of Nobunaga's Ambition?",2.0
"To tell you the truth, I disapprove of this game.  I like the graphics, yes, but I strongly sugggest one of the other Star Wars games.  It isn't very fun because of the difficulty of dodging enemy fire.  The level in the desert is my favorite.  Other things that I like are how it is:

(1) in third person

(2) starship weapons

(3) nice graphics

I suggest that Lucas Arts puts in squad-based air fighting or make the game a litle easier and longer.  Still, I am a big fan of Star Wars.  Good luck on the next game Lucas Arts!",2.0
"After reading the reviews for this game, I was all psyched up for a killer title - how wrong I was!!  The game is OK, but nothing like I was expecting.  Yes, the gameplay is simple and smooth, graphics are good, sound is great.  But where are the characteristics of a stunning game?  I've been playing space shooters for a long time, starting with the original Wing Commander.  The last Wing Commander I played (4 I think) had great movie footage, a wonderful storyline, multiple paths to take in the game, and a large number of missions, all of which were far more exciting than the ones found in Starfighter.  And that game was released a number of years ago for the PC.  To tell you the truth, I'd much rather sit down and play that than waste my time with Starfighter.  When will there be some PS2 titles that are actually impressive??",2.0
"When purchasing the game i heard all the decent to horrible reviewes it received, but i still purchased it. Dont make the same mistake i did, X-Squad is a truly bad game which makes you second guess PS2's capabilities (at least it did for me!)",2.0

"Alright, now if you've played the original Theme Park, and you are just wanting an updated version, this still isn't worth your money.  The original Theme Park is far better than this.  In this game you create your own Theme Park, which is pretty obvious.  This style of game is normally fun, but where this one fails is mostly in the interface.  The game starts you in kind of a tutorial, with building your first park, which is good.  Then after it gets into the game a little bit, it just stops, and starts telling you stuff that's wrong with your park without telling you how to fix it.  Aside from that, the roller coaster building could be much better, and usually is in other games, this one just tried something new and it doesn't work well.  The MAIN COMPLAINT about this game that I have is that absolutely everything you buy as far as shops and rides, has a set amount that you can have.  In other words you can only have a certain # of shops, a certain # of rides, only 2 roller coasters at all in the 1st park, and there is no adding more, which includes staff members.  In order to add more rides to your park, you HAVE to get rid of other ones after you hit your limit.  If you like bullfrog, and are just wanting a good game, go with the original Theme Park, or you could go with Theme Hospital which is fantastic.",2.0
"I was a big fan of the original ""Theme Park"" game, so I grabbed this one as soon as I got a PS2.  It's not bad, but definitely falls short of other Amusement Park building sims, such as Rolle Coaster Tycoon and the original Theme Park.
My biggest complaint is the restrictions in themes. Each location has its own theme.  You don't get to choose the theme.  You can't mix themes.  I think it would be a lot more fun if you could just choose from a pool of rides and buildings like in others.
The interface can also be a little awkward at times.  About the only really fun part is the 3d walkthrough of the park, and riding the coasters you design.  But that feature is available on far better amusement park simulation games.",2.0
"As an avid fan of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, I had high hopes for this game. Every aspect of this game is a disappointment. Graphics are mediocre and they betray the power of the PS2. The game play itself takes a while to get used to, and the controls are very unatural. While the intricacies of Roller Coaster Tycoon made the game exciting, the business aspect of Roller Coaster Theme Park slows down the game to an unbearable pace. When I play a video game, I shouldn't have to be a CPA to emjoy what is going on.
Sim fans should stay away from this game.",2.0
"The graphics in this game were good, but the gameplay was down right childish.  See I'm 17, and I was expecting something close to Roller Coaster Tycoon, but its nothing like that.  I'll just sum it for you : if your ages 0-12 this game is for you.  If your ages 13 and up and have a PC get Roller Coaster Tycoon.  But if you don't have a PC just pray that Hasbro Interactive makes RCT for PS2.",2.0
"I will give credit where it's due, this game does have good graphics and a lot of options.  But that's about it.  I was so dissapointed when I got this game home after having heard that it was ""the greatest football game ever"" and so on.  this game is such a waste of time.  if this is the best that the playstation has to offer then we're in trouble. The AI is absurd to say the least.  The dumbest plays happen and succede for no reason while simple passes often fly half way across the screen from where they're supposed to.  The computer constantly makes false calls that don't even have anything to do with the play. The play editor is complete garbage.  If you don't believe me, just make up a play and try it in the game. The commentary makes me want to listen to chalk grating against a board rather than the stupid things they keep saying over and over and over again. The dificulty setting is useless too.  The game is the same difficulty no matter where you set it, the only difference how many points you and the computer will score. I could go on for a long time talking about how poor this game is but I'm going to stop and actually go trade it in at EB now instead.  Maybe I'll get a worthwhile game instead, or maybe I'll just sit around and watch the grass grow.  That would probably be just as entertaining.",2.0
"Im a 20 year old male who thought roller coaster tycoon was awsome so when i recieved ps2 this was the first game I bought.  To even put the two im the same sentence is ridiculous.  The ps2 version is looney and requires no actual creativity and skill.  The rides are all predone for you and building a roller coaster is childs play.  Although my 5, 8, and 9 year old brothers do enjoy it even though the all prefer tycoon also.",2.0
"The only reason why I purchased PS2 over the Dreamcast is because EA Sports only writes games for Playstation.  And I usually love EA Sports games, but this game is just horrible.  I cannot believe that the same company that developed Madden would associate their name with this product.
First the positives: 1.) As usual the graphics are pretty good and 2.) the stadiums are customed to the team.  3.) The game play is challenging which could make for fun games.  4.) The one-on-one mode is great and features many of the all time greats.
Now the negatives:  1.) I don't believe there is no franchise mode.  That is just a terrible decision not to include the franchise option.  2.) The court is too small, whenever you spin or do a cross over move you go out of bounds or nearly go out of bounds.  3.)  And on that note the game play is not very realistic.  As just stated the cross over and spin moves are too wide. Also in the post you can't back anyone down (they don't move) and the post moves are not very good (no drop step).  4.)  The shooting is terrible, although in the 2000 version it was too easy to hit a shot, in this version of the game it is way too difficult.  Jump shots from 10-15 feet nearly never go in.  5.)  Also it is too difficult to get a rebound.  Your player can be right next to the ball and not grab it, while the computer's men all converge on the ball.  6.)  Sometimes the game does not want to let you dunk when you have an open lane to the basket or on a fast break.  You stop and take a short jump shot, and half the time you miss.  7.)  The menu operations are completely different than other EA Sports games (they need some uniformity).
I recommend that you do not purchase this game.  EA Sports should be ashamed of this game and should go back to the drawing board.",2.0
I'VE BEEN A FAN SINCE THE ORGINALLY STARTED ON SEGA.  THE OTHER PLAYSTATION LIVE GAMES WERE EXCITING AND FUN.  THIS GAME HAS NO LIFE TO IT AT ALL.  IT'S HARD TO GET A SHOT OFF IN THIS GAME AND AT TIMES WHEN U TRY TO RUNA FASTBREAK YOUR THE ONLY ONE RUNNING WHILE THE REST OF YOUR TEAM IS WALKING DOWN THE COURT.  THERE IS NO MORE PRACTICE MODE TO WORK ON YOUR SKILLS OR THE 3-PT SHOOTING CONTEST TO WORK ON YOUR SHOT.  HOPEFULLY THIS IS A 1 TIME ERROR BECAUSE IT'S THE 1ST GAME ON PS2.  THE PS1 VERSION IS ALL THAT AND NBA2K1 ON DREAMCAST HAS THIS BEAT HANDS DOWN.  SAVE YOUR MONEY ON LIVE AND WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR WHEN THEY WORK OUT THE KINKS.,2.0
"NBA Live 2001 is not a good game. That being said, I will tell you why by arguing againt what EA states are the games high points.
1) Motion-captured dunks by NBA star Kevin Garnett... I had no idea that Kevin Garnett had a policy of doing ""soft"" dunks. The true power of a dunk is totally left out. Its like your player goes up and calmly puts down a swish dunk. What happened to break-away rims and hanging? If the lame excuse for dunks has been attributed to capturing the motions of Kevin Garnett I say next time invest in any old jo-schmo highschool kid - the dunks would probably be better and have more ""umph"" and feeling.
2)Challenge Michael Jordan and other legends in 1-on-1 or 5-on-5 games...Who really cares? I say give me a fantasy season mode in which I can put Jordan back on the Bulls and Magic on the Lakers.
3) Unlock championship teams, such as 1972 Lakers or 1986 Celtics...OK, Ok, this is a cool option but I would prefer a franchise mode over anything. Perhaps the EA NBA live people should talk with the EA Madden 2001 people and learn how to make a real PSX2 game.
4) Customize players with everything from height to tattoos...They actually put this is a feature? For a 2001 PSX2 game this is what should be what's expected. On this game I think only about 35% of the PSX2's potential was utilized. Graphics are bland and after 5 games you have seen all the game has to offer.
Overall NBA Live 2001 just doesn't live up to the EA Sports name. It's a bad effort at best. Nothing really sticks out. An the game play is not that good. For instance when going in for a layup your players movement slows down. This allows any player to catch up and block your shot. Why the hell does a guy slow to a crawl on a fast break lay-up is beyond me. Take my word for it...rent this game before you buy it so you won't be shocked.",2.0
"NBA Live 2001 is a huge disappointment, I'm really sorry to say.  I really wanted a fast, uptempo, exciting game - this is the only basketball game on a console I've ever played - I'm thinking more like NBA Jam in the arcade, a long time ago.  But this game feels dead, and it feels like an unfinished product.
The controls feel awkward, and like I don't really have control -especially when one is moving ""diagonally"" with the keypad.  Trying to steal is too hard and unpredictable - the player keeps batting the air and can maybe knock the ball down to the ground, where the other player just shuffles to the left and picks it up.  The gameplay is really quiet, like you're always playing one of those mid-season games where nobody really cares.  Some of the UI is a little inconsistent, like how you can press the Start key to cut off an animation, but sometimes it just loads the Options screen, which is a major annoyance.  The animations themselves are weak, and the characters do uninteresting things like slightly shake their fists.  Yay.
NBA Live 2001, while playable, is just not exciting.  What happened?  EA Sports usually rocks - NHL 2001 and SSX are some great games that I bought without seeing and was really happy.  This one, I wish I could get my money back, but I already opened the package.  Well, it means that I'm not going to buy anymore PS2 titles sight unseen anymore.  Sorry, Sony.",2.0

For a system with a 128bits, you would think that E.A. could have improved the graphics a lot with all the time they had to work on it. Game play has not change at all and this disappoints me the most about this game. The need for a ""dunk"" button is ridiculous. Why can't you just go to the whole and score according to their skill. The only change that's noticed in the graphics is on the action replay. The only props I'm given for this game is the cross over dribble, Sega could have done better. Over all the Nba2k1 is a much, much better game. If you're able to put these 2 games (NBAlive & NBA2k1) side by side, you noticed right off that Sega spent more time in the designed room.",2.0
"I have bought every NBA LIVE game since I've had a Super Nintendo and every year EA has made great improvements, except for now. I read and re-read the instructions and couldn't believe that they got rid of the things that made this game great. The franchise mode was the best thing for NBA Live 2000. They also got rid of the 3 point contest and instead added nothing to the game except slightly better graphics. Why oh why did they eliminate the best feature of the game. Isnt it a must for sports games? When TRIPLE PLAY 2001 comes out I hope they don't screw it up and leave out the franchise mode and the home run derby. Whoever decided to get rid of these aspects should have been fired. Game play is more realistic because teams don't shoot 70% like they use to in older versions. Except for improved graphics, NBA LIVE 2000 FOR THE PS1 IS A BETTER GAME.",2.0
"I have to agree with nismofreak. I am a die hard F1 fan, I have every F1 game made for playstation. The one for PSX to me plays better. You can see other drivers qualify and also see their split times. In this all that happens is the qualifying times show up. The grafics are outstanding but thats it. The engine noise is annoying, gear selection is poor. They also really need blow by blow commentary. this is what Psygnosis has in their F1 that makes it more fun. ""Rent first then but.""",2.0
"I cannot believe the reviews of this game! For one, the PSX version of the game is so much better in terms of game play. I must admit that the PS2 graphics are stunning but c'mon! There is more to a game than just good looks.
For one, taking the BMW-Williams, the car does not have the real top speed of the real F1 car. And when qualifying, you are not able to advance the time. Am I expected to sit infront of the game for an actual hour??? Also, you are unable to watch the competition's lap time. Then, EA removes the level of modification allowed on the car. In the PSX version, you can control the amount of steering lock. That is now removed. For me to negotiate a sweeper, I have to induce lift throttle oversteer. And that, my friends, is a bunch o' BS! This game is not a similation. It is now a not so fun and boring arcade game! I regret buying this game and in the process of trying to sell it!

"When I got the game, I was all hyped up about it, because it was my first flight sim. It is a pretty good game. But after a while is got redundent and a bit boring. Here are the positives and the negatives.

Positives:

-Great plane graphics: inside and out

-Great bullet simulation: the g-force is really realistic

-Realistic missions: you have wingmen, etc.

-Landing and taking off is fun: starting the engine, throttle, etc.

-Awsome crashing graphics: tail or wing flies off and your plane is flaming

Negatives:

-It's very hard to learn the controls: basically it's ""find out for yourself""

-Unless you have a joystick, it's not nearly as realistic

-The guy who speaks to you on the radio is almost incomprihensable

-The ship size to your size is not realistic at all

-Ships are basically grey blobs with towers on them

-For one plane the controls are twisted

-The tail rudder hardly works at all

"It's very pretty. When it runs, that is. Which isn't often. I had so much trouble getting past the CD's security system that Microsoft eventually recommended I install the NO-CD Crack out on the web.
Running the game with sound on usually brings a computer-stopping crash one in every two missions. Turn the sound off and it's as dull as ditchwater.
The missions are quicklly dull and repetitive, despite flying from some very exotic locations. Landing on aircraft carriers is harder than it should be, because the aeroplane begins to waddle and sag around the sky like a soggy 747 at anything approaching landing speeds. That's just not realistic.
Many small ground targets are just completley invisible.
Despite being very pretty to look at in terms of cosmetics, it's too far short of having a reliable, interesting gameplay. I'm fed up with computer programs, particularly games, that simply don't work. I couldn't recommend you buying a car that only completed one journey in every two, so I couldn't recommend this program, either.",2.0

I uninstalled and installed it over & over again because I thought something might of happened during installation but nope. This game has many bugs for me and is very fustrating.",2.0
"My copy of this game was marginal when I first loaded it.  There are a few distrubing errors:  1.)  your squadron mates do not have any landing gear, 2.)the gunsight is significantly off-center, 3.)the bailout image flutters superimposed on the crashing plane, and 4.)the throttle starts up at 100% evey time.  In addition, my game just recently stopped responding to key or button strokes when launching rockets, bombs, or drop tanks.  Microsoft has tried to help (if you want to call them and spend 9 or 10 bucks reloading and discussing options) but assured me that all the games share the gunsight and landing gear problems.  Is this quality?",2.0
"I really don't think this game is worth $40.  $9.99 would be more fair for what you get, in my opinion. For instance, you find yourself repeatedly doing the following with every campaign mission: start engine, wait for it to sputter and start, wagtail all over the runway or carrier, raise gear, warp to battle area, shoot down enemies, warp home.  Over and over.  There really is no story line except for the war, which, to me, isn't enough because you know how the war turns out(!), and you don't feel involved in the war because there's nothing interesting about your participation except flying and shooting down enemy aircraft.  The briefings are too vague and the map is almost worthless.  There are no human voices except radio chatter that's repeated and just gets annoying. The Quick Start and individual missions are more interesting, so the game does have something to it. Microsoft could benefit from studying LucasArts' Star Wars game Xwing Alliance - briefings given by actors, compelling music, interesting storylines, a variety of characters.  The missions have a plot to them, much variety, drama and they're individually designed. I'm disappointed in CFS2 because it could have been great, and it isn't.  I keep waiting for the campaign to get interesting, but it just doesn't grab me. I'd buy CFS1 except that I'm sick of spending $40 and being let down!",2.0
"This software takes much more than an average computer.  The specs on the box are seemingly misleading.  I have at least twice what the minimums are and can't get the job done.  Without a GREAT graphics card forget about even approaching the games capabilities.
My machine is not even one year old and has good graphics capabilities and processing power.  It runs CFS1 without a single problem.  However, I am unable to even begin to enjoy the total package of this latest installment.  I must choose between great 3D terraign effects or planes that look like a ""rainbow of colors"", for example.  It is all in the choices (which are many) you are willing to accept.  I want to lose myself in the simulation but this can't be done with multi-colored buildings and ships.
While I applaud Microsoft's effort on this one, I and others undoubtedly will need to invest in the latest processing techology AND MORE to get our dollars worth.",2.0
"Good:  Graphics
Bad:  Gameplay/Sound
Unknown:  Plot
The graphics were pretty good, crisp, high detail, a bit dark though.
Gameplay, unfortunately, is terrible.  I've never before played with 1st person controls (up-forward, left-turn left, right-turn right, down-back) and a fixed camera.  Now I know why.  When dodging matters, this control scheme fails horrendously.  Running into the wall while trying to dodge because I can't see what direction I'm facing isn't a challenge, it's frustrating.  Now for cameras.  Cameras were usually WAAAAAY too close to the action, resulting in shooting at and dodging things you never even see.  Good thing for the radar.  And on to targetting.  The ""selection"" targetting by holding down the target button and selecting with controller is pointless.  If you aren't firing, you had probably better be moving.  Had this ""stopped"" time, it would have been a good feature, but as it is, useless.  The default ""closest"" targetting was often buggy, especially in long corridors.  One instance in particular in a long corridor I was constantly switching between two monsters WAY offscreen, (not even in radar, finally ran down and realized what I was targetting), while a creature right next to me was hitting me.  Now for music.  Was there music?  I never noticed.  The music in the original struck me as very creepy, and added to the mood tremendously.  I can't even say for sure that there IS music in PEII.
  As for Plot, I really can't say, as I haven't and don't plan on finishing the game, even after having completed the first disk.  To a certain extent the plot can't be that good, If I don't want to continue playing... but the interface is soooo bad that it could just be I have no desire to plod through a poor game, regardless of how good the plot is, or may turn out to be.
  Now, a note to developers:  Making a game difficult by having monsters move fast, take a lot of hits, hit hard and think smart makes a game challenging.  Making a game difficult by having terrible camera angles and difficult controls simply makes a game frustrating.  There IS a difference.
  Finally, I'd like to say that PE 1 was a MUCH better game, and I'm gonna have to ask my sister for it back.",2.0
"Alone In the Dark 4: The New Nightmare is actually only rated so low because of how amazingly similar it is to Capcom's classic Resident Evil 2.  Not just a slight similarity either, but rather strikingly identical.  Let's see, a man and woman both forced into a creepy location.  Check.  They both discover unusual and unexplainable monsters.  Check.  They both communicate through a radio.  Check.  They both go around searching for clues to understand the oddness around them.  Check.  Preset camera angles that made the classic RE series popular on the Playstation.  Check.

You see, this is basically a continuation of Resident Evil 2.  Maybe, and this is perhaps a really big stretch, this game would appeal to those who didn't think RE2 was anything to write home about.  However Alone in the Dark 4: The New Nightmare is such a blatant imitation of what I consider the real thing that it's hard for me to approach it with open arms and accept it knowing what Resident Evil 2 is a better accomplishment.

As for the enemies, the dogs look exactly like dobermans from the RE series, monsters that resemble the slow-paced movements of zombies from the RE series that creep around hallway corners in a similar fashion, and monsters that resemble drain deimos from... you can probably guess by this point, the RE series!  Impossible to believe such a clear ripoff managed to make it to the store shelves.  In a way the soundtrack resembles Silent Hill in the creepiness and even surpasses the Resident Evil series in the freak-out department, but otherwise just stick with Resident Evil 2 for the best survival horror experience.  It's like Resident Evil with way less action and more focus on the atmosphere and storyline.",2.0
"playing this games is very best and enjoy but i have problem to find the code at library ,",2.0
"Okay, seriously, there needs to be some straightening out here.

Let me get one thing out of the way first: I love this series. The first game blew me away when I played it, and I can't even play it now without remembering just about everything that happened, in sequence. The second game had a nice narrative, but fell far short from the original. I love it, but it deserves the following spanking. Allow me to explain. A few major spoilers ahead.

*Battle System: This is the one big, fat, 800-pound gorilla in the elevator for this game. Seriously, are you people REALLY so ecstatic that its real-time? Parasite Eve was an RPG, and a damned good one at that; ...this... is an action-horror survival game with some amount of RPG thrown in, just enough to earn the genre title for most. It's basically Resident Evil minus the zombies. That's it. The targeting is terrible at all times, the camera angles make it nigh impossible to target the appropriate thing that you want dead, and... well, it's way too easy. Once you've pointed at the thing, you just shoot it. Bam. Dead. Next one. I died, maybe, four times total, two of those were near the end of the game, and one was from that GODS-FORSAKEN MAN-FACED HORSE THING. In fact, I wouldn't even call this an RPG; it's just a run-of-the-mill survival horror, with less horror and more survival - and even that's iffy, because I was only truly afraid, maybe, once.

*Story: It's your atypical ""big bad corporation makes things worse"" scenario that's been beaten to death before this game, and has been beaten to death since. The only shining moments in this game are the boss battles, which provide just a LITTLE more difficulty than the normal fights (and, if you're a total perv, the shower scene; admit it, you whacked off to that too when you were that age!).

*Characters: Aya and Eve are the only two that stand out in this game, with Aya winning the race by a mile. Still, I would love to see how Eve turns out in The Third Birthday, but I doubt they'll even add her in, since she was sorta a side-effect in this game as well! Everyone else is, for the lack of no better words, forgettable. I don't even remember what the gun-toting redneck's name was! Kyle was wooden, would only show up once in a while, and barely did much of anything to advance the plot.

*Overall: This game was just plain forgettable. The combat only works when you beat it, the story is pretty lame, and the characters are boring. Worst of all, there's STILL no voice-acting (TWO LINES!! They were ""FREEZE"" and ""Hmm"". That's not voice acting!), STILL very little background on Aya beyond the ""she was in a car accident and got an implanted eye from her sister, who was infected with the Rage Monkey Virus or whatever, and now she can use magical powers that are vaguely explained which were 'awakened' during the events of the first game"", and someone STILL needs to give Aya some more personality!

Okay. I think I'm done. Now I need to go play the first game so I can remember what it was like. *deep sigh*",2.0
"Let me start with this.  I bought a playstation, a memory card, and the game JUST to play Parasite Eve I.  (1, not 2.) I had played it at my friends house and become totally wrapped up in the beautiful, amazing storyline when she moved to another state, taking my progress and everything else with her.  I only had a N64.  It took me no time to consider; I immediately ran out and bought the game.
I love Parasite Eve I.  It's the most unique, beautiful, fantastic, depressing, amazing game I have EVER seen.  Close to the 4th day, the characters are rubbing off on you, and you really feel close to them, as though you were actually Aya.  There are a few times where you get in a laugh or two due to what's being said, I.E.: (small spoiler) ""Is he really a policeman?"" ""If you mean, have we scientificly proven it, no."" It's just an amazing game!  I could go on for hours about it!
But.  I bought PE 2 soon after I got PE I, because of course, I wanted the sequel.  I expected more of what I had loved in the first- I'd already seen pictures and information, but figured that it could only get better. I was wrong. The game's CG movie graphics have become better.  But, there is a huge difference.  In PE I, you start off the game by having several movies lead in past the statue of liberty (beautifully done) and down to the theater, where we meet Aya and her ""boyfriend"", about to go into the opera. In PE 2, we hear her talk about what she's been doing over the years, and see a flashback while she shoots things in the shooting gallery. Okay.  This is my opinion, so don't kill me for it.  I have the gameplay system.  The shooting is obnoxious, you can waste a million bullets on something because they're just barely out of range.  If you have 2,000  bullets in your pack, but not in your pockets, you CAN'T RELOAD. This absolutely kills me in boss battles.  And the first real boss battle wtih that ugly-faced dude with all the ""mystery"" behind him is so obnoxious! He's laughing and snarling through-out the whole battle, in this really stupid way.  In PE I, you battle with a preeeeeeetttyyy evil chick, who's singing OPERA through the whole thing! Get the difference?!  the PE powers bite.  What the heck happened to liberate?! What's aya's excuse for forgetting LIBERATE?! <shrieks>  Anyway, if you like games where you wander around, shooting REALLY ugly monsters and people, go on ahead and play this game.  I own it, but haven't played it since I hit the desert, because I became so bored with the storyline.  Oooh, wow, a crying girl in the bathroom.  Oh, gee, she turned into a monster. BIG SURPRISE.",2.0

"I purchased this game after reading a recent article about the best games of the 90's.  This may have been a great game then, but it doesn't stand the test of time.  It may be fun for those who played the game when it originally was released, but it has little value for new gamers.",2.0
"I picked this up in a bargain bin because I had heard great things about Grim Fandango, now an admittedly older title.  I had also played a demo of one of the Monkey Island games and found it hilarious.  I greedily slapped down my ten bucks and looked forward to some fun.

The game is fun to listen to and watch.  Filled with yucks aplenty, Grim Fandango is like participating directly in a wacky animated film.  For this alone, Fandango earns high praise.  As with the Monkey Island games, the voice acting and humor is top notch.

Sadly, gameplay suffers.  If you read through enough reviews here at Amazon, you'll find that people like Fandango simply for its humor and style; most customers admit that they needed walkthroughts to get past the game's frustrating puzzles.  I'm a puzzle fan, and I like a challenge, but there were simply too many moments in Fandango where the puzzles felt arbitrary. Logic rarely led to a solution; only trial and error did!  For me, this weighed heavily--and I mean heavily--against the game.  Humor and style, huge plusses no doubt, should still be secondary to gameplay (or at least equal).  With Fandango, gameplay seems to be a less important means towards creative and hilarious ends.  You'll need to decide if this is okay with you. For me, it wasn't.

"This game was recommended for me after my satisfaction with ""The Curse of Monkey Island.""  As like the sequal, ""Escape From Monkey Island,"" it included a lot of ""Keyboard Punching"" with arrows and letters.

"I'm sorry to say that this game, based on one of the best books that I've ever read, is a terrible disappointment.  There is only one good thing about this game, and that is the graphics.  They were very impressive and crisp.  However, the rest of the game is a mess.  First and foremost, I beat this game in under two hours.  I wasn't even trying hard.  As I played the game, I noticed I was getting pretty far into the story (which will translate into a great movie but ended up a very weak one in the game) and I had been playing for only about an hour.  Next, the gameplay is awful.  Fighting another person with a sword is awful, as is the jousting.  There are other sequences riding through the castle grounds on a horse and a trip through an underground river that are sloppy, sluggish, and boring.  Every puzzle featured in the game is very simple, and yet the answer is annoyingly revealed to you by your partner, Kate.  All I can say is that you should only buy this game for any type of entertainment if you want to pay for the paperback that comes with it; otherwise, you're just buying a disaster of a game.",2.0
"I purchased 'Timeline' last night, and just finished playing it this morning.  I am STUNNED by the lack of difficulty, and the incredibly short story that this entailed.  I did enjoy playing it, primarily because I loved the book so much, and it was enjoyable to interact with the world that I had read about.  BUT, I have to say that from a game-playing stand point I am incredibly disappointed.  But, I was happy to see a game with little violence, and no vulgarity at all.  Too bad it didn't have the substance, the game-play, or the story line to make it a quality game.  A ""normal"" gamer would expect to play a game for at least a month... NOT a hour and a half.
If you are looking for a supplement to the 'Timeline' book, then by all means buy this CD-Rom.  It's a good chance to see the world visually.  If you are looking for a good game to play, look elsewhere!  Considering how excited I was when I purchased the game, trust me, I'm very disappointed that I had to write a review like this.",2.0

"Am I the only fan of the first 2 games that doesn't like this one? C'mon, underneath the funny intro, the vastly improved graphics and sound and the overall presentaition of the game, is there really a game that lives up to the first 2? I would have to say no.
The graphics, as good as they are, are way too cartoony. The jokes (aside from the intro) are either not funny or are non-existent. The puzzles are almost all really obscure. The plot is incredibly cliched (save the governer - AGAIN). I can't help but feel that had this been released almost immediately after LeChuck's Revenge with the same graphics and sound that it would be scorned apon compared to the other two.
Generally, I don't find this at all fun to play. Adventure games are one of the few genres where older games are still good for the simple reason that they don't need superb graphics or the latest technology. They need good puzzles and a good plot. They need you to get engaged in the characters. Just check out the first two games and ignore the lack of technology - they are much better. My favourite adventure game though would still have to be Full Throttle. Now THERE'S a game.",2.0
"Red Faction is a futuristic first person shooter set in mars. You play parker a miner in mars who fight against his employers. The game loads data and runs great, The graphics and sound are ok but the geo-mod technology is not as good as they said. The single player is very disappointing. It is a fairly long game but the gameplay is dull because of the poor level design, dumb ai and nothing new. It is not very hard but the designers don't know where the player would run out of ammo or health. Red Faction is very disappointing.",2.0
"I ran this game on a PC that exceeded all recomendations and I still had to run the game on the lowest resolution to avoid lag. I even downloaded new drivers for my video card just for this game and it didn't help. The game does fine until you fight an opponent with an automatic weapon and then the frames per second (FPS) drops down to below one.
  The idea of being able to blow holes in walls and things is a great idea and is the best part of the game, but the execution of that idea leaves you wanting. The engine seems buggy and unstable.
  The single player missions force you to give up all your weapons to go undercover, and it leaves you frustrated rather than excited. I haven't played the multiplayer due to a slow internet connection, but with all the lag in single player I can't imagine that it would be worth my time.
  In the end, I wanted to like this game, but just couldn't seem to do it. It had some good ideas, but ultimately failed to deliver. Better luck next time THQ.",2.0
"I bought this game because of the Geo-Mod technology, when I started playing I thought it was a really cool feature, but that's really the only interesting thing about this game. It's as though the designers spent so long working on the Geo-Mod that they left level design up to the last moment, and boy does it show. levels are built like tubes. You go in one end and exit the other. This totally kills the point of geo-mod, what's the point of blowing holes in the walls if theirs only one way through the level? Furthermore the rooms contained on the level are almost all the same, even if your not going to bother with plot (and they haven't) its nice to have some tactics involved. Weather it's sneaking up on enemies or going from cover to cover, I need something more then a flashy engine to keep me interested. This game will likely be the first of many, and hopefully those that follow will make better use of geo-mod.",2.0
"This game is not what it says it is.  From the start you'll be disappointed.  The lack of a save game feature and the fact that the enemy ""respawns"" from nowhere right behind you is bad enough.  There is nothing like playing for 40 minutes and as your just about to complete the level, you get shot in the back by one of these magically appearing enemies with it's ""cheap kills"" or even more likley the game crashes.  Since there is no way to save a game you have to start over.  The enemy A.I. is terrible.  Two guards standing together and only one guard reacts to your presence.  This happens with your first encounter and continues through out the game.
The worst part is the replay value.  No multiplayer and no mission editor.  You add that to the 14 missions that themselves have little to be excited over since they use the same buildings and basic lay-out and you have one boring game.  You played one level you played them all.  This is one to get when it hits the bargain rack or better yet pass it up all together.",2.0

"Alright, i had pretty good expectations for this game being somewhat related to golden eye, a great game, but just the crappy single player was just the start of my problem. I read about this game and heard the story, but there is more story in the mini one sentence reviews then in this ENTIRE GAME! First of all it is HARD not because of challenges but merely the lack of life. The guns suck, unrealistic, weak, no cool reload animations, and the bots are stupid. They may be accurate and with a lot of life and take a lot of work to kill but they are STUPID! they get stuck in corners, shot wildly until they see you and then kill you in one hit. the AI is terrible.  The biggest problem is lack of cheats, this game would be a MILLION times better with cheats, not because i'm a cheating loser, just because the single player is SO DAMB TERRIBLE that it's not even WORTH looking at! And the only way to unlock some of the halfway decent new guns and levels is to beat the missions which takes time, energy and absolutly BORING effort. Games like SSX with challenge that requires intelligence and exploring to find cool shortcuts, now that's challenge with a brain, Timesplitters is none of that... And finally, the one great thing about this game earning it 2 stars instead of 1 is the mapmaker! it is DAMB cool! This game should be a mapmaker for the PS2 with a minigame attached to it. Too bad that minigame sux.  PerfectDark is LEAGUES over this one. Screw the speed, Screw that graphics, we're talking gameplay and FUN here...",2.0
This game Has ps1 graphics all over it. Dont expect much from this game its not worth the 50 bucks. So if you want to buy this game just rent it first.,2.0
"After reading the reams of good reviews on this game, I became quite hopeful.  I am a HUGE fan of 1st person shooters like Goldeneye, and Medal of Honour. Most of the still screens I had seen of Timesplitters looked kind of quirky, not that I mind quirky, but when I eventually rented the game I was really disappointed.  I couldn't get into the whole ""time"" theme at all.  I don't like enemies materializing next to and behind me.  I don't like the level designs.  The controls are difficult to catch on to.  I could appreciate the graphics and the speed, but these considerations are subsidiary to me.  This game is neither reality based, like Goldeneye, nor is it fantasy-based, like Doom.  It is kind of a hybrid, with fantasy-type creatures in places like Chinese gardens.  Stealth is NOT needed in this game.  If you don't get into the theme, or the locales (which I didn't), you likely will not enjoy it, despite the advanced gameplay. Mind you, I didn't try the multiplayer mode, which seems to be the real highlight.  Even if you love 1st person games, RENT it first.",2.0
"Just a warning for those that aren't familiar with the Alone in the Dark series that they may want to try the demo first.  The reason being I tried the demo and have never been more unimpressed by a game hyped such as this.
Fans of the Alone in the Dark series might find the sequel entertaining but some of my gripes with the demo -
(And keep in mind it was the demo so I can't give you an idea on the entire game, but like I said, the demo made me determined not to buy the game.)
-- The perspective is constantly switched.  In other words, in one scene, you are looking at the front of the character, when he moves to another area (zone) that is downloaded, you are looking at him from the side, etc...  Each small area (zone) has to be downloaded and the viewing perspective constantly changes which is very annoying.
-- The mouse didn't work.  At least on the demo.  It was keyboard only.
-- Great FX on the character, but the scenery (especially the pouring rain) was TERRIBLE.  It was a giant clash comparing this beautifully, lifelike character with some aspects that looked like the old CGA graphics.
-- The gameplay system was very cumbersome.  It wasn't managed to give you a smooth flow when you are switching items, etc..
With lack of a better way to explain it, the game reminded me of an 80's game.  For instance, the downloading of every small parcel of land (zone) as opposed to smooth flowing through the entire area like ALL games today.  And as far as the horror/spooky theme, it was very cheesy.  I would recommend Clive Barker's Undying as a game that is everything this one attempted to be.",2.0
"Only being able to save your game a half-dozen times or so over the course of the entire game is bad enough.
But this game is ridiculously hard.  The combat engine is horrible, the weapons are ridiculously weak, and ammo pickups are rare, which is unusual since it takes around 50 bullets to kill anything.  And when you do run out, unlike in previous aitd titles, you have no defense whatsoever.  In fact, it seems like the only way to get anywhere is to constantly run.
I got it for 10 bucks and consider it a waste.  After having to wade through the same cut-sceens over and over again, i just got bored with it.
I give it two stars simply because it had some potential.  Unlike the resident evil series, this was genuinely scary. The atmosphere is nice and creepy, the use of a flashlight being a nice touch. That and the various monsters pop up out of nowhere, usually when you least expect them.",2.0
"The original Alone in the Dark game was truly innovative and set many technological landmarks for other PC games of the day. Oh how far we have strayed. This game uses the Nocturne engine and, like every previous game that has used the Nocturne engine, the end result is washed out graphics, horribly awkward camera angles, bad movement control, and the joy of having to fight offscreen creatures that you can't see unless you run to a different area. I can only imagine that the Nocturne engine is [inexpensive] to license.",2.0
"Okay. I'm going to do my best to be brief. If you are a player of PC games, you might want to avoid this game. From every angle it screams ""I WAS MADE FOR A CONSOLE!""  Very little attention went into importing this game for PC, and I'm afraid the bad outweighs the good.
The graphics sub-par.  In some respects, they're actually embarassing... After all the hype and all the screenshots, the end result looks like it was produced about five years ago. The backgrounds are all washed out and flat, and strangely pixelated.  The animation is generally terrible.  In some places, the fact that they attempted to pass it off as professional animation actually makes me hurt. When you backstep, it's like watching film of someone walking played in reverse. When objects overlap, you could swear you were playing, say, Space Quest.  When your character opens a gate, the screen goes black and then comes up again with the gate now open.  Aiee.
This should give you some hint as to the lack of care given to this game's PC incarnation: there are no options.  You can't select higher screen resolution, enable environmental sound, adjust mouse sensitivity or invert the y-axis... No, the designers apparently felt that such an array of choices would merely confuse gamers today, and in their generosity opted instead to allow you to configure a key or two and choose whether you'd like to listen in mono!
The saving system (that's right, there's a system), is bizarre and painful... for every amulet you collect, you can save once! I wouldn't recommend it, though, because whatever you did in the level on which you save, you'll have to do again. Yup, I'm not kidding.
The controls are awkward... They were clearly created for a gamepad, and only reluctantly assigned to a keyboard.
The voice acting is right on par with everything else, so I suppose they get points for consistency. Let's just say it won't help you immerse yourself in the story. The male lead shouts everything like Freddy from Scooby-Doo... and listening to the female lead is like attending a reading of the epic poem ""I'm a Large Plank of Wood"" put on by the National Association of Cardboard Boxes.  ""Carnby.  Please.  Come quickly.  There are things.  Terrible things.  I'm begging.  You.""
The game does have some good elements... the design is extremely strong, and I can see how, with some more work, it could provide the foundation for the creepiest horror game ever.  It isn't there yet, though, and what good it does have is simply overpowered by its problems.  It may work on a console, but on a PC, it falls very flat.  I can't recommend this game... I am a tremendous fan of the genre, both in gaming and in literature, and even I couldn't bring myself to complete it. It goes out of its way to prove that console gaming will eventually ruin the medium.  No, that's not fair, because Silent Hill was brilliant...
Honestly, if you're the sort of person who really enjoys immersing yourself in a PC game, this is likely not going to satisfy you. If you're looking for a truly spooky and atmospheric horror game for the PC, please go out and pick up a copy of Nocturne. That game reflects real care by the designers, and contains possibly the most effective interpretation of Lovecraftian monsters I've ever seen.
This game would have been wonderful in 1997. Graphically and aurally, that's right where it is. By today's standards, though, it simply doesn't measure up. A lot of these problems could be addressed in patch form, so there is hope... but I have a very strong suspicion that we won't see that happen...",2.0

Sadly with all the new features, Smackdown 2 comes with some cripplingly slow loading times, especially compared to the very speedy Smackdown 1. The season mode in Smackdown 2 takes such an exceedingly long time to get through just one week it is hardly worth playing.

"Compared to WWF No Mercy, or even WCW NWO Revenge, THQ have gone a big step down for these playstation versions.

First off, the controls are stupid, on the N64 they are easy, and you know what you are doing, on the playstation they are confusing and plays more like an arcade beat 'em up then a wrestling match. And I really hate the way you do specials in this game.

The Create A Wrestler was the first thing I tried out, it's ok, but too confusing, the lists are too long and numbered instead of telling you what it is. I couldn't even find a DX shirt to put on. The music is pointless as it only shows about 5 seconds of the titantron before it cuts to the next bit, I couldn't even find half of my fave. moves, yet there in the game somewhere and you can't even pick a height, you just have tall or short instead of the actual stat.

But what really bugged me about this game is season mode. It's confusing to even start one, but it is frustrating to have to have to go through every match of the show either watching it or simulating it, i try to skip them all to the match i'm in, but it takes too long with annoying music and then takes longer to load a pointless scene saying, ""whoever, had entered the building"" ... big deal, why did they do this? why not just do what has been done with the other 64 games and just go from your matches next to next instead of wasting your time having to simulate every other match, with no way to skip ALL events till your match, or have you spend about 10 minutes simulating through a show that you're character is not even participating in.

this game hit rock bottom and laid the smackdown on nothing but itself. Play the N64 versions cause these games are not down with it and thats the bottom line cause I said so.",2.0
"Let me get to it:  The wrestling engine, player lineup and create-a-wrestler are the most amazing things I've seen and are what make this game (except for 3-way or 4-way, because selecting which wrestler you are fightins is really annoying and those matches go FOREVER).
The thing I don't get is what's with the career mode?  It is simply the most infuriating thing I've ever seen. You have to sit through all the matches on your ""TV Show"" or ""PPV"" (of course, you can skip them, but that takes 2 minutes a pop, JUST TO SKIP!), and your wrestler isn't even always on!  Why do I have to sit through 7 matches that I'm not even playing in.  SOOOOO BORING!  Also, the cut scenes are an embarassment.  There's like 5 different ones, and they take so long to load they are not even remotely worth it any shape or form.
Hopefully Smackdown 3 will solve these problems.  If you have a bunch of friends and want to play this, get it, but if you want to entertain yourself, I'd wait.",2.0
"Despite the low rating, I should mention that there are many improvements in Smackdown 2 over previous WWF video games. The number of wrestlers available to choose from is the highest I've seen yet and they are incredibly up-to-date (even up to the Godfather now being the Goodfather). From a play standpoint, they now offer a wide variety of different matches, everything from a ladder match to a Hell in the Cell match to a casket match, just to name a few, which makes for less monotony. Learning the moves is incredibly easy, unlike some previous WWF games (like Attitude), which required the memorization of complex button combinations. Also, I love the Create-A-Wrestler mode. You are able to customize just about every last detail of your wrestler, all the way down to picking each and every one of his moves, so you can really customize your wrestler to your own individual tastes.
However, and the reason for the low rating, I cannot for the life of me figure out what part of the Season mode is supposed to be fun. Let me begin to list the problems with this mode. For one, I chose my own created wrestler to control during the season mode. HUGE mistake. I am now in June (so I've been through over two full months of matches) and my created wrestler still has yet to be in ONE match (his only involvement thus far has been in two, quick, one-minute backstage angles). So, instead you have to go through this terribly long, dull process of choosing ""Skip"" on all the matches (which don't skip immediately, you still have to stare at portraits of the combatants and wait for their life meters to go down), then go through the infamous  ""Now Loading"" period, not to mention you still have to sit through various angles, interviews, etc., which 98% of the time your wrestler is NOT involved with. In other words, literally hours and hours can go by in the Season Mode without you doing anything except for pressing ""Skip"", and waiting. I suppose some of this waiting time could be alleviated if you choose an existing WWF superstar to go through the season mode with, since the chances of your wrestler turning up in a match would increase. But there would still be far more waiting time than is acceptable, plus, why should you have to choose?  I am not a programmer, so maybe I'm speaking out of turn, but I can't help but believe that the season mode could be improved by
A) Have the season mode be more like the Career Mode in Nintendo, where it focuses only on your own wrestler so you are involved in every match (This is the best option in my opinion)
B) Allow you to skip the matches you don't want to see QUICKLY, unlike the current version where choosing ""Skip"" is still a several minute process (this was done in the original Smackdown game, so I know it is possible)
C) Allow you to skip entire events (matches, angles, and interviews) if your wrestler is not on the card
I simply can't believe that the developers of this game actually thought for even a second that it would be enjoyable for a player in the season mode to WATCH matches, angles, interviews, etc that have nothing to do with the wrestler he or she controlling. I mean, if I wanted to watch wrestling, I can do that every Monday and Thursday night on TV. If I want to play a wrestling game, I'd like to be able to do that too, but unfortunately, the way this game's season mode is set up doesn't make it very easy.
Having said all this, if you don't care about the season mode, you may enjoy this game well enough by just wrestling exhibition matches. However, to unlock various characters, matches, etc, you do have to be in the season mode which translates to an unacceptable proportion of playing time vs. waiting time.",2.0
"While the lastest and greatest wrestling game for playstation is much improved, it may be just a little too advanced for playstation, as it seems all you do is look at pictures of your favorite wrestlers while the graphics are constantly loading.  Once you actually get into the matches though, the game play is pretty fun, with all the special moves of each wrestler.  There is a need for commentary from the real announcers to give this game a more realistic feel.  Overall a game that I can't wait to see on Playstation2, because all the loading time won't be there anymore.",2.0
"Thank goodness that I rented this game.  This game is much better than the first Smackdown game.  The create a superstar feature in SD1 was a joke.  The create a superstar in SD2 is bigger and more extensive.  There are still major problems.  1) The color option graphs are difficult to use.  You only see the colors change as you scroll through the graphs.  Then you'll have to right down the number value for each color you chose for future use.  2) Once you've chozen and saved certain features, you can NOT change them.  I made three characters.  Each one took about 45 minutes to make, including moves.  After a few hours of gameplay, I wanted to change the characters names and/or entrances.  This can NOT be done.  The only way is to completely re-make the wrestler all over again.  If you didn't wright your information down, it will be another 45 minutes out of your life.  As far as the wrestling matches, Smackdown 2 offers many fun options.  Table, Casket, Ladder, Hell in the Cell.  However, the big draw of SD1 and SD2 is supposed to be the career modes.  The career mode in SD2 is actually WORSE than the first.  I can't understand why a player has to sit through wrestling dates that don't feature the player on the card.  You can skip the matches, but this takes time.  You WILL have to watch the all too brief cut scenes.  After 5 dates of inactivity, I used a cheat process to make myself number 1 contender for the Light Heavyweight title.  I finally got to play.  I, nor my other creations, were ever asked a question by a WWF superstar.  They weren't part of the story lines.  In the FIVE days that I rented the game, I only saw 1 of my guys in ONE cut scene. This is ridiculous.  A personal grief I have over SD2 is the inability of female wrestlers (other than Chyna) to go for WWF titles other than the Woman's Championship.  I don't know if this was a decision by THQ or the WWF or both.  I feel ladies should be able to at least compete for the Tag and LH belts.  There is only one major flaw with gameplay.  In matches where there is more than one opponent, the player has to manually change the focus of which wrestler he wants to attack.  This can get very confusing.  A player can wind up punching in the wrong direction or attack his own Tag partner.  That's my review.  I enjoyed my rental time, but I wouldn't pay money to own this game.  If you don't already have it, and you don't mind the old talent line up, I recommend buying ""WWF Attitude.""  If you have an N64, I recommend ""WWF Wrestmania 2000"" over ""WWF No Mercy.""  Read those reviews to learn why.",2.0
I have to disagree with the other reviewers.  I think that the puzzles were not mentally engaging.  The interface is very pretty but the challenge just wasn't there!,2.0
"RE Survivor was very disappointing for it lacked the thrill of the previous RE series.  I definately did not like not being able to see my surroundings or if I had a creature behind me...... I felt like returning the stupid game because it was one big waste.
So Please Please save your money on another game",2.0
"Well To start off, over all the game sucks. The Story Line is ok but it is more a BOOM BOOM BOOM story line. The Grapics are not as bad as they say, But its still boing overall. If it came with guncon support, and you could still walk around with the controler, it would have been great just because shooting the screen adds alot (for some reason) also CG cut sceens would have been nice. So this game is worth renting, but since there is no gun support a game the take 1 hour to beat (which would be ok if you could use the gun) Is only worth renting",2.0
"I saw this on the shelf and thought, ""a RE game, firstperson...for [not much]?"". I clammored to the checkout counter and raced home to pop it in. Now you have to realize, I haven't bought a game since RE 2 came out, so I was pretty excited. The first thing I noticed was the dark grainy graphics and the fact that you can only look left or right. There is no jump. You can't look up or down which is kind of a pain when you are trying to see the layout of the room. At first I thought it was cool to have unlimited ammo, but it takes away the jitters of entering a room not knowing if you have the ammo to clear it. I also kind of like that you didn't spend hours wandering around an endless estate trying to find one little clue or animation that would allow you to advance to the next area. I hate having to pay $2.50 a minute listening to menus just to discover where a screwdriver is. Then again, when you do find it, it's a good feeling. You could walk through this game blindfolded. There are no real obscure objects and they might as well have a blinking neon sign telling you everywhere you need to go. I searched all over and never found a typewriter. It seems that you can't save until you die or beat the game. This isn't really a problem because you get like 9 continues. I used 2 to beat the game, it took all of 2 hours! This was really dissapointing because it took FOREVER to beat the first one. I remember those hermit-like days huddled over my controller with the same expression as the zombies I was shooting. Remember the anxiety you felt entering the sewer tunnels where the giant spiders lurked? In this game there are a couple of spiders but they just sit there stupidly until you shoot them. What's the point? The coolest part of the original was that every time you thought it would end, there was a whole other area to explore. Well, Survivor has a few areas to explore but they only consist of 4-5 rooms each. The ending is also very obvious because it is completely stolen from RE 2. I also want to comment on the graphics, they were getting better and better, especially with Code Veronica, but Survivor looks pretty grainy, almost like a Sega CD game. I didn't find the shooting too difficult to master, in fact this whole game was very easy, way too easy and way too short.  There is absolutely no chance of you missing anything because if you push the L1 button you do a quick turn towards any enemy in the room. Once they are all dead, the same button faces you towards whatever items are there. These items are never hidden. They are always hovering, spinning and glinting light. There are a couple of instances where you can choose to enter different doors for a slightly different experience, but they always lead back to the exact same path. The annoying thing about this is that once you pick your path and try to backtrack, you are blocked and a sign comes up reading ""there is no need to go back"". What if I want to go back? It's like they're trying to rush you through the game. ""Here's you're items, we'll make it easy to kill the bad guys, here's where you're supposed to go now just move it!"" But it is a 1st person RE game, and that's just cool. As I say in my description, save the [money] and rent it.",2.0
The fact that you can not save your game is really a big draw back...you  can save only if you die...,2.0
"Let me begin this review by telling you that if you are going to start this game, prepare yourself to finish it. Put on some nachos or grab a large drink because there are no save points. The game follows the classic RE storyline, but adds a twist. This is a nice game to obtain if you are not digging the new plot-deviation of RE4, 5, and 6. Also good to complete your collection in the same vein as Umbrella Conspiracies. So, on to the game itself...

The game will take you anywhere between 1 and 3 hours to complete. Any longer and you should be checking your pulse. I was getting tired of not being able to save, mainly out of boredom, but I toughed it out anyways. My first time through I played lazily and ended up with a B ranking and 2:32 something. I have no intentions of improving on my rank, as the only interesting part is starting the game over with all the weapons you acquired in the previous run-through. A quick read through (or follow-along) with this guide : [...]  will help you get through the game very fast. It's so short that you can print it on one page.

________________________________
My pros :

* First-person shooter perspective adds a whole new element to the series, and actually is very scary. I yipped more than once when the dogs jumped up at me or the hunters were lunging at my face.

* The game follows classic RE style but with a twist in the story line that somehow still folds together.

My cons :

* Voice acting is BAD. I mean original RE bad. Maybe even worse. It's just gross!

* Graphics are a suckfest. Blocky, ugly, sketchy...REDC, RE2, and RE3 all look better on my TV.

* ZERO replay value. Like renting a movie you only watch once.  I heard there was a rocket launcher to obtain but that's too easy. Give me an alternate character or alternate story line instead!

* Disgusting side story. Why the developers thought they needed to concoct a story that involves abducting pre-teen children and cutting open their skulls for extraction of pituitary brain matter for Tyrant growth is beyond my comprehension. Disturbing at best, distasteful at worst.

"1.the graphics are rehashed from the other games mostly RE 2 only they look crappier.
2. the items are floating, spinning defiances of physics and common sense.
3. the motion capture is terrible, the enemys that are gifted with the ability to jump (a skill denied to the player.) the enemys seem to slow down in mid flight. the zombies shuffling motion seem to be all the more drunken puppet show than usual. everything looks like crap
4.the voice acting is terrible these people did not care about their job. it was like they were all bored. they all sound completly detached from reality. they have no emotion in their voices. except the sewer dwelling homless balding hobbit. it sounded like they had a grand total of 3 voice actors for the entire game.
5.the weapons are completly random, you have the Glock 17 and Sig Saur and a Berreta in the same group as a Nambu which is just confusing. and to furthor confuse you, you get a M70 grenade launcher which is almost useless. then a Spas 12 and a S&W model 19 revolver. and you don't get enough SG ""bullets"" like their the rarest ammo to find.
6. the 2 children in the game are stupid lilly apparently survived only because she apparently is so brain dead the zombies either except her as one of their own or fear her because she could make them dumber. and lott has the most anoying voice ever.
7. Game play is boring there is just massive dead zones with nothing there. for no reason except to take up game space. the targeting is just annoying the dogs are like crack head fast and will fuse with your legs after a period of time because you cant look down. and while they are down there humping your legs? they absolutly refuse to do damage to you. the zombies are just there they are no real threat. they are really more of a minor annoyance or target practice. the Hunters and Lickes are just epic failures due to their decreased intelgence attack and HP. it is the only RE that i know of that you can shoot a hunter point blank with the 9MM pistol while standing still and not only live but get away with fine health 6/10 times. health items are way to sparse competing with SG ammo in frequency.
8.the translations (the phone ""hang"" up) that is the line that says it all. ""I cant remember"" is stated at least four times like a rapid fire machingun of i cant remember caliber. is just blazing away. this is one game that i wish i could havebeen hit by one of those bullets and forgotten about it.
9.in  conclusion it is not as bad as the playable failure known as big rigs. its still pretty bad. but at least the enemy has AI. and there is some concept of physics and there is background music. but it doesnt play like an RE game. there is just one thing i cant get over it seems to be so laggy and slow.",2.0
"Graphics are terrible, the controls are clunky as hell, but it does have an anime opening. That being said, that's like the only good thing about it. Not to mention that the plot is a blatant ripoff of Ghost in the Shell.",2.0
"The Good: Nice anime cut scenes, lots of levels, smooth combat animations

The Bad: Clumsy and cumbersome controls, boring levels, lame objectives, no mid-level save, unfair checkpoint placement, flat ugly textures

Oni was a very hyped anime style game back in the day. This game was made by Rockstar before getting into the 3D Grand Theft Autos and other games. This game has a lot of potential, but is flawed in a lot of ways that make the game more boring and frustrating than bad. With that said, the only redeeming quality are the good-looking combat animations and challenge.

Right out of the gate you will notice that the controls are completely upside and backwards. All the combat moves are on the shoulder buttons. Why in the world they thought of this is beyond me. You actually don't really use the face buttons all that much. This make jumping, fighting, and shooting clumsy and cumbersome and you can't change the controls to something more natural. These are just some of the worst action/adventure controls I have ever used. The actual combat is fine, but executing these moves is a pain. I felt like I was stumbling over myself because I had to think about the controls. These just aren't natural! Jumping with R1, L2 and L1 are kick and punch, and you pick up items with R3. What?! I felt like I was trying to solve a Rubix cube, not play a game.

Secondly is the exploration factor. The levels are boring. They all look pretty much the same with flat boring textures and the design is confusing and labyrinthine in some levels. There's no direction and your compass is useless. The bar gets smaller as you get near an objective, but if you are two flights down it will act like you're standing right next to it. Enemies are stupid and clumsy, boss fights are frustrating, and the game just can't compensate its own design with the clumsy controls. I can't tell you how tired I got after just three levels of finding this colored console to open same colored door over and over again.

The story isn't really worth sticking around the 14 levels either. The anime cut scenes are nice, but you probably won't even get through this slog of a game. I tried really hard to keep going, but there was never a change in pace. It didn't help that there is no mid-level saving and the checkpoint placement is unfair. If you quit in the middle of a level you have to start all over. There are just a lot of annoying things with this game, but even if it was flawless you still have the fact that the game is just boring and not very fun.

When it is all said and done only the hardest core of anime fans will stick around until the end. You really had to have played this when it first came out, then come back for nostalgic purposes. The game is just clumsy and boring, but has so much potential if only the developers spent more time on the game. As is stand, I really can't recommend this to anyone.",2.0
"Before Bungie made Halo (the most overrated game of all time, aside from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), they proved that they most definitely were NOT the ""greatest developers of all time"" (as any ignorant XBOX fanboy will tell you) with this little-known blunder of a Third-person-shooter/fighter. Little known for a good reason, it seems.

This is one of the most aggravating games I've played in a long time. Not the ""good"" type of aggravating that you get from playing a game like Contra, where it's fun as hell, even if you die (and which results in that ultimate feeling of ""awesome"" when you finally DO beat it). Oni is the type of aggravating where 75% of the frustration and difficulty comes from the game itself, not because you aren't good at it.

Games like Oni are why I have very little respect for most American developers. ""Hey guys, I have an idea! Let's forget about making a game that's actually FUN, Let's concentrate instead on making a game as realistic as possible. SO realistic in fact, that it greatly hinders the gameplay, and defeats the main purpose of playing a video game! Oh sure, some people may say it's boring, but who cares? They'll be too blown away by the fact that the game is just like real life!""

That forumla does not work at all in making a good game. Let's list the reasons why:

-The movement controls are designed to be like a first person shooter, with the left stick for movement, and the right stick for turning. That would be cool if this was a first person shooter. But in a third person game with much faster action (not to mention jumping and fighting game moves too), this just becomes ridiculous. People with less than 4 hands will find this game's controls poorly designed and nearly impossible to master.

-You can only carry one weapon at a time. How lame is that? Some may say this makes it more strategic, but take a look at Half-Life: You can carry as many weapons as you want, and it's still full of strategy.

-Hypo Sprays, the game's way of recovering your health, don't have an immediate effect. Instead of having your health meter instantly rise to full, it sloooooooooowly works it's way up to the top of the meter. If you get attacked while you're recovering, you've lost it all. Bye bye.

-There's no block button. Blocking attacks supposedly occurs when you face the enemy and don't press anything, but 9 out of 10 times, this won't save your ass.

-The game goes WAAAAAY overboard with weapon limitations. The Mecury Bow, for instance, has a 5 second recharge time and fires a whopping...2 rounds before it's out of ammo. Even though it kills most enemies in one hit, it still isn't enough to justify

something like that.

-You can only jump from about 10 feet off the ground before you take damage from falling. Once again, this is just going way overboard.

-You have to press a button to pick up items on the ground instead of just walking into the item and getting it. Need I say more?

-There's a HUGE gun in the game which one of the bosses weilds. Once you beat him, you can use this weapon for yourself. The problem is, you (literally!) can only run about 1 mile an hour while you're wielding this thing. It makes getting from one end of a hall to the other feel like a drive across the country.

There are some good things about Oni, like the good voice acting, the stylish cel-shaded graphics, and the comic book feel of the game, but it's overshadowed by all the horribly annoying gameplay flaws. Not worth it.",2.0
"In Resident Evil: Survivor, you play an amnesia stricken man wandering around a zombie infested town looking for clues to his past.  The first thing you'll notice about the game is it's first person perspective and that the game was clearly meant to use a light gun prepheral but does not (yet it's Japanese counterpart does).  That major drawback, combined with the choppy animation, muddy sound, poor controls, and near none replayability, make Resident Evil: Survivor one big disappointment of a game.  It's worth playing if your a longtime fan of the Resident Evil series, but don't expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga.  Capcom has once again made another first person light gun aimed Resident Evil game called Resident Evil: Dead Aim for the PS2, and that game is quite an improvement over this piece of crud.",2.0
"I feel this game was a total waste of time resident evil fans took the time to see what this game had to offer and we get something that was probably put together in the spur of the moment. If they would have put aot more time into it then, possibly, it would have been a good one to add to the list.but with the horrible graphics and short screenplay lets just say I was glad I rented it first before I purchased it myself. I mean the puzzles weren't even difficult you didn't even have to back track like in the other games. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone due to the simpe fact that they put in no effort into this and simply let me as well as many other resident evil fans down.",2.0
"Actually if it weren't for the zombies i proabably wouldnt know that it was a Resident Evil game. This game gives RE a bad name! First of all its short! Short as in an hour and a half of gameplay for you first time playing it! Next is it has an awful story line! You a dude who lost his memory and thinks hes vincient (who is bad) and latter recovers his memory. Bosses..... im not sure if there are any,you run into Mr. X a few times but thats all besides the final tyrant......very easy! I just stood there while he ran in circles around me and jumbed over me and shot at him. Graphics.......hmmmm not good not good! Another thing is if your gonna play it and have a short ammout of time and think you can just play it,get a little ways in and save your wrong! No saves,nope none. Have i already said this game is easy? First time playing my ranking was an A. What about ammo,will you ever run out? Not in this game because you have unlimited ammo with the hand gun! Pluse you find ammo like crazy for the other guns! If you like playing bad games or are a huge resident evil fan get this game! If not forget it and play dino crisis2 or resident evil code:veronica!",2.0
"Oni was way, way too difficult to control. I found I had to set all of the controls to my own ways because otherwise there would be no way I would ever get through it. The only real value to the game is that is good looking and has a lot of freedom. Unfortunately, the effort to give you freedom gave the game ... controls. The game also lacked originality and a sense of adventure that I hoped would come with it. Instead, it was a game where if you were patient in playing it enough you could get through it. I think if this was the first version of the game, as the manufacturer I would be pleased, but would have long conversations on how to improve it. As a result, look elsewhere to spend your bucks.",2.0
"When I first read about Oni several months ago I was excited and wanted to play it instantly.  The anime style art and the story grabbed me as very intersting and developed and the screeshots I saw looked wonderful.  What I found upon finally playing the game was a disappointing effort on the developers part.
First of all I'll tackle the gameplay.  This is the area that drove me nuts.  I wanted to like Oni so much I tried and tried and tried to not let the controls frustrate me but the way the controls are worked out you constantly have to adjust the camera after turning because the camera and Konoko are controlled by the same analog stick.  The buttons on the controller have a steep learning curve and it will take you practically the whole game to get used to the movement.  Don't even think about trying to shoot while you are running as aiming is next to impossible and with no auto-tracking feature you are bound to miss more often than not.  To sum up the controls in one brief statement- They suck.  Another issue about gameplay is how saves are done.  There are no save points, the game automatically saves once you reach a certain point so if you die maybe 5 steps before the next save point, too bad you have to go all the way back and start over again.
The Graphics of this game look inspiring on paper however as one begins to explore the levels they become very bland and boring.  While Konoko herself and most of the characters involved are fine graphically, the settings are horrendous.  They are completely void of anything interesting and they seem to be the same mediocre sets from level to level.  This doesn't even take into account that the levels are not interactive at all.  Except for a few windows you can shoot out you can gun down some of the computers and crates and it won't even leave a bullethole.  Its always reassuring to know that in just a few years scientists have created bulletproof material to match the appearance of everything known to man.
The story is one point where I am mixed.  The background story they give in the manual is very dark and appropriate and I enjoyed reading that more than any other part of the game.  The actual gameplot is predictable but is horrible like other aspects of the game.  However, the story is far from gripping and in many places you have no idea what you are doing to further the plot.
Oni was a game with great potential however the controls can be so frustrating that you forget the storyline and spend more time throwing your controller against the wall than actually playing the game.  The levels are boring and bland with really nothing to do except fight battles and find control panels.  The battles will get tedious quickly with the irritating controls.  I really tried to like this game as it had such great potential, but after playing it for several days I can only recommend it if you are a big adventure fan or as a rental.",2.0
okay...I played this game and decided to take it back after the second day and get another game. Thank goodness I had bought it used. I don't think it was hard to learn how to control her in the training missions...it just made it wierd to try to aim and move and shoot with the analog sticks. I just didn't like the controls...plus the fact of this beeing my first PS2 game it didn't meet with graphical expections or desires. I went and bought sky odyssey and found it to be a much better game. You want a fighting game try Onimusha Warlords or Dynasty Warriors both are great.,2.0
"They came so close to a good game in my opinion. The game is adictive and fun. However, the controls are complex and the camera use is just plain awful. The amount of enemies and secrets is almost laughable. Of course, what do you expect as the PS2's first titles? The PS2 is STILL trying to get off the ground a little bit, but I think the true power of the PS2 won't be seen until Final Fantasy X arrives. Until then, most games we get on the PS2 may just be worthless.  Oni, could be a much better game then Rockstar did. They knew the controls were horrible and the camera was very insecure. To turn, you use one joystick and this will move the camera. The other joystick will move forward, backward, left (Facing forward), and right (Facing forward). This is no way to make a game. I personally tried to get used to it because I was enjoying the game until I got off one day finding my eyes bloddshot and my balance a bit out of whack. The game just won't hold you because of it's problems. Sometimes, I went into rooms only to defeat two enemies and find nothing. The ability to look through the walls only causes glitches and clipping.  Now for it's good points. The graphics are very well done and can at least can go up against Zelda 64. The animation is smooth and the use of pics is very nice. The voice acting isn't bad at all, and the amount of talking is pretty long. The story's not too bad either.",2.0
"I went to ... video store to rent some games for my new PS2 (Im so happy) and saw ONI. First thing I thought was 'GHOST IN THE SHELL' ... I rented it anyways: 5 bucks, 5 nights. What a deal. Hey, ... games? I WANT MY 5 BUCKS BACK! This is just another lame-GITS ... I had no fun playin this at all. First off the graphics are just plain horrible (for the PS2, or any PC), textures are bland and unimaginative, same goes for the blunt 3D-Models. The sound ... too, just a bunch of clicks and booms along with mediocre voice-acting. The music is so rare in the levels that when it does start playing it feels odd and out of place. It's about an enhanced police ... that has a 'mysterious past', ooohh. She's haunted by 'demons of her past'. There's an evil syndicate, and she's out to shut it down. Big deal. The levels make no sense, all you do is run around, ... guys and get lost. No real plot. This in an insult to Masamune Shirow and any Otaku out there. They might as well have called her Motoko instead of Konoko. For shame.",2.0
"For any of you that have already played siphon filter for the PS1 then I will suggest you go back and play it instead of reading my review of this game.  As many of you have already guessed Oni has the same general game play and feel as the aforementioned game.  Additional control was added to give the player more things to worry about during game play but otherwise not much has changed mechanically.  Now as for the storyline this game presents a classic, or should I say transparent, plot that does not develop into anything worthwhile.  Each level is more of the same thing with the foreshadowing functioning as subtly as a herd of elephants.  In short this game could only be redeemable if it had come out on the PS1.  There is no evidence of the capability, or the price tag, that has become associated with PS2 titles.
I would recommend renting this game instead of purchasing it.  There is little to no replay value and the plot will not keep a player interested for long.",2.0
"I love 3rd person action games, but ONI is NOT one of PS2's shining moments. first off the graphics are very DULL, there is no kewl storyline, as opposed to syphon filter, tomb raider resident evil ETC. and The controls really suck, especially for a action game. waayyy too many button schemes.
This is a blatant ghost in the shell wannabe, and not for TRUE ANIME fans. (you know who you are..)  if i had a choice i would rather buy EA's X Sqaud. it may be a lil' simplistic, but you'll get your $$ worth. i would pass on ONI and save ($) more to buy a DREAMCAST. iv'e seen much better games on SEGA's dying platform than the much hyped PS2.
BUYER BEWARE.. Rent ONI, b4 you buy!!",2.0
"Well what can I say.  This game doesnt really suck, but isn't that good.  The idea of a first person view was a good idea but this game lacked in several areas.  The plot wasn't very good at all.  It seemed as if the game was just thrown together to just put something on the market.  I'm a huge fan of the resident evil series, but this game was a real dissapointment.  My advice is to definatly rent the game first (it isn't very hard.  I beat it in one day).  If your a fan of the series then its definatly worth playing, but i wouldnt pay for it.",2.0
"Let me start off by stating that I got this game with the strategy guide, and I have yet to see what any of the pages look like.  This game is painfully easy and un-advanced.
In Japan, the gamers were able to play this much more like ""House of the Dead"" games, rather than in the US where it seems that Capcom wants to cash in on the American lust for first-person shooters.  The light gun is just something you CAN get for the PSX, but it isn't what you might call ""Standard Issue"" for the conventional hard-core gamer.  A light gun additive being required or at least allowed (I'm not sure if it is, a gun costs sometimes ..., and I have a few freinds who had problems playing this with it) would have made this SO MUCH BETTER!  Also, give us rapid fire for the guns!
Also, while I have seen much worse, the graphics can use a serious polishing.  Also, the animation is distorted by the fully 3-D world, and the first person view destroys all fear techniques used so well before.
The sound is terrible.  To start off, there is really no decent music like in RE's 2&3, the music in here is really both bland and pathetic.  Also, the voice acting is pretty bad, but I'm sure that it would sound a whole lot better if it didn't sound like you were listening to them underwater. However, while the sound it awful, it's nowhere near as completely worthless as much as the sound in the first RE title(mainly the beyond dismal music and voice acting).
Now, the story, well, actually, it's not so bad.  It does have a really good setup and a few good plot twists, and also the main character was told to investigate by his freind Leon S Kennedy (the hero of RE2 who could with one finger kick Chris Redfeild's ...!)!  Also, the area's that are only accessible through replay have some excellent files that rival the best of RE's 2&3.  However, the decent (although terribly short) storyline is destroyed by all lack of realism in the gameplay.  I mean face it; you fight a Tyrant only 20 minutes into the game, the puzzles solve themselves, enemies can't hit you when they are directly behind you, and even if they could, you have SO MUCH health, and you generally start off in the same basic location when you start with your next ""life"".
All in all, this game is far from worthless, but even further from being able to hold onto the ""Resident Evil"" title it holds.  I liked the first one, I was blown away by the second, the third one rocked my world, and now...this.  I'm now just waiting for Code Veronica for the PS2, while playing something else.",2.0
"Many of the reviews are right on the money with this game. I was very disappointed with this game. I cuurently own all of the Playstation versions of RE and was happy with the series up until now. I highly anticipated this game after I had completed RE3. When it came out, I heard that it was a cousin to the dreamcast release of Code:Veronica. Well, Dreamcast gets alot of points over playstation for having a better game. My first disappointment was the firstperson point of view of this game. The second was the length of the game. When I bought this game, I was ready to spend a couple weeks on another RE title. But this one took about an hour to beat and left me wanting more and more. That may be one good point of this game, that it left people wanting more of the classic style RE. Which brings us to another point. Although the storyline adds to the RE series by bringing us to a remote island owned by Umbrella, where ( ironically) the Code:Veronica game takes place, they happen to leave no possibility of any future stories on this island by the end of the story. I think any future RE titles would have to expand to other locals, which in my opinion, would just be a little too much in a series that has been a great story up until now. Long story short, if it weren't for Silent Hill, I probably would have given up on the whole RE gaming due to this latest title.",2.0
"Please do not buy this game. I bought it just because it said Resident Evil on the cover and it ended up being a big mistake. First off the controls are horrible. There is no strafe so you have to turn and move,and it can get really annoying when the enemies circle around you. You can only aim slightly up or down,but no matter where you hit a monster it gets hit in the chest. The graphics are also sub par, resident evil 1 had better graphics and it's like 3 years older than Survivor. The worst thing about this game though is the save system, the only thing it saves is the guns, and herbs you have, not where you are. So each time you start from the very beginning, which means going through the cut scenes all over again. It's also a highly repetitive game, there are no puzzles, or interesting settings, just shooting, and the shooting isn't even that fun. The only reason I gave this game 2 stars is because it's plot does add to the Resident Evil universe and because shooting zombies is always fun, even when done horribly.",2.0
"Maybe it is just me, but I feel that WWF No Mercy is the one that most appeals to a limited crowd. From what I see, it's either you enjoy wrestling and love this game, or you hate/couldn't care less about wrestling and you don't. I happen to be in the latter category, and so I feel that there is nothing about this game that I really enjoy. I really don't think there are anything in this game that would appeal to other non-wrestling-fans except for the fact that it is easy to pick up and play. Being a non-wrestling fan, I don't really understand what exactly the crowd meter thingy is for. You could be beating the life out of the opposing wrestler, yet your relation with the crowd is relatively low. I highly doubt that any other non-wrestling-fans would know what it is either.

That is not to say that there is nothing fun about this game. As I said, the game is very easy to pick up and play. After a few rounds of button mashing, you would be able to figure out that A is to grapple and do whatever other attacks you have, and B is to just beat the living crud out of each and every one of your opponents. Yet if you are not familiar with how to end a match, then you'll likely just attack for a while until your opponent gets seriously bloody. Constantly pressing B just to turn your opponent into a bloody mess gets old if you keep on doing it for several minutes. And controlling characters on a semi-3D environment just does not feel natural. Sure, I don't mind the fact that the game keeps you locked onto an opponent at all times, but it is moving around that gets tedious.

WWF No Mercy was probably the most realistic wrestling game back in 2000. There are authentic entrances with authentic entrance music as well as authentic game modes. Yet to be completely honest, I don't really care. The graphics are more gritty and realistic than Asmik Ace and Aki's previous two wrestling games (1998's WCW/nWo Revenge and 1999's WWF Wrestlemania 2000), and the characters models don't look like faces painted on blobs like earler wrestling games. In other words, they actually look like people this time around. However, they still don't look very good. Stephanie McMahon looks like a zombie, or somebody really ugly wearing a lot of makeup. Crowds are no better than previous Asmik Ace/AKI wrestling games. They don't look like cardboard anymore, but they are just really ugly, really pixelated sprites instead. Sound effects are a bit laughable. It's just ""BOOM! KAPAM KAPOW!"" Yeah. It's not that I have anything against this game, but I just don't find it that good. It still is the best of the Asmik Ace/Aki wrestling games. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I actually watch wrestling. Hey, at least from the critical success, it establishes the Nintendo 64 as the premiere system for wrestling. That is something to be proud of.",2.0
"Thsi is a nice game, its fun for a while, I'd give it 5 stars except for the fact that the memory is SCREWED UP.  you can win a title match, but when you go back to the screen, its gone, you can create special characters and when you go to select them, they're gone, it dosen't have the in-ring celebration as WM2000, but it does have post-match celebrations.",2.0

"This game has received some pretty terrible reviews elsewhere, and on the whole I'd have to agree with them. Graphically the game is very pretty - well done movie sequences, very crisp and colorful backgrounds, smooth, fast motion, etc. The story is OK, if rather linear and limited. The game engine is not too bad, although again limiting. But what really kills this game is the personalities of the characters. After you've been subjected to the umpteenth replay of some video sequence where the utterly obnoxious lead characters try desperately to outdo each other in seeing who can be the most irritating, you really begin to hope that they will all shortly die horrible deaths at the hands of the next monster they face. Unfortunately this is rather unlikely since on the whole the game is pretty easy to complete. Save this one for rental: you'll finish it in a couple of days. Or get something else - Summoner, while flawed, is a much more engrossing RPG game. There's even FF-9 if you can face turning the clock back to PS-1 technology.",2.0
"I love role playing games, and the Playstation 2 graphics were incredible on some of the other games we've played. When I popped Orphen into the CD player, I was really expecting something spectacular. Unfortunately, the game didn't quite live up to the promise.

You play a male, Orphen, in his late teens, who is a loner with an attitude. He has a brother-sister pair with him, Cleo and Magnus, who spend the entire time sniping at each other and at him. ""Shut up,"" he snarls at them. ""Well, duh!"" the girl cries out in response to something else. When water breaks in, her panic cry was not of the danger they were in, but ""My favorite clothes!!""

Their two 'bodyguards' aren't much better - with their bickering, I actually cheered when a monster crab grabbed one and threw him into the water. I kept hoping that one would grab the annoying siblings as well, and get rid of them. Come to think of it, even the main character needed a good swat in the head.

The magic Orphen uses is intriguing. His weapons have names like ""Bite of Lightning,"" ""Sword of the Fallen Devil,"" and ""Hand of Pyro."" You don't have to remember their names - he cries them out quite often enough. That's when you're lucky enough to be in combat ... a lot of the time the game simply freezes when you're moving, going into a pre-set series of actions that mostly involve the main characters yelling at or picking on each other.

If you could only skip through them, it might be playable. But you can't.

The graphics are reasonably good, the monsters you meet are interesting, but there isn't anything to move you along through the game, except for the desperate hope that SOMETHING will come along and knock some sense into the characters. Unfortunately for everyone involved, this never happens.

If you're looking for a great RPG, I'd wholeheartedly recommend Final Fantasy IX over this game. If you already have FFIX, then you might rent this one to understand just how good the FFIX team really is.",2.0
"the attemt to make the game exciting by putting a lot of stupid puzzles makes this game a not very fun game at all. the battle system is alright and i like the anime sequences that take place. its rather annoying when you get trhough little puzzles, maze like areas that take you ages to figure out. Im used to the experience points and equiping weapons you bought or forged, since its in most other RPGs that ive played. also the fact that you cant skip movies makes it annoying when you die after watching a long movie because you have to watch it again.",2.0
"I rented this game thinking that it would be a great one but, guess what? it isn't.
It focuses a lot on the story. A bad thing about this game is that if you do not understand english or if you can't make the TV make any sound you will understand nothing about the game story. You can't read what the characters ar saying, you can just hear it.
You can save the game only in determinated points and sometimes it takes too long before you can save again.
The fights are one of the things I most disliked about this game. While in a battle, you're standing still and you can't move. You can just attak or shield yourself. There are a lot of monsters attaking you at once and you get killed too easy. There is only one attak that is really effective but it's still to hard. Once you're killed your game is over and you have to load the previous saved game and start over from your last save. If you won some difficult battles before you got killed and you couldn't save the game after that, you have to win them again. Also you have to go trough some places over and over or watch the same story over and over again if you weren't able to save.
You collect some items to attract some monsters or to heal yourself but you actually can't use them during a battle.
It also is like Pokemon in some way: you have different attacks types (electric, fire, etc.) that are good against some types of monsters.
I really don't recomend this game but if you don't believe me, rent it. You'll see what I'm telling you.
Rent before buying :)",2.0
"This is one of those games that was all hype and nothing to back it up.  the previews looked amazing but the aftermath is that Orphen has ver dissapointing gameplay.  the only good thing about this game was the battles. the battle system was very innovative and fun to learn, however this game will dissapoint even the most hardcore fans of the anime.",2.0
"This game is what's wrong with so called RPG's today, or any game as a matter of fact. In an RPG i thought that it was Role Playing, not some kind of comic book.

The save points are at the most random spot's of the game and the cut scenes are just horrible, the voice acting to the dubing. And they are BORING, if you die you have to watch them all over again, and you can't skip them. Don't buy this game, watch the anime, it is basicly the same thing!",2.0
"From the first BOF down to this one, the quality has gradually declined. Sure, it looks prettier than it used to, but with few weapons, fewer spells and less variety with each passing episode, the series is looking more than a little thread-bare.
The combat system is good, though it hasn't changed hardly at all since the last time. The spells and skills are copied more or less directly from number III, including such goodies as Flare, Jump and other low-cost, useful abilities. The multi-elemental spell thing was cool but made less useful by the inclusion of a variety of useless or near-useless combinations. Some of the high-power spells require the combination of elements boss-level monsters are immune to and do an overwhelming amount of damage to regular monsters; they simply aren't necessary.
The monsters are just slighter higher resolutions of old beasties from the last three games and the dragon spells, while nice to look at, just aren't all that useful or interesting. I used them once and then stopped using them alltogether.
The fairies are about the only thing that's improved over the last installation, with multiple uses for fairies and the opportunity to build a significant and powerful attack force with the fairy spells.
The movie clips were a nice touch, but they aren't as good as some other RPG movie clips. Check out the new Chrono Trigger/FFIII disc and you'll see what I mean.
On the whole, it just wasn't all that great. Still, I've now defeated all four games several times over. When BOF V comes out, I'll check it out before buying it, though.",2.0
"Graphics: 5/10 - The colour shading is nice when you're playing outside, but for the rest of the time, this looks pretty effortless and droopy. It's also hard to see where a passage leads.

Value: 5/10 - Most racing games are worth the money because they're entertaining, but to make a long story short, this one isn't really worth paying for unless you're a really big fan of the muppets.
Overall: 5/10 - This is the sort of game you play in the game or record store while your waiting for Mum to finish her grocery shopping. In a game where you can hardly see where you're going, is it worth even playing? Yes, but only if Mum takes a couple of hours to find a broccoli stick.",2.0

There's really no challenge in this game. POINTLESS compared to Resident Evil where you have to save every bullet to kill the zombies. In this game you just run around shooting dinos that always re-apear seconds after there dead.

"Okay. I've always liked Megaman, but this one made me think that megaman isn't for the world of 3-D.

X's old friend,Zero, that was his friend in almost every game, isn't in it. but I will say this: It was all right, but I think they took half an hour into making this game, so they could just put it in stores so the world would shut up. Even though playstation is meant for 3-D, it should be side scrolling. then they could probably take out the 3-D and give it awesome features. I've bought every single Megaman game, even the ones on the old NES, and bought all of them on super nintendo, and on playstation, and nintendo64. But if they make it on PS2, and I know it will be in 3-D if they do, it should be a million times better than this. Save your money and BUY SOMETHING ELSE!",2.0

A friend I work with had played Civilization 2 which is another Sid Meier game that did exceptionaly well, but after he played this game for 2 weeks, he gave up. there was just too much stuff to learn and what certain things did was not clearly described which left alot of guessing. What he and I did learn while playing the game was that the story was good, the graphics are good, and the game was well thought out. But the overwhelming things you had to learn just took it's toll which probably explains the lackluster sales of this game.",2.0
"I have played through both the original System Shock and System Shock 2 to completion.  Having done so, I have to say that SS2 is one of the most over-rated games in history, and every time it shows up on some game magazine's ""overlooked works of genius"" page or the like, I want to scream.

First, let me get it out of the way: Yes, the story is very good (and I was particularly struck by the plot twist that introduces your ultimate enemy.)  Yes, the sound design is good.  Yes, the atmosphere is great- very spooky, very isolating.

But it's one thing to feel that your enemies hate you, and another entirely to feel that the _game_ hates you.

There are a dozen little ways this comes off, like that you can HURT yourself by running into things, and make it WORSE by increasing your agility stat and thus your speed.  I do believe that's a first for First-Person-Shooters, and _please_, for the love of God, let it be the last.  There's the fact that you can be shot a dozen times by an enemy, and when you finally kill him, mysteriously discover the weapon he was firing on you was not only devoid of ammunition, but broken to boot.  There's that the game's system explicitly _expects_ you to die repeatedly (if you have enough money you get restored to life at a sort of save-point, more on that later.)  There's a sequence that has you running back and forth trying to find a series of numbers for a passcode, one number per location, and all the while, the monsters keep up their infinite respawn while you're about your busy-work.  (What would have been the problem with your so-called benefactor putting the entire code in one location?...)

But ultimately, it comes down to economics.  The designers were so terribly afraid that the player would, at some time, have an EXCESS of something, that they overcompensated the other way.

The money of the game is called nanites, and ultimately, they're used for everything.  Die and get restored to life?  Cough up some nanites.  Want to open a locked box?  Cough up some nanites... Oh, and by the way, all that box contains is slightly fewer nanites than it cost you to try.  (Why did someone put a security lock on the equivalent of a nickel?  One of those great mysteries, I guess.)  Out of ammo?  Go to the vending machine, and cough up some more nanites.  Or you could hack the machine- for yet more nanites- and then it would give you LOWER PRICES!

I don't know about you, but when I hack something like a vending machine, I expect to get something for free.  I guess I'm silly that way.

And even if you have ammo, your gun might just break, given the uniquely corrosive qualities of the atmosphere on the ship.  But don't worry, you can buy a repair tool- for a few nanites!  (Though repairing a weapon degrades its quality, and makes it more likely to break down in the future.  Thanks, guys.)

Poisoned?  Your fate is sealed, unless you buy an antidote.  More nanites!  Or you can buy a recycling tool, and discover that what it gives you for recycling most items wouldn't buy you a lousy soft drink.

Maybe you're a psionic, using the awesome, infinite powers of the human mind as your weapon?  Great- but restoring your psychic energies means buying a psi-restoring potion.  More nanites!  For all the talk in the manual about making psionics more than ""just another gun"", this particular aspect succeeds in making them _exactly_ that, and a gun much like the others that is going to fire twice and then need to be switched out for something that still has ammo.

And isn't broken.

And you have the skill to use.

After a few rounds of ""BANG BANG click click <switch> BANG BANG BANG click <switch> ZAP ZAP ZAP click click <switch>"" you realize that what's making the hairs on the back of your neck stand up isn't terror, it's IRRITATION.

A simple equation: Infinite, respawing enemies + Finite resources = game that hates you.  Is it really so much to ask that a foe that's been shooting you have ammunition on them?  Especially if you're going to have to face an unlimited supply of them?

There's a moment in most games of both the RPG and FPS genre near the end where you feel that you are _ready_.  You're bad.  You've got the best weapons, a full stock of ammunition, the best spells, or whatever- you've learned the tactics you need to take on foes over many hours of play, and you know that what's coming up is going to be hard and it's going to take ingenuity and everything you've got.  But it's going to be fun and you have what you need to make it possible, and you're ready.

In System Shock 2, that moment never comes. The designers were too afraid of the player having an excess, and as a result, you never have _enough_.  Not even at the end.  You've been nickeled and dimed through the whole game by poison, by the unending tide of zombies, by busy-work, by hacking or lockpicking things that turned out not to be worth the sacrifices, by taking damage in places you didn't expect, by reloading and repairing weapons that break down at a fantastic rate... And ultimately, that's not scary.  It's frustrating.  It's irritating.  It's wearying.  But it's not scary.

And yes, I finished the game.  No, I felt no compulsion to play through it again as a different type of character.

There's other little things, like that they replaced the ungainly but interesting pseudo-VR hacking of the original System Shock with a guessing game somewhere in complexity between tic-tac-toe and minesweeper.  Or that the only thing your character actually says for the entire game deflates the tension of a climactic moment for the sake of a dumb joke.  Or that the bad guys seem to offer you the opportunity to ally with them, but the designers never considered making that opportunity a real one...

I've said more than enough.  Pick up the original Deus Ex if you like games of the genre; let this ""sleeper hit"" continue sleeping.

P.S.  At least two of the _positive_ reviewers have blithely stated something along the lines of ""Well, yes, it's so hard you have to use cheat codes to complete it, but...""  Do you guys really expect so little of game designers that you're willing to forgive this kind of grotesque mis-design in pacing and difficulty?  Are you so desperate for games with an actual storyline that you're willing to ignore enormous flaws?",2.0
"I never cared about multiplay for this game, I don't mind the difficulty (in fact I enjoyed it), and I thought the graphics were fine (especially for when it was released).  Having been a huge System Shock 1 fan, I was first in line (pretty much literally, too) to buy this sequel when it was released, and for the most part I absolutely loved it.
Now let me qualify ""for the most part"".  That means everything until about three major levels before the end, at which point the game completely buried itself.  To this day, I even remember the specific point at which I realized it had passed the point of non-redemption: where you found several very tall columns sliding up and down that were supposed to be (ahem) ""teeth"", and you had to jump across them a la 80's side-scroller.  The ending of this game (along with the couple of levels immediately preceding it) was so incredibly god-awful that I have to ding not 1, not 2, but *3* stars.  It it just that bad.
An ending this bad, that ruins what was a masterpiece of a game leading up to it, is nothing new in computer games.  In fact, one of the highest-profile examples of it is quite similar to SS2, and that is Half-Life.  Now, if you're the type that's able to overlook a game's ending and enjoy just portions of the journey for their own sake, then you'll likely enjoy this game more than 2 stars' worth.  However, if you're like me and can think of few game design sins worse than a horrible ending, than my rating stands.  SS2 started out as one of the best sequels I'd ever played, and ultimately ended as one of the most disappointing.",2.0
"I bought this game after playing the demo and reading several reviews, which all lpretty much made it out to sound pretty good.  I've played it through and am content to say that the only ting that it really has going for itself is a good story line and reasonable sound.  The enemy graphics and the cutscenes stink.  The weapon graphics as they fire are awful.  Imagine an EMP Rifle.  What do you see.  A beam of energy.  This thing in the game fires a giant floating blob of blue with points at the sides.  Pretty dumb.  Whenever someting gets shot, it dies.  Shoot it in the head, shoot it in the foot, shot it in its little pinky, same effect.  The role-playing is totally limited, this is not a first-person shooter for anyone with experience.  The multiplayer stinks, as it is only cooperative and requires your friend to have a copy and an equal-speed modem.  If you want a role-playing game with action, get Deus Ex or Sacrifice.  If you want a first-person shooter, get No ONe Lives Forever or Unreal Tournament.  Be smart!  Even though it is inexpensive, I would never suggest buying this game.",2.0
"This game has many positive aspects as detailed by other reviewers, but was just too violent for me. I found the images of severed heads and limbs disturbing. While the game does have some good strategy elements and character development, in the end it is a first person shooter and your main activity is killing. The plot was very good and kept my going long enough to finish the game. I guess I should stick with Lucas Arts titles.",2.0
"The only game harder than this is the ridiculously difficult ""Aliens vs. Pedator"" (that's right, hardcore gamers, play it on the ""extra hard"" setting). S.S.2 is too freakin' hard for its own good. Not to brag, but I am very good at games like this but C'mon already!  ""It's so creepy"" - Yeah, especially when enemies appear from nowhere and smoke you quicker than a lightning bolt.  ""But you have guns and stuff"" - that break 5 seconds after you use them and try finding ammo when you need it. Health Packs - finding them is one thing, having time to use them is another. ""Wow, what great level desi-"" BANG, CRUNCH!! oops, I got killed again. Sightseeing is not a good idea in this game.
However, the game does come with an ample supply of cheat codes but you have to use them at the right time. Don't start typing in the code for extra health or ammo when trouble is about to start, its too late at that point. I managed to get through the game by stocking up on health, ammo and abilities at every opportunity. By ""opportunity"" I mean when I was crouched behind a steel storage box while an automated gun was blasting away in my direction. Get the picture?",2.0

"Alright, so, quality control is that I'm sure if you purchase this it'll work seamlessly and you'll be very happy in that regard.  Though, the game, comparatively, is just about as ridiculous as they come in the Final Fantasy genre.  Don't get me wrong, I have played almost all the FFs out there as a comparison, and this one really got my goat the most.

The story is flimsy at best.  The depth of characters is fairly shallow and the story feels slapped together.  Considering it was conceived, produced, and thrown onto the shelves only a mere year after FFVIII, I wouldn't be surprised if the story WAS slammed together with very little effort.  You have your typical love story mixed in with attempting to save the planet, but many other FFs have this as well and we still love them. So, why the long face O, Reviewer?  Well, I'll tell ya.  Because the character development is weaker than a piece of paper soaked in water.  Even when you finally get Zidane, the main character's, background it falls short of pulling at the heartstrings.  Not wanting to give anything away here, so I'll stop on that regard.  It's just plain disappointing.  Not about where he's from or who he is, but the references to FFVII are heavy handed and, in this case, it feels boring.

The gameplay and controls are very similar and familiar to past Final Fantasy's and for that I am grateful.  Leveling up is typical and I actually quite enjoy the idea of equipping weapons and armor that allows you to use an ability while it's on, but also learn it at the same time.  That, to me, helped it to get an extra star.

It loses a star, however, by how the game shadows other FFs, as mentioned before.  The music, with few exceptions, are lacking tributes to past FFs and the graphics fall in the category of WORSE than FFVIII.  I understand that the producers wanted to hark back to the older FFs and how they played, but progression should be the name of the game, not half-hearted duplicates.

Thankfully, at least for me, the difficulty is not all that hard.  It's easily beatable in less than forty hours and you really don't need any ultimate weapons in order to beat the ever living crap out of the final bosses.  For me, I count this as a win, but for those of you that truly like the game it might be a slight disappointment as most FFs require double the amount of hours, plus some hair pulling battles that will leave you agonizing on how to kick ass.

Overall, I'm just disappointed in the effort.  There just wasn't enough TIME for this game to mature.  The story could have been better with excellent character development and story editing, but it lacked so supremely in this regard that it made my heart ache, especially after the triumphs of FFVII and FFVIII.",2.0

This game, on the other hand, was simple and boring. There was nothing for me to strive towards. I played about 20% of the game before I started getting bored. Played about another 25% of the game before I was so bored I could not keep playing and just gave it up. Never looked back.

If I played this one right after FFIII or something then I probably would have loved it. But after VIII this was horrible. And this is coming from someone who still loves the first few FF so it's not just about the level of technology or evolution. This game is just boring and uninspired.",2.0

"The game sounds like it would be cool- you wander around an amusement park and deal with the condemned. Well, it's not. The graphics are out of date, the voice acting sounds like a badly dubbed movie, and the point and click puzzles make no sense. Also, you're in an amusement park but you can't interact with the rides. I could forgive all this if the story was good. Instead, the storyline is just a bunch of weird events strung together. For example, one of the ""sins"" you have to deal with is a scientist who gets offered immortality. He says no so you pile little rocks around his house and leave. And that's IT. Also, the puzzles are so illogical they're impossible to solve. It took me 15 minutes to figure out I had to get to the secret passage behind the refrigerator by lifting the fridge with a complicated rope system and a teddy bear. Yup, you lift a refrigerator by using a teddy bear as a counterweight. I just pointed and clicked on everything to solve the game. It took 4 long hours where I kept shaking my head and saying ""WHAT'S GOING ON?"". The only good thing about the game was that some of the FMV's were fun to watch. They didn't add to the plot, but they showed some creepy images. If you want a good adventure game I'd go with The Longest Journey. I just wish I hadn't wasted my 20 bucks on this one.",2.0
"It was immediately clear in 2000 from advance previews of the game that FFIX was an overt response to mounting pressure from fans of the series to shift from the modern visual stylings and looser gameplay models of the past two installments of the series and revisit the ""golden era"" of the SNES games and earlier. FFIX seems to have come into existence with the sole motivation of pandering to the more conservative fanbase comprising people who sought to have the series rediscover its roots and effectively bring the old design ethos into a polished modern form on a then-current console system. Most people were placated, somewhat unsurprisingly. It's a familiar game; with familiar character personas, a (suspiciously) familiar plot, a familiar setting, and familiar gameplay.

In truth, ""regressive"" may be a better word. The overwhelming spirit of design at play throughout appears to have been to stifle anything that could have been construed as original from the start for fear of spooking prospective players. After the largely confused response of fans to the unconventional gameplay and plot of FFVIII, Squaresoft abruptly set to work creating the most meek, backward-looking, and redundant RPG seemingly within their ability at the time.

The game is set in a stock high-fantasy setting with thieves, knights, magicians and so forth and starts from the premise of a thieves' guild kidnapping the distressed Princess of an imperial kingdom. The plot from there largely stagnates and meanders over a lot of dull plodding to various destinations more in service of the whims of the scenario writers than any greater plot. Said imperialists begin conquering foreign nations, the rag-tag band of underdog heroes are forced into exile, and the status quo holds until disc 3, when the not so striking revelation of a greater power at work in the background comes to light.

From this point, the overall plot of the game is gradually revealed, and with severe disappointment I'd say the entire premise appears to be directly lifted from FFIV. There isn't even any ambiguity, the antagonists have the exact same origins and motivations. To a slightly lesser extent, the story of the character's relationship to the main enemy of the game seems to correspond evenly to the rivalry in FFVII, although I can't really elaborate on much of this in the body of the review. In short, what parts of the plot that aren't tired and obvious from the start are so derivative it's stunning so much money and time was invested making this game to (re-)tell it. The plot is a mess of dusty character and story archetypes, series mascots and tired plot devices to such an absurd degree its sheer scope of its mediocrity is sometimes enough to lure one on. As if the prevalence of moogles, chocobos, stereotyped black mages, wooden airships to precede it weren't enough, the game reintroduces the ""Crystal"" as an all-powerful last minute deus ex machina plot device to rationalize a another desperate fight for the fate of the world.

The other half of the supposed redemption of FFIX besides the regurgitated plot devices is the gameplay. There's flatly almost nothing to say in this regard. It's most comparable to FFIV as it deliberately lacks the tactical diversity and character customization of FFV's job system or FFVI's espers. You have a set number of characters with predetermined classes that level and develop on a strictly linear path, with some optional character traits and abilities being learned from equipment they equip. Back in the early 90's when dungeon-crawling was still the rage in JRPGs, this was passable. Here it's backward, obligatory, and stands as a pretty clear suggestion of the game's unabashed hostility to inventiveness of any sort.

Being a high-budget game, the artwork is pleasing. The music is another matter, as it's clear Mr. Uematsu was exhausted for ideas by this point. Indeed the FFX soundtrack turned out to be a collaborative affair. After scoring so many of these games, it's hard to find fault with him for this. FFIX's tracks are by and large, bare, simple unadorned melodies, and slightly grating jingles in more lively settings. It's disappointing; what creative energies and frustrations led him to write off-beat, strange and forbodingly ambient tracks in VIII seem to have yielded nothing but lukewarm misfires here.

I've been playing this series since I stumbled over FF1 in 1990 and followed the series rather faithfully into the PSX era. IV and V are evenly my favorites of the series, with VIII and VII behind at a slight distance. I appreciate old games and old ideas, however FFIX is solely a sloppy, stylized amalgamation of old ideas pandering to a false sense of nostalgia. IV and VI were games that flew off into bizarre and wonderfully unexpected settings and plot developments and played recklessly and viciously with the hackneyed high-fantasy settings, and V indulged unhesitatingly in relatively complex, varied gameplay. All the old entries in the series IX derives from were a slow progression away from the accepted traditions of JRPGS, and the homage it offers by means of regressing so severely is the very worst tribute it could offer.",2.0
"This game started out fun enough. It was only my second racing game (the first being Moto GP) and I thought I was missing something. It turns out that it was the game that was missing something. The earlier tracks are easy enough but as you go up they become increasingly difficult until there is little more involved then sheer luck and even that doesn't work. Cars crash and this is about the only way you can move up in the posistions. There are only a few songs and they rapidly become annoying. The effects are nothing special and the cars fly apart in large chunks, all in all it's not very thrilling. The hidden bonus cars are fairly ridiculious and a few even make it difficult to drive because you can't see the track as they are so big, there's actually a car in the shape of a big spider (legs and all). This was a pretty disappointing game.",2.0

"I am a very loyal and devoted racing fan.  I enjoy playing realistic simulation games such as NASCAR, F1, and Gran Turismo.  I have been waiting for along time for Playstaion to come out with a CART Game.  When I saw it I just had to get it and I figured it would be a cool simulation and realitic game...But I was WRONG!!!  There is no realism in the game.  The tracks aren't real and the drivers aren't up-to-date.  You can't even race long races, you can only race a few laps.
They need to re-think what they did to this game and they need to come out with a real CART game.  They can use the NASCAR and F1 games for examples.
The game that they put forth needs to be only meant for the Arcade.  And in that since it would be okay because it does have good graphics.
But, looking at it from a true racefan stand point...The game is far from real.  If you're a true racefan looking for a simulation game, I suggest at the most to rent this game.",2.0
"A strange little game which starts very ambitiously and really gets lost along the way somewhere. There are a number of borderline offensive features -- such as the sex dream sequence, the subtext that Satan's not such a bad guy after all, and the Uncle Tom-like black character in overalls -- but the thing that really turned me off was the bad writing, bad animation, and bad acting. Or maybe it's just a bad translation? All in all, not really worth the bother.",2.0
"I do not want to call this game over-rated because I do not want to take away from what other people think of this game, but I did not find this game to be very good.  It is not awful but compared to other RPGs of the time this one fails in too many places to be one of the greats.  There are quite a few problems I had with this game that are so very hard to overlook.

First this game is short!!!  Do not let the 4 disc package fool you.  It is entirely possible to beat this game in under 12 hours.  I wonderd why they even needed 2 discs because it was so short and not overly filled with any of the FMVs or detail to take up all that space.

Second the character developement was subpar.  Only a few of the characters really get developed to any extent while the others remain empty faces on your team.

The storyline was also very unoriginal and childish at times.  The story moves along sluggishly with predictable cliches.  There is little that leaves you wondering what will happen next until disc four.  In disc four all of a sudden they throw a million pieces of vague information at you that I found out of placed and rushed.  It seemed like they knew the story was predictable and tried to add a twist at the last minute, but it only confused me and left me wondering why.

This game was also way to easy.  Granted I used a strategy guide for some of the games tougher moments but it was still way too easy.  The ""hardest boss"" in the game...an optinal boss named Ozma was an unrewarding and painfully quick battle.  I defeated him at level 65ish and had very little problem.  This left me discouraged to even want to finish the rest of the game.

Finally the sidequests.  One of my favorite things about RPGs are the sidequests.  This game had very few sidequests and I had no desire to complete them.  The only sidequest that was worth doing was the chocobo sidequest.  Unfortunately it was boring and very frustrating.  The other sidequests were equally as boring and offered little reason to complete.  For example one of the quests involved running back and forth all over the world several times only to get a cheap ad-on that you already have 3 of at the point when it gets completed.

Certainly not the best Final Fantasy.  My favroites are FF7 and FF12",2.0

"This game has got to be the worst final fantasy ever. There is no way this game could be an dubbed as a final fantasy, i mean seriously come on. This game was one of the easiest games i have ever played and i think it was a simple challenge. i didn't even 9 hours straight i passed way more quickly than any other final fantasy. if you want to check it out that's up to you, but take my advice, it's not worth it.",2.0
"I have played every Final Fantasy game and this is by far the worst of them.  I hurried through the game to get to the end so that I could say that I have beat it.  I didn't even do the side quests do to the fact that the game sucked so bad.  The story line lacked in all areas and the characters were horrible.  I am ashamed that squaresoft put a Final Fantasy name on the game.  Only buy this game if you are trying to complete a Final Fantasy collection, otherwise it isn't worth the money.",2.0
"I liked Final Fantasy 7 way better! One thing I don't like about this game is that in battle mode, you don't get to see your character's maximum HP capabilty. All you see is his or her current HP and MP status. That's only the beginning though.
Not only am I disgusted by the main character Zidnae being a money boy with that stupid tail making him such a dork, and the fact that the princess practically hates him, but I'm also disgusted by the fact that you mostly can't buy Ethers and or hi=potions anywhere in the game!
That is a total joke! In FF7, the character Cloud was cool, his black friend with the cannon for an arm was cool, and that boss Sephieroth (or however the name's spelled) was a masterpiece! This game lacked some adventure and extraordinaryness that No. 7 and 8 had. It almost seemed like this game was sort of more in touch with reality than fantasy. I prefer fantasy!
The plot was also a bit too repetitive with an unchanging storyline.
Also, the graphics and battle mode were better in No. 7. I love Final Fantasy 7!, but I felt generous enough to give this game 2 stars because that guy Kuja and those summoned creatures like Bahamut, Odin, and Ifrit are cool.
I look forward to a big improvement for the future Final Fantasy games.
Thank you and have a good day,
Steven",2.0
"If you like your RPGs contrived or if your intelligence and maturity levels are forever arrested at an adolescent age, then you'll surely love Final Fantasy 9.  Don't be fooled (though it's obviously too late for that) by this game's deceptive marketing touting a ""return to the style of early Final Fantasy"" because the only similarity between this game and, say, Final Fantasy 2, was my feeling like an eight-year-old when playing both of them.  If you like overt, heavy-handed, overly simplistic dialog (and most of you bought 7 so I assume that you do), then this game will serve it up for you disc after uninspired disc.  Get yourself a Vagrant Story or a Suikoden or some well-orchestrated Baldur's Gate for the PC.  Or don't.  It's your eighty-some-odd hours.",2.0
"Where is the quality from the last game Final Fantasy VIII?
I mean the game doesn't interest me at all in the beginning, it is too manga and comic relief inspired, and has no real seriousness about it. This makes this a less ""hardcore"" experience than the Final Fantasy 8.
I miss the depth in the characters, and I also miss the complex story that was so evident in 7, and 8. Bad game! I just hope they increase the dark feel of the next game, because this one was too goodie goodie for my taste.",2.0
"As anyone reading this should know the 'Final Fantasy' series are without the slightest doubt the best role playing games in the world. The graphics in the movie sequences are the closest to real life that can be possibly made at this point in time. The story lines could even be made into top selling novels. What I have just written is true with only one exception, FINAL FANTASY IX.
The story begins with such complexity, throwing so many people who are totally different into the one party. The game is set in medeavil times which takes you way back to games before FFVII and as if that isn't bad enough the games battle sequences involves four of the characters at once rather than the previous trio battle groups this can be seen way back in the primitive years of 'Final Fantasy Legands' for the GAME BOY!!!!!!
The movie sequence's graphics are as usual... astounding, but because of the storyline they can only be so interesting.
The battle mode seems fairly easy to use but thoughout the game it will get harder and you'll have to summon creatures such as shiva to help you and because of the old type Magic Points you can only do this a little.
All in all the characters and the game in general are not as cleverly thought through as their pedecesors let's hope Squaresoft can recover from this slump and make up for it with Final Fantasy X for the Playstation 2 and in the short term why not go see the movie.
Sorry but it's only a 2 out of 5 from me",2.0

"You've read all the five star reviews. It is undeniable that FF IX has regained the popularity that FF VII once obtained. But,do not be mislead by hype. Heck,this game is the candy-bubblegum pop of all RPGs,the same ol' ... recycled all over again. Take this;a group of various personalities planning to stop the plans of an evil queen from world domination. FF trademark. And too,the return of the dreaded random battle system,the addictive(duh...)card game from FFVIII which promises no rewards but..satisfaction(woohhoo..rare cards! But i can't turn them into rare materials!!).And to compare this to FF VII is absolute ...,even ... First of all,the mini-games are,very,very little compared to FF VII.You don't even have FF IX's own Gold Saucer,and the mini-games are just the card game,the chocobo ""hot and cold""(go digging like a ... to upgrade your chocobo and get rare items),and a numb mini-game which involves the big,fat Quina catching frogs hopping around the marshes. What about the gameplay,it's a drab too. You have your typical stereotype Zidane dominating the game and even characters like Vivi,Dagger(what a...dumb name the so hyped translators give)and Eiko,with powerful spells and summons,is deemed useless. Unlike previous Final Fantasies,each character have it's own specific abilities. You have Zidane hacking around with his sword,and absolutely useless in magic(except his trances),Vivi,the good-for-nothing little wizard whose magic skills are incomparable to Zidane's strength(until very,very later in the game),Dagger a.k.a Princess Garnet,with powerful summons(which are useless when you go hop into the last dungeon),Quina a user of blue magic who eats his enemies to learn spells(only a portion of his spells worked).While these characters are like you typical Walt Disney characters or Ben Hur type casts(sarcasm),again compared to Zidane,like extras instead of support characters. And compared to even Square's ""flop"" FF VIII has more balanced cast of characters.
If you think random battle is bearable,like FF VII and FF VIII,this is the most frustrating game after FF VI(for PSX)to date,and prepare for countless hours of head banging moments. There is no moogle charm(FF VI) or Diablos's Enc None (FF VIII)to ease or diminish random encounters. Worse,every battle is just tiresome,with slow loading times and slow ATB bar. This problem even effects your haste spell,where there is no difference in enemy's frequent attacks even when you cast it.
Finally,this ""light hearted"" Final Fantasy is just not really funny. There is a handful of situations that will only gives you a mere sneer in you face. The dialogue,even with good translators,is lifeless,bland,and lacked with emotion. And it is time for Nobou Uematsu to retire,because 70% of the game's soundtrack is pure ...,with MIDIs still his favourite tool. Overall,if you want good graphics..only good graphics and a pure Square fanboy(i know almost everyone do),don't go cursing at your fellow FF fanatics when you buy and beat the game.",2.0
"First I'll go over the good points.  The graphics are incredible, the characters are interesting, and the story easily grabs one's curiosity.  If this were a movie, I'd watch it over and over again.  And Vivi rules as a character.
Unfortunately, this isn't a movie, it's a game, but for some reason, the creators forgot this.  You have very little choice in the game.  You watch a few minutes of movie, then get a character to maneuver through and area.  You have freedom to move the character, but the game basically ""persuades"" you to take certain routes to progress the story.  ""Do you want to go left or right?  You go left?  Well you're supposed to go right.  Go ahead left.  Nothing will happen until you go right.""
You even play the characters trying to stop the heroes, such as the knight.  So in otherwords, you have to escape, yet you play the character trying to stop the characters from escaping, yet you don't have any real choices.  You move until the action continues.
Battles are all right.  Both sides battle back and forth until the story continues.  Whatever happened to random battles to gain experience?
Maybe I'm missing the point of modern RPG's.  As a movie, Final Fantasy is excellent.  But I don't want a movie in which I have to keep pressing buttons or get a character to wander aimlessly to adavance a story.  Sorry to all fans of this, but I prefer a little more choice.",2.0
"I was really dissappointed in this game, for several reasons. The biggest being that it was incredibly simple. Not only did we go back to having stupid characters and a silly equipment system, there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DIFFICULT AT ALL about this game. It took almost two hours to defeat Ultimecia in FFVIII. It took an hour and a half to defeat the weapons in FFVII. There was not a single difficult fight in the entire game in part 9. The last boss only took 10 minutes to beat. The ending was pretty good, but I did not really feel like I had accomplished anything when I beat it. I really hope the guys at Squaresoft will go back to the style of FFVII and VIII when they do the next game, because those were just incredibly good games. I don`t understand why people would want to "" go back to their roots "" when they have made so much progress. The characters in IX were no where near as cool as in previous games ( infact, all of them except for garnett and vivi were downright irritating ). I just hope they can do a better job with FFX.",2.0

"I remember Fast Food Tycoon from somewhere. About 4 years ago I downloaded a DEMO of a game called Pizza Syndicate on their website, ... and after I played the demo for a while, I went to look for a place where I could buy the game. Since I loved Pizza Tycoon, and I found Pizza Tycoon 2 to be great. However, I was unable to find the game, until just recently. This game is more than just a remake of Pizza Syndicate, it's the entire game, just with a different name. A very deceiving name if you ask me! Pizza, for me atleast, is not considered Fast Food. When I saw Fast Food Tycoon, I expected I would be running a McDonald's type franchise, with the Pizza Tycoon Engine. I didn't expect to be playing a game that I have already played before. With the lack of, or no instructions on how to play this game, I only knew how to play because the game is the exact same as Pizza Syndicate and Pizza World... (Sounds like a familiar situation to Airport Inc. - Air Mogul - Airport Tycoon, or whatever you want to call it, it's all the same game! 1. No instructions 2. Poorly done tutorial  3. The re-release of a game that already exists, why not leave the name Pizza Syndicate, instead of tricking me into buying a game that I might have already owned. I'm lucky I only had the demo, but if I had the full version of Pizza Syndicate, and bought Fast Food Tycoon, it would have just been like throwing my money away. So, if the game had instructions, and didn't have a deceiving name, I would have giving this a 4/5 stars, because the people are funny, the soundfx is good and the graphics are nice. But because of the tricky sales tactics they did, I give it a 2/5 stars.",2.0

I have yet to win a scenario.  If you don't automate the help, you cant figure out how to space them so they don't all show up at once and go home at once leaving an empty restaurant with hungry customers.  You can automate everything, but what fun is that?

"The idea of creating and managing your own fast food chain,  and then watching it function from a bird's eye view is a great one.  Unfortunately, Activision failed at recreating this idea to your PC with Fast Food Tycoon.  The main reason the game is a failure is because of it's confusing gameplay.  It helps to use the tutorial but even after that you'll find yourself wondering, ""How did I get to that certain screen that let me do that certain function."" Watching your pizza(only type of food)place function is pretty cheasy also. There are very few animations and there's not many ways to edit the looks of the place either.  If your looking for a solid simulaion game that will keep you entertained for hours your better off with Theme Hospital, Roller Coaster Tycoon, or one of the sim-cities.

"I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the first Pool of Radiance series.  It was the first computer game to bring a great PC version of a popular RPG to fruition.  I also played the Black Isle/Bioware versions of the AD&D series (Baldur's Gate & Icewind Dale) and loved those games.  But this one?  I think my review would be censored if I told you what I thought of this game.
First of all, the game crashed on installation!  Blizzard may be the only software company that releases relatively bug-free PC games these days but how can a software company justify a game with bugs in the installation process?!  I've heard that I have it lucky.  Some people have had their operation systems wiped out in the installation process.
After getting the game to run, I was unimpressed.  The graphics are decent but it doesn't have the same atmosphere as the other recent Dungeons & Dragons products.  It's a ""hack and slash"" only game and things such as quests, great storylines and character interaction which made so many of the Dungeons & Dragons games enjoyable are non-existent in this product.  The instruction manual is also a poor substitute for an introduction to the new 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rules.
I'm afraid that the more I play this game, the more technical errors I'm going to find.  There are already many bugs such as the game crashing when you save it during certain conditions.  I can live with a bugged game if it promises to offer great gameplay when it is fixed with patches but this game is a pitiful attempt to live up to some of the great successes the Dungeons and Dragons series has seen with PC games.
Don't waste your money.  If you're an avid D&D fan, wait until the game price drops and then try it out but I'd recommend Baldur's Gate II as a much better alternative if anyone desires a great RPG game for the PC.",2.0
"This game is ok overall but the play seems slow and the controls
aren't the most intuitive or easy. It looks pretty good but
nothing exceptional here.
 The character customizability seems to be nonexistant, you just
distribute stat points and pick one of 2-8 character models
depending on the race/class choice you made.
 Overall it's disappointing, but that's mostly my own fault for
expecting it to have all the classes and races from DnD 3rd
Edition, they left out my favorite (Wizards), and because I
thought the character developement would be more involved.",2.0

repeat what was said about the lack of variety in character
creation or the agonizingly slow path to leveling other
than to say that review is spot on.  The variety of monsters
you encounter is slim, the plot is not really there at all.
Finally, the combat (the meat of this game..) is plodding and
time consuming with very little flash or drama.
Bottom line, and I am sorry to say it- unless you're just
 between games and have something like ""federal prison"" type
 time on your hands to kill- don't waste the hours of your life

"I didn't hate this game as much as most of the reviewers here, but I must agree that it was a disappointment.
For what it's worth, I've had none of the technical problems that others have described (crashes, lockups, etc.). The user interface is certainly less than ideal, but it's workable. And yes, the load times are ridiculous, but that by itself isn't enough to ruin a game. And the AI is terrible, but there are RPGs with poor AI that are still great games (e.g., Neverwinter Nights).
So what's the problem? It's an endless stream of uninspired hack-and-slash. The puzzles rarely amount to more than ""find the right key to open the door"" - and you can be sure that the key will be arbitrarily located in a random chest on the other side of the dungeon. Roleplaying is almost nonexistent, and when it does come into play, it's usually pretty hackneyed stuff. You spend most of your time wandering around a gigantic, inconveniently designed dungeon, hacking your way through either ridiculously wimpy or ridiculously powerful undead. Strategy (if you can call it that) ultimately boils down to saving your game before each battle and replaying it until you win.
So while the engine itself isn't a total disaster (though it could certainly be better), the game that they designed for it is. The Baldur's Gate series did the isometric AD&D thing MUCH better, and Neverwinter Nights takes computer-based D&D to a whole new level. Unless you're just looking for a cheap way to kill a lazy weekend, don't waste your money on this yawner.",2.0
"I was looking forward to this game--a real D&D 3rd Ed game.  It started out fun, for the first few days.  However, I soon realized that I was playing the same game over and over again, in different, but very similar areas with higher level players and monsters.  I will say that I really enjoyed the graphics and the combat system.  Magic is prety cool as well.  And the outside areas of the game are fun.  But this is mostly an underground dungeon quest and the dungeons are essentially the same.  I finally reached a point where I was bored stiff and quit playing.  I never finished the game, and I had been playing for weeks.  I started with eager anticipation, ended up extremely disappointed in the almost endless repetition of the game.",2.0
"Many hours of my life have been wasted playing this poor excuse of a game...boring, boring, boring.  But I finally finished, without cheats, and solved every subquest in the game.  And you know what, I'm left with the feeling I just killed a Dracolich with mediocre characters using absolutely insane weapons and armor...huge demon sword with +5 hit and triple damage on a level 8 character.  PLEASE!!  THAT'S SO STUPID!!  I still can't believe I found some +3 warhammer with a level 1 character.  This game is insanely boring and just an attempt to have a chance at killing a Dracolich, a monster that in any normal D&D situation would be next to impossible to kill.",2.0
"I will admit my bias, and enable you, dear reader, to take from it what you will: I enjoy role-playing games with stories.  As such, I have been monstrously disappointed in this game.  The closest analogy I can give is that it is much like the old stand-up game Gauntlet, wherein a collection of heroes ran around killing monsters, acquiring potions and keys, and comically eating food.  It is an old-fashioned dungeon-stomp, an endless cycle of ""Kill the monsters, get the treasure.""  The pretty spell graphics that are so touted by the designers do not come close to making up for a drudgerous party management system (no click&drag windows; horrible isometric viewpoints which create an inability to see party members/treasure/monsters behind walls; not allowing party members to scout, forcing everyone to stay close together...).
Beyond this, the game gets boring quickly.  There are basically no characters, a very weak storyline, and the player is left with nothing other than killing more monsters, getting more treasure, and secretly wishing for a voice to pronounce eerily, ""Warrior needs food... badly.""",2.0
"Reading through all the reviews, I see no mention of a MAJOR bug that plagues this game that I kindly refer to as ""screen-jerky"" mode.  It reminds me so much of when the old video game screens used to slow down when too many moving characters appeared on the screen.  Thats exactly what happens all too often when trying to play this game.  Except its worse because when that happens your player controls will not work (going into periodic freeze-unfreeze-freeze-unfreeze) yet the monsters are free to attack your party at will and can damage you without you getting to attack back...until the game switches to a new screen perspective (like one extra monster far away from the party) and/or one of the monsters throws some nasty magic at you.
In addition, using a magic item during combat can be VERY difficult.  You accumulate a GREAT number of items, scrolls, and potions throughout this game but trying to select one to use in combat has some very serious flaws.  For one, when you pull up the item list during combat, the time-clock to take your attack keeps running.  The item list is EXTREMELY disorganized too...instead of pulling up a list where several items (and similar items) are grouped together, your whole inventory list of magic is jumbled; for instance if you have three ""Potions of Critical Healing"" in inventory, when you pull up the list you won't see ""Potion of Critical Healing (3)"" on the list...instead you will see three single potions on the list, and they will not be listed together, but instead scattered throughout the magic item list.  Potions, Wands, Scrolls, and weapons are not grouped together, and by the time you find the item you are looking to use, your time to use it expires and you lose your attack.
In addition, unless you are already holding the magic item, you have to activate it TWICE in combat to use it, not only once.  It takes one pull of the awful magic menu to equip the item and then you have to select the item AGAIN to use it to target something.  And its not always easy to find the item you are using on the second menu popup...instead of having the text change color or become boldfaced, there is only a tiny little ""plus"" sign next to the item equipped that can be difficult to see when you are in a hurry to get your attack in before your turn runs out.
I agree with the reviewers that the play is repetetive but there are enough quests in the game to make a decent story and the interface of the game is not as difficult to get used to as in, say, Wizardry Gold or the later Might and Magic Games (I much prefer computer RPG's in third person perspective).  Thats the only reason I give it two stars instead of one.  The graphics rival that of Diablo 2 although there is much less interaction between NPC's and the voice sounds are inferior.  I agree also that more places to spend your gold would make the game more enjoyable...its hard to make the long treks back to the merchants when you are loaded down with the weight of many items that encumber your characters and impede your movement (which makes a BIG difference during the fighting).  There are much better games out there than this one, free of the major flaws mentioned above and more fun to play.  I'd only recommend this game to those who are avid RPG game fans who don't want to use their brains too much on a new computer game...I think in a year when the price is halved it would definitely be worth buying.  Not now though.",2.0
"The game is so buggy, the box crawls on its own. After purchasing the game and investing about 20 hours or so, a bug halted my progress. UbiSoft has released a patch for this particular bug, but the patch is not retroactive; I'd have to start over, with no guarantee that it's truly fixed, and negotiate around the myriad other bugs within the game.
To put it bluntly, it's no Baldur's Gate II. It's a dungeon crawl, and not a very exciting one at that. The only real benefit to playing it is the eye-candy provided by the spell system and by the richly detailed backgrounds - even with this, though, the game isn't worth playing at this point.",2.0
"Pool of Radiance:  Ruins of Myth Drannor was, unfortunately, a somewhat disappointing game.  Tales continually fly left and right of one bug after another, some so serious that some people's entire operating systems were damaged or destroyed by various installation and uninstallation glitches, as well as many other minor to severe problems.
Looking past the bugs, though, still reveals a lackluster game.  Very few elements of the game were implemented satisfactorily, and none of them were character creation.  People familiar wtih AD&D will most likely be at least a little bit saddened to find that they cannot play as bards, wizards (only the sorceror kit is available), or druids, as well as having the entire race of gnome closed to them.
People unfamiliar with traditional AD&D, though, will still find that every cleric tends to look like every other cleric, just as every fighter tends to look like every other fighter and so on--characters simply aren't given enough variance to look or feel distinct, which will suck a lot of the joy out of this game for those players who delight in party creation.
In gameplay, Pool of Radiance continues to prove sub-par.  For most of the game, there is very little variety in monster encounters.  Most of the game will be spent fighting orcs, skeletons, and zombies.  One fight looks and feels like another very quickly.
Furthermore, character advancement and plot development is so painstakingly slow that most players will probably feel like they are getting nowhere after hours of gameply.  A new element of the plot or a character level-up probably happens an average of once per 5 to 7 hours of gameply.
The character development is aided somewhat by the generous amount of fair to very nice treasure scattered about.  You may not gain a level after 4 hours of gameplay, but you'll almost certainly find a new toy to give to one of your characters.  As would be expected, though, most treasure is not suited to your party, and unfortunately the money obtained from selling them is almost meaningless in this game--shops are few and far between and hold very few items worth buying.
Pool of Radiance is not without its pros, though.  The battle system--while sometimes repetetive in content, is well thought-out and developed.  A battle is like a well-played game of chess, and with plenty of time available to consider one's moves and how much risk to take.  Graphically, the spell animations are some of the best around in an AD&D game, although the backgrounds in the game are somewhat monotone, very repetetive, and quite uncreative and uninspired.  Expect to see a lot of drab, brown hallways.
It is true that this game may well appeal to some gamers who understand patience and can see it through to the end.  Combat will be enjoyable to the select few who have the patience to see the many repetetive and time-consuming fights through to the tactical masterpieces that lie between them.
All things said, though, this game is not truly recommendable.  Your money would likely be better spent elsewhere.",2.0
"Along with a multitude of other people, I looked forward to this game with eager anticipation. And, along with a multitude of other people, I was severely disappointed.
I guess that I first got really disgusted with only having 1st level characters in Myth Drannor. You know, the place where Elminster doesn't go. Okay, I dealt with it.
I personally did not have a problem with the uninstall bug, thank goodness. I was plagued with the crash bug, where it would randomly crash, usually at the worst times. (Almost through a major battle, etc.)
Also, I had spent 10 hours or so in the game and my save game became corrupted, and I had to start all over again. This made me very upset.
The game, as of this post, has been out over 1 1/2 months. We have gotten very small patches, but nothing to fix the crashes or other bugs in the game itself. I lucked out towards the end and finished up quicker than I thought. I'm glad, because the battles get very wearisome. And that's all the game is.
If you like fighting an awful lot, then you may enjoy this game. I was hoping for more of an adventure game.
On the up side, I got to play Baldur's Gate 2 for the first time afterwards! What a difference!",2.0
"I was really looking forward to this game after finishing BG2 and its expansion pack. Unfortunately, it was disapointing.
The game had a lot of potential, and did a lot of things right. Character generation is fantastic, and the graphics and sound
are pretty good. However, it wasn't enough to make for it's serious defects. The interface is convoluted and difficult. More importantly, combat is turn-based. This makes for very slow gameplay, and it got boring quickly. Also, the story line is pretty weak, and the NPCs are flat and lifeless. To the games defense, it reminded me a little of a modern version of the old RPGs from TSI (like the pools of radiance or dragon lance games). I guess if that's what I was looking for this might have come across better. But after finishing the Baldur's gate games, this came off as needlessly slow and badly executed.",2.0
"Like so many very early attempts at role playing games, Pool of Radiance has failed to capture the very intent of D&D.  The game is slow playing, has very little plot, no room for character development, and is technically inept.  Combat simuilation is so slow as to be agonizing.  Once combat is entered, you can't leave.  Initiative (per combat rules) is almost impossible for a player character.  In the early game, you can make a load of money, but you have practically nothing to spend it on.  The graphics are poor, the interface is clunky, and the game respresents a bad interpretation of the 3rd edition D&D rules.",2.0

"This could have been a good game. The combat system is very true to the pen and paper D&D. The problem is that it is really, really repetitive. If you've had one battle, you've pretty much had them all. And aside from a few extra powers, the battles don't change. The RPG aspect of the game is laughable. Most of the time I had no idea when I was fulfilling quests as most are kill the bad guy in front of you. Now I have to wait for a good CRPG like Neverwinter Nights to come out. Black Isle knows how to do D&D. UBI Soft doesn't",2.0
"Not superb.  Graphically superior than it's predecessor Baldurs Gate, Pool of Radiance lacks the game play that BG held.  I've always said I would take a game that lacks in graphics if it makes up for it in Game Play, and BG did that, This game is mediocre at best.  It is stable on my computer, I have yet to have it crash (knock on wood)so I'll give it point for that, having a game for near two weeks with no crashes is pretty good.  I'll give it a point for graphics, as mentioned earlier they are great.  I'll give it a point for allowing you to create up 4 members of your party.  Where does it lack, Game play as mentioned is poor, interface is tiresome, I guess the hardcore table top player geeks like it, but I can't stand the turn based combat.... I turned it off.  With Baldurs Gate Infinity Engine, it was customizable... players could make their favorite sword from whatever book they read and through it into the game to be bought of found, one group even made a whole new add on for it, but I don't see that this is as customisable, there for not very player friendly, so minus a point.  If you are a BG fan, don't buy it thinking you will get something like it, you won't.  It doesn't hold the interaction of BG, I like that, if I like running around hacking things up with little to no problem solving, I would play Diablo II.  I guess SSI created a concept that had a following already with the original Pool of Radiance game, made a graphically great game so they could hype it up and then threw it at us.",2.0
"I am a huge fan of the original gold box games and was hoping this would be a revamp of those.

"I agree with a lot of the things that have been said already.  While the graphics on the backgrounds and the animations are very good, and the sounds are good as well, the graphics on the characters are somewhat lacking.  Character creation is fairly limited and somewhat bad at points (the fact that when you choose an icon for your character, you only get two options, and they are basically the same exact thing, only slightly different colors, was disappointing at best).  I think where this game really loses out, though, is gameplay.  It's just not fun.  It plays like a Windows program, and that's just not exciting.  You cannot scroll the screen beyond where your characters are standing, making the view limited.  You can't rotate the view, meaning that your characters are often standing in the way of something you are trying to look at.  Basically, nothing about the game screams excitement.  It's a ho-hum, not really worth buying until maybe it comes down in price kind of game.",2.0
"In the past few years, an annoying trend has emerged in the home computer video game world. Game developers, presumably tortured into submission by their publishers, have been releasing outlandishly buggy games. PoR is another in a long list of casualties.
Online role-playing games such as Ultima Online and Everquest were barely functional at release. Black and White crashed constantly. Anarchy Online was a complete joke. Even Max Payne had a couple problems at first (in this case, the patch was out within a couple days).
This ""release and then patch"" method of rushing a game out the door has got to stop. Often the problems aren't fixed for weeks. In the case of PoR, a few people actually had parts of Windows removed due to a bug with the uninstaller. The other problems people have reported are too numerous to list. Add to this some gameplay balance mistakes (or possibly bugs), and you've got an army of angry computer RPG fans flooding the official PoR forums with vitriolic hate letters.
The saddest thing, in the end, is that all of these problems are with a game that turns out to not even be that good. It's a notch above mediocre, a somewhat pleasant and totally mindless diversion. There's no real depth, excitement, or role-playing to speak of.
Wait for the bargain bin on this one. It'll be there soon.",2.0
"I'll keep it short and sweet:
Imagine Baldur's Gate I.  Now slow down the action tremendously and make the plotline totally linear.  Then make the game buggy - it often sputters (lags) almost like Ultima Online did back in 1997.  That's essentially what you get with Pool of Radiance.
Even with the inevitable release of a patch, the game itself is not compelling.  You walk around slowly until you find a monster.  The monster approaches you slowly.  You slowly attack it and it slowly retaliates.  When it's dead, you walk around some more.
If you're looking for a non-linear game that you can play as a single player, I'd consider waiting for NeverWinter Nights.",2.0
"I'll start off by saying, I do enjoy rpgs alot, at least I used to, recently the pickins have been to many and to drab.  This is another example of a game that could have been good, but is too much of a let down.
It reminds me of a game I picked up awhile back, forgot the name, but on the back it said it was a 'Diablo like' game.  It was in really big letters, and I was jonesing for Diablo 2 which at the time hadn't been released.  Get it home, and put it in, and its a turn based strategy game....  Yeah, Diablo like my foot.
I describe Pool of Radiance: RoMD like this, a very slow Baldur's Gate.  My main problem is that the game plays very slow.  Second, multiplayer seems to be a huge joke, where DOES the multiplayer take up at, and does it have a story at all?  Third...well, the Third Edition rules.
This is my first contact with them, and I was really hyped to see them at work, since some friends of mine want to convert some of our all time favorite campaigns over to NeverwinterNights.  After this game, we may skip NeverwinterNights altogether....  To put it lightly...why in the heck is the Mage's spells based off of Charisma, can anyone explain this?
All in all, the game is a let down, its nothing more than a really cheap rip off of Baldur's Gate, yet turn based with the characters being so big that you can't see very much of the map at the time.  The upswing is that it is all 'seemless' in the fact that you don't have 'zones' per say, the areas can be very large in scale, so it makes exploring more interesting.
Final word, if you like playing with the 3rd edition rules, and can stand very slow game play, then nab it, because all in all, it actually is like sitting down and playing it pen and paper style, taking turns with initiative.  The bugs are pretty bad in spots, but hopefully they will fix them soon.  Beyond those kind of ppl, buy it at your own risk....",2.0
"The first few times I played the game, I really enjoyed it.  However, after completing the 5 levels twice, I am completely sick of it.  Another five to ten levels that could be unlocked by completing the game would have made all the difference.

"I didn't much enjoy this game, though I must admit that the graphics were TERRIFIC!  I suppose this is a great game if you you're into (as the young man at the game shop put it) ""Button Mashers"". . .  A button masher, it seems, is a game in which the primary goal is to mash the attack button before the enemy hits you over the head with a mallet (or some other unfriendliness).
The crux of the game is that you're one of the heros outlined in the opening credits.  Each has a different weapon that they use in a different way from the next (Et cetera, et cetera.  Yadda yadda. . .).  You have to win a series of battles (that are a bit confusing to begin with) and claim various prizes. . .  Now on to how to play the game- (much like the title of this review) ""Run around, whack buttons, repeat until you are dead or victorious"".  Taa Daa, you've just mastered Dynasty Warriors 2; Congrats.  The only real strategy I've been able to discern from watching 3 people (aside from myself) play the game is ""don't get hit"".
Sorry to have been less than overjoyed with the gameplay, but I've seen really good games and I've seen really bad games (I own 116 PS1 games and 16 PS2 games. . .) and this one is simply too close to marginal to get all hot and bothered about.  Rent it before you buy it.  If you can't stand the idea of returning it to the rental store, buy your own.  (On the up side, I'd give it 2.5 stars if that were an option)",2.0
"I rushed out and rented this game after reading the reviews on this site.  Anxious to try a game compared to the likes of ""Kessen"" by the same company, I have to say that I am pretty disappointed.
But this game seems like it was cloned from the PS1 version in a big hurry to get to market.  The graphics look very super-imposed on their background, and the fighting is very unrealistic, in the sense that you can just jump into a crowd of people and start swinging away --- including not even harming your own teammates.  (Can we have a tiny bit of realism here?) The character auto-animation is odd...characters just take random lobs at each other instead of actually fighting.  Finally, there are very limited moves to choose from.
If you must have this game, please rent it first.",2.0
"Every once in a while you just go ahead and buy a game without knowing anything about it and you are sorry you did.  I have had this happen to me once before with a bad game called Deathtrap Dungeon.  Well I referred to this game as Deathtrap Dungeon 2 because it's another mistake on my part.
And believe me, I am not all that hard on games.  I want to like games and I want to have fun, but there isn't much good about this game.  First off, as the other review noted there is no story.  You start the game off right in battle, and you expect the story to pick up after that right?  Wrong.  Think a story is going to show itself at the beginning?  Wrong.  I have yet to see any story.  The only story you will get is from reading the book.
The game kind of reminds me of a Diabalo/Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, except both of those games were good, and Dark Angel is not.  If they would have just thrown in some good voice acting like in Legacy of Kain then the game would be so much better, but they didn't.
The graphics are definately subpar.  The menu screen looks like something that could have easily been done on the PS1.  Actually, the whole game looks like it could have been on the PS1.  The only part that seems above par is the sounds and music.  But there is only so many times you can hear a monster grunt, or one say ""You'll regret that"" after you wax him before that gets old.
They say this game is an Adventure/RPG.  I don't see much RPG about it.  There really isn't much freedom to wonder around.  Guess my idea of a RPG is Phantasy Star, Summoner or Final Fantasy.  On Dark Angel you point a silver cursor to one of the areas on the map then it shows brown dots go to that location.  There is no getting attacked on your way to anything.  Then all you do is crawl around level after level of some dungeon killing lots of monsters, picking up weapons or stuff, hitting switches, and sometimes killing some monster that gives you some item to fullfill a quest you got from one of the towns.  Then you take the item back to the town and they give you some money.  You also can collect items to take to these shrine things in the towns and they can raise your strength or one of your other attributes.
The towns are pretty bad too.  There is very few people in each town, and probably only two of them are of any use to you.  Meaning, there are probably only two of them that you can get a quest from and buy and sell items.
I see nothing original or good about the game (besides the sound).  And unless you really like just mind numbing dungeon crawling, then I can't really recommend this game to anyone.  I can see this game coming down in price real quick because once some people get the word out about how bad it is, people probably won't be buying it too much.
Please rent this game if you really feel the need to play it.  Then decide whether or not to buy it, I have a feeling that after a few hours of playing it, you won't want to waste your money on it.

"I bought this with my PS2 and ended up returning it for Kessen.  This was a very good idea.
In its favor, the game has decent controls and makes pretty good use of the analog controller buttons.  That's really the only positive thing I can say about it.
Graphics are okay, but certainly not up to the standards set by other releases such as Ridge Racer V, DOA2 and Kessen.  The way the trees are rendered as a vertical stick with a couple of rings of texture map around them is annoying.
The enemies do not scale well, going from too easy to too hard too fast.  It is too easy to walk off a cliff and die, but there are also cliffs you have to walk off to advance the plot and there is no good way of telling the difference.  When left with no other options I found myself saving the game then walking off all the cliffs I could find hoping one would lead to more plot.  Saddest thing it, this does work sometimes.
But by far the most annoying aspect of the game, and the one that made me stop playing it, is the camera.  There are camera control buttons that don't do anything sane.  During boss fights in small spaces you usually don't get to see the boss most of the time.  And I'm not just an incompetent player making an excuse for not beating bosses.

The page is VERY misleading, and I'm considering returning it.  I at least wanted to make it clear to anyone who wants to order this that if you want a name brand Sony card, be very careful.",2.0
"Woo-hoo. It's a minimalist peripheral. What can I say? It does what it is supposed to do, and NOTHING more. And that is really frustrating as 15 blocks of memory is WAY to little memory to save an even average amount of games. I own the game SaGa Frontier, and I need all 15 blocks for that. So what happens? That's right--Sony gets more of my money.
If you are using a PSOne, get a trustworthy 3rd party memory card (InterAct ones work well and hold good amounts). However, if you are using a PS2, I guess you have no choice, data saved on 3rd party cards have the tendency to suddenly get destroyed. Once again, the customer is being sacrificed so they can maximize profit.
So the final word? Get it if you have to.",2.0
"These things cost like 15-20 bucks and they only hold 15 games! That is very cheap. If you are ever going to get a memory card for your PSOne, get the colored cheap ones that come in a 3 pack for 10 bucks. Thats what I got and now I can hold 45 games for less the price. Can you believe that? 10 bucks for 45 games or 17 bucks for 15 games? You choose.",2.0
"This game is horrible! If you enjoy wasting your money than this is the game for you. The graphics are the only thing that makes the game seem exiting. The missions enventually get extremely boring...

"Armored core is a fun game, but I don't think it's a good game. I believe this was the first game I really really enjoyed on the PS2. Unfortunately, I didn't think it was worth the hype and the expense of getting the machine. Honestly, I felt as if I could have played it on my N64 and saved [price]. It was disappointing because there was so much potential with the combination of the platform and the genre. Yet, it was the same as always. I enjoyed the game, but I think if you want a fun game that shows you the power of the machine spend your money on Twisted Metal: Black or wait for Metal Gear. I think Armored core is no better than what a lesser machine can run. As a result, spend your money elsewhere and find something that makes your PS2 sing.",2.0

"I must admit, I had been a little out of the mechwarrior loop for a while, and then decided to get back into it with MW4.  I never played MW3, but I was a fan of 2, so if I blame a change on this game that occurred in 3, I apologize.
I found this game falling short of many of the expectations I had for it.  The graphics were better than 2, but not nearly to where I would have liked to see them.  The enemy mechs tended to look two-dimentional, not to mention their drivers were particularly stupid as far as tactics.  For example, if you don't shoot at them for a while, they tend to forget that you're even there, and they walk away.  Weapons look ok, although I was partial to the PPC looking like a sphere (as in MW2) and not a bolt of lightning.
Weapons in this game fall into groups; no two ways about it, you have to group your weapons.  If you want them to chain fire (as I like to), it's lot more work than it's actually worth.  I've learned just to live with it.
I would also like to know whose bright idea it was to change the name of the ""Timberwolf"" to ""Mad Cat.""  That's more of personal qualm, since my favorite was the timberwolf.  It's hard to bring myself to pilot a mad cat.  I also do not believe that Mechs should have faces (see ""Atlas"" for example).  They don't look intimidating; they just look stupid.
The movies are nothing special; and the acting is absolutly terrible.
Also, some of the features seemed a little unbuyable, such as the anti-ballistic armor.  What is that, foam rubber covered in bubble wrap?
This game is also far to easy.  Even on the hardest setting, it's too easy to blow away your enemies.
However, the multiplayer is very cool; I just wish there were better people out there to play against.  It still plays like a classic mechwarrior, and it's still fun to blow the you-know-what out of everything.  Even Microsoft can't screw that up.
I'd recommend finding the game somewhere for cheap, just to get a mechwarrior fix.  MW2 is, in my mind, much better, but it doesn't work with Windows NT/XP/2000, which is really a shame.",2.0
Graphic's were ok. Didn't like how they changed the keystrokes nor the fact that you have to shoot another mech 200 times to kill them..Shoot a leg off & it's still there..What gives with that?Another bothersome thing about this game are all those video's you can't bypass..On all the rest of the games just hit esc & the video stop's & you can enter into battle. But not on this game. You must endure all the [game] video's. I've played all the Mechwarrior games & this is as disapointing as Heavy Gear was. Even was a member of Clan Wolf on the old Mplayer.com mech2 online gaming site. I'm just hoping Mech4 Mercs won't be like this one is. It's too bad I can't play my Mech2 & Mech2 merc's anymore due to my O/S..It just won't play DOS based games.,2.0
"To me it seems more time was spent on the storyline/video recording than game development.  The actors didn't say anything I really wanted to hear and it just wasn't as satisfying blowing things up as it was in MW3. Even with a good PC (Pent 4 1.4G w/all the trimmings) it gets choppy in battle.  I recommend if want to pretend you are a blond hair blue eyed kid and you want to see video's of people ""talking"", but if you wanna rip a mechs leg off with an Auto Cannon, stick to MW3.",2.0
"Overall this game is OK, but don't listen to the Microsoft ads.  The story line is good, the action is decent, but the game just dosen't live up to previous Mechwarrior games. The mech lab is horrible.  The player can only exchange weapons of the same type(lasers to lasers, or missles to missles, but you can not replace an AC2 with a PPC, for example), so customization is frustrating and difficult.  The acting is poor, and the opening scene is boring and uninspired.  The mech selection is also poor, although the new mechs are ok.",2.0
"This game was not very well thought out.  Other than the talking characters, the game play feels really cheap.  Feels more like a PS1 game than PS2.  King's Field II is way, way better... so was the first one.  I was expecting this game to be like King's Field since it was made by the same company.  Other than the first person view/feel, attacking, and picking up items, it is nothing like it.  The music is cheap, alot of the rooms look the same, there is no map, and the gameplay is too fast and rushed.  I'm in a poison area where you have to keep activating your Protect Ring to keep yourself safe.  I'm trying to fight monsters and whatnot.  Having to constantly use this item and waste magic doing it instead of being able to use your other rings is a pain.  The game was not very fun to play to begin with, so I don't know why they threw in that poison area.  Don't get me wrong, the game isn't the worst I've played, but it's definitely not what I expected or even remotely close to it.",2.0
"I decided to rent this game and see if it was any good. I beat the thing in four days. I was very dissapointed in the end boss and the ending. The talking sequences sucked. The only thing i liked about the game is the fact that it is a rpg. So my recomendation is walk don't run to the video store and if you are really bored and love frustration, rent this game.",2.0
"When you think Unreal Tournament you should think of a PC and not a console system.  While FPS games have a chance on the console, just think about 007 for the N64, it's difficult to make a winner on the console experience.  Unfortunately, UT does not make it into winner mode.
Play control isn't bad.  There are a fixed number of pre-set ways you can configure the controller, and not everyone will find one that's acceptable.  I prefer setting J which makes it almost identical Oni style controls and seems to me to be the emerging standard control for first-person games.
The multiplayer mode has too many problems to make this game enough fun.  The levels are all pretty small and pretty simple.  There's no network play (though you can hook two PS2s together with an i-Link for 8 player fun), so you'll pretty much max out at 4 people on a split screen forced to use the controllers.
If you're looking for a good multi-player FPS, I'd save your money.  It's only a matter of time before some company makes one.  It takes a little patience.",2.0
"Terrible terrible terrible... very very dissapointed with sony. I actually bought this game for ps2 even tho i had it for the pc. The graphics r terrible, the controls r demented, and it is no fun without playing it with atleast 10 people in the same map with people all over the world, which is a very lacking point of this game.. don't waste your money and time buying this game... get it for the computer... it is cheaper than this one, it's still played, and is a great game... the pc game is a classic, the ps2 one is no more worth a pecan's droppings.",2.0
"Unreal Tournament may have done well on the PC, but for PS2, it seems dull and uninteresting. Although you can confiugure the controls to slightly resemble any other PS FPS game, they do not have the configuribility (I think I just made that word up)  that Timesplitters has, and with my backwards lefthandedness (now I am pretty sure you won't find that one in the dictionary) controller configurability is an esential. Once you get used to what the controls do, you still have to deal with the speed of the game.  I know that it is more realistic to have people die when you shoot them, but one shot virtually decimating your health just means that you are going to spend half of the game trying to get weapons because someone shot you in the face when you were looking for a weapon, because you died when you were looking for weapons.  Sound a bit repetitive?  Well, this game is repetitive.
Another feature this game is missing, that I much enjoy is the ability to choose bots, not just four or five different skill levels, but really being able to pick who they are, and their individual skill levels.
If you are unlike me, and don't happen to mind a limited control over your game, maybe you will like this game, but may I also point out that several of the positive reviews for this game are for the PC version.  Something is apparently lacking from the PS2 version, and since I have never played the PC version, I am unable to tell you what the certain something is.",2.0
"compared to it's PC brethren, this title is sorely lacking.
No online play = no fun without multi-tap and 3 extra dual shock 2's...
Ugly graphics compared to PC, or even fellow PS2 First Person Shooter: TimeSplitters.
Slowdown.  Lots of it.  Especially in multiplayer.  Do not play with more than one other person or you will experience some serious slowdown.  It's not so bad that you CANNOT play it, but it is very frustrating considering how powerful PS2 is!  You shouldn't have to put up with slowdown with this kind of machine.  If you've played Perfect Dark, the slowdown is comparable to that game in 4 player mode.
Horrendous controls.  The game gives me a migraine every time I play it because for some reason the controls aren't fully customizable....",2.0

"This game is visually and responsively pretty good, the graphics and gameplay are very good.  However the major drawback of this game is all the loading time.  It loads before the game, after the introductions, between rounds and after the fight when the decision is made.  The Boxers come to the ring with no enterage and no robe. When you knock out someone in real life the ref doesn't take both boxers to the center of the ring for the decision (do the people who design these games even watch boxing??).  Also you can't fight created boxers in exibition mode or against eachother.  One last thing, the damage to your opponents is very limited.  You can hardly see the cuts, there is no drippings of blood and very little swelling of the eyes or face.  Overall the game is pretty disappointing, especially with the supposed enhancements of PS2. (Rent before you buy!!!!)",2.0
"Graphically awesome.  ""Dynamic Punch Control"" and multi-style boxers allow for infinite ""in the ring"" possiblities.  However, out of the ring, the game goes nowhere.  The training sessions are good, yet the same linear ""climb the ranks"" approach is getting old.  Also, the ""create a boxer"" options are limited (i.e..limited shorts, gloves, tatoos).  The big disapointment is that you can NOT fight created boxers against each other!  Even KK99 had that option.  It is my opinion that EA Sports held back on the out of the ring options.  KK01 for the PSX has more options (i.e..aging, clothing).  I would suggest sacrificing graphics for more game options and buying the cheaper version for the PS1.  The PS2 version looks great but, unfortunetly, that is all.  I think Knockout Kings is the best boxing games you can buy, however, it is nowhere near the level it should be.",2.0

"This game, in one word, is ""bad."" It just doesn't have enough going for it to get over 2 stars. It is a button smasher, and should NOT appeal to any real gamers who have any respect for [their] skills. If you have no skills and can't DO anything besides button mashing, I recommend this game to you, you loser with no reaction time and no idea how to play a game. But here: I'll explain the generous 2 stars I've given this game - it's beautful. The graphics are beautiful, and so are some of the characters *g*, but that doesn't (and never should!) make up for the awful gameplay. Firstoff, there's the awful slow control characteristic of fighting games. Then there's the button mashing. Being a gamer who relies on speed, I brought me fast moves and strategy to bear on my younger sister - and I was demolished for it!! She literally set her controller on the ground and began to smack it, and she beat my arse! My recommendation is against this game, no matter how sexy the girls and how good the graphics!",2.0
"I was really looking forward trying out the Telecaster replica. The image looks good but the distressed look isn't very realistic when you see it in person. I have no problems with the whammy bar or strum bar. My big (huge) gripe is with the buttons.

The buttons don't occupy the full width of the neck They're about 2/3ds of the width. What that means for me is that I often miss hitting a button  because I'm pushing the button on the side nearest to me.

The shape of the button is also a problem. It's squared of rather than rounded (like the Rockband 2 wireless guitar) so if you try to slide a finger from one fret button to another it can catch on the edge of a button.

I've been playing Rockband since it came out on XBOX 360 and also Rockband 2 and the Beatles edition. I'm decent and I can play most songs on Hard with no problem and some in Expert. I'm sure that I could figure out how to make use of this controller if I had to but I don't see the point. It really takes away from the fun of the game to have to adapt the way I play.",2.0

"This review is admittedly more of a rant, but PS2 contollers all very commom and have been available for more than a decade.  So it blows my mind that a new controller still costs about $30.

I had to replace my controller after is died, so I bought two used PS2 contollers off of Amazon to save money, and neither worked.  So I bought a third used (but allegedly functioning) controller at a local game store, and it didn't work either.  So it's pretty clear at this point that buying something like this used is a crapshoot, so I'm pretty much forced to buy it new at $30 to guarantee it works.

It's a shame, the controller is among my favorite designs when it comes to gaming (for me, the Dualshock Controllers, Wii-U classic controlers and Gamecube Controllers are among the best, most natural designs), but 10+ year old hardware like this should cost practically the same as it did when it first came out.",2.0

"When I first purchased the PS2 dual shock controller from Amazon, I was under the impression that I was purchasing a Sony product--similar to the image that was being advertised on the website.  However, to my amazement, the package that I received was a bootlegged version; I felt like I was duped.  Unfortunately, weeks later in my follow-up feedback, it was finally brought to my attention that the item was not an original Sony product.  In the end, I wished that the seller could have been more forthcoming about the product, otherwise I might not have purchased it in the first place.  I guess that's what happens when you pay $7.50 for it; it was just too good to be true.

Overall the controller is still compatible with the PS2 system and the item was shipped, brand new, in a timely fashion.  If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the genuine version then this is the way to go, otherwise do not even bother.",2.0
"The Playstation controller is nice. However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy, maybe even more so. The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both. The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit. This controller feels great with the thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement. Suddenly in 2005, four years after the PS2 was released, games like Metal Gear Solid III: Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini-games feature. The controller has been given new life because of this.

The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality. This controller, for all its design, will give you a dual shock. First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break. Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1, L2 or R1, R2 wing buttons. Even if you don't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming. The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw. Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more. The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink. I have never seen one that managed to remain straight. Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it.

For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust. I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model. Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something. The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit. It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust. I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time. Make these controllers more robust please. The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly.",2.0
"Hell you need it to play games and that is the only reason you need one of these, third party controllers are better and not as flimsy but most won't work with your ps2 so your stuck with the duel shock 2.

"I have played SSX to death.  I have never abused my controller.  Two facts.  After 5 months of use  the R1 and R2 shoulder buttons are prone to sticking.

Starfighter is the 1st game I have played that requires you to always have both thumbs on each analog stick, and let me tell you, your hands end up getting scrunched together into am uncomfortable position, and it is always tough to move the stick towards your body.  The controller is too small when you are faced with using both analog sticks.  Sony was wise to not change the controller to much, so as not to confuse the less avid gamer.  But I expect more.

"I bought this game, thinking it would be as good as the many reviews claim. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. This is just my opinion, but, this game is boring as hell. You just wander around a  drab-looking castle looking for a way out. Maybe it's because I'm 16, but I need something more exciting. You pretty much just run back and forth opening doors, dragging boxes and fighting evil spirits occasionally. Even when you do that, it's just plain annoying. Trust me, it's not all as impressive as they say.",2.0
"I had a feeling this game would be more than less, since it's on playstation and not playstation 2 or dreamcast. the line is pretty good, it's a dang shame that wing zero, tallgeese, or any other favored gundams from gundam wing aren't on this game beside wing gundam. the special moves are lack luster and limited. why does dodging take away power from your life and why do you have a limit on your shooting powers? basically this game has no appeal to me what so ever. thank god i got this game free instead of wasting my money on it. if you want a real good gundam game, then write to bandai or somebody cus this isn't worth it.",2.0
"Why is it when developers unleash a franchise game they tend to get lazy and contemptuous with their design?  For years I've been waiting for a good Gundam game, so it was with great excitement that I launched into this game.  What Bandai delivered is a game that has great visuals and a wonderful cast of characters from past and present Gundam series, but a fighting game that is lukewarm at best, absolutely horrendous at worst.
Badly balanced characters is the worst aspect of this game.  I've finished the game with every character by now, but every time I have to fight ""Psycho Gundam MkII"", it's still one of the most unpleasantly ill-balanced fights I've ever come across.  I know some gamers equate difficulty with fun and unfairness with challenge, but fighting a computer character whose every hit takes off about eight times more energy than you do isn't exactly my idea of fun (and I'm not talking about a Psycho Crusher-style, one-time-only super move either).  Even among the usable characters, Zeong (possibly my favourite Gundam character ever) and Quin Mantha are quite weak, but The-O is lopsidedly powerful.
There aren't that many playing options, either -- the Vs. mode doesn't offer that many more characters to choose from; the Story mode has laughable, generic Japanese anime cliche dialogue (""I'm as tough as they come"", ""I'll destroy you"", etc.), and the ending is so flimsy I would've rather not had any ending at all.
Being a huge Gundam fan, I still give this game an extra star.  Based on gameplay alone, this is a real stinker.  The only point of recommendation is really for the characters.  Sure, it's fun to play as Sazabi or Zaku II, but does that make up for a very bad fighting engine, dirt-poor response and careless design?  Not for me.",2.0
"Again, the video game industry has succeded in building up tremendous hype and aniticipation for a game which cannot possibly live up to it.  I've heard all the talk that most likely caused you to look up this game: amazing graphics, intuative concepts and deep gameplay which mirrors Zelda.  After having experienced this game, I am deeply dissapointed.
  The concept is at least original - overcome obstacles and challenges and help a princess follow you to the exit of a castle.  Along the way, solve puzzles so the princess can continue to follow behind you.  This plays well for the first hour or two, but quickly becomes annoying and repetative.
  There are some great puzzles in this game that will leave you scratching your head for hours.  However, that's about all the game is - puzzles.  There are a few action sequences, but those simply involve pushing the fight button repeatedly.  Once you get sick of the same old puzzles - some of which take forever to solve because of the bad control - Ico loses its appeal.
  The graphics are somewhat impressive, but they can't show off much besides the inside of the castle, plus there is a lot of fog.  Many other PS2 games have superior graphics.  Often, intircate parts of the puzzles get lost in myraids of grey and fog, making the puzzle nearly impossible to figure out.
  It comes down to this: if you're a die hard puzzle/strategy gamer, check out Ico, but don't expect much more.  Calling this an RPG is an outright lie.  If you expect variety from a game, avoid this one.  I checked it out for a 5 day rental, played it straight through over one night, then returned it the next day out of boredom and went back to Devil May Cry - a much better investment.  There are lots of better PS2 games you should look into.  Otherwise, just save your money for a Gamecube.",2.0
This game was wonderful to play all the way through.  The puzzles keep you thinking yet they don't get in your way.  The game play seems fluid and none of the puzzles seem contrived or forced.

"So it looks like Majesco decided to finally rerelease the GameGear hardware.  Unfortunately, I don't think too many people are going to care.  First of all there are no new games coming out for the system.  The back-lit screen is nice, but it eats batteries (6 AA's last around 3 or 4 hours).  And the physical size of the unit is absolutely huge.  About the only good thing the system has going for it is the low price.  But even with the low price I still don't believe it is worth the price of admission.  The money would be better suited going towards a GameBoy Color (or a GameBoy Advance later on this year).  The GameGear wasn't worth the money when it launched 9 years ago, and it still isn't today.",2.0

2) It does not support the TV Tuner adapter. (You get audio but no picture)
3) The case is not as studery & the brightness control is hard to turn.
So if you have never used a GameGear before & want an inexpensive portable game system, than go ahead.  If you want to replace a warn out, broken, lost one, than this would be an inexpensive alternative.  But if you have the TV Tuner, and LOVE the classic game gear than you sould either look for a used classic one or get your's repaired.",2.0
"The combat system is great. It's so nice how a fairly simple number of controls can be combined in so many ways. It's incredible to be surrounded by enemies, and be able to just work through them like in a movie, using the right combinations of moves to put them against each other and yourself out of danger.
That's why I gave this game an extra star, for the combat system alone. Hell if this even had multiplayer, that alone might warrent it another star. Too bad.
The story is very standard fare, no character development. But this is okay, I can deal with this in action games.
But the level design is horrible. Every level is the same exact thing: fight some guys, flip a switch, open a new door, repeat. No reason to explore, no puzzles or obstacles, nothing. I got so bored. For a pure action game, level design is critical.
In terms of strict realism, I guess the levels are pretty good, but then I look at Deus Ex, which had very realistic levels, but they were also extremely fun to play. In Oni there were constantly empty rooms that did absolutly nothing.
The save feature is bad, but you probably know this by now. To just barely get through a fight and be looking for health, to open a door and suddenly hit a new save spot (with no indication that it was there), where the only way to go is foward through a load of enemies is NOT fun.
In short: Great combat. Boring levels. Fustrating play. No multiplayer.",2.0

"I purchased this game the day that it came out. I have been a fan of the Resident Evil series from the beginning. This game and Resident Evil 0 (now coming out for the Gamecube) are two of the main reasons I bought an N64. However when I got the game home and started playing it, I immediately found some things that bothered me. While in general RE2 is a very good port of the PlayStation version it has some problems that the PS version didn't. The first problem, and the biggest one, is the controller. The game was built around the PS controller and Capcom didn't take the proper time to rework the control scheme too well. The design of the N64 controller makes it hard for people to easily access all of the buttons. In a game like this all the buttons need to be accessible. While after a while you will get more or less used to the controls, it still doesn't feel right, and I feel this holds the game back a chunk.
The second problem, albeit a small(er) one is the fact that you can change the colour of the blood that is in the game. It's a neat idea that just doesn't work. If you've played any of the rest of the series and know exactly what's going on, you know there's absolutely no reason for the zombies to bleed green. Humans, even after they're dead, don't bleed green.
It was quite impressive that Capcom managed to port all of the FMVs from the PS game onto the N64 cart, and they did a good job of it too. Unfortunately due to the type of media the N64 uses the FMVs just aren't as good as the PS game's.
If you have an expansion pack in your system it can actually make the game look better than originally which is nice. It does a good job of this and hats off to Capcom for enabling this to work.
To sum it all up:
-if you have a PS and an N64 buy the PS version.
-if you just have an N64 and want to be able to kill lots of zombies and other creatures, and don't mind get incrdibly frustrated with the controller then by all means buy this version
-Scares aren't as plentiful as they should be, but at least the first time through it can give you a few jumps.",3.0

The post play commentary is amusing, but as one comment goes following a late body slam, ""was that really necessary?""-my fatherly response is a resounding ""NO"", which is why I gave the game a 3 as opposed to a 4 or 5.

This game is alright.  It is pretty fun and kind of scary but the game has alot of backtracking that gets annoying.  Dinos become very smart and mean.  This game is fun but just get ready for a couple of hours of boredom before you get to the real action.  The puzzles are pretty hard as well.  The music is pretty good.  This game is decent over-all.  Buy if you are looking for something different than zombies chasing you around.,3.0
"Dino Crisis in word is relatively cool.  But there are too many flaws for it to be anything apecial in the world.  First off, there are so many cutscenes you can't skip.  This is supposed to be scary!  Well, its not, not even close to it.  They add some deep-bass music and they call it a horror game.  What surprised me even more was that Capcom, the makers of the Resident Evil series made it.  Not even close to Resident Evil at all in quality, and it should be better.  When I got the game, all I did was play the Resident Evil 3: Nemesis demo that came with it.  Dino Crisis has good graphics, dang good sound (as in sound effects), and cool enough weapans (you only get, like 5 weapans though which makes the game boring).  The fight scenes are just too boring, you shoot the stupid dinosaur (you only fight against raptors through the whole game accept for bosses which is also stupid).  The game is just too boring, not scary, and in word, not fun to play at all in my opinion.  There are some gory perks that help it out.  There are a few puzzles, but they are way too easy to figure out.  The acting is bad as well, just stuff that you wouldn't say when there are dino's running around trying to rp ya apart.  And in the cutscenes the people seem to move like there were some programming probablems at the office.  The videos (expecially in the beggining of the game) earn it the 3 stars it got.  I do not reccommend this game, go buy Resident Evil 3 or Quake 2 or something if you're looking for some action in your gaming day.",3.0

"I have been playing video games since I was about six years old.  I am 29 now, and recently I have lost interest in video games in favor of more intellectually challenging past times.  However I am still interested in games that have some kind of problem solving or strategic elements.  So I decided to give Resident Evil 3 a try.  I had played Resident Evil 2, but didn't remember there being many puzzles.  It was mostly just collecting items in order to unlock doors or otherwise advance farther into the game.  I heard Resident Evil 3 featured some legitimately challenging puzzles, in addition to the classic survival horror elements of strategically using limited supplies of ammo and other essential commodities.  However when I played the game, I found the puzzles to be either really easy, or just boring exercises in pattern recognition.  Even the survival horror classification is kind of bunk.  There's PLENTY of ammo for all your zombie killing needs.  It's also really easy to figure out when you are supposed to fight the zombies, and when your supposed to just run past them.

In short, if you like third person shooters, this game definitely delivers in that regard.  Just don't get this game expecting any kind of intellectual challenge.",3.0

"Nemesis was obviously an expansion of the Mr. X element found in senario B of Resident Evil 2. Upon each encounter with him the screen flashes white, where you must make a choice between two options of how Jill will handle the situation. For example, you get to choose between hiding in a chest or running out the door. The game takes place mostly in the streets of Raccoon city and there are more zombies. A quick turn around 180 degree move was implemented whick makes running away easier. Also, you only can only play as Jill as the main character. The graphics are better than RE2's but the theme is not as dark which takes away from the mood.

The controls and camera angles are the same as the games before it, but what drags this game down is the weak story and regenerating zombies. Things have gotten a bit cheesy this time around, I can't really tell what it is but it feels like a washed up version of RE. It's like zombies are now common place and the novelty of the idea was wearing off at the time RE3 came out. It's the story that doesn't bring much to the table that really makes the game feel dull. Combine that with the wack controls, the dated ink ribbon save system, and the limited inventory space, and what you get is the negative aspects of the Resident Evil series without the soul/personality.

The best feature is the Nemesis element but that even at times gets annoying. The choice system sometimes punishes you for logical choices where an option seems like you'll be able to run away and the other indicates that you want to stay and fight but the outcome is actually the opposite. It's like those 'choose your own adventure' games where you make an innocent choice and jump to the given page, only to find you got gang raped by baboons... or something like that.

Because the streets are more open there are a lot of dead ends and back tracking, and what pissed me off was that zombies would regenerate for no reason, or maybe for the reason to show 'you can never clear out a whole city of zombies'. Whatever. Because the story is pretty mediocre I didn't get much satisfaction from beating the game aside from finally being able to put it down. That was back then. Now with the recent play through taking turns with my brother, we died a stupid death and immediately decided ""forget this game"". Technically it's not broken, it's just the overall feeling of indifference that gave no incentive to soldier on. Luckily Capcom was able to rebound with Code Veronica. 3 Stars.",3.0

"Resident Evil 3: Nemesis - Circa 2000

GOOD:
- Nemesis enemy adds a new twist to the game and makes it more intense
- Good story, with twists and turns
- Some nice bonus mini games to unlock

BAD:
- Graphics look pretty dated
- Voice acting is not that great
- Controls feel dated

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:
- Slow moving ""survival horror"" game, which is more about moving boxes, managing items, and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life
- A Sc-Fi horror game set in a city over run with zombies, and a super zombie called Nemesis

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Resident Evil 2
- Dino Crisis 2
- Silent Hill
- Alone in the dark

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Half of this game takes places during the events of Resident Evil 2
- There is a remake of this game for the Nintendo Game Cube, which doesn't really upgrade anything
- The playable character (Jill) was also one of the playable characters in the first Resident Evil
- In Japan Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is called Biohazard: Last Escape",3.0

"One of the coolest things Dreamcast offered was the VMU. After all, it was a Gameboy like memory card that fit into the controller perfectly and gave it a little screen. Yeah, wow, a screen. I still don't see how the screen is useful. In Sonic Adventure it displays a freaky little Chao pretty much the whole time. In Crazy Taxi it just had an animation loop. So the ugly useless screen is out for me until I find a game that uses it. Then the buttons. WHAT ARE THE BUTTONS FOR? It goes IN the controller and the buttons are COVERED UP. When I take it out it just sits like a brick and does not display anything. So why the cute little D-pad and tiny little A/B? As a memory card it functions well and is conveniently placed. Yet after five games I ran out of memory. FIVE GAMES! My Gamecube memory card has close to 20 games on it and is only half full. Even my junky third party PS2 memory card holds more. I could hardly fit a Chao onto it. So, while this is the official memory card, you might be better off with a third party model.",3.0

Aw it takes me back to a simplier time when our country was not burdened by such a huge debt. Take me away Dreamcast, you rock. Did you think that I was going to lose?",3.0
"ok, so this game is innovative and different...how can you say that? its basically an exact duplicate of the original, only bigger guns and more monsters. still, i love the series, so i have nothing against it. the gameplay can get a little repetitive at times, with all the running back and forth, and the HARD mode is ridiculous. lots of fun but a little boring at times. my only major con with the game is this-you have a shotgun, a magnum, a bazooka, and you STILL need a key to open doors? id just blow the friggen thing down. yeah i see it needs to be this way for gameplay i just think its stupid. same thing with the nemesis, after you knock him down for the count at a time, why not blow his head away until nothing is left? that would certainly put an end to that, don't you think? all in all, a good game plauged by minor problems.",3.0
The VMU has some cute features like mini games and it can be your watch so you know what time it is. It has other cool features. But i don't reccomend it because all it holds is 200 blocks of memory. Get the 4 slot 200 block each slot memory cards. It worked great for me. I just forgot what brand it was made by so youll have to look for it closely if you want it. The VMU is just kinda a waste of money. ONLY GET ONE OF EM DONT EVEN THINK OF GETTING 2!,3.0
"I really loved playing RE2, but this installation to the series wasn't as good.
I beat the game very quickly, and did not see much need to go back and play again (like the dual storylines and multiple endings RE2  had).
The Nemesis following me around thoughout the entire game was just  plain annoying.  For key plot points, it made perfect sense... but at other  times he just ran around after me while I was trying to explore.
You only  switch characters once, and for a short amount of time.
All in all, I was  not as impressed by this game as I had expected.  I definitely recommend  renting/buying RE2 (it will take you longer to finish, that's for sure),  and then renting RE3 if you are still interested in the series.",3.0
"The product was a gift for my granddaughter, and it was sent directly to her.  I cannot personally evaluate it.  I do know that she was unable to use it right away because it required some connecting software that was not included.  Hopefully, this problem has now been resolved.",3.0
"This device might be needed, but why doesn't Dreamcast have that built into the console itself?  Hmmm... I wonder. ;-)
People who wish to buy Dreamcast in the future need to know about this extra necessity (at extra cost): what I would call a gimick. It's a sleezy thing to do, really, in my opinion, not providing game saves within the console itself when it is a basic function needed by many games.  You think you have everything you need when you buy Dreamcast, but oh, no.",3.0
It came on time and it worked. Thank you. They sent me an extra game and an extra console just in case I needed parts. I'm grateful.,3.0
"This review is directed more towards the gamer that is looking to get into older systems, because I do get the feeling that most (not all) of the love that the Dreamcast gets comes from people that owned one from the get go.  I have been a gamer since the Colecovision/Atari days, and I do still very much appreciate good old fashioned games, but something tells me that many (again, not all) people that have grown too accustomed to 2 anologue sticks will have a hard time going back to 1 stick for 3D games.  Personally, PSone 3D games haven't aged well with me either, and have preferred the Sega Genesis for my old school kick.

The Dreamcast does offer a decent set of adventure and survival horror games, but is rather sparse in RPGs and platformers - If you love RPGs (and little else), then this system is not for you.  There are a couple of really good ones (Skies of Arcadia, Grandia 2), however, they are also offered on other systems, which might also be of interest.  The Dreamcast also doesn't offer much for the FPS lovers that have gotten into the genre after the PS2 and original XBOX came out.  Yes, there are a few (Unreal Tournament, Quake, Half Life), but most that love 2 sticks with their FPSs will probably squirm with 1 stick.

Now, where the Dreamcast's library really shines is 2D fighters and space shooters.  If you absolutely love either, then the Dreamcast is pure heaven, and buying one is practically a no brainer.  Actually, you can throw 3D fighters in there too since games like the original Soul Calibur and the Power Stone series are still incredibly fun.  Sports games are another strong suit for the library if you don't mind playing with outdated rosters (Sega really gave EA a run for their money).

Sega also had a knack for releasing some quirk that was easy to fall in love with - Games like Chu Chu Rocket and Ooga Booga are still  very fun multi-player games.  Unfortunately, some of that good quirk (Samba de Amigo, Seaman) are best used with accessories that have gotten rather expensive and tough to come by (although, I'm sure collectors won't mind at all).

In the Dreamcast's favor is that it has gotten cheap.  Although some of the games that makes the system a worthwhile purchase have gotten expensive, there are still some moderately priced options that are totally decent for those with a passing curiosity for the system.

I do view this as a very niche system, and I don't think that it will appeal to everyone.  Again, this review is geared more towards people that never grew up with (or owned) a Dreamcast.  I do think that ANY gamer could probably have some fun with this system, but I also think that many of the passerbys that picked one up years later will wonder what all the fuss was about.  Sure, it was revolutionary in it's heyday, but that doesn't mean much to people that are in love with their PS3s, Wiis, and 360s (or people that simply skipped the Dreamcast on their way to a PS2, Gamecube, or Xbox).

If you're thinking about picking up a Dreamcast, I would suggest doing a little homework to make sure that the library suits your tastes.  Although, it is not expensive, you might end up spending a bit on games just to find out that you're really not that into it.",3.0
I had purchase one before and getting this one for my grandkids was just as good has my dreamcast,3.0
"This is one of the most realistic driving simulation games available in the market.  The reason is that there is actual damage effects if you drive your exotic cars recklessly.
One of the most impressive damage effects in  this game is the damage effect of your car's tubeless tires.  Tires could  blow off and only the rims are left.  The damage will in fact affect your  sharp turns and the stability of your car.  They also spark as a result of  friction between the metal rims and hard asphalt.
Headlights and  brakelights will be damaged as soon as your car bumps into something.  The  damage of your car's headlights will impair your driving at night.  As a  consequence, you can hardly drive your car at its top speed.
Other damage  effects include the damage of your car's rooftop when your car turn over,  tire marks on the road, and fire comes out from the gas tank.  Furthermore,  graphics and sound effects of this game are relatively comparable to its  sequels.
The drawback of this game is that you cannot buy spare parts and  fix the damages that you have caused to your car.  You cannot pop the hood  open and re-tune the engine after the race.  You cannot modify your car.  There is just so much things that you cannot do to your car.
In  conclusion, without those impressive damage effects, this is just another  typical driving simulation game.  It is pretty boring and it just can't  keep me playing for months.",3.0
"I will state why I like and don't like the Dreamcast.
_pros_
Good graphics
4 controller ports
56K modem built in
2 mem. card slots per controller
small size
_cons_
very NOISY
no dvd player
very small amount of games
the games stink!
cheap controllers
Even though the Ps2 is alot better system the Dreamcast is cool. It was far ahead of its time though. And the games were absolutely horrible. There were very few good ones and no, Sonic is not one of them. Athough it is a good system I would recommend getting a Playstation 2. The Dreamcast is dead and they are not making any more games for it.",3.0
"If you have a 3dfx card, if you have a more advanced card like TNT2 or  Geforce, just don't update your drivers and you should be alright.  You  don't get all the graphic benefits but it goes pretty fast in 32 bit mode  at 1024 x 768.  Nice selection of cars and cocpits too.  Music very good.  Engine noise could have been better, too synth, but better than most racing  games.  I haven't driven in a while but I know what it's like to go above  the speed limit on a winding road. and this game is decent at simulating  it(especicially if I play in a pitch dark room)",3.0
"From the beginning, this game starts off difficult.  The cars in this game have particularly weird handling, the feeling just isn't right, especially if you play the previous Need For Speed games, on either computer or game  consoles. I liked the graphic detail of the game.  It was smooth and  everything just flowed, no matter the high settings I set game options to  have.  Another feature about this game that I like was the selection of  cars to race.  However, I really would have liked to see some commuter cars  that we normally see out there, to have cars that games like Grand Turismo  has.  I believe that would be nice.  And also to have the ability to supped  up the cars too.  Those are what the things that have been missing in the  Need For Speed series that I would definitely like to see in the future.",3.0
"I am an owner of a Dreamcast,Ps1,Ps2,sega saturn,sega genesis,gamecube,N64,and an Xbox and I love my dreamcast , the graphics on it are alot better than my Ps1 and N64,sega saturn,and genesis but not better than my PS2 and Xbox and just as good as my Gamecube I love the modem its great. the games are great too.
 This is a great system",3.0
"This system has good graphics, but it was released between the time of ps and ps2. Sega whould have waiting  a year. While they do that, they should have upgraded the system. Therefore, this system was not in the competition of gcn, xbox, and ps2. nothing more to say... its a disapointment that i bought this piece of junk for the price of 3 ps1 which is way better. there are only 20 games for this thing. im sure NEVER gonna buy any sega consoles ever.",3.0
"The Dreamcast is an awesome console. It has cool grahics, great game, a responive yet ugly looking controllor, and a build-in 56K modem. Even though it has nice games most of its games can be found on the Gamecube, Xbox and the PS2, so why would you want it now that their on the other systems. But if you simply must have it please do so, I highly recommend it.",3.0
"i bought a dreamcast last year for my 13th birthday (when n64 is dead and ps1 was not at its best) and i thought it was pretty f'n good
the graphics were good and the gameplay was impressive, but then the ps2 came out and i wished that i had bought a ps2.
the ps2 is quite a bit more expensive but u r payin 4 the future man..sega has abandoned the dreamcst and everyone is sayin that the dream cast has great games..well whatever u see now are the only games u will see.. they are making no more games.but the ps2 has all the good game companies now and they r here to stay.. personally it is out of the xbox and the ps2...dont even look at the gamecube.. but out of xbox and ps2 ps2 is better because it has all the good companies but xbox only has computer companies..anyway, bak 2 the dreamcast....if u are up to about 13yrs or younger and u r happy with the games already out then bloody hell go for it, i mean 49.95 is an excellent price for a good console.. but if u r like a bit more older and mature and u r looking to the future that get the ps2..dont forget the ps2 is backwards compatible..
in conclusion, i would say that the dreamcast is a very nice console with good games and if u like the price(and u definately will) and u love arcade and sport games that go for it

"Got this shipped to me without any packing material.  It just clunked and whirled but did not play games.  Amazon is giving me a refund.  Whether the unit was damaged during shipping or not, it did not work.
Since Amazon is out of the Dreamcasts, I combed the retail stores in my area and found one left.  It works great.  If you can find one, (...) you get graphics and gameplay equal to a PS2 (I have a PS2, only the controls are different). (...) Both versions look and play identical. (...)
Listen to this Christmas shoppers:  I was able to pick up a Dreamcast, 2 Virtual Memory Units (VMUs), 2 rumble packs, a second controller, the keyboard, and 10 games (enough to keep anyone busy) for (...)less than the price of a PS2 or Xbox console (and just the consoles at that). (...)  This system is a bargin if you can find one.  Games are going fast, but check around... they are available if you look.
Since one unit was bad, I'll give this console a 3 star rating.  0 for the one that did not work.  5 out of 5 for the one that does.  It's too bad Sega could not woo developers (such as EA), otherwise this console might still have a future.  Bottom line: Great Games and Gameplay, Great Size (smaller than GameCube), Great Prices.

"I bought the Dreamcast just to get World Series Baseball 2K.  I was pleased at first, but then I was disgusted.  The game is fun and all, but you're limited to options during gameplay.  I ended up buying other games and the graphics are great.  However I found it hard to find a good game.  I just bought an XBox yesterday and I can't wait for it to come.  If you're thinking about buying a Dreamcast, save your money and go with one of the newer systems.  GO XBOX!",3.0
"Is everyone out of touch here. Dreamcast is dust. Another game system out for a year to make a quick buck. They are now switching to software producing with PLAYSTATION and NINTENDO. I was lucky enough to catch this and sell everything I have for 100.00 and basically I took the person for the simple reason that they are going to only make 30 titles the rest of the year. Hooray...I mean, what's that tell you. To further the testament of how cashed this system is, the slashed the price from 149.99 to 99.99, just like that.  Remember the Atari Jaguar, or the Sega CD. In a year, Sega dreamcast will be amongst the relics of gaming consoles. So everyone who continues to buy the now Console only package, you make no sense. I, on the other hand will either wait to buy PS2 or Microsoft's X-Box.  I will give you this, DC was good, NFL2K1 was fun...but move on people to something that will be around for more than a year.",3.0

"You know those games that the magazines all say is cool and your friends tell you about and it's the talk of the year, and when you buy it it's great, but your playing something else in a week. I think Tekken 3 is one of those games. I'll be honest, the game itself is fun, but repetative. You'll soon find that all of the characters and levels never change, and the Tekken Force mode does very little to improve. It, just like the game, gets old. I guarantee you will play the game all the way through just to unlock all the player videos though. If you can get the game used and VERY cheap, buy it. It's a fine game for a while, but nothing you'll play for years.",3.0
I am asking for advice since I cannot get email addresses. Especially from someone who knows about the difference between PS2 and dreamcast. I was ready to buy a PS2 but after reading some reviews I am confused and ready to now buy a Dreamcast. So please someone help me with this tough decision. I would like to hear from Matt N. Thank You. I will continue to read this website. I appreciate any feedback.,3.0
This game will satisfy all the Tekken fans of the past.  Button mashing galore.  I didn't find it that satisfying.  We unlocked all of the characters and beat the game.  What more was there to do?,3.0
"Okay, Tekken 3 isn't too bad or too good either. You fight on a rotating block that is uh...boring. Pretty cool combos and people. I like King the best. Some people cuss when they get hit and the graphics are pretty fine if you ask me. Wasn't an overall bore or an overall excitement. It was smack dab in the middle.",3.0
"Again we have another year where a new console wasn't available for you to buy.  So the only alternative buy a system already on the shelf.  Choices are few as PS1, N64 is really all that's left.  But hey what about Sega.  Though most of Sega's system were bad, many of the games were good.  Except for Sega CD and the 32x adapter the Genesis games were pretty darn good in there day.  But The SNES just mopped the floor with the Genesis.
But Dreamcast was passed up on it's release because of price and having on;ly 2 bad games.  But now since the PS2 isn't available, people wanting a next generation system have fallen to the Dreamcast.  It is a good system that has new technologies that you have to wait for when they are released for PS2.  Sony loves making you spend more money for addons.  For instance for 299 bucks the PS2 doubles as a DVD system.  Since it plays DVD wouldn't it have been great for it to come with a remote?  DVD players that cost half as much come with one.  You have to buy a multitap to play with more then 2 players, at least the N64 and the Dreamcast have the ports right on the front.  At least Nintendo and Sega have enough since to include most of the stuff u need.
The PS2's bad design will be this systems fall when the next generation systems come out.
Sega has spent it's last money to make the Dreamcast a success and now new life has been breathe into it.  They are selling like crazy, because the PS2 is a bad investment.  But it may be to late as Sega may be software bound instead of hardware bound.
Hey even Atari had it's day.  Just think they would still be here if they had teamed up with Nintendo when Nintendo asked them.
What will be the demise of Sega?",3.0
"I bought the dreamcast because of its lower cost than PS2 and because I could get one for Christmas, but I am starting to regret this decision.  NFL2k is not that great of a game although the graphics are nice.  I have used playstation for the last few years and I have come to expect more from sports games.  Does Sega not have a liscense agreement with EA sports?  If not the DreamCast may be obsolete in a few months because its games do not have the depth and game play that are customary in EA games.  Does anyone out there know if Sega will ever get a deal with EA?  If not I may have to put the DreamCast up for sale even though I have only owned it for two weeks.",3.0
"For those of you who have not played the Tekken game series, it is a 3D fighting game; that uses the same button configuration as Street Fighter 2 (Fierce Kick, Medium Kick, Weak Kick). What makes Tekken different from other fighting games are the moves, smooth animations and the cinematic movies for each character that is used to beat the game (you also get a new fighter when you beat the game), however that becomes the point of the game, seeing these movies. Each movie unravels part of a mystery (as to why your even playing the game). A person can beat the game in 20 minutes, because each fight only lasts about 20 seconds, so the pace is pretty fast and you don't need experience to beat the game. Unfortunately there is not much noticeably different from Tekken 2.",3.0
I like this game but there are not many cheats and it gets old quick but if you want a thrill buy it.,3.0
"I'm glad I had the opportunity to play this game, since I love the Star Ocean franchise.  It can, however, be a little slow.",3.0
"The concept behind Star Ocean 2 is great.  The plot is long and involving.  Private actions offer a lot of flexibility in the plot as well as determining the type of ending you get.  How many other games can say they have 80 endings... NONE!  I like the real time battles where your allies act on their own.  Unfortunately, sometimes your allies act dumb and you have to tell them everything to do, which gets mind-numbing quickly.  If they souped up the graphics just a little bit more and did a little more with the music (which wasn't bad to listen to, but wasn't exciting), the game would rate right up there with the Final Fantasy games.  I love the character interactions and the voices.",3.0
"This game was immense.  The sheer volume of options in character development was overwhelming.  If you want a game on a grand scale, this is the one for you.  The storyline is very good and the skill system was a  very good idea.  Characters are not developed enough, but interaction  between them was interesting, especially the way that it affected the game.  The final battle is unfairly difficult.  It requires more skill than luck  to complete.  Replay value is probably this games greatest attribute.  Because the game is so affected by your actions, it can be very different.  Also, there are a wide variety of characters that you can use.  These  things combined with the skill system can make this into a somewhat  different game each time you play it.  If you are not short on patience,  this can be a very fun game with a lot of replay value.",3.0
"I had heard all the hype about Virtua Fighter 3tb for the Dreamcast, and when I saw it for cheap I picked it up expecting a hell of a fighting game.  What I got was a mixed bag, this game is nowhere as fun as people say and can't hold a candle to other fighting games like Soul Calibur and Dead or Alive 2 for the Dreamcast in terms of graphics, play modes, and playability.  The graphics don't even look like Dreamcast graphics, they look like the game was developed on the Sega Saturn, but the cons end there.  The gameplay is deep however, the fighting styles take a lot of time to master for each character, and after you do the game is a breeze.  It's a decent fighting game, but nowhere as good as it is said to be.  ...",3.0
"i played this for my xbox and I kinda got stuck for free roaming, if your planning to get this any time soon, this free roam thing has no map guis, so if you trying to look for a mission and you went to another adventure field/mystic ruins, you could get lost easily, because I really got lost going onto snow cap. otherwise, its a good game, I only beat sonic and tails, so I don't want to spoil",3.0
"This is just one of those titles that you pop in and expect to be taken back to a similar time. Eh, maybe not so much as you'd think. It's not a bad game by any means, but it is one of those early 3D games that just hasn't gotten the camera down quite yet. That, and Big the Cat.

Buy this game if you really want to go back down memory lane, but just remember to temper your enthusiasm",3.0
"This game is broken down into three components. There is the adventure mode that is quite subpar, minigames that are mediocre, and finally the stages that are very fun to play. Once you clear a stage or minigame on the adventure mode, it unlocks and you may just play it by itself from the main menu when the game boots up. You may play as 6 different characters, all with their own unique stories, stages, and minigames. I thought this was a brilliant implementation of the game. Although, admittedly the Sonic and Tails stages are way more fun the the stages for Big the Cat, Knuckles, or the robot. The Amy stages are somewhere in the middle.

The controls are somewhat frustrating at times, particularly in the adventure mode. The NPC humans in the adventure mode look downright like stick figures graphically, and stand there like manequins unless you knock into them. Then they flinch for a moment and go right back to their original position.

The adventure mode plays like an exploration game. You must figure out what to do to get to the next cutscene, minigame, or stage. You must find the object or area that will take you to it. This is a rather mundane and boring, sometimes frustrating, part of the game.

Sometimes the camera angles in this game make it so you can not see your character or get any sense of direction. Again, this is most often in the adventure mode.

The cutscenes in the adventure mode are well presented and timed. The fade from the adventure mode to the cutscenes is well paced. The graphics look great, and soundtrack well performed.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the sonic characters, as you can play and develop so many of them. If you like action or 3D platformer type games, you will probably enjoy this game as well.

This game is definitely worth a play though to see if you like it. I did, I own it, have beaten the game with several of the characters, and still enjoy playing it to this day. However, this game is hardly the best the Dreamcast has to offer.",3.0
"There really is no storyline to this game.  All you do is go to the dungeon, kill monsters, and come back.  THATS IT.  There is no real character interaction, no plot development, and no detail in the 5 house town.
the good side-  a way to have a little fun and kill something. (may sound twisted, but hey when your bored, it may be the only thing to do).  There are some cool items to buy and find, and the unlimited views are amazing.  You can literally have ANY view you want of the character.  Plus, the loading time is short.
I suggest you buy this game if you liked Diablo, but if you want a REAL RPG then get Baldur's gate or Ultima Collection.",3.0
"Usually I'm an adventure game fanatic at heart, but this game was bought for me as a gift and I found myself greatly caught up on it as soon as I installed it on my computer.
The game is very much a dungeon bash situation.  You create a character and assign them attributes, buy them weapons, and then go out to the local dungeon and pound every monster you meet, bather up as much treasure as you can, and then buy better weapons so you can kill even more monsters.
While you're in town the villagers will tell you about items that have been stolen that you can find and return for rewards, or people who ask for your help in killing a particularly nasty monster, or they tell you a bit about the big creature you'll find yourself facing at the end of the game.  Your ultimate goal will be to gather several crystals together to gain an item that will allow you to take on the evil dragon lord at the end of the game, but there's dozens of other quests to keep you occupied meanwhile.
One of the most innovative features to the game is that it maps each area and dungeon differently for every new game you start, plus it juggles the quests around so that no one game is exactly like another.  It was an interesting detail that wasn't necessary, but was nice of the programmers to add.
All in all, I was quite pleased with this game.  There's times when one gets bored with confusing puzzle games and you just want to run around in a dungeon and hack up monsters.  Darkstone offers adventure by the bucketload, and will hold your attention for awhile.",3.0
"When Blizzard released its mega-hit Action/RPG hybrid Diablo in 1996, it was gobbled up with enthusiastic acclaim from critic and gamer alike, with good reason.  It evolved the addictive dungeon-crawling formula from  Gauntlet with gloomy, gothic architecture to create one of the most  satisfying romps to straddle both sides of the Action/RPG fence in years,  and shared distinction with Daggerfall in bringing CRPGing out of its  regressive  slump in the last few years.  After the initial deluge, it's  odd that most other gaming companies out there were slow to carpe diem with  their own bandwagon products, given their the propensity to create  ""me-too"" games if it follows a successful formula.  So, this  sensory input sluggishly trudged through the nervous system of the gaming  industry until finally, in late 1999, it hit the brains of the rival CEOs,  and out marched the clones.  Darkstone lead the pack with Revenant and Nox  soon to follow.  It's a good thing that the most derivative of the three,  Darkstone, was released first, because come this summer when Diablo II will  be released (uh, so the grapevine says), this franchise will definitely be  damaged goods.
Darkstone is SO derivative, down to the color of the  potions, names of equipment, character classes, stats, and mouse controls,  that if I'd been handed this game without documentation on a nondescript CD  I'd have thought it was ""Diablo 3D.""  I challenge you to find a  reviewer who DOESN'T make a Diablo allusion with this game.  Even developer  DSI is self-conscious about this, its very manual instructing gamers at the  beginning that if they ""are already familiar with this type of  game,"" an obvious reference to Diablo, they can move on to appendixes  outlining the major differences in structure from its predecessor.  Even  banner advertisements for Darkstone that I was privy too touted ""All  you former Diablo players searching for a new home, your search is  over.""  There is something refreshing about a gaming company that  admits that its product is nothing more than a stylistic rip-off.
The  best way to review Darkstone would be to speak about how it in fact DIFFERS  from Diablo.  First off, in single-player mode you have the option of  playing simultaneously with two characters, with the computer controlling  one.  This teamwork makes progress easier, and AI used is decent enough  with a Warrior or Thief.  In Town (yes, that's its name, ""Town,""  DSI must have rightly assumed that naming it would be redundant, after all,  one of the most oft typed phrases I saw on Diablo's Battle. Net was  ""see u in town""), in addiction to the mandatory  blacksmith/witch/healer/innkeeper present there was also a banker for  hoarding all that extra loot taking up space in your inventory, and  anything that you purchase that exceeds what's in your pocket is extracted  from your account (medieval debiting!  How progressive!).  There is also a  Skills Trainer, who trains you in, well, skills, and various tiers of  ability, that operate much the same way as spells except they don't tax  your stats any.  Some skills passively assist your character, such as  ""Trade"" and ""Perception"" which endow your hero with the  ability to haggle merchant prices and detect trapped objects, other skills  like ""Forester"" or ""Theft""  have to be activated.  The  well-disciplined and learned character is a huge advantage on the road; I  got in the habit or regularly using ""Concentration,""  ""Meditation,"" ""Orientation,"" ""Prayer,"" and  ""Lycanthropy"" in-play, which was a huge boon to my combat skills,  as well as using others such as ""Repair"" and  ""Recharging"" to increase the value of surplus equipment I'd find  before pawning off.  There is also a feature to allow you to automatically  backtrack previously visited areas, allowing the computer to take care of a  lot of needless traveling to and fro in dungeons and on the surface world.  There are a couple of irksome contributions unique in Darkstone's  re-treading of old ground, however.  One is the inclusion of hunger and  aging of your characters, giving the game a condensed timeframe feel to it,  but to what end?  A tad of grounding realism to your careers as  evil-smiting heroes?  Luckily, there is usually enough food and anti-aging  potions down the road.  Two, prices tend to be extraordinarily inflated  compared to Diablo, at rates 200-400% of what you'd expect.  10,000 gold  just ain't what it used to be, pardner.  And naturally, Darkstone's engine,  bestiary, quests, and dungeon-design have been re-modeled and expanded from  Diablo's, with 32 dungeons to Diablo's 16, and a plethora of randomized  quests to go with them, even if they mainly fall in the banality of  retrieving the <art/craft> of <person/place/virtue> or killing  the <evil foozle> of ages.
I enjoyed digging up the nostalgia of  Diablo's glory days in Darkstone, and played it nightly with a friend of  mine for about a month before the novelty wore off. However, that's still  only a third of the time I devoted to Diablo.  Simply put, Diablo was a  little more fun that Darkstone.  Diablo had the feel of a melancholy  AD&D Ravenloft adventure, Darkstone was more along the line of a  clichd D&D dungeon-crawl.  Diablo's Trinsic was a morose and haunted  country village bathed in crepuscular dusk, Darkstone's garden-variety  ""Town"" is a fort enclosing a pen of adventurer shops in bright  daylight.  Diablo had a thematically consistent ensemble of demons and  undead, Darkstone has a goofy collage of goblinoids, anti-heroes, and  creepy-crawlies---you thought Monty Python's killer rabbit was a joke?  Meet its rodent cousin.  Even Darkstone's musical score sounds like a banal  remake of Diablo's.  Drak even makes a bona fide Evil Speech (tm) at the  end of the last level before commencing battle.
Darkstone is a very  serviceable modern upgrade to Diablo, with some welcome additions to the  award-winning formula.  It's worth looking into if you're a starved  Action/RPG fan or if you want to relive some of that late-night  hack-and-slashing with some friends.  Just entertain no illusions about  what it is, and what it isn't.",3.0
"Sonic Adventure is a pretty good game.  I came into this one expecting a game like the old Sonic games.  It is nothing like that.  It really is a full-blown adventure!  Personally, I was looking forward to more side scrolling action.  Navigating the 3-D can get a bit tedious at times.  If you have no problems with that, then this game is for you!",3.0
"This is a really good game. Great graphics, good game play, and chalnging levels all are some of D3's major features. However, the graphics are so good that you need more then 64mg ram to play. my 333mg, 160 ram can run slow, and im not even on the higher graphics setting. Also the levels are way to hard. It sounds pathetic, but im stuck on level 2. Dont buy this game unless you are a interplay fantic.",3.0
"This is the one game that, by now, every Dreamcast owner already has. And deservedly so; it's easy to pick up and it's blindingly fast. Problem is, it's so fast, you'll blow right through it in a few hours. It's too bad Sega felt the need to tack on the other characters. All the non-Sonic levels are boring (especially the big cat levels where you fish). Then there's the terrible music. I recommend muting your TV and playing your own music on a CD player because the in-game music just doesn't work at all. Or you could listen to it for a good laugh.",3.0
"My fave parts of this game are the graphics, levels, (speed highway my favorite) voices, (except Big's) and characters. My fave characters are Sonic and Super sonic. It has some small glitches and camera problems. And it kinda goes stale after the 30th time. I have played it probably 85 + times. (over 200 probably with all the characters) It's the game that you can't help but love. Not the best launch game of the sega, but it's good. Let's see Sa2 and sonic shuffle please!

"Birth of the Federation seemed like a reasonable purchase at the time -- but it's long since migrated off of my hard drive. Microprose has a solid history with Masters of Orion behind it, but they just didn't do justice to  that game and Star Trek at the same time.
The game continues along a  similar vein to MOO2 complete with a pretty reasonable combat environment.  Like MOO2, though, it becomes a lot of micromanagement for not a whole lot  of return and the computer just doesn't seem up to the task of truly  defeating you.
If you're a Star Trek fanatic, you likely ""have""  to own this game and will enjoy it simply because of the universe (be  warned though: it's all Next Generation due to licensing).  If you're a  turn-based strategy fanatic my suggestion is to stick with MOO2 or look  elsewhere.
If you do purchase the game -- make sure to download the  update from Microprose.",3.0
"A Master of Orion type game set in the Star Trek Universe!  When I first heard this game would be coming I was thrilled and impatiently waited for the day it would be released.  Unfortunately waiting for the game was the  most exciting thing about it.
Now don't get me wrong it is a  ""good"" game but it is not great or fantastic in any sense of the  word.  If it had been released a few years ago it probably would have been  received better but the truth is that this game is simply Master of Orion  with Star Trek names and graphics.  There was no real improvement or  innovation in this game.  Star Trek's rich background and history are given  short thrift.  The Diplomatic system is shallow and uninspired.  The combat  system held the most hope but it simply becomes a battle of the strongest  fleet wins, with little chance for tactics or strategy.  One of the worst  features is trying to navigate around the map.  You can't simply scroll  with the mouse pointer like in MOO but have to zoom and unzoom between  different map settings.
In the end if you really love Star Trek and  simply can't get enough this game will probably interest you.  But if you  are a serious gamer looking for new challenges, wait for this game to hit  the clearance rack.",3.0
"I waited over ten years to play this game!  I bought it over ten years ago, around 2000.  Even by that point it was in the ""bargain bin"" shelf of jewel cases.  Unfortunately, I was too busy in my life to play it and waited nearly a decade before I had enough free time.  Getting it running on Vista definitely took some moxie:  I would have saved hours if I had simply played through it ten years ago.

I had heard how original and fun the game was, but frankly it was a lot better before I actually sat down to play it, if you know what I mean.  Once you learn how to play, the campaign stages get quite repetitive and the game's ""sense of humor"" gets trying.  Additionally, I feel the gamemaker's attempt to shoehorn 3D into this game didn't add much and could have been completely dispensed with:  at least it should have been optional.  Finally, it ultimately gets to be unsatisfying to make your dungeons since the ""fog of war"" prevents you from planning intelligently, and the space you are given to dig in seems inadequate, even in the later campaign missions.

Anyhow, here are two big issues:

1.  The thing is full of bugs, and the company that made it is now defunct, so there won't be any more patches issued.  The latest official patch was 1.7.

2.  This was meant to run on ""Windows 95 / 98 / Me,"" according to the packaging.  I've also never had a problem running it on XP.  It is possible to get it fully running on Vista or 7 and I am here to tell you it can be done.  Try some combination of these, starting with f, then d.

a.  Right click and run program as administrator.
b.  On the compatibility tab, set it to run in Windows 2000; disable visual themes, disable desktop composition, and
 disable display scaling on high DPI settings.
c.  Although DKII puts a shortcut on your desktop, I found have it not to work with Vista or 7:  you must go into the original Bullfrog folder and launch the game directly from the executable, keeping in mind a and b above.
d.  Right click on your desktop.  Under display settings, disable hardware acceleration.  If you can't do this sweepingly (e.g., because you have an NVIDIA, go to the NVIDIA control panel for DKII and disable virtually everything, especially texture filtering.
e.  Bear in mind that DKII not only runs its own executable, but it runs another program simultaneously which is actually the game engine.  The process shows as ip.exe.  So anything you do to the DKII.exe should also be done to that.
f.  Run DKII.  Go into the graphics options, uncheck all those boxes:  visual translucency, environment mapping, and especially the last:  hardware acceleration. Set shadow detail to 0.  What you do with gamma is irrelevant.
g.  You can get quite discouraged if you're going through all this and you keep getting those black squares on the menu screens.  But if you go into the graphics options and keep finding that, upon being restarted, the game has rechecked ""hardware acceleration"" without your permission, do not be angry.  Simply accept.  Go back into the main menu and load an actual pet dungeon or a campaign dungeon.  When DKII reloads one of those, that check should go away and stay away even after you close the game.  In other words, when you uncheck ""hardware acceleration,"" the game must actually load a dungeon for this to take effect.  If you simply uncheck it and exit the game, it won't take.
In addition, I have posted a link to a Youtube video in the comments that I found helpful in this struggle.
h.  It is not my experience that setting graphics options to low or running the game in 640x480 is going to help you at all when trying to get it to run under Windows Vista and Windows 7.
i.  It shouldn't matter whether you applied the patch or not:  I have gotten it to run both ways on Windows Vista and Windows 7, although only with the final 1.7 patch:  I don't know about the three or four patches that came before that, all of which are still available on the internet as of this writing.
j.  If all else fails, be aware that it might be your sound card that's causing a problem, not your video card.  This game seems to like simple sound cards and has a reputation for not working on account of the newer, snazzier ones.  If all else fails, try disabling your spiffy sound card in the Device Manager to see if the onboard sound on your mother board will give this a pass.

By the way, I want the world to know that it took me longer to figure out how to play this under Windows Vista and Windows 7 than I actually spent playing the game!

Hope this helps someone.",3.0
"Yes, the game is fun if you like TNG. But, what many people are not saying, the game has a few bugs in it. One of the bigger ones is a ""memory leak"" which makes the game run extremely slow and sometimes crash after you get to the later turns in the game.

Combat is very uncreative, and could use a little better sequences.

The only way to win diplomatically is to pay races in credits, which by the TNG Era money was not necessary to Earth or the federation, so the credits are not something that should be in the game.",3.0

Star Trek: Birth of the Federation is a good game but has a slow game play that can get boring. The good part about it is a pretty good game and it has some good combat in it.

"Being from the Master of Orion camp, and having not enjoyed MOOII very much, I was expecting great things from this game. It is a good game--better than MOOII.
However, the game has some faults. For the ST  fan, there are some problems with the races (the Federation is fairly  aggressive when playing as another race, for instance), the play is  SLOOOOOW (on a 450 PII, 96MB RAM), and the micromanagement of systems takes  a long time to get the hang of (but not nearly as bad as Star Wars:  Rebellion).
All in all, a good addition to the strategy minded--campaigns  can last for days. However, there's still no beating MOO as the best space  stategy game.",3.0

"Ages in the making and a bit of a disappointment, 'Mechwarrior 3' isn't sufficiently different to the ancient, venerable 'Mechwarrior 2', and suffers from the lumbering nature of mech-to-mech combat - even the best simulation of big, slow robots fighting each other boils down to a series of largely static duels. It's not complex enough for there to be a strategy hook, and not cartoony enough to be fun on a visceral level. Fittingly for a sequel to one of the nicest-looking games of 1994, the presentation is excellent, although the fantastic music from the original game has been ditched in favour of some anonymous, inferior imitations. As before, the weapons you have are an odd bunch - although you can kit your mech out with a variety of equipment, you eventually realise that only heavy lasers and heat sinks are any use. Machine-guns and missiles are strangely ineffective, and it seems unsatisfying to spend the entire game 'painting' the legs of enemy mechs with weedy lasers. Despite a four-year wait, the game seems... underwhelming. Not bad as such, just very forgettable. There aren't many missions, and only one of them (in which you have to intercept a train) presents a major challenge, and when its over it just seems to fade from the mind. Except for the voice acting, which is fine, but having them say 'aff!' as a salutation, whilst true to the Battletech universe, sounds extremely camp. The intro movie is fantastic, by the way.",3.0
"After playing the demo for `Mechwarrior 3' I was less than inspired, and unlike the venerable `Mechwarrior 2', saw no reason to buying it. Well,  boredom and impulsiveness lured me into finally purchasing the game, mainly  because it was on special. Considering there is four years of development  and technology in `Mechwarrior 3' over Activision's older title,  `Mechwarrior 2' is the better. Sure the graphics are inferior and there are  play touches evident in the newer game, but there is a much grander feel to  wherein you have to combat Jade Falcon Clan across several worlds, whereas  in MW3 you take the role as a mechwarrior with Eridani Light Horse tackling  Clan Smoke Jaguar on only one world. This lack of scope hampers the game  tremendously, plus the game also lacks the connectivity that MW2 had to the  entire Battletech universe.
 Game setup is simple and once installed  the user is treated a rather nice opening segue of Light Horse forces  fighting a desperate battle against superior Clan forces and eventually  luring them into a trap. From there the player is given the option of  Campaign, Training, Instant Action, Multiplayer, Options & Credits from  the main screen. Training is tedious and drawn out, so I suggest using the  Instant Action option and scaling battles up as you become more and more  familiar with mech controls and systems. I haven't tried multi-player yet  simply because I know there are going to be way too many cowards cheating  for me to enjoy battling against other players. Campaign Mode deals with an  invasion of the Smoke Jaguar home world and using it as a stepping stone to  Strana Mechty in 3058. Yawn.
 Not much of a story here, I'm afraid,  and that's only half of the troubles for this game. It's buggy! While my  system exceeds system requirements by light years, the game routinely dumps  me back out to my Windows desktop, once after my `mech overheated and shut  down. Worse, the game's sound effects get so messed up that pressing an on  screen selector to move LRM-5's to your mech results in a burst of  auto-cannon fire issuing from your speakers instead of a beep! This happens  mainly in the arming & load out menus with sound effects overriding  what was originally there. It also happens in-game when your MFB's encircle  your mech unit to repair it, repair sounds are replaced by explosions,  weapons fire, `Mission Successful', `Mech power-up detected', etc. It gets  annoying fast. My jump jets on mech units have never once worked  properly.
 The graphics are a mixed bag of some very nice designs in  buildings and other structures that give a nice sense of scale while in  your mech. Terrain is quite good, but very limited in variety. The  battlemech's themselves are well designed, by surface bitmaps are very  busy, giving the mechs an extremely cluttered look. Mech animations have a  very nice look to them, conveying a sense of weight in motion. Microprose,  for some reason, changed the damage model, and suddenly `time on target'  becomes a necessity in order to deliver any appreciable damage you your  target. If your Med Pulse Laser does 5 points of damage and you do not  concentrate it on a single location, such as a limb, it gets spread around  to the rest of the mech. Very quickly does the player learn the value of  twin UB-AC 10's! Or, god help you, twin Gauss Cannons! Whoohoo! I actually  made a Daishi in the Instant Action section that mounted 4 Gauss, it had  limited ammo, but anything I shot stopped shooting back.
 Microsoft  will be doing Mechwarrior 4, and given they are also making the X-Box,  (sounds like something Charles Xavier might make to battle Magneto or  something), I am not sure if PC gamers will see it. However, it is also  looking that the X-Box will be based on PC architecture which means the  games might be cross compatible. For now, however, `Mechwarrior 3' is a  mixed bag of some very good things, but perhaps, at least in my case, too  many bad things to make it very much fun. Maybe I'll try the Multiplayer  option and see if it gets any better. Until then I still have my old copy  of Mechwarrior 2 kicking around, and there's a 3Dfx version of Mercenaries  available as well. This game could have been so much better, but too many  problems drag it back into the realm of mediocrity.",3.0

This game has no type of running game because it is too slow and the linemen don't block  good and if a defender tackles you 30% of the time you will break it. The passing game is too dangerous.

"First off, why do top designers make mistakes like  building a game that's so dark I can't see the gamma controls in options? Believe it or not, they used a dark blue control for the gamma and the page is black. The other  controls on the page are light green. This little artistic flourish sent me  on a three day journey of frustration to play the game and get the  brightness up. Navy on black is idiotic. Too many designers use tiny  letters and obscure illegible fonts for games. We don't all have 21 inch  monitors you know. Please keep an eye on the fools you hire to deal with  the simple things like choosing fonts and background colors. Now on to  other issues.
The story is intriguing. The opening music was great and  got me interested inspite of the rather choppy and low quality cut scenes.  What happens to that great opening music later? It turns into action,  disco, buttkickin game music that I hate.
Training could be more  involved. I needed to play over and over to get to any proficiency with the  many controls and seemingly endless information kiosks. I don't really play  games because I want to read so why not just give all the information on  the mfd or pfd device in voice format instead of having us read all this  drivel? Better yet, build a training  mission with us actually having a  stress free environment to really work on skills and become familiar with  controls. Hey! Here's an idea. You know those training missions I fly off  on, but I really don't go I just watch the movie? (I wonder if my ugly  woman is still waiting for me?) Why not really send me on that mission to  learn? WHAT A THOUGHT!
Why can't I choose a weapon or get some health  when I'm in user mode? The action doesn't pause and the monsters just keep  pounding away and sneaking up which I just find stressful. I know you're  trying to put me in the situation, but I like to pause and think. You can  forget that in this game.
Here's another annoyance. You go to this  vending machine to buy bullets and health and soda or whatever and first  you have to select what you want on this complicated interface after you  figure out what it costs from the tiny numbers buried off on the side.  That's already annoying, but then you have to pick the items up  individually and then you have to go to user mode and ""USE"" them.  Just forget it if you're bein attacked and most likely you will be. A  possible reason for all this difficulty is that you should learn to turn  off the security before trying to purchase anything. Once again, this is  annoying to me.
Is this a new genre? Action, adventure, role playing?  Sort of. I think of it as an action adventure with a tedious learning curve  and a lot of dull reading. It's a boring second year college course. The  psionics have me interested, the inability to use guns is frustrating at  first and there's too many monsters to deal with wrench style.
The  ghosts are great. I didn't have any kind of religious moment or anything  like I've read some people describe, but then I knew the ghosts were there  because I'd read the review beforehand and now, so have you. The monsters  or ex crew or whatever they are, are scary, but they are also blurry and  unlike some people, this game didn't really scare me to death and make me  wary when I'm alone or anything like that.
There are a lot of good games  out right now and I'm having a hard time devoting much time to this time  demanding game. I do appreciate the innovation involved in this game, but I  also loathe the geeky qualites of unnecessary complication. Then again,  without all the skills, this would be just like half life or doom or  whatever. Doom with ghosts.",3.0
"SS2 is a good quality game. Like others, I find the atmosphere creepy and the elements of gameplay innovative, but the same elements of gameplay are just too difficult to adjust to. I made the first mistake of assuming that if I brought up the items screen, the game would pause (thanks to conditioning from Deus Ex and Morrowind). It didn't, and I got the snot slapped out of me by a hybrid. Lesson learned: I made damn sure to clear an area out first before I did anything with inventory. That quip aside, this is a fairly decent game. The only other problem is that as you progress, the ability to travel between areas perviously explored becomes less and less, and you have less freedom to explore whole areas since many places are closed off (it feels like being herded down a ramp to the ending, like when on the Rickenbauker). As a note, I borrowed this game from a friend, since I refuse to purchase a game that is older than Deus Ex, but cost more than Deus Ex. If the graphics were stellar and on par with Half-Life, I could understand. But seriously, charging 30 plus dollars for an older game such as this, when I got the GOTY edition of Deus Ex for 9.99 just sort of kills the initiative to buy it; not to mention it is a gross rip-off of customers. I would consider purchasing it if the price went down to say...8.99 at the least, 12 flat at the most.

"Should I start with the good or the bad news...
The bad news: For anyone who has played the board game, saying that the software has artificial intelligence is a compliment. Ok that's harsh, but my 9 year old son has no  difficulty beating the computer. And I have not sweated once even when my  allies are at the weakest setting and my opponents at the highest. Also,  the code is bug ridden. The user interface is good but could use some  polishing. I have not yet tried to play over the net, but I have found  intimidating instructions on how to get around the various difficulties one  may encounter in doing so.
The good news: My 6 and 9 year old kids  absolutely love it. They learned the rules of the game very fast. To teach  kids with the board game requires a lot of time and patience, something  that my computer has in larger quantities than myself. Using the game, my  kids learn geography without effort and I pitch in some history by  answering their hundreds of questions.
I also like the new scenarios in  the Iron Blitz edition. The various options allow one to fine tune the  rules to one's taste, like getting rid of the technologies.

"the games story line is great...exciting and full of action but the game has its pros and cons...first off the graphics pretty much suck...for the time it was made the graphics were awesome but now they are funny...second off the force powers get stupid sometimes...the AI sucks and its too easy to fool them by just using mind trick, its easier just to use mind trick over and over again to finish the levels. But like i said for the time it was made in...its a good game and fun to play but once again...the graphics...SUCK",3.0

No scratches or damage, shipped in an envelope so I was scared of damage, but it's all good. Thank you.",3.0

"You know, its really a shame, this game could have been so much more.
First of all, let's give credit where credit is due. Kudos to  Microprose for even including the years 1940, to 1942 in this game. It was  refreshing to get something other than the typical egocentric American view  on the air war over Europe during WW2.
I loved the graphics, the  interface with the mouse for external views is genius, and you can spend  hours admiring yourself from near or far.
Sadly, if you are an aspiring  ""mud mover"" for the Luftwaffe in the years 1940, through 1942,  you are going to be a frustrated pilot, the promised targets never do  appear. There isn't a moving ground target in all of merry old England.  Those trucks must have stealth technology or something!
On a final note,  don't even attempt to play this game until you have downloaded version 1.2  from Microprose's webpage, out of the box, the so called ""AI"" in  this game is non-existant. Nothing like flying on an intercept for 2 hours  in realtime, and finally sight the enemy, only to have your flight leader  declare, without attacking,""nice job everyone, let's go home"",  without firing a shot! Whoo Whoo..really get's the adreline  flowing.
After downloading the ""version 1.2"" patch, this seems  to have been fixed, but where are those elusive Brit lorrys?",3.0
"I've probably seen all of them from the WWII era, from the old 1942 Pacific air war to IL-2 Sturmovik.  This is one of the most entertaining.  It flies pretty well and the graphics are almost as good as some of the later ones.  It has given me a lot of pleasure.

I rank the best ones as follows: IL-2 (Sturmovik); Janes WWII Fighters; Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator 2 (Pacific Theater); Microsoft's Flight Simulator (WWII Europe Series); and finally this one:  European Air War,by Microprose.

My ranking is based on quality of graphics, smoothness of manuever with a good computer (mine is a 1.8 Ghz Gateway Pentium 4 with a half-gig of RAM and ATI) and the flight modelingof the aircraft (how close to the real aircraft they are in their performance).  My judgment on the latter is based on the fact that I have flown a variety of real prop driven aircraft since I soloed in 1946, as well as many radio-controlled models.

"I bought this game, and I expected it to be awesome. I was kind of disappointed. Well, 1st of all, the gameplay was ok. The stability was not so incredibly good. Sometimes the game will shut down after a mission( the missions are ok, but it takes a long time for each 1). It was easy to learn. Multiplayer on the web isn't that great, because NO BODY plays on the internet with this game. Its just too old, which also is the reason for my 3-star rating. The graphics aren't as good as the cover looks, believe me. The smoke from planes is a greenish color. Sounds weird, huh? Well thats the way it is on my computer. I guess I should have considered that this game was made in 1998. Well, I guess this game was good a few years ago, but its just too outdated.

"A game that could of been one of the best games in the world for me. I love Star Wars, from movies to games. And Stratagy, sci-fi, battle games are my favorite (usually) out of all electronic games(N64, PC, Playstation, etc.). But this was a dissapointment. For one thing, the battle graphics are horrendous!! On the battle screen, one starfighter=a squadron of 12 (unless they are weakened), and shoot one laser to symbolize them battleing. And they fly around like they were on strings!! Now how cheesy is that? The Capital ships in the battle screen are low in detail and have the symbolizing lasers. Also, it is a pain to get the ships to do what you want them to do. All in all, the battle scenes are one of the worst I've ever seen. But I can sat It could be worse.  Now in normal game play it is a little better. The main Galactic display is fairly easy to use an descent graphics. Also the sound and music in this area are OK, too. Though it is more of a pain than a good time to start a new game. It takes several hours just to get of the ground. Few planets have shipyards and construction bases, and the ones who do have them are slow and transporting buildings all over the galaxy can take forever.  One good thing about this game is it has a breif encylopedia of some of the things in the Star Wars Universe  I think Force commander was another attempt of this game on the ground instead of in space, and it was much better but still hard to use. I think the next Star Wars Rebellion type game should be more like a Star Wars version of Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain.  Final Verdict: 2.5/5",3.0
"While I cannot give the review that our esteemed gamer from MIT did, I also cannot give this a horrible review.
I've owned this game for over a year, and still do not feel like I understand everything about it (the  manual is poorly organized and not very helpful). There are some things  that do not seem to work (force training, espionage). The interface is  horrendous, and the fleet battles are insanely complicated (I just let the  battle play out). Add in that there are only two options for sides (Rebel  and Empire), which makes repeat play a little dry. I will agree that the  helpers (C-3PO and some Imperial droid) are more than a little  condescending.
However, the underlying strategy engine seems sound. I  jumped in without reading the manual, and got to where I thought I'd  figured it out in a few days. The nice thing about this game v. other  strategy games is that you cannot overpower your opponent very easily (a  downfall of MOO). Once you figure out resources, the economics make the  play very compelling.
If the interface was improved, and the space and  ground battles strategically enhanced, then LucasArts would have a great  game.
I have not played this multi-player, so I cannot comment on that  aspect.
In the final analysis, this game was rushed. LucasArts should  stick to space flight games like Tie Fighter and X-Wing or First Person  like DFII until they figure the interface out. Don't rush these games in  production!",3.0

"The fact that this controller is cheap, USB Plug and Play ready, and so similar to the playstation controller is the reason it's a solid bet.

However here are the problems:

1. The directional pad is innacurate on precision. If you just need to walk around in a game its great, but if you need to hit a specific direction, it will come off usually as a diagonal.

2. The buttons are very loud and get stuck. The Green button doesn't pop out most of the time anymore. It seems like a small problem, but it can get very frustrating.

"This is an inexpensive, lightweight PS2-style programmable gamepad that would otherwise be a great value were it not for the extremely shoddy directional pad.
I own two of these gamepads for about 3 years (which shows its durable) and they have fared well for emulator games and games such as Madden and High Heat Baseball where precise directional control is not crucial. But the d-pad makes this almost unusable for 3D and racing games.
The d-pad is slotted to the diagonals which tends to push you diagonally when you want to go up, down, left, or right. This makes it difficult to go in a straight line which can kill you in certain games where accuracy and speed are important. Using the mini-joystick can help control a little better. The controller is kinda small so it may not fit well in big hands. Its instant and easy setup without any software makes it a true plug-n-play device.
For the $10-$15 price range you can't beat this, but do yourself a favor and spend another $5 to $10 more if you can for a better quality gamepad with ergonomic controls, trigger buttons, and force feedback.",3.0

"(This review applies to the Macintosh version of Star Wars Racer). A fun, exceptionally fast-paced game that brings racing to the Star Wars video game universe (and more multimillions to George Lucas's coffers). But  before you buy, check the system requirements carefully: while this runs  fine on my brand-new iMac, I'm hearing that many older Macs aren't  supported for this fast-running program.  The key to watch out for in the  system requirements seems to be ""3-D hardware support (OpenGL  compatible); iMac and newer machines require no extra hardware""  (according to the system requirements on Amazon's page). That's why I give  it 3 stars...the game itself would be worth five stars but it loses a  couple for being persnickity and only running on Macs that were seemingly  introduced last week. While I applaud LucasArts for pushing the envelope in  creating the game, owners of older hardware should have a chance to run it  too, and not at speeds of Jabba the Hutt.",3.0

"Well, this is a bit tricky. Ya see, as far as light gun shooters go this is by far the best I've ever seen on any system, at any time. On the other hand, some things are just plain awful. Well, lets start with the good.
The graphics are just plain jaw dropping. The backgrounds and environments are a little simple, but the zombies and the way they react to being shot is insane. The first time I saw this game I couldn't believe me eyes. The sheer amount of enemies, the fast pace, the gruesome look. You won't really notice the bad when you're looking through the sight of a gun blasting down anything that moves trying to stay alive.
The way zombies react to being shot is amazing. You'll have to pump several rounds into the body to kill one, usually blasting a hole clean through them. Even a well placed headshot may not do the trick though, as some zombies will keep coming at you even with half their face blown clean off. Others are armored and armed to the teeth and know how to use tools for protection. It makes it quite interesting.
So far as zombie graphics and good shooting fun go, this game is simply unmatched. Story wise however, it fails so hard it hurts. The script and voice acting is just atrocious. One of the worse in video game history. I don't know if it's meant to be some kinda B movie joke, but it's not funny. It's just, plain, awful. Thankfully you can skip it all and save yourself the headache.
Sadly you can beat it in a single 30 minute sitting or so, but these games are never really all that long. A training mode adds some length, but that doesn't last long before it just gets dull. This isn't a deep game, this isn't genre busting... it's just a good and fun ol' fashion shoot em up with some gruesomely cool gore. I still play it whenever I'm in the mood for something different, and for the most part it's still a lot of fun. That's a lot of replay value. If you can still find it, it's real cheap these days. Great game to play with friends and after Trigun marathons. Well worth the sub $$$ range.

"Roller coaster tycoon never came out for mac, so that's why I ended up buying Sim Theme Park.  It was different than Roller Coaster tycoon in some good and bad ways, so I'll tell you them and you could decide if you want this.
Pros:
You can click on the ride button and ride any of the rides.  Even the custom made ones like roller coasters.
You can walk around the park just like you would at a real theme park.
Cons:
Not enough freedom.  Once you build all of the rides, in all four parks, that's it.
Everything would disappear when I won a key to open up a 4th park and I would need to reinstall the software.  A major con.  I never opened up in Space land.

"I am yet to find an Electronic Arts game that does not provide me with hours of entertainment. However, with all the ""Theme Park"" simulation games on the web, I advise you to chose the Roller Coaster Tycoon Games.
Why do I advise you to chose the Tycoon games?
*The Roller Coaster Tycoon has better, more realistic, and more playable graphics. Of course if you are one who enjoys the cartoonist preception of the characters, this will be an okay feature. However, I recommend looking for screenshots of this game to see if you like the graphics.
*Sim Theme Park clogs up your computer system much worse than Roller Coaster Tycoon, so unless you have a pretty fast system, be prepared for some freezing, where with Roller Coaster Tycoon you can pretty much play with out annoying slowness.
*Sim Theme Park gets boring fast with its last of great rides, themes.
Don't get me wrong I love simulation games. (They are my ultimate favorite) But I sincerely recommend the Roller Coaster Tyoon Games. They cost less, have better reviews, better graphics (in my opinion) and more rides and themes, and in addition, they don't freeze up your older computer as much as Sim Theme Park.
As with most people reviewing this game, check out the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, I guarentee you cannot be disappoint with them.",3.0
"When I first got this game, it was plain confusing. I had to skim through the 80 some page manual before finnaly getting it.
The object of the game is to get as many people as you can into your park. If you get a lot of people or money, you win golden tickets and, after 4 golden tickets, a golden key. You need keys to enter the different theme parks. You can biuld a variety of rides, (which need to be researched by reserchers) shops, and side shows. You can hire a variety of staff too.
Park Management is tuff, at first. I struggled for money. Also, the park was a pain to keep clean. I needed tons of janitors patrolling all areas of the park.
But, after I got over the first ""obstacle"" it was all flat from there. I biult many rides and entertainment (though my park was still a bit dirty) and reached ... It is fun for those who get it and confusing for those who don't. It is a fun game and worth the money (well i thought so). It is good for people who like a challenge, and don't mind reading and understanding the manual. For those who don't have the time to flip through a manual; don't get it.

He'll say your janitors' patrol areas aren't just perfect, or one person just littered! Big deal! Again, unlike RCT, it has only four themes; one per park. I also don't like the idea of Golden Tickets and Golden Keys, which you need to access other parks. It's really hard to get things just perfect, and since everything is expensive and you can't charge for rides, your cash balance is low all of the time until five years later (in game time). You don't have a very large selection of rides, especially at the start. Overall, this game really bites the dust, and if you don't have Roller Coaster Tycoon yet, get that instead.",3.0
"SIM THEME PARK is both complex and simple at once, which can get confusing.  It seems to be aimed at the grade school set, yet includes controls which end up being complex.  The 3D graphics are eye-poppingly fancy, and the rides and attractions are clever, but the theme parks don't seem real like they do in Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Nevertheless, this game is a fun addition to your sim library.
This game is equipped with a tutorial mode, which introduces us to an annoying little character who talks all the time, attempting to explain how each control works.  After I turned the tutorial-guy off, I found it much more pleasant to play this game in which you design a theme park complete with rides, sideshows, restaurants, a staff, and other attractions.
This game features parks with Disneyland-worthy themes such as Halloween (coffin restrooms!) and Prehistory (think a kinder, gentler Jurassic Park), which have clever rides and attractions.
One really cool feature is the ""ride it"" option which allows you to see your ride from the perspective of someone who is on the ride.  You can also see things from the perspective of security cameras.  This is fun, but the novelty wears off.
I enjoyed checking out the various types of theme parks in this game, which you get to play by earning golden keys (for reaching certain goals) but I ended up going back to Roller Coaster Tycoon, which I think is a superior game.  I give this game 3 stars for anyone over 12, but possibly more stars for anyone younger.",3.0
"Sim Theme Park/Theme Park World are part of what I like to think of as ""the Bullfrog trilogy"". These three games (this one, ""Populous: The Beginning"" and ""Dungeon Keeper 2"", all from British company Bullfrog) all use a similar (spectacular) graphics engine and all fall roughly into the ""real-time strategy"" category. There is a marvellous aesthetic sense which pervades each of them.

In STP/TPW, a sequel to 1994's ""Theme Park"", you lay down paths and theme park attractions, then open your gates to an ever-growing throng of youngsters eager to buy your burgers and fries right before going on a loop-the-loop 100mph roller coaster. (Vomit figures heavily into your equations.)

Rather oddly for a theme park sim (though absolutely typical for RTS) you hire researchers who research advanced rides for you--not to mention advanced concepts like ""the gift shop"" or ""the restaurant"". With the right balance of attractions and staff and financial savvy you can change your! park from a travelling-carny level experience to a nigh-DisneyWorld extravagazna.

Well, sort of. Each of the four parks has a specific theme and must stay within that theme. No Disneyland style division (Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, etc.) in a single park. Understandable given the strain that would put on the hardware--but unfortunate.

Like the other games in the Bullfrog trilogy, there is considerable ""well, that's cool"" factor. And Bullfrog created a ""downloadable ride"" patch which theoretically could give the product some real legs.

But there is even less actual =game= here than in the other two. And after you finish your first park, you'll find that you're playing the exact same game on your second park. And third. Every park has the same number and type of rides, sideshows, refreshment stands and miscellaneous objects.

Playing is not unlike eating a huge cone of cotton candy: Sweet, but not particularly satisfying.

It's also a good exa! mple of a product at cross-purposes with itself. There's considerable ""toy"" value in the game: It's a pleasure to build your park. Typical of Bullfrog games, the interface is clean, simple and rewarding. Experiencing the game from the first person is a real treat. But.

Every moment you take to smell the 50-ft. high artificial roses (Wonderland park) is a moment where something is going wrong in your park. This is where the ""gameplay"" comes in, unfortunately.

When you have grown your park to a good size, you'll be stopping whatever you're doing every minute or so to schedule repairs. Now, there's a simple rule: You don't run rides in the red, so you check your maintenance report and shut-down any rides that are going from yellow to red.

Thing is, it's so mechanical, it would've been easier to just set a bar for the point at which the mechanics would go repair things. They could shut the rides down when they got there. (The way it works now is you have to s! hut the ride down and wait for a mechanic to show up, or drop one there.)

This is true of the rest of the staff, too. They wander around their patrol areas, one presumes, because they don't have access to your big park map showing all the problem spots. And you can't stagger their break/work times, so they can all be waiting for an opening in the staff break-room while your park goes to heck.

If Bullfrog had taken that out, though, there wouldn't have been much left to do except adjust the amount of fries on the salt. And, typical of the implementation of ""business simulation"", you have to adjust each stand individually as you build it (or flip back to a stand that has the settings you want and click the global setting button).

There's the cross-purpose: Trying to make a business simulation out of it. Building a park at the micro-level is fun--managing it at that level is a chore.

If they had gone the other way with the business simulation and allo! wed you to handle things like promotions, suppliers, unions, and lawyers, one of your pleasures could have been taking a break from it all to go to the park. (But that wouldn't really fit neatly into the categories that all games Must Now Belong.)

Anyway, it's hard to actually dislike such a good-natured, easy-to-play game and there's a lot of fun here despite the flaws. Hence, three stars.",3.0
"I was very disappointed after flying it. I was excited about all the different aircraft I could fly, but I've been spoiled by Falcon4, the king of flight sims. The first problem is the constant bobbing up and down of the planes' noses after take-off and while landing. The biggest problem, IMHO, is the fact that the flight models are BAD. All the planes fly exactly alike. The A-10 is just as fast and as maneuverable as the F-15. That is not accurate. If you like accurate flight models then run, don't walk, away from USAF! The cockpits are fuzzy and the switches don't work, like they do in F4. The scenery is nice, it runs smoothly, and has never crashed on me. The missions are fair, but it doesn't have a dynamic campaign. It's heavy on eye candy, but light on flight modeling. If you just want to fly different cockpits and watch the scenery, then by all means get it. If you want accurate flight models for each plane and a dynamic campaign, then get Falcon4.",3.0

"Let me start off by saying that no game show computer game can be spectacular or addictive.  It just can't be realistic enough.
But Jeopardy is about as good as a game show computer game can get.  The questions are realistic (I think that they are actual show questions) and the opponents are tough enought to beat you more than half the time, if you want to set the difficulty high enough.  That is my favorite feature of the game -- it is not too easy to win every time.
Another feature that I like is that you can set the spelling strictness to the level that you like.  It is rare that you get a question wrong because you misspelled the word.  That is a nice feature.
I haven't played the game enough to see the categories repeat themselves.  That is a problem with every computer game of this type, and there is basically no way around that.

Then we have contests as to length of the coaster, the size of the theme park, and the one with the fastest speed but a coaster that lasts the longest.  Thanks.

"Most critics insist that Half-Life is the best game ever, but I must disagree.  I will say that it has perhaps the best gameplay of any shooter, but it does have its drawbacks.
One of the best traits of half-life is that although it has much the same gameplay as any other shooter, it  seems to have done it exceptionally well.  Like most shooters you walk, run, climb, jump, crawl, and shoot, of course, but in Half-life it's so utterly engaging.  I'm not sure why, but I believe the great gameplay is a result of the intuitive nature of the puzzles and combat.  You can look around and say: ""Ah ha!  That's the way.""  And in most cases you are right giving you a satisfying feeling of knowing that you used your brain well.  However, as another reviewer noted, in some cases you get nailed with a ""gotcha,"" you die, and it's time to gawk at the ol' loading screen.  Nevertheless, it's not that hard after you play the game for a while, and who doesn't want a challenge?
The weapons are average and include the standard machine gun, shotgun, and pistols along with grenades and other weapons you pick up along the way.  You can also use guns set on turrets.  All your weapons pack a punch, and you shouldn't be dissatisfied with any of them.
Enemies include monsters and ""grunts.""  They're decent looking, and the grunts have good AI.  Some of the ""boss"" monsters need to be killed with special weapons that you fire from pressing a button on a wall.  It's very satisfying to see one of the big monsters finally go down.
The sound is exceptional except for the voices of the NPCs.  I'm not sure why their voices are distorted.  It might be a bug.
Speaking of bugs, this edition of Half-life has a bug that causes you to stick to some of the lifts which can be very annoying.  Sierra should have fixed this bug by now.  I used cheat codes to get around this problem, however.
As for cheat codes, use them!  As difficult as this game can be, you can finish it using these codes, but try the game without them at first, of course.
What really drags this game down is the graphics.  Although they aren't poor, they aren't that great either.  In some of the levels the design is so plain and smooth I feel like I'm in a tin can.  This problem gets in the way of Half-Life being a truly great game.
To sum it up, I'd say Half-Life is a good, solid shooter.  It can be so absorbing, but it won't wow you either.  And such an opinion will get me in trouble with all those rabid Half-Life fans, no doubt!",3.0

"Okay this game does habe its drawbacks: lame voice overs, poor graphics, and difficulty with control. It also has its good sides: STAR WARS (duh), piloting and blowing the snot out of every thing (even wingmen), and tons  of missions. The easiness of destroying enemies pales to lets say, Rogue  Squadron, and its tricky to shoot enemies. Missions vary from taking out  small fighters, or taking on star destroyers, or escorting freighters. Some  missions can be long and boring and impossible. Only for die-hard Star Wars  Fans, like you and me.  -Jake",3.0
"I ordered this because I lost my old CD a long time ago and I wanted to play it.

It is a Windows professional, im not sure what year, very old OS though. But if you don't have that then this game will be a blast!",3.0
"The initial buzz regarding this game was enormous, leading some publications to regard it as the best videogame ever. But hindsight shows that the title simply hasn't aged well.
For starters, the plot is void and simplistic - seen a million times before. The game is also overly long, and the puzzles get old fast. For a similarly themed game, ""Deus Ex"" outdoes HL, as it actually delivers on the promise of realism. In other words, the gameplay adjusts to you and not the other way around.
Possibly the strongest point about HL is the mod community built around it. Mods are addons which can be downloaded off the net for free. Although the quality of the singleplayer mods leaves much to be desired, the multiplayer mods are often spectacular, as is the case of Day of Defeat and Counter Strike.
My advice is to purchase it SOLELY for these mods, provided you have a good internet connection, so that you may spend many sleepless nights playing the various realism-oriented mods available.",3.0
This is a fun game until you complete a park. It gets dull and boring. And one thing that makes me a little upset is that this game has one park that has a ton of rides and the other parks only have one ride already built. So thats all folks,3.0
"You would think that a game with this much hype and praise MUST be just the greatest game ever created, right?  Well, I don't know about that. Sure Valves Half Life is a decent game; the graphics are not too bad, the AI is fair, etc. But not one part of the game is truly outstanding. The storyline is rather bland, consisting of nothing more than secret government compounds and evil aliens from another dimension, as is the level design. I must have spent over 2/3 of the game wandering through insipid gray corridors. The weapons you are equipped with are ok, considering that most of them are real world guns, so they act as expected. The thing that I disliked most about this game however, was the endless lackluster appearance of the world you walk through. This game is almost devoid of atmosphere, and not even the 'alien world' levels were very vivid. Perhaps that is just a graphical handicap though, considering that it uses the rather archaic Quake2 engine. I suppose the bottom line is; if you are looking for another game to pass the time with, check this out, or if you go for those online realism mods, this is the game to start with. I for one was dissappointed, If you are looking for a game that will really suck you in though, try Unreal or Deus Ex.",3.0

"Honestly, I was disappointed by the game.
The 7 CD pack goes away in less than 3 hours and so vanish the money and all hopes for a week's creep show.
The game lacks the least amount of imagination which would fill in the first 4 CDs of an average perfomance. But the laziness of Roberta Williams was evidently packed up by plenty of running around the castle and 4 houses of the nearest village.
Despite the miss in scenario, I would suggest running through the game for 2 basic reasons: to enjoy one of the rare samples of a plain storytelling computer implementation, and... to have your friends freak with a ravenous story-ending.",3.0
"I am a huge fps fan, but i don't get why everyone likes this game so much.  I found it rather boring and dull.  The gameplay was slow, most of the game was just going around looking for buttons to push to activate different things, which got old in about the first 20 minutes of gameplay.  i admit this game is very good, but i just cant see why it has gotten so much hype.  if u want to get the coolest fps then get Clive Barker's Undying",3.0
"Despite all the hype, Half-Life is not what it's cracked out to be. The AI is not that impressive. Most of the enemies are stone deaf. If you snipe at a soldier in an area full of his fellow soldiers, they often will remain oblivious, until you jump into their line of sight.
Though the story is very minimal, it gets the job done. What Half-Life does well, is incorporate the story into the action, though the story-line is much too predictable.
Although it is a very fun game, it is not very immersive. It has some great action, but the atmosphere seems too light and upbeat to really thrust you into the Half-Life world. This is a very fun and addictive game, yet the story and immersion factor are lacking.",3.0
"When i first bought this game roughly a year ago i thought it would be something that would last for a long time. Dont get me wrong or anything, the game was great, but after a while the fun dimmed down. After playing the scenario over and over again got boring. Also, the game gives you goals for your park and a timelimit to achieving that goal, in my mind i believe the game should have let you win if you achieved the goal before the time limit, instead of waiting for hours to complete. The gameplay is good and balanced and graphics aren't bad from a birds eye view point. Replay on the other hand is a set back. After coming back to play this game day after day, its seemed old and boring. Sounds are also bad and annoying (except the people screaming on your roller coaster.) All in all i expected more, but i was glad i bought it and it is still on my hard drive today.",3.0
"Roller Coaster Tycoon is a fun game and very addictive, but only for a while.
The first few weeks were a lot of fun playing this game, but after that it becomes too predictable and boring.  The problem with it is that it is virtually impossible to fail at or lose.  No matter what you do, within reason, and you will make money and expand your amusement park.  After a while this proved boring for me and I felt like it was unchallenging and a waste of time.
Another thing I did not like about the game is that the money values are unrealistic.  For example, I can charge $40 to get into the park and $2 for each ride, which is all right.  But I can also buy a huge multi-million dollar roller coaster for $10,000.  I found this part of the game disappointing.",3.0
I am what you would call call a tycoon junkie but not much into the scenerio games that come with the tycoon games. If they only had more freeform games this game would have gotten a 5 star. I suggest you wait until November when they release RCT 2.,3.0
"I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon because it looked interesting, and the option to build roller coasters reminded me of Disney's old game Coaster.  I played it for a while and bought the expansion pack, but it just didn't hold my attention.
When I bought it, it looked like a game for all ages, but after playing it for a while it really seemed like it was designed for kids, not adults. The whole nausea feature with guests vomiting all over really got old after a while. Also, the graphics aren't bad, but there's no variation in the guests, they all look like bald men, even the staff.
Once you've played all the scenarios, there's no more, and there isn't a ""create your own"" and just play option, everything has a scenario. You can keep playing them after you've won them, but you're limited to the land and the setup of that scenario.
The speed is also an issue, you either have go or stop, there's no way to slow down or speed up time, and most scenarios require a time limit, like a year or three years.  Unfortunately, if you've won the scenario at the end of year one of a three year scenario, you're stuck. You have to wait out the next two years, and there's no way to set the game at a top speed so it will end faster.  The opposite is true as well, if you're almost out of time and haven't met the conditions, you can't slow down the game to help you plan things out.
On the good side, the general graphics look nice, you can figured the game out pretty well on your own, and there's a nice variety of roller coasters. You have plenty of things to play with in the game, but there's just enough to it that I wouldn't consider it a fantastic game.",3.0
"Ever own a game that you can't decide if you like it? Sure, you read the reviews and bought it on their recommendations, but in the end it's your opinion that counts, right? This is my problem with Starsiege from Dynamix.  On the one hand it's an obvious quality product with no obvious glitches or  crashes, has a good interface, music and sound effects. Dynamix even went  above and beyond the call by producing a Starsiege Compendium-a 96 page  companion book to the main manual. This details the history, characters,  and vehicles that populate the universe of the 29th century.
 On the  other hand, the game is...missing something. Perhaps it's the fact that you  literally have to nickle and dime your opponents to death before each mech  is destroyed, providing you can actually hit them. (Something neither your  AI controlled allies and enemies don't suffer from). The in-game sound  effects must be reset from basic install specs - the music drowns out all  communication and in-game dialogue. Lastly, the mech designs are abysmal!  Most of the weapon discharge sounds - gunfire, lasers, etc. are uninspired.  Considering this game came out after Mechwarrior 2, why do the mechs look  worse that technologically inferior game? I mean, surely they must be able  to come up with something a little more original than a jukebox with legs  or a June bug with long legs?
 There is a good game in here trying to  get out.
 The story is compelling, the missions well designed, the  mechs and tanks easy to control, with the excepting of speed settings and  forward/reverse switching. The 3D support is well handled without being  over done, and colored lighting is not overused. The terrain texture  mapping and landscape detail is exquisite as is the positional shadows.  However, graphically pretty it might be, the explosion of mech is almost  comical-a little flash in the torso area then all the bits fall to the  ground. If you're far enough back you get an expanding purple ring, (I want  to thank ILM and Star Trek VI for making that the current most copied  special effect!)
 Missions are well presented with Mark Hammil in the  role of Harabec, the dispossessed Knight from the Terran Empire, and who  has joined the resistance to lead them and the guy you work for. He briefs  you then you are free to recruit squad mates then equip yourselves. As you  progress in missions you gain access to heavier mech units, new technology  and more powerful weapons. The mission difficulty curve gets steep - fast.  And five or six missions in your scrambling just to stay alive, let alone  complete your mission objectives. Squad mates are essential, but you will  get to used to the fact that they will rack up a higher kill score than you  will. Either that or I just stink at this game, but I don't think so.
  I think as an anime fan I expect too much from the domestic market as far  as mecha design go. Even the original twelve mechs included in the  Battletech boxed set were from Macross or Armored Trooper Votoms, the Wasp  is from Crusher Joe. However, as Monolith Productions and the game Shogo:  Mobile Armored Core and Dream Pod 9 (Heavy Gear) have proven, this doesn't  have to be the case, and they provided very fresh mecha designs. The  Starsiege units are uninspired at best, even allowing for the fact that  many of them are modified labor or construction units.
 Is this a  great game? No, it's a good game. But there is a great game in there trying  to get out.",3.0
"This isn't a bad pinball package at all, but it's definitely not the best available (for that, refer to the Pro Pinball series).
The games are faithfully rendered on-screen, and look and sound just like the originals.  The gameplay itself, on the other hand, can be a bit choppy in places  compared to the Pro Pinball engine.  Cue Ball Wizard, in particular, is  very difficult to play -- the sharp angle at which you view the table  doesn't help.  (If only they'd allowed you to view the tables from  different angles...)
The earlier games provide a nifty sense of history  for the pinball genre -- but are often not that much fun to play.  The  novelty may wear off relatively quickly for those used to today's  tables.
Well worth a look -- and...it's not a bad value just for the nostalgia factor.  If you want a  great game as well as a history lesson, however, look to the Pro Pinball  games.",3.0

I bought this game for Que Ball Wizard alone. I played the real machine for a year straight when i was 15 at the local comic book store. It is in my opinion the greatest pinball machine of all time. Having a relatively easy ramp shot (which is the entire game) made it lots of fun. But whoever designed this game made a big mistake because the ramp shot in the computer game is nearly impossible. I'm lucky if i hit it once out of every 20 tries. Forget scoring points on Rowdy Ramp Round. I really wish they would make a patch for the mistake but it will probably never happen.,3.0

"I have been a fan of this genre since my first brainwahing, which happened to be by 'Betrayal at Krondor', nearly seven years ago.  The game was enveloping for several reasons.  First, the graphics were state of the art  for the time.  Second, the story allowed some divergence from the plot  without negative consequences.  Third, the plot was well developed and  engendered emotional ties to the characters.  Finally, it was plain fun and  challenging.
Return to Krondor had big shoes to fill, no doubt.  However,  while I found the game enjoyable, I did not find it enveloping.  It was  missing several components which made the first so great.  The plot was  very static, with very few and very minor diversions made available.  Explorers don't seem welcome.  Second, the plot and character development  seemed very thin.  At the end, I didn't care much about the folks in the  story.  Finally, it was too short, which is probably a function of the lack  of divergences.  When you have no fun side paths, you head great guns  toward the finish line.
Nevertheless, perhaps the notion that I thought  it was too short is a mark in its favor.  I wanted more.",3.0

"This game is great, at first. The initial premise is interesting, and watching the units and structures being built/born/warped in, is fun. However, in order to be successful at this game, you have to play at such a fast pace, that you don't have time to enjoy those features.

In online play, it simply becomes a game of ""Who is the fastest mouse clicker?"" Against the AI, it's a joke. The AI knows where all your cloaked/burrowed units are. For example, Protoss reavers will magically gather around your burrowed zerglings & hydralisks, then obliterate them in 2 or 3 hits. But at other times, the AI does nothing while you pummel one of its outposts. The AI seems to go back and forth between either being all-knowing or completely inbred-stupid, so it doesn't really feel like you're in a battle; it's just a matter of finding the ""bugs.""

If you need to kill some time, this game will serve you well, as the minutes will quickly pass to hours. But the story degenerates into a Kerrigan-focused plot that has overt feminist themes (I don't know why they did this in a video game), where she is the most important thing in the universe. Even the Overmind itself (male) becomes secondary to Kerrigan.

As a game, Star Craft is unsatisfying and aggravating, and it takes an epic story and whittles it down into Raynor chasing after Kerrigan like a lost puppy. And it's hard to be sympathetic with Kerrigan, because she was ungrateful for Raynor's concern from the get-go. She acts like an intergalactic Gloria Steinem most of the time, incessantly jabbering on about her right to do whatever she wants, blah, blah, blah, to the point where you actually hope she gets eaten by her own brood.

So, although Star Craft is without question a big part of video game history, it is also a reminder of how potentially great games wind up being just ""pretty good"" games.

Why 3 stars, then? Because the cheat codes are a blast, and the included Prima strategy guides are a great read for gaming nerds (like me). Also, you can spawn this game and play with friends, which actually is a lot of fun, as you can Skype while nuking each other on battle.net.",3.0

As well, they aren't smart enough to walk around trees.  They just walk into them and keep walking on the spot.  It's a good strategy game but it kind of gets boring.",3.0

If you're new to RTS games then this is an excellent starter game.  It'll get you into the idea of collecting resources to build an army and upgrade them.  If you're more experienced at RTS then you won't like this game.  The graphics are bad and the unit control is not good (you can only control 8 units at a time).

"Some classics are best forgotten when they require one to spend more time updating them than playing them.

I never knew about this when I purchased it, although to some this may not be a terrible loss. My main problem was with the horribly organized mod community. It took me hours to find good and reliable sites for this game, and even longer to understand what all the mods were for. A sound appreciation for F1 history is 'required' before purchasing this game, as there are too many car types, manufacturers, and drivers to keep track of. One could develop quite a headache from it all. It gets worse when dealing with the mod community. GPL has been modded to death IMO, and should be replaced by something newer.

"Well, I don't really see what the big deal is. It's one of those games that completely addicts you in the beginning, but after a while you start to get sick of watching the roller coaster you spent an hour on just go crashing to the ground.
Once you meet the first challenge, the rest are basically the same, just a little harder. All of the people I know who got the game got too tired of it before they could finish it.
Even though I don't like it now, there was a short period when I stayed up past 2AM playing it. I guess it's an average game, at first you are totally into it, but shortly after you loose interest. I recommend this game to gamers who don't really have anything to do, and are just looking for a cute game to waste their time playing. Rollercoaster Tycoon probably won't be as popular with some of the older kids, a little too young. Also, it's a little too tedious for REALLY little kids. I give it 3 stars.",3.0
"USNF 97 would be a cool game- just like the original with more missions, better grapphics and cool sounds, but it doesn't work with Win 95 like it is supposed to. I've confirmed this with a friend on his machine and it  shuts off right in the middle of a dogfight!
ATF is a cool game but you  have to play it through dos because the controller won't work with the dos  window-patch. It has some really awesome, fast planes with some modern  missles and cool campaigns, but the missions are very difficult.
Longbow-  theoretically, looks like a cool game, but, once again, cannot get the  controller working in windows.
Don't know what EA is doing about these  problems, but I emailed them a while back and have not yet recieved a  reply... so much for customer service.
All in all, if they were to work  on your machine, I would have given this a 4/5.",3.0
This game is average. It is a pretty fun sim. I played it for about a month straight. You get to make your dream theme park. One problem i didn't really like is there isn't enough room in the parks. It gets pretty boring when there isn't enough room to build a really cool roller coaster you want to build. But all and all this game is fun.,3.0
"After passing Gabriel Knight 1 and 2 long before this game came out I was very ""into"" the gk series, then the third installment came. I was expecting it to be like the first one, cartoonish and not very realistic, I was right. In my opinion, gabriel knight 2 is the best of the series only because the personalities of the characters stand out the most in the gabriel knight series. Gabriel knight 2 uses real actors whom gave a great performance, the use of 3d and going back to Tim Curry in GK3 was going down a step. Gk3 is basically Gk1 in polygonal format with a less interesting backset.
I was very dissapointed in the story of this game, in the end after I confirmed the whole story, i said ""nice try"". Nice try as in, 'nice try, but the story just doesn't work out'. One thing that makes the GK series good, is gabriel himself. He was protrayed well in this game, because they used Tim Curry as the voice, as they did in GK1. Another character you play in the game is Grace, very frusterating when it comes turn to play her, the game totally changes from fun and comical to extremely boring. In all fairness though, playing Grace is boring in all 3 games.
So to cut things short the only incentive to play thie game is for the 3d graphics, they are indeed nice eye candy. I recommend playing ""The Longest Journey"", or if you want a taste of the GK series, Gabriel Knight 2 is the way to go.",3.0
"The GK3 is a good game.  As in the previous games, GK is investigating an ocult mystery set in France.  The interactivity of the game is good, the plot is intriguing and encourages you to do more research on teh subject.  However, the riddles are sometimes too complicated, leaving the player at a loss.  At one point I began to wonder what the point of all this is.  Anotehr somewhat annoying thing in the game was that shortcuts are not available for a lot of the places, GK or Grace should go to.  There is a map that gets yout o different locations in the region, however, you have to walk around the town every time you want to visit a different building within the town. While I understand taht this is done on purpose--you collect clues on the way, players should have an option to skip these steps and minimize wasting time watching GK walk the same streets a hundred times before the game is over.",3.0
"I recieved this game for Christmas & once I got it hooked up I was addicted. I loved the concept of building your own theme park. Between me & my 12 year old brother we had built every ride there was to build & had about 8 of every theme park. After awhile we started using it less & less, then it sat completely forgotton on a shelve in our den. It had been 3 months that we had played it & now we only play it unless were bored enough. My advice to anyone who wants to buy this or 'The Sims' is just don't. If you really want to play it I would borrow it from a friend or nieghboor.",3.0
"I have to admit, though I am a big fan of GK and am an avid adventure gamer, I didn't buy Gabriel Knight 3 right off the shelf when it came out because... man, the graphics are terrible.  Come on, face it.  This series has never used a single engine more than once.. the first one was plain old tradiational good 2D art (which definitely works, though not fancy).  The second one used full video, but it worked surprisingly well.  This third one, however... it really really interfered with my gameplay.
First, there is the ugly 3D graphics.  I guess they can't expect everyone to own super machines so they can't soup it up, but it does not compare at all with anything already out there.
Second, what's up with the camera?  Is this a 1st person game or a 3rd person game?  I can leave my character at home while I (the camera) do all the exploring and still the character's voice is telling me what I am seeing.  That just doesn't work, it completely takes the ""immersiveness"" away from what could be a great game.
The lesson is, you don't have to go 3D if it doesn't HELP YOU.  Some of the best selling games aren't fully 3D:  Diablo 2, Baldur's Gate, Grim Fandango, The Longest Journey... I can go on.
Other than that, Jane Jensan pulls it off again with a great story and character development.  Too bad the technology side got in the way, if not this could be one stellar game.  Buy it now for its price, and then sell it to someone else.  The experience is great but it's not worth keeping.",3.0
"This game is quite shallow compared to the first two.  Much hype is made that this is a game about Gabriel confronting vampires, but these are the most bashful vampires in the world.  You don't see any until the last scene of the game (except in Gabriel's dreams).  And even then Gabriel doesn't ever confront them himself, but it's Mosely and another guy (and you don't get to see it).  Also, the guys who turn out to be the vampires are walking around outside in the daylight the whole game, and don't have ""vampire teeth"".  The only thing different about them is that their eyes turn red when they get mad...pretty sorry vampires.
Some of the puzzles are silly.  For example you have this fingerprint kit.  You spend much of the game trying to get fingerprints, and in the end the fingerprinting has absolutely nothing to do with discovering who the kidnappers are (which is what you are trying to solve).
The graphics and gameplay are okay but not great.  I think they could stand to optimize their 3D engine since this would be responsible for the performance problem many people have had.  As far as the story itself, it moves very slowly.  Gabriel Knight 2 is my favorite all-time adventure game but this (3) is the first one where I asked, ""Is that it?"" at the end.
Lastly, this game does address religious matters.  They sort of  take apart the Christian religion (they really do).  I am not a fundamentalist by any means but I think that's a bad subject for a video game.  Without going into detail, I'd say you should probably avoid this game if you hold any Christian beliefs--even non-practicing.",3.0
"I enjoy the Gabriel Knight series and still play the other two games, even if they're a little outdated.  The storyline is excellent, and you really get to know the characters.  Unfortunately, that's not the case in the third installment of the series.  Some of the characters are as  ""wooden"" as Queen Amalia from the ""Stars Wars: The Phantom  Menace"" movie.  You hardly get to know them at all.  Plus, the  storyline is a bit weaker than the other GK series.  I spent a lot of time  scratching my head trying to make sense of what happened a minute ago.  When I finished the game, I was STILL stratching my head, but this time  because of the ending!  In addition to that, the graphics are totally  unlike that which you would see in a game like this.  I also like the  King's Quest series, but since they ""polygonified"" the eight one,  my interest has been waning.  ""Sierra games,"" as I call any game  where you walk around and have multiple icons that you click on different  things to get responses (text or oral), SHOULD NOT have graphics like this.  I would recommend this game to fans of the series (obviously), but for  everyone else, wait for the price to drop before you make the purchase, and  while you're waiting, play the first two GKs.  I highly recommend those!",3.0
"Okay, but not the best. I highly enjoyed GK1 and GK2 with their excellent plots, but this has yet to be desired.
First of all, the game ran too darn slow on my computer. It's the first time that I've played a game on my computer with such slowness. It was torture just to get Gabe  moving--sheesh.
Also, the characters. I didn't feel that much for Gabe  and Grace as I did in the first two. I enjoyed Tim Curry's voice in the  first one, in this one it was too much (forced with those annoying quips).
But one thing that was a huge let down for me was the storyline. I would  have forgiven GK3 for all the other minor peeves--if the plot was just as  good as the first two. But it was not. The story was boring. It didn't even  hold my interest.  The  plot didn't feel *horror*. In the first two  stories, there was a suspsense, scary edge to it. The theme (voodoo in the  first one and werewolves in the second one) was spread through out, but in  GK3, you really don't see any of that until towards end.
A dreadful  dissapointment.",3.0
"Many people who know this game could flip to see that I gave it anything other than 5 stars. But, I felt this game did not deserve the last stars for a couple of reasons which I will present you with now. By no means  should you NOT purchase this game, but don't expect everything it's been  described as.
The major positive aspects of ""Roller Coaster  Tycoon"" are obvious. The user can create their own theme park right  down to the roller coasters which they can design themselves. After  designing the park the gamer can watch virtual people explore and enjoy the  park.
The negatives just about even off with the positives. First of all,  the interface makes creating roller coasters difficult. It will take the  user a LOT of work to master creating a roller coaster quickly.
Secondly,  when the user does ultimately make his creation... it will probably be  disliked by the virtual people unless is snaps exactly to the  guidelines.
Third, the information is incredibly innaccurate. How many  roller coasters cost a mere $9,000? And in what world would people pay over  $50 each to get in a theme park, and then pay insane amounts to ride each  ride?
Lastly, Hasbro didn't release a Macintosh version. Something that  all game developers should be doing as the Macintosh is grandly growing in  the computer world and a much better gaming system than the PC.

"I will be totally honest here, I LOVED this game! I bought it when it came to out (then) local comp usa and fell in love spending countless hours playing it and life was great but then it happened . . . I bought a new laptop and installed it on it and from time to time got conflicts (ALL VIDEO) as my much more advanced video card and my game were fighting each other much to my dismay I started seeing my game freeze then drop off with windows reporting an ""unrecoverable or exception"" error on the video.  I looked it up and saw others had same problem and saw an update was needed but bad news: SIERRA WENT O.O.B.!

"It look stunning - the artwork is obviously inspired by Chris Foss and Peter Elson (sci-fi artists of the old 'Great Space Battles' books from the  late-70's), and it's gorgeous, even more so than 'Conflict: Freespace'. Not  only is it technically impressive, it has style, too - space itself is a  colourful nebula, and the vehicle designs and paintwork give the impression  that you have a gigantic set of cool toys at your disposal. Surprisingly,  the 'Battlestar: Galactica'-esque story around which the game hangs is a  cut above the average - whilst not exactly 'War and Peace' it's still much  better you might expect.
The flow of play is less interesting, though.  With no terrain as such, it's not so much a tactical game as a strategic  one - the side that can field the most amount of units wins. As one of the  other reviews mentions, a gigantic asteroid field would have helped things  enormously. Furthermore, as in 'Urban Assault', the AI requires that you  manage every significant unit at the same time, something which gets on  your nerves quite quickly. And it gets very, very hard later on -  especially as your status is carried from mission to mission. Often you  realise that you're going to have to start again from scratch in order to  complete later missions, and having to spend ages after you have 'won'  mining for resources in order to build up your forces is very dull.
Do  you want this? It's more or less one of a kind, and it's utterly stylish,  although in the long run both 'Starcraft' and the older 'Total  Annihilation' are more fun to play.",3.0
"I must say that I enjoyed Homeworld... for a while.  I did not, in all honesty, finish the game because I felt it degenerated into a pure slugfest, no tactics or strategy involved (for the most part).  The short  summary is that Homeworld is a fairly typical harvest resources, build  forces, kill the enemy sort of game.  A couple frills with the attempted 3D  interface and the salvage capabilities, but nothing to write home about.  If you want real-time strategy, there are better choices out  there.
First, though the game is, in theory, 3D, very little is actually  done in 3D, and the interface for trying to do so is difficult to manage.  Almost the entire game takes place in effectively one plane (for the core  game, there are a couple of exceptions).  So, while the 3D idea is neat,  very little is done to develop and exploit it. Second, very little strategy  seems to be involved in the game.  The interface is a little too clunky and  micro-manage centric (to use any units with intelligence, YOU must be in  direct control of them) to allow for grand tactics and strategies, and  there is a sad emphasis on the captial ships.  To a large degree, you can  do entirely without fighter class ships (once you reach a certain tech  level). Obviously, game designers have yet to notice that there are often  very good reasons for having smaller stuff on the scene.  The formations  attempt to bring some semblance of order to the game, but those same  formations rapidly disappear in actual combat, making them fairly  pointless. Third, unit intelligence is miserable.  This is not a problem  liited to Homeworld, but seems to be endemic to the strategy genre.  Fight  to the death, you cannot establish a target priority intelligence. you  cannot setup a series of orders (shoot your designated target unless  something juicier or more deadly appears, run to a certain staging area if  you are damaged, guard this ship, but do not leave it's immediate vicinity,  etc.).
On the plus side, the game is pretty smooth.  The views are great,  and the perspective control is very useful (though a camera angle change  could be nice, ie, view out from a unit's perspective, rather than always  looking at a particular unit or view of any area, rather than a unit).  The  repair/refuel and docking capability is cool, as is the ability to jump  around the map (mp only though). Sadly, I don't think the game lived up to  its hype.",3.0

"Outlaws was released in 1996, and was one of the last 1st-person shooters to retain a sprite-based game engine over a true 3D polygonal one. It's also one of the few western-based shooting games on the market.

You're Marshall James Anderson, a former lawman who takes up the badge again when a railroad baron's goons kill your wife and kidnap your daughter. You'll fight through nine stages, including ghost towns, mines, cliff dwellings, and saw mills on your quest for revenge. Bonus missions send you on bounty-hunting quests for those thugs you never saw during the main game. Lucasarts really nailed the spaghetti western atmosphere and trappings with lots of animated cutscenes and excellent voice work. You can also pop the game CDs into your CD player and hear the highly memorable full-length soundtrack.

But there are problems with Outlaws' gameplay. The environments are still pretty decent, but the enemy sprites were average by 1996 standards, and look pretty bad today. Some of the levels can be disorienting and confusing, and the missions fall into key hunts that aren't much better than the original DOOM. There's really no sense of direction except to run around and open passages until you meet the boss. Bosses aren't as distinctive as in other games, and you might not know you've killed one until the game jumps to a cutscene. To its credit, Outlaws included elements that later became staples of the shooter genre, including having to manually reload (bullet by bullet!), a sniper rifle, and a stamina meter where your character becomes slower and out of breath the longer you run.

I can't say there's much reason to buy this title today if you've been raised on shooters like Half-Life and Halo, but if you're a collector of Lucasarts games and want to experience the high-quality cutscenes and soundtrack, Outlaws is a must-have.",3.0

"For ideas and overall gameplay, this game is great. It's easy to get started and easy to understand the basics. The sound is not only great, but appropriate to events in the game. Getting feedback on amusement park customers is easy, and the information is useful. The whole economic model  is easy to understand and adjust. The visuals are great, and the way that  park employees are manipulated is well designed.
But, I found some  usability quirks that made gameplay frustrating, and random crashes made it  so I didn't want to return to play. It's not always clear where and how to  run paths to attractions. Worse, if there's just one tree on a square where  you want to set an attraction, it won't go down there. (Not like SimCity,  which takes trees out automatically when you build). Trying to build a  custom roller coaster was a trial, one I never completed. To make changes,  you go back an un-build from the end, which can be tedious if you've built  quite a bit already. Finally, I started getting random crashes, which would  just dump me out of the game. Enough that I stopped playing (even though I  was mostly haveing a good time).
I love simulation games (I've played all  the SimCities, plus Sim Copter, SimTower, Railroad Tycoon, and more), and  trying to design and build my own roller coaster was a trip. Better testing  and a bit more attention to good design would make this an A+ game.",3.0
"Starcraft.....

the game of building a lot of stuff...researching as much crap as possible...and BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF THE OTHER PLAYER.

The game...it is partly strategic....but...the game is basically about building as many units as possible and hoping that the other guy doesn't have as much as you do.

if you are having trouble on the game...cheat...thats all there is to it...if the game gets so boring at times....Cheat.....thats all there is to it.

The game of Starcraft is complicated as you advance in the game....but..if you have friends in high places(wink wink)...you should be able to do just fine. But....the game is so easy at the start that you wouldnt even need to have friends in high places when you are going solo on it.

Now multiplayer........thats very complicated...you are basically battling against other players who have more experience than you do and you are HELPLESS to an attack by the people you are against. My advice....dont go into any rooms that say noobs only. the people in there are basically setting you up for the BIGGEST BEATING OF YOUR LIFE......i know.....it happened to me too. This is the area in which you NEED friends in high places. My advice..again...join clans...you will be surprised in what help you get there.

THE BAD POINTS OF THE GAME

Now my review basically looks like its all about bad points in the game....but it just goes to show that what i am about to tell you may be helpful....or u cant do anything about it...you decide that for yourself.

  1. The game has LAG.....it has it in multiplayer and single..nothing you can do about it accept that you have to wait for it to stop.

  2. You can get confused very easily as the game progresses further into the mystifying depths of starcraft.

  3. You also can get very frustrated...easily...jist keep a cool head throughout the whole game or else get off and walk away for a while.

hope this helps you understand starcraft better...

Combat Flight Simulator is fun but not very realistic and it has really bad grafics. Somethimes when your playing the game a enemy shoots your plane and then theres bullet holes in the cockpit window and you survive. If that really happened the pilot would be dead. Also the planes don't try to move away from you when you shooting them so it is really easy to shoot down planes. I shot down 72 planes once. Combat Flight Simulator is not alot of money to buy so it kind of worth getting if you like WW2 combat flying game. Combat Flight Simulator 2 and 3 are a lot more fun and realistic.,3.0
"This is the original CFS.  Though CFS3 is out by now, those owning older computers, even those that can run CFS2, should consider CFS1 as an alternative.  CFS1 is set in Europe - allowing you to fly fighter missions using the tried and true Microsoft Flight Simulator engine (formerly the BAO flight sim engine).  Surprisingly, this is a pretty effective sim for one that many could easily boil down to ""Flight simulator with guns"".  Unfortunately, despite the challenges of adapting skills amassed flying combat flight sims with less realistic flight modeling, CFS1 never really becomes more than ""Flight simulator with guns"".
In CFS1, you can fly on-line, single missions, or campaigns.  Using the MSFS engine, it is as adaptable as any edition of ""Microsoft Flight Simulator"" in terms of add-on aircraft, scenery or missions.  (Be aware, that while there's no shortage of modern military aircraft available for sale or for download, the inherenent design of this game is towards pre-modern aircraft.  Neither the sophisticated systems nor guided weapons are available).  There are actually 2 campaigns - the Battle of Britain (summer of 1940) in which you intercept (or escort) waves of the Luftwaffe's medium level bombers or dive bombers against industrial and defense targets in England or Channel shipping and the daylight bombing campaign against Europe starting around 1943.  CFS1 is entirely a fighter-driven game - barring user customization, you can't fly big bombers.  On the flip side, fighters can be armed with rockets or bombs.  While you can fly for the Luftwaffe in either campaign, your choice on the allied side is limited.  I can understand being stuck with the RAF for the Battle of Britain (the attack on Pearl, and America's entry into the war was still over a year away), but didn't the RAF fly at all in 1943-45?  The campaigns are short and scripted: you fly the same mission until you get it right.  To be honest, the mission goals aren't demanding (I'm more likely to get snagged by crashing into a wingman or getting too close to an enemy), and the repetitive aspect of pre-scripted missions would be little improved by a dynamic campaign, since most missions would be the same anyway (how much of a Mustang pilot's time wasn't spent escorting waves of B-17's?).  One tip for escorting the bombers - you may have caught Edmund O'Brien as a P-47 driver in ""Fighter Squadron"" (1948) who chafes under rules that require his pilots to stick with the bombers and not chase enemy planes to the deck.  Just remember, the time you've spent after you break formation to chase an Me-109 away, will easily be exceeded by how long it will take you to rejoin, especially if you went for the deck and must now claw back up to your formation's flight level.  This is especially critical since other Me-109s will exploit your absence to cut into your formations.  Stick with the bombers!
I can't say how realistic flight modeling was - I'd expected worse remembering how pitiful I was on the WWI mission included on the original BAO Flight Sim (c. 1982).  Visually, the planes are lovely, though this is an old game, and it won't bowl you over.  Damage modeling is suspect - CFS1 is stuck in an era of sims in which your plane will have a fixed response to damage; this is despite a more effective damage model in ""Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe"" (1990) in which a given hit from an enemy will lead to progressive deterioration in your plane's condition.  Ground targets and ships are completely implausible - one hit from your rockets and destroyers, u-boats and merchantmen (which remain parked like sitting ducks) disappear in fireballs ala ""Battlestar Galactica"", which hints that this project was rushed to shelves.  (The other hint is the appearance of Me-262 jets - they only appear in one mission, and as ground targets.  How did that happen?)
So, what's really wrong?  A weak mission generator and the same aircraft we've seen in over ten years in flight sims.  MS probably guessed that it wasn't worth their time to do more than add guns and damage models to the FS engine - people would just download the missions, flight panels, scenery or aircraft files they wanted anyway.  Sure the game has the big planes of that theater of the war - but then did CFS1 have to wartime Europe?  With its flight engine, CFS1 would have been the perfect vehicle for a Korean war sim - an idea that MS inexplicably ignored for this and the next 2 additions.  WWII Europe simply has been simmed to death.  Terrain is incredibly flat and, especially down low, doesn't even look like terrain.  It's almost at the point where, unless you go on the `net for add-on files, there really isn't anything to simulate here.  In short, MS was hot to create a military flight sim that would adapt to any user's preference, they forgot to give it features that people would prefer to keep.  I couldn't get decent performance on my P200mmx/Voodoo2 PC.  Obviously, hardware wasn't an issue when I moved up to a P4 (no Windows XP compatibility issues here).
On a final note, CFS1's disappointments are not completely covered by CFS2.  I own both games since I wanted a Pacific war sim.  Though CFS2 is obviously an improvement, CFS1 holds up pretty well - CFS1 owners can download or buy add-on files to capture the Pacific experience.  In short, if you've got CFS1, don't feel like you've got to spend $$ for CFS2 or to upgrade your machine.",3.0
"Microsoft made massive improvements when they made the sequel to this game. I have them both and don't really recommend this game.

"Naturally others will have a different experience of this game depending upon their proficiency at aircraft sims and the game controllers used by their system. This is merely my experience with this particular game. The concept is great, particularly for WWII buffs like myself. Graphically the game is superb, no complaints there. I do however have major trouble with the handling capabilities of all the aircraft used, save for the Spitfire Mark IX. This is the only aircraft which seems to be able to keep its nose level long enough for me to get is decent shots at another aircraft. Most of the other planes fly like stuffed pigs and no matter how often I hit the ""Bank/Yaw Center"" key the moment I make a slight correction the nose buffets wildly. Maybe I am not doing something right but reading the manual and using the tutorial does not give any clues at to what I can do to alleviate this game spoiling effect. So basically I am limited to flying the Spit which doesn't bother me too much as I prefer the RAF. Unfortunately as most seem to feel the Combat Campaigns and Missions are lacklustre, particularly for the RAF. Some are just plain goofy. Too many missions involve attacking ground targets, which are difficult and dangerous to hit (slamming into the turf or surf is a constant hazzard). I just get the feeling that the game has been overprogrammed to include spoilers that reduce the handling capabilities of the aircraft and if I have this trouble playing at the easiest/slowest level then obviously the designers don't know the meaning of the word ROOKIE. Everyone has to start somewhere I just don't think this game offers the novice the support necessary to acquire the gaming skills needed to operate it. I have tried the downloads for new missions and aircraft but these are just sitting on my hard drive like Junkers on the tarmac. There is no use in offering them if they don't load themselves. If these files need to be modified to make them run then there is no use in offering them to any but the advanced computer buff. I (and no doubt most computer users) wouldn't know how to configure these files even if Microsoft was kind enough to walk me through it. But here's the beef, why didn't they include these features before releasing the game? Microsoft has left it up to the gaming community to modify their software for them. I give them poor marks in the customer service department. So for me the game is more the Spitfire Flight Simulator which doesn't make me unhappy but clips my wings a little.",3.0
"First of all the game graphics are sharp and fast. The flight physics are on the ball.  When you are looking around in your cockpit this where the game shines.
Shooting a plane is very rewarding with debre falling off(and yes you can in fact shoot wings off planes) and smoke.
Unloading on a plane and then pausing to move the camera all around is worth way more then 5 stars.
Unfortunately the campaign brings it down for imersive play and lasting interest.
This quote from reviewer Filmfanman sums it up perfectly:
  ""The campaign modes are the least interseting aspect of the game and leave a lot to be desired. I want a sense of ""being there"" from my sims, outside of combat. I want detailed debriefings after a mission. I want to feel a sense of camaraderie with my fellow virtual pilots. I want to know who made it back and who didn't. I want to see how many kills my squad mates got so I have a benchmark with which to compete. I don't care if the missions are scripted or dynamic so long as they have that feel that really immerses you in a campaign. The campaigns here fall flat""
But the game is good for a few hours here and there.  And I would encourage you to fly the ones that are not terribly long to get the most out of the simulation aspect.  Otherwise like what someone else said.  It will get boring quick.
 All in all a very solid game where the campaigns brings it down 2 stars.  Sad.",3.0
"I got this game in Dec 1997 and for months me and my best friend did nothing but play it. At the time it seemed so cool and interesting. Today, it seems dated and dull. Weird isn't it? I have AOE2 and it is much better but that too already seems old hat. Even with all the expansion packs available for this game it will never come close to the complexity of the sequel or Age of Mythology. Buy it if you can find it dead cheap tho.",3.0
"I make a hobby of owning and playing flight simulators, and can really appreciate both realism and playability. While this game has a little of both, it left me wanting so much more.
Gamers familiar with other WWII titles like the older Aces over Europe and the newer Janes WWII Fighters will feel like they're flying a paper airplane after a few flights in this sim. While a fantastic attempt at simulating the flying experience was made, and succeeded in most points, there's just something about the whole flight package that leaves me wanting more. After a flying a few missions with this game, I go right back to WWII Fighters for the whizzing bullets, radio chatter, textured clouds and flak, groaning and creaking airframe during a tight maneuver, spinning propeller blurring your view ... In short, while we can't expect any one game to give us everything, I still expected a game touted as one of the ""flight simulator"" series to give me more realism.
As for playability and ""fun"", the game has a little more. Don't let anyone tell you it's an easy game either. Playing the missions from either side gives you a pretty good feel for the campaigns fought so long ago. If your team (axis or ally) felt the crunch, or was flying high, you can really feel it here. Damage-to-flight is pretty realistic, and thought it may seem that your fighter is taking more damage than it should be allowed to, you're quick meat in a dogfight with so many control surfaces and avionics all shot up.
If I were to sum this game up, it's fun, but lacks the ""feeling"" of realism some of us purists out there are looking for.",3.0
If you have ever played any of the aces series you will find this a disappointment.  Aces over Europe is about 10 times better and more realistic.  This is just an expensive game that has Microsoft on it so it sells.,3.0

"CFS has excellent graphics but is limited on number and types of missions available. Jerky motions at times.  I had difficulties playing as game quit and returned to ""Desktop"" without warning.  Tried MS Support and they could not resolve the problem.  I have plenty of space for game with a Voodoo 3 3000 PCI graphics card. I would not purchasse this game knowing what I know now.  I bought Jane's WWII Fighters and it plays without any problems. Microsoft's CFS is not designed for today's PC's, in my opinion. My CFS CD is now collecting dust.  Look elsewhere for flight sim games.",3.0
"As an experience, Microsoft's 'Combat Flight Simulator' is rather akin to watching your parents dance - it's an attempt to inject some fun into the  staid 'Flight Simulator' series, and whilst it retains all the virtues of  the longest-running flight sim series ever, it doesn't totally work, being  not much fun to play as a game. The presentation is solid, and extremely  unspectacular - the graphics are very rough, and the sound is nothing to  write home about, although the trails of debris that fall from the back of  enemy aircraft is attractive. You can choose to fly a limited set of single  missions (some of which seem oddly hard, simply because you don't have  enough ammunition to destroy your assigned targets), or a 'campaign', but  disappointingly the 'campaign' is just a set of single missions, one after  the other, generating no atmosphere at all. It isn't a patch on the  campaign mode in Microprose's 'European Air War', or the modern 'Falcon 4',  in which the course of a war is modelled and remembered from mission to  mission. The end result is that the game quickly becomes quite monotonous,  and with no real incentive for you to do well from mission to mission the  thought of taking off for another round of bomber interception palls.  Special mention must be made of the manual, which, 'DiD'-style, has lots  and lots of information, but doesn't actually tell you much about flying,  fighting, and most importantly dropping bombs.
That said, all of Europe  is modelled, and if you have the time you can try flying from London to  Paris by landmarks and compass, if you so desire. And a thriving community  of 'Flight Sim' buffs will ensure that the CD you get in the box is only  the start of an ongoing affair.",3.0
"A good WW II flight sim should contain 4 key elements: Great graphics, great campaigns, realistic flight modeling, and good flight damage modeling. Combat flight simulator gets 2 out of 4. The game has some of the  best graphics I have ever seen in a flight sim. The texture mapping on the  landscapes is so detailed and sharp that sometimes you'll swear its real.  In fact, it looks so realistic that at times the CGI planes look out of  place against the more true to life terrain. The cockpits are nicely  rendered and the planes look fantastic. When a plane takes damage and  begins to stream smoke the effect looks very good.
The flight modeling  seems to be pretty accurate. You have three different levels of difficulty  with the `Ace' setting giving you the most realistic experience of flying  these planes. The planes never seem too difficult to handle but don't fly  themselves by any means. I have found myself in several spins that were  either difficult to get out of or ended in me ejecting from the plane. Good  stuff.  But don't let the graphics convince you this is a good game. There  are some faults, damage modeling being the biggest problem. While in  combat, I have blasted hundreds of rounds at enemy planes and witnessed  bursts of  debris come off the plane but nothing in terms of the degree of  damage is seen - no bullet holes, no charred/burnt sections, no parts of  the plane missing. In the intro you can see a couple of planes lose their  wings in a blaze of destruction but I have yet to create this same effect  in actual gameplay. And, surprisingly, when your own craft is destroyed you  get the same stock explosion with obviously simple polygons representing  the debris of your plane giving your demise a kind of ""canned"" feel. These  problems detract from the virtual realism you want in a flight sim.
The  campaign modes are the least interseting aspect of the game and leave a lot  to be desired. I want a sense of ""being there"" from my sims, outside of  combat. I want detailed debriefings after a mission. I want to feel a sense  of camaraderie with my fellow virtual pilots. I want to know who made it  back and who didn't. I want to see how many kills my squad mates got so I  have a benchmark with which to compete. I don't care if the missions are  scripted or dynamic so long as they have that feel that really immerses you  in a campaign. The campaigns here fall flat.
If you are the kind of  flight sim gamer who doesn't care about immersion in a campaign then the  graphics alone will not disappoint. There are also some pretty good single  mission that are not tied to a campaign but the re-playability value based  on the single missions alone probably wouldn't be worth the purchase. There  is also a quick mission feature which puts you right in the middle of  battle. While this is a pretty good feature you can set the number of  opponents in a squad but you can't give yourself any wingmen, so its just  you against however many enemy pilots you choose.
If you're into  graphics, definitely get this or Jane's WW II fighters. If you want great  gameplay and engrossing campaigns go with European Air War. I am hoping for  better things from Combat Flight Simulator II - Pacific Theater coming in  4Q 2000.",3.0
"This is the game I bought a new CD-ROM, Voodoo 3D accelator card and almost a new $1,500 PC to play!  It chokes on my old 133 MHz unless everything graphical is set to wire-frame-and-polygon scale.
Initially  very fun, until you play it a week or so.  Then you realize that the things  that make computer games really fun -- role playing where your squadron  gains more experience -- is missing from this flight sim.  Sure, the dog  fights are fun, but this game tends to give you that ghostly 'I'm all alone  in Sim Land' feel after while.  The campaigns are long strings of same-o  missions.  A case in point:  After you take off, you can skip to the  action.  Pretty soon you find you never fly anymore, just skip to the  action, fight, and skip back home.  That gets old fast and pretty soon  you'll delete this ol' dog off your hard drive and look for something with  more depth.",3.0
"I was put off this game initially by people saying 'it was to much like tomb raider.' I don't actually like tomb raider but i went out and bought this game anyway.

"One of the most entertaining flight ""sims"" I have ever played. This game has given me hours and hours of enjoyment -- especially online. Unfortunately, there are some perplexing and conflicting elements involved here. Although the game has a ""realistic"" setting, there are no stalls and/or spins during flight. The program allows a virtual ""Red Baron"" to do things with a plane that are simply against the laws of physics. Also, for all the detail the programmer(s) put into this game in many areas, the guys (and gals) -- for some reason -- dropped the ball in certain places. There is no weapons load-out screen for the planes, and there seems to be a never ending supply of crude rockets and bombs -- whether you want them or not (the bomb/rocket load doesn't seem to affect the performance of the planes). In ""real life"" these weapons are loaded as needed per each mission and then expended. Most importantly, the game only shows its true graphical splendor in the 3dfx Glide mode. My Geforce 3 card only allows software rendering (the ground looks like a Purina checkerboard). In summary, be careful -- this one is addicting as hell. (Also note that there is a good online community out there who are ready and willing to help new ""pilots"").",3.0
"Watch out with this one.  If you have a newer graphics card like a Geforce2 then you will not be able to get the 3D graphics.  This game does not support 3d acceleration with newer cards.

How do I start? The monk is a nice addition but the fact that the 2 better characters are hidden in the game WITHOUT 'skins' to make them visually appealing was a drag.

"First I'll explain to you what my superpad looks like, as it's different then the one pictured. It looks very similar to the official Nintendo brand controller, the only difference being that mine has colored face buttons(red,blue,green and yellow), says ""superpad controller"" at the top and the start and select buttons are a little higher. There is also 2 big bulky circles on the back underneath the directional pad and the face buttons, and it says ""interact"" below the start and select buttons. There are no signs of this controller being cheaply made at all, and it seems to be about identical in quality to the official Nintendo brand inside and out. However, read on...

Now, for all the 6 or 7 years I've had this controller I never had a problem, but now it's got some major issues! You may be thinking ""Jeez, 6 or 7 years with no problem is pretty good!"" but considering that the official controllers last forever, that's really not that great. I suppose it makes it far superior to many other 3rd party controllers out there, but it's still not worth it if you can find an official one. Anyway, my controller now has buttons getting set off without them even being pressed! It seems to depend on the game which buttons get set off without being pressed, but needless to say my superpad is pretty much worthless now.

Overall, you could probably do much worse, but the Nintendo brand is proven to last, and if you can find one of those that's definitely the way to go. I'm sure that everyone is going to have a different experience with their superpad - you could end up with one that lasts longer, not as long or one that has problems from the start. This is just my experience with a single superpad controller after all, but official seems to always be the least risky.",3.0
"At first I really was enjoying this game, but it's gotten old after I beat it the first 3 or so times and I began to realize a bunch of things concerning usability. Maybe I'm just not using all the features to their  fullest advantage though, so I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt.  As for the interface, there are plenty of ways to make gameplay much more  smooth. I find it primitive and, if possible, at the same time it is  overcomplicated. I can't say I'm an expert at this, but it seems from  reviews I've read concerning other software (concerning  ""intuitive"" interfaces) that the interface can best be described  as not at all intuitive. The saving system and the restrictions imposed  when one gives commands in combat are my biggest pet peeves.
What the  game lacks in functionality, it makes up for in amazing graphics and music.  Both are truly magnificent. The quests may give you a challenge where the  normal mode at times doesn't.

I never grabbed a tape measure, but it must have been somewhere around four feet long. that extra two feet less than an original controller meant the difference between sitting on my comfy couch and having to sit on the floor to play my games.

All said and done, the controller is well put together, and the button feel isn't too bad, but if you're going to try to sell SNES controllers, you should at least be clear on how short or long they are.",3.0

"I remember getting this game a while back when I was younger.  The game was difficult to master, which I attributed to my young age, but I loved to play it because of the nice atmosphere it gave; beautiful, fantasy surrounding, pleasant music, pretty landscape (the 3D terrain had an enhancing effect over other strategy RPGs I had played on the PC before).  Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot.

Moving back to the present day, I had lost my copy and was itching to play it again, having all but forgotten what the game was like.  My girlfriend and I had gotten hooked on Age of Wonders, and I wanted to investigate similar games for her.

I ordered LoM SE on Amazon not too long after.  After installing and playing the game for a bit, I was a little dissapointed.  I was still the game that I remember, but it seemed deficient in ways I hadn't noticed before.

For example, the graphics did not age well.  I can go back and play much older games from my childhood such as Quest for Glory I & II (SCI engine) and still marvel at how beautiful the graphics are despite only 16 available colors and a screen resolution of 320x240.  This is double edged, because while I feel that LoM has pretty graphics, they still seem to work out poorly in the long run.

Secondly, I still find the gameplay to be difficult.  I'm not a kid anymore, and I have since mastered other fantasy RPGs, but the system in LoM seems a bit awkward and difficult to master.  I couldn't play it for more than a half hour.

Overall, I think it's a good game.  Even though it's not my cup of tea anymore, I can see that lots of other people really love it, so if you like the genre then I give it a good recommendation.  The price tag is very cheap, and it's well worth a grab.",3.0

"This game is very much worth buying at its listed price.  This game has so much potential, but is somewat awkward and buggy in its interface.  Let me give you some examples:
1. Real time combat:  As mentioned in the editorial review, this is extremely problematic and awkward.  Because it is based on a 3/4 view, you lose sight of some of your units, and often it seems they do not immediately respond to your commands.  Units end up in a scrum at the center of the screen, and don't readily disengage or advance.  This is dissapointing considering ""Lords of the Realm"" which was not perfect either, had a much cleaner interface, and it is an older game.  Lords of Magic would have been a much better game if the battle view was adjustable, and the speed of combat as well.  If the units were more ""Diablo"" sized, or somewhere in between, it would have been a vast improvment. Also in ths same area, when entering dungeons and the like, your party can randomly turn up in strange places on the battle scape map, e.g. your sorceress is on the other side of the map all by herself, next to a group of trolls, when all her protection is on the other side separated by a physical barrier like water.  This can mean certain death for a character you have spent much time developing, and makes no sense.  If your party goes in as a unit they should appear that way on the battlescape.  This is just poor design.
2. Hero Status bars:  On the ""overland"" view, your heros have a pop up status card, showing their items, level, etc.  These are so sparse that once you gain multiple magical items you have to create new heros just to have someone to off-load the items to in order to take an inventory of your items.  When you have many parties on the board, this is maddening!
3.  Overland spells:  There is no feedback on overland spells (spells you cast while in the ""world view"").  You have no way of telling whether they worked, or what the affect was.  ALso there are some spells that seem to not work at all, like transporting a magical item via magical means.
4. Fortesses:  These are far to weak, and are awkward to defend.  If any of you have played Lords of the Realm you know that castles are easily defended. Not in this game.  There is no ability for your archers/javeliners to man the walls of the castle.  You can direct them to that area, but often they just stand there or run around.  They also gain no advantage from the height of the walls or the cover provided thereby.  You just end up with a scrum at the front gate with everyone bunched together like Mattel vibrating football.
This game is worth playing just to be able to use Balkoth after you complete it.  The spells that ""Death"" can cast are really cool.  Overall, I recommend this game at it's current listed price.  It has some beautiful graffics, interesting story, and combines party based roll playing with RTS and turn based strategy.  With some conceptual changes, this could be the greatest game ever.",3.0

For some reason Sierra dropped the spoofs and comedy to make a King's Quest clone instead of a spoof.
The play is pretty smooth but the interface will drive you nuts until you get used to it.",3.0
"I've loved Quest For Glory since the first, but this last one did not at all live up to any QFG fan's expectations. The storyline itself remains more or less true to the earlier games, but the gameplay reeks of being tweaked to be more like traditional RPGs, most likely thanks to the new executives who ran Sierra after Cendant took over. The soundtrack is unimpressive, I'd go so far as to say the MIDI music from QFG2 and 3 was better than the digital music for QFG5. Overall, unless you're a fan of the earlier games, you probably won't enjoy this one very much.
On that note, Sierra is stupidly discontinuing sale and production of the QFG collection (as well as the collections of King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, and their other main series from the 80s and early 90s), so Amazon and other retail stores are not going to be selling them anymore. I'd really recommend looking around for them in various places that sell used software (e.g. [URL]); they're really excellent games.",3.0
"I am a HUGE fan of the quest for glory series, in fact I still play quest for glory I-IV. But quest for glory V was seriously lacking. It seemed to be tacked on and quickly thrown together. If your a fan on QfG get this  just to fifnish the series but be prepared to be disapointed. The only  thing improved would be the graphics. The plot and humor that made I-IV  what they were just doesn't seem to be in QfG5. My adviice, buy the QfG  anthology I-IV are defiantly better even if there are in VGA (and worse)  graphics.",3.0
"One has to wonder about the idea of ""individual colony themes.""  I saw no difference what so ever.  This game touts being all about developing a new planet and managing a balance of priorities, but in essence it is just another shoot 'em up and beat 'em up, build your army and go to battle war game.  Bummer!  When I started I deliberately took on the role of what I expected to be a less aggressive type of leadership in the form of the ecological group or Green Party.  As I was establishing my initial territory I happened to bump into the United Nations Peace Party doing the same thing.  Rather than a ""Hi there!  How's it going?"" or ""This is a wild new place. How might we cooperate and help each other develop and survive more effectively?"" -- the immediate response of this so-called Peace Party was: ""You have violated our territory. Back off or we will destroy you!""  Oh, yeah, that sounds sophisticated.  --  Given the nature of our present world I have to admit this is probably what most people would think is ""normal"" -- especially for the UN ""Peace"" Keeping tactics.  I found it VERY disappointing that Sid Meier apparently either doesn't think humanity has much potential for consciousness expansion and is incapable of resolving problems in any way other than ""kick your butt"" aggression OR simply knows that most gamers prefer aggressive action game to more intellectual reasoning.  Either way it is a shame.  --  I was really hoping for a bit more sophistication and imagination here -- in line with MY ideas of what the future holds and humanity's potentials.  I did like the little bit of increased depth, but ultimately gave it up for a ""shoot 'em up"" game.  From that standpoint, I enjoyed the graphics, the development, and the possibilities in general.  But I am still disappointed that we don't call a spade a spade here -- or in other words call it as it is: just another war game.  Suite yourself.",3.0
"Overview:

  As a summary, I think Need For Speed 3: Hot Pursuit is relatively fun but it should have a lot more realism than it does.  It is low in realism especially when concerning graphics.

Cars:

  The car selection contains a good variety of driving characteristics including top speed and handling.  The cars maneuver realistically.

Locations:

  This is where I downgrade the program.  The graphics look too simple with few color shades.  All of the race tracks seem to follow the same style.  There are a lot of cool shortcuts though!

Racing Dramatics:

  The dramatics are great in the hot pursuit mode.  Otherwise the race is dull.  In the regular race modes, there is no concept of getting ahead of behind the AI players.  The AI cars never crash.  You can either get ahead and stay ahead, or fall way behind.  There are not many strategies to keep you ahead.

Pursuit Mode:

  The getaway pursuit mode is fun.  The AI police are challenging and set roadblocks as well as spike strips that flatten you tires.  You cannot work with other police in be cop mode which does not make the chase exciting enough.

Conclusion:

  For a conclusion remark, the software is acceptable.  It just is not dramatic enough at times.  It would be a game to consider buying, but I generally would suggest other games more.",3.0

"I would rate this higher than FIFA '99, but much lower than the WC98 games.  I like it better than 99 b/c I can compete at the World Class level, but doing so reveals the game's major flaws.  This game is meant to  be an action/arcade game, and is not a serious attempt at sports  simulation.  The only useful strategy I can give a player is to score  goals. If you stop attacking at all, you will regret it (for ex. I lost a  3-1 lead w/ 10 minutes to go using standard defensive strategies).  The  only good defense in this game is a good offense.  The amount of goals  scored and the distribution of goals are ludicrous. 13 games into the  Premier season, I as Leeds United have scored 47 goals, 35 of those by the  2 forwards (Huckerby, Bridges).  The gameplay awards knowledge of knowing  when to press the right button, not knowledge of football (soccer).
As  far as the announcers go, they do sound totally wrong announcing European  games (they're fine if you stick to MLS).  As bad as they are, I don't find  them as annoying as John Motson's sidekick from FIFA 99 (that guy sounded  like a parrot).  There are also key players missing from some teams  (especially in the MLS).There aren't any real stadiums in the game either.  (Those with RIVA 128/TNT graphics cards will have to download new Detonator  drivers to make the game work)
The positives about the game are the great  graphics (although the players are skinny, and the screen jumps sometimes  when the computer has to read the CD).  It has classic teams, such as Man.  United '68 and Brazil '70, that make for some fun matchups. And as  unrealistic as it is, it's fun to play.",3.0
"I have enjoyed the Kings Quest series very much, but I didn't get started until Kings 5. I got this set, but the gameplay and graphics, though a head of their time in their day, was real tough to play in this current day and age. While these all have great stories, graphically and challenging wise, Kings Quest 6 & 7 are the only 2 that are really playable now. Kings 7 is graphically very good and the story and gameplay is pretty cool. The only thing missing from this set is The Mask Of Eternity which is actually Kings Quest 8. Graphically, it's a stellar upgrade over these and the gameplay is faster paced with alot less puzzles to solve. Roberta Williams was definitley ahead of her time and I hope she continues to create these Kings Quest games(go to gamespot.com and look for an article on Roberta Williams. It was an excellent story).",3.0
"This game was alot of fun because you have to balance between military domination (whereas in other games the bigger army always wins the game) and keeping you Civilization happy and economic.  However, the actual battles loose this game alot of points. 4 Indian brave or warrior type units you can take a war walker or SAM site or fusion tank! it's just absurd.  There's no way a warrior could beat anything that advanced.  I understand the realism that was attempted here.  William Wallace proved that advanced doesn't mean best but this game takes it too far. The new Special Units are in my opinion really cool.  I keep hearing about how devastating or annoying they are but all you have to do is find them (not hard at all) and your problem is solved because this game lets you either kill them or if you want to stay out of a fight you can expel them which simply sends them home peacefully. And, you can use them to your andvantage since the computer rarely finds your units.  If you've got the cash you can incite revolutions in other cities causing them to turn on their leader and become a new civilation or join yours. So this game is fun but unrealistic so it gets 3 stars. also replay is good for a while but you soon run out of things to do and the game becomes boring.",3.0
"This game is a great attempt at making a truly innovative and unique game. Of course it's a sequel to Pa Rappa the Rapper and if you liked that first game this sequel is worth it, it adds some new features and makes for an interesting game. However that being said I found this game just too hard. I played it for about two weeks and then just gave up in frustration.
Before I start examining the game let me explain it a little since it's so different from any other game. Basically you are Jammer Lammy and you're trying to get to a concert in time to play with your band. To get there you have to play your guitar at a various set of places along the way. Each of these times you play your control paddle like it was a guitar trying to follow along with a bouncing ball like display. Of course you can improvise and change the style quite a bit and if you're music still works you should still get the same amount of points if not bonus points. If you beat a boss then you get an additional item to modify the sound of your guitar. There are also Vs. modes and Cooperative modes so you can play with a partner (either the computer or a real human).
Anyway, during the time I played the game I was able to get to the second to the last stage of the single player game and was also able to play and unlock several of the vs. stages, and I probably got around 20-30 hours of game time out of it, but it just got boring as I kept pounding my head up against the wall. My biggest complaint is that I couldn't tell why I was getting bad scores, there seemed to be almost no difference between the times I got good points and the times I got bad points, so I didn't even know how to improve.
Nonetheless this game has some great sound, and interesting graphics. The graphics are 2-dimensional but move 3-dimensionally so all of the characters look like paper cut outs. The sound is pretty good and despite having heard some of the songs dozens of times they never really started to irritate me. The control is pretty good I guess but as I mentioned above at times I couldn't understand why I was losing. Oh one final note of warning this game is very surreal there are things that simply don't make sense but it's kind of cool in a way too.
I'd recommend this game to anyone who played the first one, or anyone who likes a really challenging game. Moreover if you want to try an innovative puzzle game that is quite a bit different this is a good game to get.",3.0

"PROS:

1. difficulty mode select

2. ability to turn vibrations and subtitles on or off

3. Colorful, eyecatching visuals

CONS:

1. No tutorial

2. No save option if played on PSII

3. No Pause option (pushing select will make you start from the beginning or quit)

4. No level simple enough for younger children - notes can be quick and complex

5. Oftentimes bad music with vocalists that are too goofy or difficult to understand

I picked this up, hearing it followed along the PaRappa games. Familiar with the others, I I conquered this one - only having to do 2-3 songs twice.

At first, the songs are clear and catchy, in my opinion. But the last half really disappointed me - the lyrics became difficult to understand, and the voices were either too goofy or grainy to rely on them for help with the beat. Additionally, the songs themselves were musically displeasing and I found myself wanting to hurry up and get through a song just so it would be over.

In conclusion, I think it's a fun game for people who like the music-based style, but not anything special. Buy it used and cheap if you wanna play it - like I did.

"I bought this game with the impression that, maybe as a kid, I didn't fully understand the story or the gameplay. So, I played it again. Well, as it turns out, this game has next to zero storyline aside from one opening cutscene. And I was definitely better off not understanding the level design as a kid, because every level is just a floating platform with obstacles on it, and there's a constant annoying fear of falling off, which is definitely the least challenging way to die.
Overall, this game is kinda cool though. I don't know another game with these kind of mechanics, so it's definitely an interesting play. For a cheap price I'd say try it out.",3.0

"Vigialnte 8 would have been a fun game if it weren't for two things: Crazy Taxi and, more importantly, Grand Theft Auto. Basically you have 18 vehicles that run around trying to destroy each other--everything from a motorcycle (with sidecar) to a bus to a moon vehicle to a dump truck (and I found the dump truck to be the best). It really is a fun game, but after playing Crazy Taxi and Grand Theft Auto, it doesn't stack up. The control isn't as great nor is there any story to it. It gets boring rather quickly, but only because I've played similar games that are a lot more fun. I wouldn't go out and buy it, but if you don't have any of the better games, then I'd say keep it.

"Back when this game first came out, it was a groundbreaking effort for extreme sports video-games, most of which were, (and for the most part, still are) mediocre at best.  The tricking system was simple, and easy to learn.  The level design was the best in the genre, and the level objectives were fun.
  But that was three years ago.  Today, even for the incredibly cheap asking price I just can't recommend purchasing the original game in this series, beacuse for just a few dollars more you could do a whole lot better with any of the sequels in the series.  Provided, the latest two sequels (3 and 4) were primarily designed for next-generation consoles, but they did come out on PLaystation 1, Game Boy Advance, and dare I say, Game Boy Color, so you should be able to find the game of your choice on the platform of your choice.",3.0

But even though it can be a little challenging, the truth is, the game is just too short. The game is not enough of a challenge, there are only 30 tapes in 6 levels with three competitions, and the game takes no time to blaze through. Even though it is harder to combo, the game often gives you more points than it should. If you're just going after three gold medals, a person could beat this game with two different characters in a day. If you're going for all the tapes, it depends on the person. Maybe a day, maybe two. There isn't much depth to a lot of the gameplay, and it gets old really quick. The length of the game and how easy it is cut two stars off the game's rating. The game had more potential than the hype and what it really was, but for now, and even in the second, it's not much...",3.0
"Graphics are great but there are so many things to learn to do. Most of the time I let the computer fly the whole mission and just watch. Takes a long time to take off  (have to start each engine seperately), then a long taxi ride. It IS cool to watch the bombs hit the target. If you like a lot of technical detail, you'll like this sim.

This is in addition to my previous review. After reading the manuel and doing some pratice, I have a good grip on this sim. You can easily take any position on the bomber, or any bomber, or any plane involved in your mission. This includes the little friends or the enemy fighters. I enjoy being the bombadeir.
  It's best to let the pilot fly the ship while you do all the other tasks. Machine guns are a little difficult as the bandits fly by really fast. Men get wounded and you have to assign first aid to them by other crew members. The crew fight fires plus more. You can watch all this happen in real time. If it gets boring, you can jump to the next action. If you love the B17 as I do, you will love this sim just to get to see them flying. It is very realistic. Planes get shot down, some catch on fire, some get all shot up, the landing gear won't come down, engines quit running, men get wounded, some die. I recommend this sim very highly to any WW2 airwar buff.",3.0

"I have been waiting for this game since I first read about in mid year 2000. When I found out it was available, I rushed out to get it that same night!  First off, let me start by saying that the design, concept and graphics all rate 5 stars. This is one ambitious game!  Playing as any 1 of 10 crew positions was something I couldn't wait to try.  The graphics are something you really have to see to believe - you just better have some serious RAM and a decent video card to really appreciate it! However, there are some serious disappointments.  This game is hard. And I mean HARD.  Just trying to complete the Training Missions was so complex and difficult that I just gave up and jumped into some Historical Missions to learn as I go.  Flying is EXTREMELY difficult and the Pilot Helper Option is really no help at all.  As for learning the Norden Bombsight, Pilot Cockpit Instruments or Navigation...well, good luck. Email me if you figure it out!  I blame alot of this on the Instruction Manual which is great for historical information but very vague on how the instruments and gameplay works.  My main gripe however, is the TIME it takes to complete a mission. A single mission over Germany and back took me close to three hours. And that was with the Time Option increased to x8 most of the mission.  You will find yourself flying over France or over the ocean for hours with NOTHING to do.  I am all for a simulation but there has to be a fine line between SIMULATION and  GAMING.  My father came over to check out the game and we started a mission, watched half a football game, ate dinner and we still were not over the target area. I am hoping that once I get better at flying the airplane or learn how to work the bombsight or learn how to navigate, it will become more enjoyable.  I really want to like this game because it is such a great concept.  But I have owned it a month and still cannot fly the bomber without HEAVY computer assitance.  I would reccomend this game - but please have PLENTY of pantience and time to invest!",3.0
"This is one of the games I still play on Dreamcast. In an effort to keep the fewest amount of equipment around my tv, I decided to get the playstation version of this game.

If you've never played this game before, it's still the same fun. I can give it that. I don't want to draw any comparisons to Twisted Metal. I like both. For the price, it's worth a shot but if you still play Dreamcast, get that version instead.",3.0
"It added a little to the main game, but nothing earth shattering and the quests don't have much to do with the main plot. The quests are VERY difficult to get through and take more than a little patience and perserverence to succeed. My advice? Seek out and downloadthe unofficial add on ""Dark Side of the Sword Coast"" to suplement Baldur's Gate and this Expansion Pack instead.",3.0
"When I played Baldur's Gate, it was a wonderfully long experience of exploration and balanced encounters. If you ran into an over-powering encounter, you knew your party had ventured into the wrong place at the wrong time. This expansion is a bucket of cold water in the face. It's short, just four areas with a dozen or so levels, and brutally hard. Maybe I didn't level-up correctly in Baldur's Gate, but I found every step a struggle of high-level encounters, traps my their couldn't disarm and, worst of all, key puzzles. Additionally the expansion didn't have of the story elements of the original game. The game itself had almost no changes although there was a new auto-pause feature that was very helpful. Hard-core Baldur's Gate fan with a high-level party (10+) will love Sword Coast but other should probably skip it.",3.0
"I'm sure that this add-on was pressured by the public to be released  quickly due to the great succsess of Baldur's Gate, but at the time of  release the price tag seemed a bit high for so little substance. Other than  some new areas and quests to complete, the only redeeming quality of this  package was the experience cap being rasied a tad giving all those  dual-class humans a chance to shine.  As a nice bonus, there are some  REALLY cool new magical items that could ease the time an Import character  will have in the next installment.",3.0
"In Tales of the Sword Coast, you are taken back to the land of Baldur's gate prior to the end of the game.  You are placed in the city called Ulgoth's Beard.
Once in this city, you are immediately sent on a quest to  an ice island.  This scenario is realitively easy to complete.  Following  this completion, you can be sent on two more major missions.  The first one  sends you in search of Balduran's ship and a forgotten island.  This  scenario is intriguing due to the new enemies that are werewolves.  The  climax of this part of the game can be difficult, but has some nice game  play.
After completing this scenario, you go for the last scenario that  sends you down to Durlag's tower.  There are numerous levels found in the  tower, in which a few levels can be quite confusing.  There is excellent  images on the one level in which a skeleton of a greater wyvern surrounds  the floor.  In order to complete the tower, the party must defeat a  demonknight, which is not too simple.
Following the completion of the  tower, the party must complete one or two minor scenarios before the final  task of facing Sarovek.
Overall, this game is just a mere minor extension  of Baldur's Gate.  Yes the play can be fulfilling, but there is not enough  depth the game in order to justify the price.  In my opinion even though it  is adequate, there is no real need or desire to play this game.",3.0
"I love this game; it's the best I've played since Ultima IV. But the expansion to Baulder's Gate is rather undeveloped. I think they should've put more plot to it.

"I played the game years ago on the original Playstation. Now the only console I have that can play this game is the N64, so I bought this game online. It would not play at all. I would try to replace it or get my money back, but I'm unsure how.",3.0
"I own both Vigilante 8 and its sequel, Vigilante 8: Second Offense. I like them both. They're my favorites out of all my N64 games. But there were annoying faults in the second game.
 Namely the excessive amounts of water. Constantly one finds themselves sinking under and being transported to inconvienent areas of the level.
 But the most aggravting thing by far was the fact that one had to pick up objects during the missions. Which wouldn't be bad at all if they didn't take up one of your only three weapon slots. For those of you who have never played the game, you can only carry three weapons at a time. But during every mission, one has to pick up briefcases, toolboxes, bombs, or gas tanks that take one of your weapon slots. Meaning you only get to attack with an aresenal of two weapons. This is very inadvantageous if you happen to have nothing but a miner layer and a flamethrower, easily the crappiest weapons in the game. It also makes it more difficult to guard your special weapon from being thrown off when you accidently run into another weapon. Which is even more infuriating if you happen to accidently run into the priorly mentioned weapons.
Yet, despite it's faults, Vigilante 8: Second Offense did have some improvements over its predecessor.
 In this new version, you can pick up Salvage points which will add new accesories to the cars such as antennaes and spoilers and the like. And if you get 100 of each of the four types of salvage you get a completely new chassis. The game also features 18 vehicles, five more than the prior.
So, if they had left out all the water and given you an extra weapon slot, the game would've been a respectful sequel indeed.",3.0
"didn't like the game in general. i'm sure this is a good game for others, but im didn't like it",3.0
"First off, I must say that I feel both Fallout 1 and 2 are great games. Second, I must also say that the download version of Fallout 1 worked perfectly for me. Third, I agree that the product review is for the product itself (i.e. gameplay, fun-factor, and etc.). However, I think in this instance it is fair of me to include the functionality of the downloadable content in the review as I did end up paying more for the download version ($9.99) versus buying the CD-ROM hard copy version ($4.99) only to have the downloaded software not function properly.

Even though the game crashes for me, I like it so much that I continued  to play.  This is a fantastic, post-nuclear-apocalyptic RPG! Like other reviews have mentioned, the first Fallout revitalized a stagnant RPG genre populated with run-of-the-mill games. The Fallout series really set itself apart from the rest of the pack in more ways than one and inspired many future great games (and great game designers). Make sure you play Fallout 1 before Fallout 2 in order to fully appreciate and understand the story line.

This RPG is turn based during combat and requires some tactics. It also requires some patience to wait your turn, though it isn't long. Sometimes it can be frustrating, especially if you are used to first person shooters, real time strategies or fast action RPGs like Diablo II.

The Fallout series is unique because of it's gritty feel. Like a Mad Max wasteland with even more seedy characters with a plethora of gun runners, drug cartels, and whore houses. There is an interesting blend of wild west meets futuristic fantasy/sci-fi.

I can't speak for everyone who has downloaded Fallout 2 from Amazon, but for me the download version randomly crashes during game play, which is very frustrating if you forget to save your progress regularly! Furthermore, Amazon has a no refund policy for downloadable content. I can understand why they would not want to give any refunds for the content, because someone could just download the game and then say it doesn't work. Then they get their money back and keep the game. But what if the content does not function properly? I am sure this is an area of concern for both Amazon and its customers.

It is great to have on-demand content at our fingertips and had this downloaded version of Fallout 2 worked correctly I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars. As I stated before the download version of Fallout 1 worked without any problems for me, but for some reason Fallout 2 does not. Perhaps Amazon can look into the matter to make sure the software downloads, installs and runs correctly for its customers.",3.0
The graphics are not very good and it is easy to complete. Toy Story on PS3 is alot better. But it is a fun game to play.,3.0
"Toy Story 2 for the PC was one of the first video games I ever played, and one I grew up with and loved as a kid. Lacking a decent PC, I chose to pick up the PS version instead for nostalgia's sake, and in most regards I see relatively little difference between the two versions. Toy Story 2 is a 3D platformer game in which you play as Buzz Lightyear as he sets out to rescue Woody in the events of the movie, and more or less runs parallel to the events of the film, visiting familiar venues like Andy's House and Al's Toy Barn while introducing some new locales such as Al's Space Land and Andy's neighborhood. Platforming mechanics are solid if not as fluid as I remembered them, combined with decent graphics for the Playstation, and gameplay is varied with the gradual addition of new environmental challenges and powerups that allow for new means of exploration and combat. Although only comprised of 10 levels and 5 discrete boss, the levels are fairly substantial, and new powerups encourage you to revisit previous areas to find secrets you missed. Nonetheless, the game will start to get a bit repetitive by the finals levels while rarely offering any decent challenge; the level bosses and minibosses in particular are some of the easiest I have seen in any game to date, usually involving blasting away with your laser in their general direction while mashing the spin attack to deflect attacks, and are almost always defeated within a minute or two. Emperor Zurg in particular was so laughably easy compared to my original memories that I will never view him the same if I rewatch the film.

The main problem with the game, one which chronically ruins the enjoyment, is the terrible camera mechanics. Rather than locking the camera behind Buzz rigidly or using the right directional pad to control it freely, the game either keeps the camera in place and then realigns to follow Buzz a couple seconds after he stops moving or allows control through the shoulder buttons. Neither option allows for vertical adjustment, making platforming needlessly challenging and leading to a lot of frustrating falls. Both options work poorly in practice, as the active camera cannot adjust on the move as you are battling faster enemies and the passive camera moves far too slowly to be useful, and in both cases the camera routinely gets hung up on terrain or decides to suddenly change it movement if Buzz turns in certain ways.

If you are a fan of Toy Story or have a kid that is, and are a relatively casual gamer, then this is a game for you. If you or your kid are a more serious gamer though, then it will be hard to enjoy the game's charm in light of its gameplay flaws.",3.0
"My almost 5-year-old and I got hooked playing Spyro 3 earlier this month. We've been playing endlessly. To take a little break we tried out Toy Story 2. What a disappointment. I don't think the graphics are that great, unless you're comparing them to a Super Nintendo. And the games are MUCH harder to play. We couldn't figure out what we were supposed to do in some rooms, and the skill required to complete most of the tasks is just beyond my youngster and I.
My other complaint would be with the help/instructions on-screen. In Spyro, the characters read aloud the messages as they appear on the screen. This means he can play the game by himself. But because he can't read, he can't get help or hints on-screen.
While he does seem to like it because of the characters, he just can't play it by himself, and his frustration level is pretty high with this one. Not to sound like a broken record, but if you've got a younger child, try Spyro 3 (or 2 or 1).",3.0

"I adore cinematic adventure games with real people to talk to instead of polygon models and real locations to explore, and that's exactly what Black  Dahlia was.  It was a real hoot to play with some great puzzles and  interesting people to meet.
Although there was a certain level of gore  involved, Black Dahlia takes place in a unique time period and has some  interesting twists that I'd not seen in other adventure games.  You start  out, innocently enough, exploring a potential Nazi originization and soon  fond your case growing larger and larger as you delve deeper and deeper  into it.
The game has a certain atmosphere to it that was really neat to  wade through.  At one moment I might be hobnobbing in a secret nightclub  and rubbing elbows with Elliot Ness and another moment I could be dodging  traps in an ancient germanic crypt with poison dart traps and treasures to  discover.  Although the game was very linear (I could not progress until I  had done a certain thing in a certain order)it still held my  attention.
But halfway through the game the mystery aspect was lost and  it became more of a horror movie.  I won't give away the ending, but when  It was all over I felt frustrated and somewhat betrayed by the fact that a  lot of the 'evil' things that happen in the game I was relatively helpless  to stop.  The people who were predetermined to die I could not save.  By  the end of everything it seemed as though I was the only person left, and  all my friends were gone.  Even my satisfaction of thwarting the evil  baddie was taken from me as the 'hero' left in shame.
But not everyone  demands a perfectly happy ending, and some folks like their grit.  I still  will not deny that this was a very well done game even if it wasn't up to  my tastes.",3.0
"I'm relatively new to the computer gaming world, and picked this up while looking for something to get me past the sorrow of finishing Riven.  As a crime fiction writer and reader, I thought the plot was reasonably  well-designed and interesting.  I confess to cheating on some of the  puzzles, usually because I was in a hurry to see what happened next.  There's a pretty good mix of harder and easier puzzles, and the best fit  neatly into the plotline.  There are a number of easier puzzles, however,  that don't really serve to advance the plot.  I found this only mildly  annoying, though, because most were out of my way pretty quickly.  The  graphics are great, very ""immersible,"" and even the acting isn't  bad.  (There are some entertaining easter eggs here and there that enliven  the main character's role.)  The villain is satisfyingly vile, and acted  with disturbing enthusiasm.  In short, I enjoyed the whole thing up to the  end, which I found predictable and somewhat disappointing.  Nonetheless,  I'd definitely recommend Dahlia, because even though I found the end  unsurprising I wouldn't have missed the villain's endgame bloodthirsty  exuberance for anything.",3.0
"Toy Story is a game that you play for fifteen minutes and then get bored of it.  The graphics are o.k. and the sound effects are all right.  But kids that loved the movie will adore this game.  You meet up with other characters from the movie some of which give you advice, others ask you for help.  It's the same idea as Mario, you collect coins and fight bosses at the end of the level.  But instead of getting stars you get pizza planet tokens which are used for video games at pizza planet, a pizza restaurant.  Sometimes you must move things to climb up on boxes or tables. I rate this game a three out of five stars because it could have had a better plot but still was a sucess.",3.0
"Pros
Huge levels to explore
Decent graphics for a console game released in 1999
Very hard to die. Health doesn't deplenish very much when hit, so it's decent for kids.

Cons
Terrible camera angles
Hard to judge jump distances. Lots of falling and having to climb up to the jump again.
Short game but sometimes confusing puzzles.

All around mediocre game. Young kids probably couldn't beat it, but they would enjoy jumping around exploring the environment. My 4 year old loves to just walk around and shoot at things. When I was young this game was like the kids version of Grand Theft Auto. Buy it for the young ones.",3.0

"I play Diablo 2 a lot, and someone recommended this game.  There are some similarities, but many differences.

I have probably put 25 hours in on the game, and I am still in Chapter 2.  Maybe I just need more experience at the game, but so far it is frustrating.  You kind of have to fly by the seat of your pants.",3.0

"Baldur's Gate has the personal distinction of being the very first computer game I owned, and at the time it was simply amazing. It's aged fairly well in the six years since then, and I still play it sometimes. Of course, it can't compete with recent games in terms of graphics and sound...but what true RPG gamer cares about those more than story and character, eh? In these areas BG is still among the best, seven years after its release. I would recommend it for fans of Dungeons and Dragons and fantasy in general, though if all you're looking for is 3-D wonderment, you may want to try something newer.

Gameplay: Very good. The interface is smooth and easy to learn. The game is from 1999, so the graphics are of course not very ""advanced"" by today's standards, but they are beautiful nonetheless, each map area having been painstakingly painted in 2-D. The sound is good, especially the environmental background sounds (rain, snow, wind, wildlife, the chattering of city crowds, etc.), which really make you feel as if you're ""in"" the game, especially when wearing headphones. The voice acting is mainly limited to NPC dialogue, dream sequences, and chapter introductions, and while it's very good, it gets a little repetitive after a while (I quickly got tired of hearing ""wife's been gettin' prickly on me arse"" and the like whenever I'd speak to random people in the towns, for instance).

The interpersonal relationships between party members are one of the game's best features; they will bicker, banter, flirt, and occasionally brawl with one another. How you act in the game, and which particular NPCs you have in your party will affect how other NPCs react to you. I will say though, that you can't really play the game as an evil character, regardless of which alignment you select during character creation; you're more or less forced to take a good, ""heroic"" route through the game, and acting too evil will eventually make it impossible for you to finish the game. Overall, however, BG is very fun to play. There are a myriad of subquests to keep your interest up, and the main storyline, though somewhat linear, is engaging and always leaves you wondering what will happen next.

There are some things I didn't like about the gameplay. The AI of party members leaves a lot to be desired, for example: either the AI is turned on and the party members will attack enemies immediately on sight (which is quite a hassle when your characters are invisible or hiding in shadows), or it's turned off and you have to do everything manually. I found the ""custom"" AI scripts available to be next to useless and pathfinding (especially in dungeon areas) was oftentimes terrible. The wilderness areas between towns were another sticking point. I know that random encounters out in the wild are one of core elements of most role-playing, but after the fifth or sixth time I had a level 1 party get wiped out by gibberlings in the first or second wilderness area, I got very frustrated. The experience cap was also something I'd rather not have seen.

Technical Issues: Some. I've had two separate copies of BG installed, both on my old Compaq, running on a 350 MHz processor with 32 MB of RAM (later upgraded to 96 MB). The first install went smoothly. The second, over a year later, did not, and required four separate attempts before it was successful. I was unable to install the game to my second physical hard drive, and had to use the first drive (older, slower, and smaller). After installation, the game would sometimes crash for no apparent reason, especially when several magic spells were being cast simultaneously onscreen. When my party was fighting more than about five enemies at once, the game would occasionally slow to an absolute crawl and the animation became choppy and jerky; if this lasted for more than a few minutes, the game was almost certain to crash. This happened even after I installed an additional 64 MB of RAM (and I note that it's never happened with Baldur's Gate II, which is installed on the very same system), but it was an inconsistent problem. There were also a few instances of the game crashing at key points in the story (such as the beginning of the final battle), forcing a restart. Though these issues did not prevent me from enjoying the game, they were annoying enough for me to rate it 3 out of 5 stars overall.

All in all, Baldur's Gate is an excellent game. The story is deep and involving, the party system is a joy to explore, and the sound and graphics (though outdated by today's standards) are wonderful for a game that was released in 1999. If not for the minor gameplay issues and annoying technical problems, it would rate a 5 out of 5.",3.0
"I had VERY high hopes when I ordered this game due to a number of the reviews that I read.  However, after installing and playing the game, I was somewhat let down and I find that I'm not excited about continuing the adventure.  Don't get me wrong this is a fun game but in light of todays advanced graphics, sound and storylines, this game just seems a little outdated.
I found a very frustrating aspect to the game seems to happen when encountering a new creature.  At the initial encounter, I was hardly able to do any damage and I would usually be killed very quickly.  However, after restoring from a previous save point, then attacking the same monster....I would prevail without an extremely difficult fight.  This seemed to happen over and over again.
Anyway, here is my rundown of the pros and cons.
Pros:
-The game is huge and will take a lot of time to solve.
-Character creation and development has depth.
-Large number of magical items.
-Seems to follow the D&D rules closely.
-Adventuring decisions impact future interactions and character moods.
Cons:
-Character level progression is slow!
-The game is extremely hard even on the easiest setting.
-The numerous restores from save points gets old fast!
-Small inventory for each character requiring you to leave numerous items in dungeons or in the wilderness.
-Accumulating gold for weapons, armor and health potions is very difficult in the beginning.
To me, this game is like a bad movie that you continue to watch in the hopes that things will get better.  However, just like the movie, things have not gotten any better and I'm now a little frustrated.  Although I have had some fun playing, I was not able to become imersed in the story and I will probably stop playing.  If you enjoy challenges, you might like this game more than I do.",3.0
"The case and manual are in great condition. The game is not. It lags sometimes and sometimes the screen gets pixalated. I wasn't really expecting much for a $15 game in ""acceptable"" condition but for the pixalating screen I'm giving 3 stars.",3.0
"Baldurs Gate is an entertaining game, but a great one?  No way.  It has too many major flaws to be a great game.
1.  The AI of the characters that you control is quite possibly the worst AI in the history of computer games.  The characters can't move more than an inch on the screen without getting out of the marching order.  The path making functions for the characters to go from point A to point B is pathetic!!!  Sometimes characters will wander around the screen aimlessly, or get stuck in a corner when you need them somewhere.  This tends to get your characters severely injured or killed.  It is a major annoyance.  This game is designed to run in real-time, with the ability to pause, but because of the terrible AI, you find yourself pausing the game every two seconds to micromanage your characters.  So much for real-time combat.  Turn-based would have been better.
2.  This game has scores of encounters that swiftly slaughter your party with no chance whatsoever of you surviving the first encounter.  The only way to get past these points is to reload your previous save game, which you will find yourself doing more than a thousand times.  After you reload, you cast a bunch of spells to make your characters more powerful, and redo the encounter.  After trying enough times, you win.  What is the problem with that, you ask?  It is pointless to use your wits to better prepare yourself for the unexpected, because the unexpected will easily wipe you out, and you can then reload anyway.  It's almost like ""cheating"".  Where's the challenge in that?
3.  The game is pretty stingy with experience points.  50-60 hours of gameplay only moves you up about 5 or 6 levels.
4.  The inventory system gets annoying.  Not enough slots, and a gemstone takes up as much space as a suit of armor. (Supposedly, this has been taken care of in BG2).
On the upside, the combat is fun when things go your way, especially the visual and sound effects created by the spells (I always wanted to know what an exploding fireball looks like).  Also, I thought that the plot of the game was very good.  The game has a lot of quests and sidequests, which make it nicely nonlinear.
Baldurs Gate is a fun game, but it's too tedious to be a great one.",3.0
"Baldur's Gate has a terrific real time engine, where you get to see everything from what weapon or item your character is wielding to the unique spell effect an image is using. Except for a few bugs easily fixed by a patch, the game's engine is exquisite, and provides the best electronic RPG system that I've seen.
The only flaw for me is the fact that the game is essentially a hackfest. While an epic and intriguing plot is included, the real villain spends most of his time hiding behind his lackeys to the point where, despite a brief appearance at the beginning, you go through 100 hours of dungeons and monsters just to speak to him. There is almost no dialogue or character interaction, and the final few battles turn out to be an exercise in how many monsters you can summon rather than an opportunity to utilize real strategies.
While the combats are entertaining to a point, I prefer more story-intensive games such as Final Fantasy or Planescape: Torment. But at the same time, this game does provide an excellent setup for it's sequel, and Baldur's Gate II improves on everything the original does wrong. If you like combat, or if you want to get the whole saga, you will want to pick up Baldur's Gate.",3.0
"While the game is a great deal of fun. The reason I rated it only 3 stars is that the packaging is so terrible, the disks are often damaged. It is packaged in a poorly designed cardboard contraption with lots of rubber cement. It falls apart in storage and shipping, so you end up getting disks covered in goo that is impossible to remove. I had to ship mine back. I went out and got it at a local store, made them open the package and check for goo damage. Sure enough, they had to open 4 (!) before they finally found one that was intact and clean. Great game, poor package design. Buy it, but buy it in a store so you can be sure you get a set of clean disks. Save yourself the dissapointment.  It seems to be only this, the first Baldur's Gate that has the trouble. We have all the others and they are wonderful in every way.",3.0
"Although Baldur's Gate was great years ago Ice Wind Dale, with almost no new innovations, shows its age. That doesn't mean it's a bad game. However, it feels dated, and it's obvious that BI Studios was hoping BG fans would continue to look past its GUI shortcomings in favor of authentic AD&D rules and a good storyline (ala PS:Torment). The fact that the average rating is high means that it worked.
Gameplay can best be described as Baldur's Gate on Fast Forward. Although the storyline is interesting (ala Salvatore), it is so linear that there is almost no room for really ""living"" in this world at all. Players will remember that starting up BG on a daily basis begged the question of ""where should I go today?"". Not so in IWD. You are directed to proceed step-by-step through the game from one goal to the next.
The overall hack-n-slash feeling of IWD will appeal to different players. Personally, I lost interest in the hundreds of dialogues involved in PS:T and was eager to play a BI game that didn't force me to spend hours and hours reading text. At the same time, with today's technology, one would expect that the little dialogue that is present should be voiced-over. But it isn't. Although the cut-scenes are well done, the meat of the game feels quite archaic.
Overall, IWD gameplay is very similar in many ways to BG. Although BI tried to fix the pathing, it is still poor -- albeit better than BG ever was. There are more spells, and more levels. But again, the inability to really ""live"" in IWD makes leveling higher rather a moot point. It just allows you to finish the game. Money is rather worthless since there is no thriving economy.
All in all, I'd have to say nothing ""jumps out"" at you in this game to make it special. It feels like a stop-gap between BG and BG2.
Graphics, although well done are disappointing for the simple fact that 640x320 resolution is just ridiculously low for this day and age.  Thankfully Heart of Winter fixes this problem, but even 800x600 is too low.
The 2D graphics are a bit clunky on my PII450/Geforece system. I had this same problem with Planescape. How is it that I can run a complex FPS 3D game at 50FPS, and run some isometric 2D program that bogs at 20FPS when 15 objects are on the screen? It's just proof that BI's graphics engine is way out of date -- even though they keep trying to improve its effects to cover up how old it seems.
Ambient sound is very good, as in all BI products.
Sound tracks are excellent.",3.0

"Castlevania is a darkly digital adventure into the Gothic world of the Dracula legend.

 There's the ubiquitous Vampire Hunter, this one's name is ""Richter Belmont"", a 23 - year old mortal hunting the Lord of The Undead, estimated to be over 400 years old.

 Richter's 17-year old girlfriend, ""Maria Renard"" goes looking for him, & is, of course, captured by Count Vlad Tepes Dracula {sic}; so she ends up presenting an additional problem / obstacle for Richter.

 These magnificent creatures so easily beaten by inexperienced & pathetic mortals? Please.

 Obviously, the philosphical theme is that of the ""Good vs. Evil"" simplicity, but remember, it is just a game, after all. There are some idealistic disturbances, such as werewolves being slaughtered, & of course, there's no real choice of actually being Dracula Himself, or a demon, for that matter, but the player does get an opportunity to battle, & even kill them.

 Alucard, Dracula's confused & ingrate son, is an option, however, he has the same type of mentality besetting 'Nick Knight'; that is to say, unappreciative of the magnificent being he is, & the Dark Gift bestowal.

'Death' {Thanatos} makes a special appearance, giving Alucard a dire warning, & ends up making off with his weapons... he he he.....

 After some brief scathing philosophical arguementation, in which the Dracula character makes a rather good point, the battle begins, amidst the triumphant & haunting strains of an organ.

 Castlevania comes off as being a 'cross' between a movie & a videogame.

 Castlevania contains magnificent scenery, & some pretty damned good music.

 One major warning: Watch out for Demons!",3.0
"I loved this game a lot.. i mean a lot. It was, by far, my favorite game i ever played. Until i beat it like 3 times and made about 20 different teams, i figured out how this game works. first off, i'll explain the obvious. You can choose from 6 races (Human, Elf, Half-Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling). the you choose from 8 classes (Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Mage, Cleric, Druid, Theif, Bard). Then from 6 attribute points (Strangth, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma), to further make your character more personalized. Problem is, theres only 3 good races (Human, Dwarf, Halfling), about 3 good classes (Fighter, Mage, Theif), and only certain races are good with certain classes( Huamns are good at Fighter, Mage: Dwarves are only good at fighters, and Halflings are only good at Theives), so that just destroyed most of the customizing. The other clsses are pretty much worthless, as they are vastly inferior to the three main classes. The races other than those three have disadvantages that greatly outweigh their advantages. Items are also poorly made, as many items are clearly better than others, even at the same price, it was like the makers decided to put trick questions in the game, it almost makes you think your being put in a test, because if you read the entire description about the waepon, you can clearly see they are much better than other weapons that are alike. the puzzles made in here could have been put together by a person with no imagination, as 99% of all the puzzles area as follows, ""I got robbed (or lost) this item right over there. Can you get it for me?"" Everybody it seems, can't keep track of anything, one person asks you to get his boots back, because he dropped them! There is very little originality to this game, because the characters you meet are very much the same in all aspects. You can create a team of up to 6 people if you know how to work multiplayer, just make a game, and make all your allies computer, that way you get to control all 6 people, and you get to make them all! But soon enough, you'll find out, like i did, that theres a very strict teams you have to create if you want to win. Theres like 3 variations of a team that you should make to win, or else you'll lose very quickly. I won't spoil the fun out of finding the right combo of race/class, but its a very easy choice once you see how the game works.

"Baldur's Gate is the best AD&D game to come around in a while, but it drove me absolutely insane for the first few hours.  Why?  Because in the beginning, there are quite a few people who want you dead...including a few  powerful (at least at THAT point) wizards.  At low levels, a guy can walk  up to you, say ""Okay, I'm going to kill you now,"" and quite  suddenly knock you out in 1-2 hits.  After a while though, you'll get into  it.  Man, you have to watch yourself in this game, because there is are  deceptive people in *every town!*  Lots of characters walk up to you asking  for help, and end up being villains!  To wrap it up, it's a keeper.  (especially the bundled version w/the expansion pack) but don't get  discouraged at the beginning, because that's the hardest part.  Once you  get by that, you'll have a good game with lots of side quests and  longitivity.",3.0
"Baldur's Gate has got all the eye candy you'd look for in a modern computer role-playing game.  And it's also got a fairly intriguing storyline, which is something you don't see too often on the desktop.  With  enough horsepower in your system, the game plays pretty well and after  applying a patch from Interplay's web site, doesn't crash too often  either.
So what's the problem?
It all depends on your past role playing  experience and your expectations.  Baldur's Gate reproduces the AD&D  ruleset surprisingly well.  But it also reproduces the feel of most  AD&D gaming sessions in that there's way too much combat.
Now, if  your AD&D experience is primarily from the premade modules from TSR,  then you'll love Baldur's Gate.  My own AD&D experience deemphasized  combat and focused on character interaction and acting.  My dungeon master  would routinely lie to me and my fellow players as we unravelled intriguing  and sometimes epic plots.  We formed attachments to the NPCs presented to  us, and would sometimes be on the verge of tears as the dungeon master  struck them down before our characters' eyes.  Our greatest experience  point rewards would come from playing our roles well, complete with  accents, facial expressions, and emotions.
The computerized dungeon  master that controls Baldur's Gate cannot come close to that experience:  sure, the story twists and turns, but the random encounter of 2D4+2 kobalds  ruins the flow, and the AI won't appreciate you role-playing your heart  out.
That's not to say that if you don't like combat you won't be able to  finish the game.  You can, if you use the cheat code to summon one or two  of the Driz'zt characters, who will happily slash their way through any  obstacle.  That's distracting, but I did get through the story, and it was  a pretty good story in the end.",3.0
"...but not as good as all the hype.  I found the combat very irritating, as far as controlling all the characters.  I spent half the game hitting the pause key.

Nobody to blame but myself - the game is a re-buy for a copy that was stolen a couple of years ago - and tetris games are hard to find.  BUT... next time I'll be more careful where I click.

"Kingpin...where should I start?  The main highpoint of this game is the impressive and funny songs by Cypress Hill that were made exclusively for this game.  Aside from all the profanity and blood and gore, this game is  ok but not one of the best games from Interplay.  This game is basically  your Quake mod that has a story and some additional features added to it.  However it is funny to see the reactions of people in the game when you  pull a gun on them.  If you are up for lines and lines of profanity, tons  of blood and gore and missions that require you bounce heads with some big  boys, then this game is for you!  The only drawback is the long load times  so make sure your computer chair is comfy.",3.0
"In Kingpin you start out as a guy just like everybody else, but then you get this ""reputation"" as this bad [guy], who doesn't take [anything]from anybody and is basically unstoppable. There are alot of good, and BAD things about this game, and this will deffinetly be the review you need to look at because I like the game more than I dislike the game, or vise versa.
The Pros for the game are: The graphics are Great in some aspects (people, explosions, fire, and sometimes surroundings),
also realisticness plays a big part in the game at some points, for instance, the blood, the blowing off of limbs, it's not like those other games where you shoot someone in the face 50 times with a bazooka and bleed a little! The language is also GREAT, most people think that the language is ""terrible"" or cursing is way overused but if you think that then you shouldn't even have bought a game like this! I mean what do you expect? This is a game, where people almost ALWAYS have a gun. Live in the WORST area of anyplace that I have ever seen and have box's at the best as homes. So I really doubt the people in kingpin are going to care about their language! I also seen someone complain about how long it takes to reload the shotgun, that is bullcrap, it is almost the exact same speed of realoading a real shotgun! Another thing is, the enemys have to reload! Thats right!! When they run out of ammo you can blast them and they can't do anything about it! The lighting is also good in the game! When you shoot a gun liek the tommygun it will definetly light up the room! It's also great to be able to hire people or ""thugs"", which basically only help you kill people or unlock doors or safes! There asre also diffrent gangs in kingpin! You can spot them by their attire. The Sewer rats, the scorps, the dragons, and the jokers. You later in the game even get a chance to join the Jokers! which all have a joker head tattooed on their arm. The cons of the game are, first of all, like another review said on here. What the Box of kingpin says is a COMPLETE LIE!!!! First of all it says, Recruit a gang of thugs, LOL, NO, you can have up to 2, yes 2!!! thugs at one time, if you try to hire any more then they'll say something along the lines of ""sorry, i can't run with ya"" or ""you gotta make room for me"", the box also says about what the thugs do, and it says something about them hanging back to guard your turf, what turf???!!!! You have no area of your own, you rarely ever go back to a spot you've visited before in kinpin! So if you tell them the stay put then you'll never see them again! It Also says, shoot a snitch in the knee caps, there are no snitches, and if you shoot anyone in the kneecaps, your going to catch a cap in the face and lose 60 health! It also says shoot an enemy with a single head shot and watch them bleed! No again, in the later levels of the game it is EXTREMLY hard to kill people you can sometimes go up to an enemy at point blank range and shoot them in the face with a shotgun and they will just shoot you back! Another thing, enemys don't ever acutally bleed! They just have red marks. Another completely moronic thing about this game is that the RATS can hurt you!!! They can set there and bite you and take off 1 point of health each time they bite you! thats just dumb! Another thing about the enemy is they sometime are just stupid, they'll set there and run around in circles until you kill them, even if they have a gun! And that is kingpin, thats a long review but it is basically everything about the game!",3.0
"I bought this game under the impression that it was something of a gangster simulator. Call me dense, but that's what I thought. (Well, don't.) The packaging reads along the lines of 'Hire your own gang and tell them what to do.' It also mentions shooting informants in the kneecap to punish them. This is made up out of whole cloth, because nowhere does this occur. I was expecting to start off low then move into my own office, hiring new members, conducting gang wars, somewhat like Gangsters 2 but in 3D. This isn't the case. The blurb on the box gives the impression that you have far more control over your environment than you do.",3.0
"Despite my liking for gore and profanity, this game leaves for something... I would say gameplay value. When I first started playing it, I enjoyed the nice Quake 2 based engine and the 3D Audio, but it quickly got me saying, ""Why am I playing this?""
I understand the plot clearly, you want to become the Boss (the Kingpin) and you have to fight through gangs and other obstacles to get there. These obstacles include ridiculous missions of running back of and forth doing favors. Such as giving a bum some whiskey to get a combination safe number. I thought if a game has a Mature rating slapped onto it, it might as well have some Mature thinking puzzles...
The profanity is something that probably turns away most audiences, because most of the gamers are young and probably need parental admission to get games. To me, the profanity is interesting to hear, not annoying or disturbing. I have never seen a game so daring to use so much violence (until Soldier of Fortune) and profanity.
All in all, I would suggest anyone who likes graphic violence in gang-related environments and non-stop profanity.",3.0
"Overall, we have enjoyed the game a great deal, but don't think it lives up to all the hype.  The personalized board feature only applies to the board and not to the deeds, making it confusing.  And the 3D graphics and sound effects slow the game, while the simpler graphics are not easy to see.  For the money, it's a good deal and I've enjoyed it a lot but I would advise people not to expect more than a fun game.",3.0
The game is ok. The graphics is great.  I really wanted the orginal Monoply but brought this by mistake.  I always put first timer buyer for the computer setting but always seemed to lose.,3.0
"I happen to like playing Monopoly. But when you play this game against the computer opponents, you are in for a strange ride. The computer opponents will mortgage all their properties to fund a monopoly they may have just gotten. Then it would take forever for the computer player to buy houses and hotels.
The computer players hardly ever trade among themselves. After playing the game a few times, I got to where I knew how the computer would react.
I also found that I enjoyed playing the game a lot more when I turned off the token voices and Mr Monopoly's commentary.
Still, this game is a good way to knock off a couple of hours. The rules are pretty basic, and straightforward.
Overall, I would recommend getting this game, as long as you're not expecting too much.",3.0
"To sum it up, this game was a major dissapointment.  The interface was dumbed down to the point of being retarded compared to the original.  The unit AI was a joke, unit would go through lava at times and destroy  themselves to get to you.  And as for originality, well why did they borrow  units from Dark Reign?  The assault tanks, the missile tank? Come on guys!  The original game is in my opinion, the best game ever made (and never  played to boot, sadly) but it was and is great even now.  This games good  points ie strafing AI, cool backgrounds and more involved unit design are  not enough to make up for the bad points, ie high system requirements,  poor, short storyline, dumb AI, etc.  But what I consider the worst crime  is that they took a very useful interface and ruined it.  In the original  you had to assign units to the F keys but now it is done for you, you can't  take them off and you can't mix units on a key, you also can't build if  they are all used up either.  And you can no longer run your base from  other ares like in the original.  There is no defend command when you are  away.  I could go on but enough already.  If you want to play the real BZ2  then get the Red odyssey expansion pack, it is well done.  I played the  original for 6 months straight, but this coaster was not even on my hard  drive a week before it was gone.  Good Hunting!",3.0
"Do not buy this game unless you have AT LEAST 350mz or more. The stated ""minimum requirements"" of 200mhz is nothing more than Activision's way of getting at your wallet. In one of the final levels of  the game, a system of 200mhz will not even be capable of completing the  mission. 350mz should get you through the game with all details off and  resolution at the lowest.
I recommend you have a system of 450mhz or  higher for satisfactory gaming. Anything less and some of the single player  missions' low frame rates could get on your nerves.
If you have an AMD  CPU (in the 300-400 range), you should probably stay away. The marketing  folks over at Activision neglected to tell AMD owners up front that the  game was optimized for Intel processors and that AMD chips may present  buggy and slow games. You have to dig into the readme before you see that  little surprise (so if you're going to try BZ2 anyway, make sure you get it  from a place you can get a refund from).
Also, if you're looking for  Internet play, make sure you have at least a cable modem or DSL connection.  As with Heavy Gear 2, the claim that the game can play online  satisfactorily on the required 28.8 connection is a woeful mistake.
The  game itself is fun and definately above average. I would have given the  game 5 stars if it had strong multiplayer support, but in this area, BZ2 is  about average. So 4 stars for that. Still fun, decent sound and music,  unique gameplay. 3 stars for the folks who are marketing the game.
if  you're looking for a game with cooperative multiplayer support, where you  and a buddy can take on the enemy AI together, look elsewhere. While most  Real Time Strategy games support the feature, BZ2 left this out.
Be sure  to check out the Pandemic website, message board, and BZ2 newsgroups for  more customer reviews!",3.0
"When I reached the fourth level on this game I have to say I did get stuck on what to do next. Fortunately I did get a ""walk-through"" off the Internet and that helped me advance to the ""Sun Creature"" stage (level 14?). Here's where the game itself stalled on me. My ship faced and retreated from the sun creature in accordance with the walk-through I was following (after all it helped me this far). Anyway, after my retreat I waited for a communication from the nearby planet as to how to stop the creature, but it never came (I waited a long time). I eventually gave up (I have a life). This game does need its players to get a patch, but it didn't do me anymore help. It would seem that someone did get further in the game than me or I wouldn't have a walk-through to refer to. I just can't recommend this game to anyone in good conscience. It would be a 5 star game -- IF IT JUST WORKED. The new motto for software development across the board: Quality Counts. So make sure to test it thoroughly before you package it.",3.0
"Railroad Tycoon II is a real time strategy game by Poptop software with complex interactions, interesting graphics and lots of thinking. The gameplay reminds me of Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon, In which you play a tycoon who control the trains, buses, planes and ships in the tycoon world. In RRT2 you play as the railroad baron and control the train transportation, Buy and sell stocks, set the train routes, lay the railway tracks, stations and take over companies. There are lots of real life trains and cities. The gameplay is quite good, It takes a while to learn to play and be good at it. RRT2's graphics are very good, The towns are very beautifully desinged, There are lots of beautiful terrain and real looking buildings, The world looks real, with rivers, forests, snow and hilly mountains. RRT2's screnario's are also very well desinged and a lot fun to play, It also comes with a screnario editor for you to create your own screnario's. Railroad Tycoon II has got a clumsy interface, It is very hard to lay the tracks with the mouse. There are other annoying factors like, You don't get enough money, It's hard to manage things when you have a lot of trains and stations, You need to pay a lot of attention at the stock market to make money ect. Railroad Tycoon II is a very good game but quite hard to play. If you like this game get Transport Tycoon, It is more intresting, lot more fun and quite easy compared to this.",3.0

sorry for gramatical errors, guys",3.0
"Let me start by saying that in general, I really enjoyed this game.  I played through all the missions a couple of times, and some were downright challenging.  I only give it three stars, though, because of several key factors.
The main drawback is that the AI is weak, in my opinion.  The bad guys don't react particularly well when you start sniping their buddies.  Rather, most of them tend to assume threatening postures but otherwise just stand around waiting to join the ranks of the worm feeders.  Others will run around a bit and shout, but there is no real method to their madness.  Again, they tend to be easy pickings.
Related to the weak AI is the fact that the bad guys are rather poor marksmen.  My typical tactic playing through many missions was to find a suitable vantage point from which to engage at long range, reasonably confident that the return fire would be pretty inaccurate and not particularly threatening.  Of course, if you start getting into closer quarters, their aim tends to improve just a bit.
The bad AI also applies to fellow team members.  Alpha and Charlie teams (2 men each) were very poor about trying to be stealthy, and were won't to charge in with guns blazing only to find themselves promptly deposited in body bags.  The net result is that the player (the one-man Bravo team) has to fulfill most mission requirements on his own.
I also disliked the fact that the bad guys were a little to easy to kill.  Simply grazing one on the foot is enough for a KIA.  This tends to cut both ways though, because the good guys also die with only one or at most two hits.  On a related note, bullets don't penetrate soft objects like tents (but thankfully do break windows).  Just a tad unrealistic.
On the plus side, the vast terrain areas allow a great freedom of movement and maneuver.  Although there are preprogrammed mission plans for each level, the player is free to disregard them and ""ad lib"" as much as desired.  This permits a fairly high degree of replayability.
I thought the graphics were decent but not great.  The ""night vision"" effects are fairly neat, if not entirely realistic.  The selection of weapons is not huge, but appropriate.  The player's arsenal does not resemble that of a typical ""shooter,"" but is still generous, consisting of a knife, sidearm, main armament (usually a rifle or machine gun), grenades, laser designator, and maybe a demo charge or LAW.
Although there are plenty of mission levels, each with its own imaginative story line, they all tend to feel the same during play.  They all involve single-handedly (after you teammates get themselves wasted) killing several dozen terrorists, and occasionally rescuing a hostage, destroying a convoy, knocking out a radar site, etc.
Overall, this is an enjoyable game, and one which I will probably play again in the future.  It's not all it could be, for the reasons described above... thus the sequels, which I will review separately.",3.0
Very fun game but the camera angles often make it really tough to play...as in you'll often need to shoot blind or hide and get the camera situated so you can see what you're doing before running into battle.,3.0
"I used to own this game but after I beat it and played the multiplayer modes with some friends, I sold it to get some money. It made its debut on the Nintendo 64 back in 1998. Though its take on modern warfare was based on a battle between tan plastic soldiers and green plastic soldiers (with a funny background story), Army Men: Sarge's Heroes was a Doom/Duke Nukem clone that had its moments but ended up being a mediocre gaming experience.

In this game, you control Sarge, leader of the green plastic army battling against the tan plastic army and its leader, Plastro. Plastro wants to take over the world and kidnaps one of Sarge's friends, luring him and his army into combat spilling out into human world stages. So yes you'll embark on a tour of various human backdrops, overcoming the enemy tan army and obstacles. Everything builds up to the final stage where you face off against Plastro in a bathroom, complete with working toilet and bath tub.

The game allows up to customize your control setup and after each completed stage, it will prompt you to save. Doing so will keep your progress as the stages are pretty long. Since it's a army game, you use all kinds of standard weapons: machine guns, grenades, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, etc. If you take damage, pick up health kits scattered throughout the stages. But if you take too much damage, you'll die and will have to start the stage over again. When you want to take a break from the story mode, you can hit the multi player mode with 3 friends and shoot it out.

The PROS: You can see the charm of two dueling plastic armies fighting it out in real world stages just like little boys who grew up playing with plastic army soldiers and this game pretty much captures it well. The cutscenes detail what's happening so it's easy to get into. The sounds and effects are standard in an army combat game. It will keep you busy and the multi player modes are fun to play with your friends as all of the weapons from the story mode are available to use. The game takes advantage of the expansion RAM pack to pump out more effects. It's not required so it's a matter of whether you have it or not.

The CONS: The graphics are pretty damn ugly by today's standards and back then, it barely cut it. There were other games that pumped out better graphics so get ready to see pix-elation, glitches and the occasional hit/miss detection of weapons. The expansion RAM pack, while somewhat bumps up the resolution, isn't used to its full potential as there is little difference from using it and not using it. Those looking for a challenge will find it here but in the way of not seeing enemy fire, jumping off or falling off from high ledges mean certain death and dealing with the somewhat stiff, robotic feeling controls of your character. Also, the camera sometimes gets a little wonky so you have to always make sure its in your line of vision. Once you're done with the story mode, that's it...no bonus content or unlocking of extra features at all. At least, the multi player mode adds some re playability.

While it's fun to play for awhile, there were better shooters available at that time for the N64. The plastic army theme set atop in the human world is pretty cool so there is some fun to be had with this game. But that fun doesn't last long and you may be frustrated with its lack of polished graphics, uneven game play and controls that take some getting used to. Get it cheap if you must, but you'd be better off with Army Men titles that were released later on in the N64's lifespan.",3.0
"This game was OK.  The spells were good and the weapon enhancements were a pretty cool idea.  While it was possible to do different moves with the shield and weapons to make combos of a sort, it ended up being easier to just block the enemies' 2 attacks and attack, block and attack.  It is very repetitive.
Perhaps I've been spoiled with RPG games lately, but the character interaction in this game seemed so limited that it brought the entire game down.  The entire game was very small and I got through it in about 3 sittings.  The best thing going for the game was the voice acting.  The storyline was limited by the very small character interaction.  Also, I couldn't help feeling like I was playing a bad version of Soul Reaver the whole time.  That, or a mediocre clone of King's Field, which was mediocre in its own right.
If you find this for cheap, it may be worth it, but don't be expecting amazing graphics and sound.",3.0

"Looking at some of the other reviews here that knock this game because of its difficulty makes me a bit mad. I found the game to be hard (the briefcase mission took me dozens of attempts) but this is what makes the game last - I still go back to it occasionally, looking for new ways to get the president home safe.
Try getting to the gas station on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge, or getting back to the hideout in China Town, playing ""Survival"" if you want impossible.

By 2003 standards this is basic on graphics, all the roads are straight-line and the game fairly linear, but it still holds its own against its modern counterparts, and can be fun, and a challenge. Bouncing around those steep ""Bullett"" streets in San Franscico, or trying to get to the Hospital on a rainy LA night can still get the pulse racing and the palms sweaty!",3.0

"Driver is a good game, but with some annoying flaws. I will compare it directly with Midtown Madness, because the two games are very similar. Driver takes place in four generally blocky cities. MidMad takes places in  a beautifully drawn Chicago. The car in driver handles exactly as you would  hope, being realistic and incredibly satisfying - think cop chases from the  movies. The handling in MidMad is its biggest let down - think radio  control cars. The format in driver is also a little annoying - sure it has  adrenaline pumping thrills, but if you crash your car even once, then the  chances are your game will soon be over. It is frustrating that the cops  can so easily catch you and inflict more damage on you after you've  crashed. In MidMad, crashing is the most satisfying bit, it puts a grin on  your face from ear to ear and keeps you coming back for more. You don't get  that in driver. If only they could combine the two games utilising the  realistic car physics from driver and the many different locations and add  in the beautifully detailed scenary and car crashing fun of Midtown  Madness, they'd have one helluva game.",3.0

"I had never played this game before I bought it (2011), so I didn't really know what to expect besides that all of the reviews I've read are horrible.  I bought it because I am building up an N64 collection and have always been a big South Park fan, but there have been so few games.  For this reason, I was pretty pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with it.
  The game is set up like a mix between Mario Party and Jeopardy. You can pick 1-4 players. Each player has to buzz in and then answer a question. Some of the questions are about South Park specifics and others are general knowledge or things that practically no one would know. After the questions you go into mini-games, which there are a good number of (for an N64 party game) and which are all actually pretty fun. I even got my wife in on this, who is not a fan of 64 or SP, and we had a great time playing it.
  The graphics are about the same of any N64 games of this time period, think along the lines of the SP FPS game. The Audio, both character voices and music I found to be great and humorous. Controls could be better because you don't really use the analog stick, but didn't take away from the game. Remember, as with  most N64 games, the replay value is not going to be all that high, especially with the types of games out now. If you're looking for the ultimate party game, Mario Party 8 or Kinect Dance Central is probably a better bet, but if you want some nostalgia and a fun South Park game, this will do it for you.",3.0
"Unnecessary but entertaining exploitation of the ubiquitous South Park license, the game show format is good for an hour or two of mindless trivial pursuit.

"I'll start this off by saying that this controller is not as durable as you might like. Gone are the days of the NES and Atari 2600 when you could throw your controllers at the wall whenever you suffered a cheap death. However, it is a decent controller. Official Saturn controllers are difficult to find due to the Saturn having been out of business for over 10 years. This one is a fine choice if you cannot get your hands on one. 3D controllers, however, may be better suited for certain games.

I won't turn this into a review about the Saturn itself and all its great games, but if you have a craving for some NiGHTS or Virtua Cop, this controller will get you there. One thing to know about this one, though: make sure you have the ""Auto-Fire"" switch off or the A, B, C, X, Y, and Z buttons will keep firing as long as you are pressing them. Good for shooting games in some contexts, but it was very frustrating when I tried to play ""Tetris Plus.""",3.0
"These recently arrived at my door. Eager to pop them in, I dove right in. The buttons are excellent, they do not stick and they work great. The cord is long.

"I recently purchased a Sega Saturn from a seller on Amazon, and I ordered this controller (NEW) to go along with it.  I'm not sure whether there is an issue with the controller itself or with the controller port on the system.  Basically, sometimes the ""start"" button will not work, sometimes it is the only button that will work, and sometimes nothing works.  There are two flip switches on the controller, and when I flip them, it often switches which buttons happen to be functional (although the flip switches do not do what they are supposed to do).  Jiggling the connection has no effect.  This leads me to believe that the controller, much like many third-party hardware items (e.g., memory cards and controllers), is inherently defective (i.e., in my experience, third party memory cards tend to have glitches that erase saved data and third party controllers tend to work just fine until one day they randomly stop functioning properly).  The Saturn was supported from 1995-1998, so many third party items have been sitting around for at least 13 years.  I would probably stick with original Sega products in the future.",3.0

"I, like many other Imperialism II owners, was brought to the series by the original Imperialism, which, undoubtedly, remains one of my favorite games. However, I do not think the sequel lives up to its predecessor. The second game got rid of some of the most amusing parts of the original. For example, the Industry screen in Imperialism II is bland and uninteresting, and, in my opinion, the addition of emplacerd artillery to the game, however realistic, took away from the enjoyability of playing by making it a little too hard to take land early in the game. And what happened to the wonderful scenarios? The second game, even with its change of setting, is too like the original in my opinion. Granted, designing a game sequel that combines the best of the original while also adding new ideas is hard, but from the team that created Imperialism, it is expected.",3.0

"This is an odd mixed bag.  You have, on one hand, an honest-to-God intriguing story, with original characters and above-average voice-overs.  You got side-quests, hidden treasures, and deep background folklore...  Everything to please those who like a good book.  The graphics are good, except I would have preferred more animation frames on some characters...  Oh well...
Then you have the battles.  This is where the pain starts.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the real-time/turn-based hybrid battle system from the Final Fantasy series, with the added depth of having characters ""build-up"" three levels of power with time.  Like Final Fantasy, battles build up your characters' stats, to prepare for that ultimate final battle against the big boss.  Unlike Final Fantasy, the battles aren't that much fun.  The creature types are more or less the same, with minor color variations.  And you don't feel compelled to fight in the first place.  You don't want to fight; you just want to continue with the adventure...
The only thing that (may) push you forward is the top-class story.  The Story is what drives this game through, just like a good book.  Want to turn to the next page?  Well, must fight about 20 creatures 20 times to know what happens next.
This is the problem (for me at least).  An excellent story matched with a boring battle system make the final product a game of patience.  Recommend you download the demo first!  If you feel that you can enjoy this game based on the demo, by all means, buy-it!  If you are more of the impatient type, well either buy this game and download cracks or cheats, or look elsewhere.
This game would have been a better adventure game than an RPG.",3.0
"First off, let me start by saying that I more prefer games like Zork, Myst/Riven, and Monkey Island. While, to some, that may make me an ""inferior"" game player, I think it's all a matter of taste. I also love Final Fantasy, but I honestly think it's just too slow paced and I lose interest in it quickly, but still love playing it.
That said... I'm rather ambiguous on this one. It has the world-roaming capabilities of FF, yet lacks any real unpredictability. The gameplay itself is all linear; there's only one way to go, or so it seems. The world's small size lends itself to being a more compact game, but even that gets old after a while. I found myself growing bored with, as another player noticed, having to kill monsters again and again whenever I went through the same area.
BUT....
There's just something about games where the dialogue is spoken. :) There are also subtitles to read if for whatever reason you like it that way. The movies were good, if few and far between, and I really like the characters. The story is also a really great one; I honestly picked it up just because it seemed so cool! The gameplay itself is easy to learn, which is good as I tend to have a very limited attention span, but the pace of the game itself... well, there were times when I was desperately searching around for what I'm supposed to do to trigger the next part of the game and get eaten up by monsters because it took so long. Royally sucks.
On a whole, I think it's a good game, but mostly if you're big into RPGs like FFVII. It's got an expansive world, I think, but the linear gameplay isn't for everyone. I suppose it *could* merit four stars, but I don't think it's for everyone, so if you're with me on your game choices I'd wait until this was in the sales rack before picking it up.",3.0
"I don't understand why so many reviewers are saying that they were having problems running the game on xp...........it runs fine for me......the game was ok,I thought the graphics could have been better and I don't like the idea that if you fail the mission you have to start it over(no realism in that)I would wait for the price to drop before buying it!...........",3.0
"The gameplay and the puzzles are just fine, if a bit confusing (but hey, if I understood everything right away, it would be too easy.)  The graphics are a bit disappointing (compared to Riven and Myst 3: Exile.)  The worst thing about the game is the poor acting (especially the obviously fake accents) of the people you come in contact with.  The characters are shallow, unrealistic, and stereotypical.
However, this is a game you play for the puzzles, and the puzzles are fun.  Moving around the manipulating things is easy, which is a real plus.  Overall, I recommend this game if you can get it at a good price (i.e., it's a fun game and worth your money, but not a must-play like Riven.)",3.0
"This game is very easy.  Only one ""puzzle"" was even remotely challenging, and this means that it took me about an hour to retrace my steps and find the object I was looking for.  The graphics ARE beautiful  and other game designers would be smart to use in their games the QuickTime  VR technology that is found in #3 -- this makes it seem more realistic.  However, I found this game very limited and a bit boring.  I found myself  often wanting more; the ""world"" seemed too small and limited.  The characters had no personality, nor did they do anything other than  their 1 given task and ""talking"" with you. The best game in the  series is #2, and it is VERY good.  In fact, it is one of the best games in  this genre that I've ever played, although I really enjoyed Full Throttle  and Curse of Monkey Island (Lucas Arts).  #2 is VERY hard, but the  ""walkthrough"" mode that comes with the game is entertaining.",3.0
I wanted a WW2 U-boat simulation game ever since the old commodore 64 version of SILENT SERVICE came out. This game is a perfect version of that simulation/product...However I must agree that I'm sad because not enough time and money went into the production values. The main menus DO LOOK like something a child would draw and might have come from an old commodore 64...But still it is worth having as I see no other WW2 U-boat sim out there.,3.0
"I've enjoyed sub simming since first playing ""Sub Hunt"" on my Intellivision and have bought practically every sub sim since. Needless to say, I've highly anticipated Silent Hunter 2's release since I first heard of it 2 years ago. (Honestly, it's been so long I can't remember exactly when it was first announced.) Release dates were pushed forward so many times I can only assume that the game had severe production and finance problems. Well, it's finally here and it seems obvious that the extra time taken in releasing the product was not spent on improving the program. I wanted so much to really love this game. I feel for the small teams of software developers that don't have the big $$$ that companies like Microsoft do and I like to support them in their efforts with my purchases - but this program lacks some key elements and took way to long to arrive.

  The graphics, or lack thereof, betray the game's age. I was hoping for a look comparable to ""Sea Dogs"", but no such luck. The highest resolution the game supports is 800x600, and on a 17"" monitor that just doesn't cut it. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the title screens are poorly done, as well. The sim does have wave and sky effects along with decent 3d models, but they just don't match up to the graphics of today's games. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are much better than the original Silent Hunter and there simply aren't any other WW2 submarine simulations on the market to compare, but after 2 years of waiting, I expected more.
  Aside from the graphics, the game has two other GLARING flaws: no multiplayer available yet and no free-roving campaign. I guess the folks at Ubi soft figured we wouldn't need multiplayer yet, since their upcoming destroyer sim (meant to be played with Silent Hunter 2) won't be out for a couple of months. They're promising a patch, but this is still an obviously incomplete product. The game also comes with predisigned missions that can be edited, but I loved the option in previous sims to spend the whole war roaming freely around the ocean, looking for prey. The lack of this limits the sim big time, in my eyes.
  On the positive side, the sim, itself, is acutally pretty good. I thought the overall AI was impressive and enemy destroyers were none to easy to evade. The sound room (something I hadn't seen in a sub sim before.) added an eerie touch of realism. For dedicated sub simmers, you'll find all the bells and whistles of earlier sims, including advanced realism settings to let you control as much or as little as you want. The waves and weather do add an extra layer of variability that has been lacking in sub sims until now. The subpar graphics also have a positive side as far as performance on lower-end machines is concerned and the game has been very stable on my computer, so far.

  The bottom line is, beggars can't be choosers and, as Silent Hunter 2 is the only WW2 sub sim to come out in a LONG time, we sub lovers can't be too picky. I guess the market simply isn't out there to encourage companies to do a top-notch job on a submarine simulation, so SH2 will have to do.",3.0
"Ok, maybe not despair.
Total Annihilation was one of the first Real Time Strategy (RTS) games to use a true 3D environment.  It looks and plays wonderfully!  There's a lot of variety to units and the game can be truly  engrossing.  The strength to TA, however, is in multiplayer in human vs.  human combat.
The single player campaign in the game is adequate but  not compelling -- the story line is just enough to make playing the game  seem worthwhile without really getting you to buy into it and suspend your  disbelief.  Unfortunately this lackluster storyline is hampered by an  Artificial Intelligence (AI) that's really none too bright.  Once you learn  how to use a couple key units and buildings the computer simply has no  ability to be a serious threat.  Heaven forbid you should try multiplayer  cooperative against the AI... you'll be disappointed.
Overall, it's a  decent game but if you're not the type of person to match witch against  other people, then you may want to consider another RTS title with a  stronger AI.",3.0

"This is basically a point-and-click game with various puzzles to figure out; even the plotting itself is a puzzle to be put together to progress.  That is where my primary complaint with the game comes into full bloom.  The character(s) you control always move at a slow walk(there really isn't anything to run away from) and this is so annoying, especially if you have to walk from one side of an area(town, village, etc.) to another just to exchange information or gather an item only to return to the previous location.  One area made me laugh at one point because I had to once more ""walk!"" through an entire Aztec village just to gather the lineage information for six fallen warriors.  I broke out my pen and paper and subsequently got my virtual excercise.  But that is not the only moment in this game that I threw my hands in the air.  Another is in a small town.  The character(s) are able to pick up and use items they find in rooms, along the way, etc.  I am going to ruin this part of the game because it was utterly ridiculous.  I was ""walking!"" all over town clicking in vain, trying desperately to find any sort of an answer to the state of limbo I was in, when I suddenly picked up a rock.  A rock!  There are rocks all over that bloody town!  However, there is a lot here worth mentioning in glowing terms.  The places are all interesting and filled with unnerving characters.  There are many blood-filled chambers with defiled remains and maniacal behavior from the gruesome denizens that inhabit this game. There are multiple characters to be controlled, even if, in the end, they are essentially one character battling with his dementia.  That plot-line is revealed at the start of the game, so don't be mad at me for unveiling it now.  The mechanisms that have to be deciphered or puzzled over are all excellent as far as graphics and level of difficulty.  They are not so hard as to cause violent head-shaking, yet not so easy as to allow any random clicking to unravel them.  Overall, for a decent price, I can see many enjoying this game and ""walking!"" through the various areas patiently looking for clues...and ""rocks!""  If you have a lot of time to burn then this is your game.  The fact that you can save the game at any point is also a large plus.  Take it easy.",3.0
"Sanitarium is not a bad game considering it was written in 1997.  Most of the puzzles, however, are a bit too predictable for experienced adventure gamers...everything you need is at any given location.

Still, it's a good start for those just starting into the realm of adventure games...",3.0
"You've read the synopsis so I won't repeat it.  Some of the places you get to visit are amazing, filled with interesting challenges.

This averages to 3 stars, though I'd still recommend the game at this price!",3.0
"I can't really see what the appeal of this game would be when you could just buy Civilization II. Yet again Microsoft steals someone else's idea and doesn't carry it off very well. The mac version is a pretty horrible  port, and doesn't follow Mac user interface conventions at all. The mouse  cursor gets stuck now and then, too. Laying out the empire isn't nearly as  interesting as in Civ. The warfare aspects are OK, although the defender  gets such a big advantage that wars tend to be inconclusive unless one side  just wasn't prepared. I guess some people might like the real-time format  better than the turn-based format of Civ, but personally I just find that  half the time I'm bored because nothing's going on and the other half of  the time too much is going on at once and I get messed up.",3.0

"What can really be said besides the fact that its South Park, its racing, and its crazy.  The controls aren't the best or most responsive in this game.  And it's more than a little annoying that you can't just choose any map when playing multiplayer and playing a map in multiplayer does not unlock any further maps.  My guess is you have to unlock them in the single player campaign.  More than anything else its clearly a game that someone didn't lose any sleep over (even while working to make it) and was put out there to cash in on the South Park franchise.  But if you're a die-hard video game person and you have a jones for the South Park gang to somehow be involved then this game is worth the handful of dollar bills.",3.0
"I bought this game because I really loved playing TA (Total Annihilation).  The user supplied maps and units for TA really made for a lot of variety, and I thought the graphics were cool.  TA Kingdoms seemed really slow (as in not very interactive).  The graphics were OK, but they seemed like a downgrade from the really crisp models they used in TA.  It was annoying to have the computer fire at me from far off screen where I knew he could not see my units (this was a problem in TA too, but less of one, in my opinion).  The setting for TA Kingdoms sounded exciting, but it seemed like the different Kingdoms had a very set way of doing things and once you figured it out you were all set.
Overall, I thought this was a pretty boring game.  Go for TA instead.",3.0
"This is probably closer to 3 and a half beuse of a few nice features, such as the loading screen is a stained glass that fills in. But the actual game has a really easy campain and really hard skirmish. There are may different units for each different player.

If  you've never read the series you will probably love the game - well  designed engine and the best graphics I have seen.  I, however, was  disappointed.",3.0
"Ok, forget the game in style, play, and everything else. This is based on the WoT!!! and they made it an FPS!!! ?????  This should have been made into a diablo style game at the minimum, and now that we have World of Warcraft, there is a much better comparison to what the game should have been based on. Most people are not going to find that they enjoyed the books, and therefore enjoyed the game. Its too... not like the books. Unlike the sucessful Jedi Knight Series, that we all loved as an FPS, (First person shooter) -because thats what you do in star wars blow stuff up and run around real fast using flash force powers- The WoT needs to be an RPG or an MMORPG. We want long game play, big plot, closely tied to the storyline. If your coming at this as an FPS to play enjoy. If your coming at this as a WoT game, run.",3.0
"The game was fairly tiresome most of the time. I suppose there were a few gripping moments, but the storyline was rather poor. The Magic system was good, and there were some cool moments like being able to levitate your enemies over your head and throw them off the tower wall. But there were problems with the AI and the monster men looked stupid. The game featured a group of witches that really should have been Holy Sisters, by the way they acted. What's with today's world? God forbid anyone have a chaste Nun as a heroine. No, instead we must have witch-sisters. The artwork wasn't bad, I'll give that to the game-makers. But this game overall doesnt come close to the excellent work done on something like Arx Fatalis. Better to save your money and get that instead.",3.0
"Being a big Wot fan, I couldn't wait for this game came out. But I only had a 386 PC! Then I got a much better PC, which left me with nearly nothing moneywise. Or I simply couldn't find the game. So I downloaded the demo--as one person said here, the demo is a horrible representation of the game, I'll take their word for it. But from what I did play, I was most impressed at first, playing it often, then there was a several-month period when I didn't play that game at all. The architecture is FANTASTIC in this game. Not exactly how I visualized it in the books, but pretty close. Multiplayer is Okay, but not great. The battle system, I think, is kinda clunky. When you need a certain ter-angreal right NOW it's hard to get to it without accidentally skipping over it. There isn't much of a variety of bad guys from what I've seen. Where's the Draghkar? Myrddraal? Darkhounds? Gray Men? etc. The atmosphere is nice in this game, though. Very dark at times. I'll probably still buy this game--hence the 3 stars. But if you want my real opinion, I feel that Robert Jordan's Wot series should be made by SQUARESOFT (the company that makes the Final Fantasy series). Squaresoft has EXPERIENCE with RPG's and if anyone could do justice to RJ's masterpiece, Squaresoft can. Like many of you have said, there isn't much of a quest element in this game. Anyway, I don't know about you, but I'm going to e-mail Squaresoft now and see if I can convince them to make something that will be what this game should have been.",3.0
"The developers of this game figured they had a combination that couldn't miss:  A game in the wildly popular First Person Shooter genre, with a tie-in to one of the best-selling series currently on the SciFi / Fantasy  racks.  Instead of strengthening each other, the collision of these two  design philosophies produces something that isn't entirely satisfying to  either fan demographic.  While there are plenty of good points to this  game, that constant core conflict is all too apparent.
I'm not normally a  FPS player, but I used to think I was a decent one.  After playing the  first bit of this game, I had a rather rude awakening:  this game is  *hard*.  Especially for reflexes used to Civ and Icewind Dale!  Being stuck  on the shores of the Manetherendrelle (the very first level), torn apart by  a combination of missile and melee attacks coming from the dark, dark  shadows, was not precisely my idea of a grand time.  This is the first game  where I've had to reach for the cheat codes on the very first level.
Fortunately, the pangs of conscience were quickly forgotten in my  appreciation for the graphics.  This is one of the most beautiful games I  have ever played.  WoT sets a new standard for FPS games; future entries  will be expected to have equally high-calibre artists on the staff instead  of simply coders with some latent skill.  Unfortunately, you still have to  deal with your opponents.  That's a nuisance, and kind of pointless, what  with god-mode on and all.
The puzzles are interesting, if a bit more  basic than old-school adventure gamers are used to.
As a fan of the WoT  series of books, the plotline was a treat.  It's simple enough, and made  clear enough by the various cutscenes, that non-readers should be able to  catch on very quickly too.  I'm don't think Jordan wrote it himself, and  I'm sure it's not part of the ""canonical"" plotline, but it  admirably serves its purpose as a framework for the game.
I didn't play  the multiplayer version, as I saw little point in matching my skill against  people who could actually *beat* this game.  The demonstration in the  tutorial looked like fun, though, and I understand that those who do play  multiplayer think it's great.
If you're an FPS god *and* a WoT fan, this  game is a must-have... give it a whirl and  you won't be disappointed.",3.0
"While I enjoyed the game (and it is a good game) I have to downgrade the  game because it became apparent to me that it was not finished. As I  approached the end of the game bugs started to appear and there was a level  which I could not save without crashing. When I reported this I got the  stock 'Known Bug' response, and I do not think it was ever fixed. After  completing the game I was extremely disappointed in the ending. Understand,  this is a game which had used some fantastic cutscenes to keep the gameplay  moving along, so when I got to the end I expected something that would  satisfactorily wrap up the hours spent completing this game. But you get  nothing. The game just ends and you get credits--no closure to the story,  nothing. I hate to be a spoiler but how can you spoil something that  doesn't exist? This was one of the worst endings to a game ever, and left  me considerably disappointed. In retrospect I realized that the beginning  and middle parts of the game had been fleshed out and well crafted while  the ending felt tacked on and it is apparent the game was rushed to market.  I enjoyed the game, but feel the lack of care on the decision to cut short  the development to get it to the shelf was a terrible business decision and  is a detriment to the overall appeal of the game.",3.0
"I waited a long time to write this review.  Please read on and you will understand.  Having owned a computer for many years, and owned many computer games, I realize that sometimes you just have to work through some bugs in the system.  Having said that, I have been working through an issue with my total annihalation game that should only occur on a used disc.  Disc 2 for no apparent reason will simply go into an error mode which states that windows has encountered an error and needs to shut down.  Because I'm patient I have tried to work through this up to and including taking it to my local video store and having them work on it.  Their conclusion was, whoever owned it before me had something happen to it in their computer and it cannot be fixed.  If you have read this far then you are probably getting my point.  If it had been new as it was advertised it would never have been in anyone elses computer.

Now as for the game itself, well if it works it is really fun.  You get to build a society of battling robots with the sole purpose of eradicating the other robot society.  The levels get increasingly difficult as you encounter such thing as meteor storms.  By the way they get really annoying.  You just get your defenses built the way you want and boom! meteor shower knocks them out.  I don't particularly like these levels.  The levels late in the game are full of action.  For you experienced gamers, play it at the more difficult level if you want a complete onslaught of bad guys to descend upon you.

The game itself does a good job of mixing land battles with sea and air battles, so if it is just a matter of rating the game content and game style, I would give it really high marks.  But beware buyers, there are sellers out there that are without a doubt misrepresenting what they are selling.  Just as a side note, I am going to admit I should have packaged this back up and sent it back.  But I thought this was going to be a simple fix.  As it turns out it cannot be fixed.  Thanks for reading.",3.0
"The game worked. However, if you let the opening sequence play, it would inevitably get stuck. You had to skip ahead to the main menu.

"This game can get very hard at times but like any good game of chess it takes strategic planning in order to win. You have 6 characters in the game and each has their own skill. The purpose is to use  each man together with  their skills to achieve your mission. The game is tough but it is also time  consuming as well as fun. The game is based during WWII in which your men  go in Nazi camps and  sabotage, rescue, kidnap, assassinate, etc. This game  is not for everyone especially for those who  get easily frustrated, it  takes patience and planning to win. I recommend playing a downloaded demo  to see how you like it before actually buying  it. The price has reduced so  i would recommend buying one now or wait as they might combine the two  commando titles in one to resell.",3.0
"The ""fun"" rating here means the overall emotional effect of the game. There are some pretty genius and breakthrough things in this game i.e. the radio and the flashlight, the atmospheric effects achieved with the fog and darkness and switching between the real world and the altered world. One of the most impressive effects is where you are running from monsters in the dark with your weak flashlight while the shadow of what's chasing you can barely be seen behind. They did a h-ll of a job with the creepy level design and sound effects, very scary, but it's also a negative just because looking at rust colored bloody rooms and listening to hums and whistles is unpleasant. I also found the circle motif used in boss fights to be pretty genius. Some issues: The pace is stalled right from the start with a tedious key finding quest, this could take hours if you search manually, I got frustrated after 30 minutes and looked at an online walkthrough. That really becomes a problem with the game, all the locked doors and barely being able to see where you are going, it isn't fun. This was my first vague impression of the flawed game play, it's really a lot like Fester's Quest for the NES: it's gray, empty, you navigate repetitive looking areas, and swarms of hopping things are out to kill you. The story in outline is good, and has a clear goal that keeps things moving forward, basically ""save Cheryl"", but the scipt ranges from adequate, to boring, down to mst3k type badness like something from ""The Touch of Satan"". The camera can be a problem, and it's easy to get spun around and moving in the wrong direction when everything looks too similar. The puzzles on the last level feel too contrived, ""there's a key but I can't reach it because a piece of glass is in the way"", why not shoot the glass?",3.0
"Okay, after reading all of these crazy awesome reviews of this game, and being a huge fan of Silent Hill 2, I bought this game from here for $40.  And boy, was I disappointed.  Lets list the good and the bad

Pros:

Impressive graphics, considering it's a playstation 1 game

Great Music by Akira Yamaoka

Amazing Camera angles (especially during the opening run down the hallway type thing)

Fun to play

Good atmosphere.

Cons:
Not fun at all in the daytime, so you have to wait until night to enjoy it at it's fullest

The atmosphere is NOT backed up WHATSOEVER!!  This was my biggest gripe about the game!  Stuff like resident evil and dino crisis have less of a crazy atmosphere, but what atmosphere they do have is backed up by the sudden and unexpected appearance of enemies, and the extreme difficulty of killing the enemies.  Plus, with a lack of ammo, you're usually panicking.  Silent Hill has great atmosphere, but plenty enough ammo to kill the generally weak monsters that are found throughout the levels, and most of them are slow and don't do much damage to you, therefore they don't pose much of a threat.  Silent Hill 2 had Pyramid Head, and at some points I actually was too scared to continue on with the game on the fear that he might show up and slaughter me.  Silent Hill has absolutely nothing to back up this atmosphere, and if you can get past the disturbing look of things, and realise that there is nothing making the scary noises, you're just walking around a deserted area that has the lights out, some monsters, and creepy music.  What's so scary about that?  Nothing.  And when there are an abundance of enemies, it's not scary, it's just annoying, because if you can't pick them off one by one then you're overwhelmed and you die.

Like I said above, absence of enemies makes the game far too easy, but too many enemies makes the game too hard.

They should have had your character have crashed on the outskirts of town and had you walk to town in the middle of the night.  That would have been scarier, and better than just appearing in the town.

The alternate dimension is overused.  This problem was fixed in silent hill 2 though, and was executed perfectly

After my list of the good and the bad, you tell me what you think.  I wasn't scared playing this game (maybe made nervous a few times, but never terrified like I was playing the sequel).  It's definately a good game, but terribly overrated, and you can tell it's their first effort at the genre.

In all, being the silent hill fan I am (I own the first 2 games and origins, have seen the movie(which sucked, btw), and plan on buying the third and fourth titles when I have the money) I'm glad I bought this game, but It's not as good as the hype leads you to believe.",3.0
"I am sorry to have to give this game only 3 stars but......I do find it frustrating to play the character who has to endlessly walk in a thick fog while searching for his child.

  At first it's a bit spooky but it quickly becomes a pain. I guess the character would agree!

  I did like the features of the human characters and I managed to be pretty good using the gun although I have read otherwise from some folks.

  The game seems a bit slow playing out and confusing. Again, I am sure the characters are ""feeling"" the same way.

  I would recommend this game to people with lots of patience and who like the idea of not seeing clearly more than 12 feet ahead of the character. Also you need to have lots of time to spend on this game.

  My idea of a good older game is Resident Evil:Director's Cut. It's something special!

  thanks,",3.0
"Silent Hill - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- Considered classic to many hardcore ""survival horror"" gamers

- Was sort of considered too scary to play in its time, for some gamers

- A complex story, with twists and turns

- travel two different worlds, this one and a demon one

BAD:

- Graphics look pretty dated; fog is not graphically very pleasing

- Voice acting can be bad at times

- Controls feel dated

"Well I finally bought this game after hearing so many stories of how people catch ""scare attacks"" and what-not and not for nothing... I was totally! let down... I've played Fatal Frame and found that game to be down-right terrifying, and was hoping to get the same feel with silent hill, but nope... not at all...

Maybe it's because I'v ebeen spoiled by Fatal Frame? or maybe I should have played it when it was first! released... but I actually found this game to be kinda cute... lol. Following the monsters in the dark when they can't see you is funny, and beating them in the back of the head with a pipe when they're not looking is even funnier.

Some! things that seemed errie were the camera angles, the music and some voices that you hear. The darkness factor is alright but that radio? ugh... the worst! attempt to a creepy sounding radio noise... The puzzles were ok, and the monsters?... zombie dogs and flying bat things aren't scary... I'll finish playing the game hoping to be scared to the point were I scream like I did with Fatal Frame, although I don't think it'll happen. An ok game to add to a collection, just so you can tell who-ever was scared of this game that they need something more to scream about. :)",3.0

"As the world awaits the next installation in Capcom's flagship Resident Evil series, Konami has stepped forth with Silent Hill, a horror concoction all their own. Instead of merely riding onto the gaming scene on RE's coattails, Silent Hill strikes out into bold new territory and clearly distinguishes Konami as a continued force to be reckoned with in the videogame world.
Once you plop in the game, you're treated to a seemingly peaceful CG intro showing young widower, Harry Mason, on a tranquil late night drive with his seven-year-old daughter, Cheryl. The pair speed down the highway on their way to an aging resort town known as Silent Hill. But somewhere along the way, their trip is cut short as a young girl appears in the middle of the road, captured in the headlights of Harry's jeep. As Harry attempts to avoid hitting the girl, his car spins violently out of control and the world blurs. As Harry regains consciousness in the driver's seat of his wrecked car, he turns to check on his daughter only to find that she's missing. Where did she go? Welcome to Silent Hill, an adventure masterfully crafted by the use of sound, sight and even touch. Played mainly like an adventure game and not an action title, Silent Hill neatly sidesteps any obvious aping of the RE series by taking a more literary turn into the world of horror. With an emphasis on character and storyline, Silent Hill prefers to appeal to gamer's imagination by limiting their vision to a small range of light surrounded by inpenetrable darkness or by jarring any grasp of reality that the gamer might have on what exactly is going on in the game. In fact it's the storyline's refusal to adhere to a formulaic premise, with Harry confronting apparitions, chasing down demons and puzzling over diabolic visions, that makes the game so incredibly unique. Chills and shivers aside, Silent Hill is one strange trip into nightmares left untouched by the more action-oriented gameplay of Resident Evil. The most important factor of the game's immersive qualities ranges from Konami's depiction of Harry as a regular guy with whom gamers can identify with to the excellent use of ambient sounds to catch players offguard in their most vulnerable moments. Harry's plain appearance translates seamlessly into how he actually plays through the game. His aim is awful and his running pace, though quicker than most enemies, still keeps him only a heartbeat away from being mowed down by the demons running amok on the streets of Silent Hill. In fact, because of the limited amount of ammunition available in the game and Harry's inexperience with firearms, you'll find yourself evading enemies more often than confronting them. And this is one of the finest features in the game. Not only does this strengthen the adventure element in Silent Hill, but it also draws the player into the world of the game by mixing in enough realism into the madness. On top of this feature in the game, Silent Hill also refuses to ease up on the game in regards to atmosphere and mood. Backed by an ambient soundtrack, the game features some masterful effects that are sure to have even veteran Racoon City warriors quaking in their boots. From the inexplicable sobbing of an unseen child in a blood-stained school hall to the loud rattling of an invisible ""something"" underneath the floorboards that you're standing on, the game never sinks into predictability. Imagine all of this while never quite being able to see past arm's length into the darkness. Equipped with only a pocket flashlight, Harry is forced navigate pitch-black areas where demons insist on lurking just outside of the range of sight. Often, you'll hear them before you can actually see them, pushing the tension factor in the game to white-knuckled heights. But as masterful as Silent Hill is, it still can't claim perfection. In a completely 3D, polygonal real-time game environment, there are always going to be issues about control. Silent Hill slightly suffers from this. Maneuvering Harry in some of the game's tougher spots and getting him to go from dead stopped to run and back again can prove an exercise in frustration, especially when you find yourself trapped in a narrow hallway filled with murderous demons ? with only 15 rounds of Handgun ammo left. Visually, the game remains grainier than what's expected of a PlayStation game released in the system's fourth year. But the overall look of the game, with its murky fog effects and clever use of lighting makes good use of the graininess adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay throughout the game. In the face of Silent Hill's brilliant gameplay, these flaws only take so much away from the game and leaves us wondering how great the game will be on a next-generation system.",3.0
"I searched out this game after I read up on it a bit. ""Genuinely scary... suspenseful atmosherics... disturbing..."" screamed the fan-sites.  For starters, if you've ever played a Resident Evil game, this is too familiar territory. There are differences yes, but once you set foot in the school or hospital areas, it's RE all over again (running about in frustration opening doors, checking the map every 5 seconds, puzzles accompanyed by daft poetry riddles etc.) The other thing that sounded good to me were the nasties. The sites again babbled on about ""sinister zombie children that brandish kitchen knives and scream with glee as the slash you with them""... errr.. hello? They appear to be teddy bears with spikey claws that just seem to fall in front of you gnawing at your shoes! The rest are all RE moonlighters - zombie dogs, giant spiders, giant moths... nothing origional or vaguely creepy. The game's most interesting point to me is the 'alternate reality' sections with are rang in with a strange air raid siren. Basically what happens is that all your familiar surroundings are given a very Hellraiser-esque makeover, all bloody chains, crucified corpses and rusted metal. But it's really just the backdrops that feel creepy, the monsters patrol around with the same stupidity as ever.  The monsters also cause a radio transmitter to crackle so that you know when you're not alone, but that kind of ruins any jumpy moments as you just stand there waiting for any would-be attackers to reveal themselves. Also, the crackle gets annoying after a while. Anyway, buy this if you're not familiar with Resident Evil, as it's far to familiar. Actually no, buy RE 2 or 3 instead.",3.0
"OK.  This game is mediocre in multiplayer... but only in CTF.  The deathmatch is awful, and the other lame mods that come with it are worse.  Aside from sniping on the Face map, the only use for this game on my computer has been single player sniping on custom maps.  While all of the newcomers to the FPS genre have been hailing this game soley because of the great AI (I'll give it that much) you should notice that most of the professional compitetitions take place with Quake III, a game that takes skills such as aim and quickness.
Now there are some pretty cool things about Unreal Tourney.  For one, the maps are outstanding.  The AI is the best in the industry, as I have already said, but single player can only go so far... and just because the bots are smart, doesn't mean they are good, even in Godlike.
I've been playing the Quake series for years, and until Doom 2000 comes out, I doubt any game designers will be able to match John Carmack's coding skills.  If you want an FPS game that never gets old, stick with the company that eats, breathes and sleeps this gametype, id Software.",3.0
"One word comes to mind when I think of UT.  That is ""throwback"".  The level design is reminiscent of Quake 2.  The rocket launcher looks very similar.  The female characters with their hair waving look the same  as those in Q2.  Health and armor do not diminish over time, also as in Q2  (changed for Q3, for a number of reasons).  Epic took a formula that  worked, and made another game out of it, using an old (but still pretty)  game engine.  if you want to unwind and have a good time, fire up Unreal  Tournament and join a laggy server (I have a T3 connection.  With Q3 i get  dozens of servers under a ping of 40 ms.  With UT, the best i can ever find  is 80 something), or create a botmatch.  That's really the most fun you'll  have with this game.  If you want a game that will really last, and one  that you can feel yourself improving in, and take a bit more pride out of  the first time you win a game, buy Q3.",3.0
"Yes, that's the size of it fully installed!  Ok, it's cool and all, but not that much different to justify this huge size. I liked a lot DF 1 (not DF2) , Hidden and Dangerous in spite of the crashes, Swat 3 etc, but this  is just a Doom improved. It's also hard to configure even in my Pentium II  333 with 96 ram and Viper 770 32Mb. I don't recommend.",3.0
"I'm not at all impressed by Unreal Tournament.  It isn't a bad game by no means.  Although, I  didn't find the game half as Quake 3 is.  It does have a lot of features, and both the graphics and interface are nice.  But it  just seems like the exact same game to me with updated visuals and some new  modes.  Only get this if you were a fan of Unreal, not a just a fan of  multiplayer first-person shooter.  It plays and looks too much like Unreal,  it's not much of an improvement.  It is cheap though.",3.0
"While there's very little storyline to speak of, VR Missions provides a plethora of challenging objectives that test strategic skills, quick thinking, and patience.  The controls are solid, the missions are varied, and the sense of accomplishment is certainly there.  Graphics and sound are minimalist and serve the game well.  Sure it feels like a small expansion and not a full game, but it's worth a look if you enjoyed the training missions from MGS.  I found the ""confidential"" image displayed after achieving 100 % completion to be a nice treat, and surprising as well.",3.0
"i think metal gear solid was THEE greatest video game ever and so i had to have this addition.  i was a little disappointed.  some of the msssions are a little drab.  the really good ones, where you play the ninja, do not happen till late in the game and so the fun is short lived.  some of the missions are so basic that i blew through them in no time and others so boring that i could finish them in my sleep.  this was not awful but not great and that leaves you with three stars",3.0
"When i bought it back in 1999 it was one of the best RTS avalible and it impress pepole even today. In the begining it was quite amazing (COOL grphicks, nice style, good story line) but fter a time it began to be boring becouse you don't have one of th most basic elements of an RTS game: BUILDINGS. You cant build anything you can only move and attack. So if you like that style of games than go ahead and buy it but trust me evntually ou will get board of it.",3.0
"This game is good...up to a point.  Like the bots in Quake 3, the senarios are either very easy or very HARD.  I've also noticed that when you start a mission, if you enter the cheat that reveals the whole map, you'll notice  that the enemy always has more than TEN chests of gold and at least FOUR  artifacts right within easy reach!  All this while YOU have to scrounge by  to surivive in the early game!  Later on, when you control vast armies,  which would make Waterloo look like little kids playing War, you'll run  into computers which will, naturally, have armies approximately three times  larger than your own. The game CHEATS!  Trust me, you'll be screaming in  rage too when you enter the scene with twenty of your best units and find  that the computer has seventy of his.  At least it's not as bad as HOMM2,  which had one mission put you up against more than 200 bone dragons!",3.0
"I always have have mixed feelings about the 'Heroes' games. They are a combination of 'Civilization' and RTSs like 'Starcraft' with a turn-based combat engine thrown in, I really enjoy the building and exploration parts. However when I get ready to start conquering, most times I find opponents who are ten times more powerful than I am. Most Herons maps require either a quick rush or a 'build combat force only' tactic. This is especially true on Large and eXtra-Large maps. If loved previous Heroes installments this one is more of the same. If you've never played Heroes before it's harder to recommend since the gameplay is monolithic. Fortunately you can pickup other editions such as Heroes III dirt-cheap. I encountered no technical issues playing this game.",3.0
"The best feature of this game, I agree with most, was the Arcomage mini-game. If they haven't already, 3Do should turn this into an actuall game. The option to choose between the light and dark path was nice, but the overall game was too much like MM6, without enough new features.  The use of the invisibility spell makes it too easy, though, and I found myself almost done at level 20.",3.0
"I bought this game souly on the fact that everyone hereon amazon has praised it as being a fabulous game.

Well, it's all right, but it needed a lot more to keep you interested after a while. I burst out laughing during my first race when I crashed and burned into someone, and I got 1st place for doing it! But, this game isn't as great as some have said. It's OK to drive the circuits or do the demolition derby in the arena, but I have gotten tired of it, so sorry to whoever said you won't get bored with this game, I did!

There isn't enough tracks, there isn't enough cars, and it really needs more in the game. It needs a proper race, without the demolition, you can do a time trial, but I want a proper race with all the cars. There also needed to be an option to turn the check points off... I just wanna turn around and go the other way for something different, but once you run out of time, it's game over. Also, it needed something else, like in Mario Kart where you get the shells to throw, or the boosters/nitros, or things to lay booby-traps on the track... this game really needed something like that.

Currently Nintendo has managed to bring out a Gameboy that's pretty much a compact SNES/N64. So if they release this game again, lets hope they add more to it.

Two player mode is OK. Most of what the reviews here say are true, the bomb tag is the best, but it sucks that there is only about 4 tracks to compete in.

All there is, is Arcade. Where you race the first race of the tournament, and that's it.
Tournament, or championship mode or something where you race about 5 tracks and a couple of demolition derby's.
Time trials.
And then 2 player with normal, destruction, bomb-tag and flag .. there needed to be heaps, heaps more included.

I believe if THQ had made another version, it would be the same as the difference between WCW REVENGE & WWF NO MERCY.. the extras just separate the two completely.

This game is ok. Good for 2 player. Not too bad in the graphics and controls. But it just needs more in it.",3.0
"Sure, there were numerous worlds to walk through, graphics were moderately interesting, and practicing alchemy was fun.  But when I had reached level 30 and I was still running into those 4th level monsters over and over..not  to mention the all-too-predictable scifi routine toward the end of the  game, I grew increasingly bored.  What really irritated me were the bugs I  found playing the dark side and the outrageously leathal guys at the very  end.  You have to engage in a little politics in the middle of the game,  but I wish there was more to it (e.g. sending letters/spies/tributes to  various leaders).  I feel Might and Magic missed a great potential for a  very interesting plot.  It was fun while it lasted, but I didn't bother  finishing the game.",3.0
"Here is a game that, rather than doing anything new after the success of its predacessor, chose to simply reuse an outdated graphics engine and make the gameplay insanely repetative. Not to say that it doesnt have any of the  things that made Might and Magic 6 good in it but with games like baldur's  gate and Planescape: Torment out there are much much better ways to spend  your gaming dollar.",3.0
"After reading the other reviews, I have to say I agree with both ends of the spectrum, this is a mindless slash and hack focused on money and experience (kind of like life - only you can restart MM7).

So if you play the story mode, you cant save it without that add-on. I found that a little dissappointing, but the game itself is still tons of fun.",3.0
This game was made in the command and conquer style.  Unfortunately it is overly simplistic.  All of the maps are the same size so it is quite easy to determine where your enemy base is located(usually exactly opposite  you).  The graphics are cool and the gameplay is easy but there is no real  plot and the map size really bring it down.  The gradations on the map are  great though.,3.0

"I was very disappointed with this game. Maybe this is because I had already played Half-life before I played this game. I'm always skeptical when a game is without a singleplayer mode and I doubted that it could beat the multi-player of Team Fortress classic for Half-life. While it is an ok  multiplayer game it had already been far surrpassed by Half-life in  single-player, multi-player, graphics, realism, as well as lasting appeal.  I could not in good conscience rate this game any higher when it is  obviously lacking in so many categories.",3.0

"Visually this game is awesome. The monsters the NPC's the other players, all stunning.
 At low levels this game can be a lot of fun. You have a sense of accomplishment every time you log on. Whether its for half an hour or an entire day.
 As you progress it becomes more and more diificult. Eventually you cannot log on for half an hour and accomplish something. The  creatures you have to fight to lvl are camped with 20-30 other players  (during peak time) with a waiting list to get at them. They have made it  impossible for the casual player to get to high lvls.
 I have had fun in  this world. But i caution anyone without a whole lot of free time, DO NOT  BUY THIS GAME. All the high lvl players are students who are skipping  class, guys who are laid off from jobs, or housewives.
 Buy this game if  you have tons of free time and a lot of patience. Do not buy this game if  you like a story line, and historical background. This game is visually  stunning, but behind the graphics there isn't much else!",3.0
"I've played the game since it came out last year and it is fun to play but the design is for group play and group play only and this is the problem.  If you have hours to burn on a regular basis then grouping shouldn't be a  problem, but if you would like to get a hour or two in of playing time or  if you don't like grouping then Everquest would be more fustraiting than  fun.  And grouping effectively requires people who know what they are  doing; I have been killed so many times in groups it's not even funny.  The  game can be great fun but it can also give you an ulcer.  If you have  friends or family who will play when you play then go for it, if not I  would wait on a more solo friendly game.",3.0
"I am an addict. I LOVE RPG games. I started with Muds, and moved on to single player RPGs and then Massive Multiplayer RPGS. I greatly enjoyed UO when it came out, and enjoyed Everquest for 6 months. Now, however, I am  spending 10s of hours per week on Asheron's Call. MY POINTS ---------------  ONE: I love the ""High Fantasy"" aspects of  Everquest. If you play an Ogre, you have to actually look down to see the  elf you may be talking with.  TWO: I also really liked  the graphics in Everquest, but then i realized that eventually the  characters all look the same since you cannot customize your appearance  such as hair/eyes etc.  THREE: If you are patient, and  love to play cooperatively with others, there is nothing wrong with the  game play.  FOUR: The 2 things I liked least were the  ""Zones"" .. which feel like a bunch of quake levels, and the lack  of advanced quests. The quests are simple ""Get [insert object name  here] from [insert NPC character name] in [insert far away town name] and  return to [you get the idea]""  FIVE: Also, the  different races offer too many advantages that tend to have all Fighters as  ogres and all mages as elfs. I prefer a more level playing field and  skill/XP vs just XP based character development.  SIX:  I must say the Everquest character development/combat systems are weak at  best (far better then UO's, and noticeably worse then Asheron Call's)Simply  put the char and combat system are too simple. It takes very little  strategy in battles. Simply ""hit as best you can then run.""  SUMMARY : Good Game if you like High Fantasy and you are  patient, But Check out Asheron's Call as I think it offers more all  round.(but you won't be able to play a troll or elf etc .. just human)  -- TROG lvl 23 Ogre Shaman - Bristlebane  -- Camber lvl 29 Sho War/Item Mage - Morningthaw",3.0
"this is really michael, mary anne's son, but that doesn't really matter. i only say that because hardly any girls play this game, if any. anyway, at first the game rocks. when you first turn on the computer you wish you  could get on as fast as possible. when you turn it off, you wish you could  play more, well, not really. it's addicting at first, but not THAT  addicting. as i was saying, up until lvl 20 it's great and i think you  level fairly fast if good at the game, but it took me 2 months and hundreds  of hours of playing to get there, and i wanted to have more of a life.  after all, i had a girlfriend and guitar lessons to spend time on... if you  are a big RPG fan like me, you'll like it a lot the first two months. but  be prepared to spend a lot; it costs $50 to buy and an addition 10 dollars  each month after that, ignoring the first month which is absolutely free.  and the downside is that if you cancel your account, you can't make another  one so if you want to play again some months later you have to buy a new  game cd. you must have LOTS of time on your hands, and it is challanging.  if you are very good it's the best game in the world, but the problem is  that i found the cooler, more fun classes to play were the hardest to be.  my lvl 20 wizard gets killed so much, and it is impossible to solo, kill  monsters alone, with him, while warriors, a very boring class, level fast  and are easy to play with. all in all, buy this game if you love RPG's,  otherwise forget about it.",3.0
"In all my years of gaming, I can truly say FINALLY that Sega has a good shooting/Doom/whatever game. The problem is you can't really aim that well without getting shot about fifty times. The multiplayer is average; online-capability would've been sweet. All in all, the graphics are, like any other Dreamcast game worth its salt, breathtaking. The sounds are nice, with explosions and speaking roles (not too bad voice acting, if I might add) however, the gameplay tends to wear thin and becomes stale after about three weeks.

"Hype?  What hype?  I didn't even know about this game until I downloaded the demo!  I haven't been exposed to ""The Hype,"" so my review is going to be completely unbaised.  So, what do I think of this game?
In  many aspects, simply vanilla.
I don't care what engine a 3D game use, as  long as I enjoy the game.  Just as the realistic gore and fun seperated  Soldier of Fortune from the rest, Daikatana's storyline set it apart.  Plus, in Daikatana, you can ""level-up"" and alter your stats as  you kill more enemies.  You can increase your weaon's damage, speed, your  jumping height, maximum health, and your running speed.
The weapons are  innovative, to say the least, with 6 unique weapons in each of the four  episodes. along with the Daikatana itself.  When you use the Daikatana at  first, it's a slow as crap.  But as you kill more enemies with it, the  sword becomes more powerful, until it reaches level 5, at which point a  flick of the wrist can kill anything.  The downside to this is that YOU  don't get level-ups.  Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an  omelette, I guess.
Also, the locales are especially unique.  You travel  through four time periods, and in each one, there is unique architecture  that really sets the mood of the level, from the icy lands of 560 A.D.  Norway to the temples of ancient Rome. Unfortunately, those are the ONLY  things that set Daikatana apart.  The rest of the game is the usual  ""find key/switch/artifact, open a door, repeat"" formula.
Now,  for the BAD part of the review - the AI!  In the game, you'll get two  sidekicks that help you.  A few levels later though, you'll want to call  them ""groinkicks,"" because they will impede your progress so much  that you'll want to give them just that!  The sidekicks get in the way of  your aim, they shoot YOU when you get in THEIR aim, they fall off ledges to  their deaths, and they'll go after an enemy, even if they have no weapons!  And guess what?  If they die, so do you!  Most of the time, you'll order  them to stay put and finish the level yourself.  And the enemies?  They're  cannon fodder.  No brains at all.  With the exception of the civilians, all  they do is rush you.  Believe it or not, the smartest enemies are...the  doors!  I'd swear that they have the minds of sadistic killers!  They just  LOVE to ambush hapless heros - they stay open until either you or a  sidekick walks through the doorway, and then they suddenly close, crushing  all that are in the way!  Enemies know well enough to avoid them, so I  guess in a certain respect, they ARE smart!
Overall, as I mentioned  before, Daikatana is vanilla.  There are new innovations, but when you get  down to the gameplay, it's more of the same thing.",3.0
"Daikatana - everyone waited for years for this game. Like The Phantom Menace, there's no way that this game could live up to the hype... but it really does a good job trying. This might be the first FPS game to have an  actual storyline (told through cut-scenes), the graphics aren't too bad,  and the idea of having buddies that tag along and help you is GREAT. on the  downside, the AI in this game is HORRIBLE. after playing Half-Life, there's  no excuse for enemies that stand by casually as you slaughter their  friends. there's also quite a few puzzles that force you to leave your  buddies behind while you try to open a door for them - sure, you can leave  through the vent, but they can't. it's also frustrating to get through a  level and have to start over because Mikiko decides that she wants to take  on an enemy in another room - without ammo - and kills herself. and the  graphics - while not bad at all - look kinda dated.  Multiplayer isn't bad,  but with Quake III already out ... why bother?",3.0

Unfortunately, the game has some glaring weaknesses that reveal  it's incompleteness. My hard drive was grinding constantly and the graphics  stuttered and jumped indicating unoptimized code. Too often I would try to  rush into battle to gain the initiative only to have a graphical glitch  slow me down or stop me all together.

"I got this game because it was supposed to be the best game ever. It's not. The main flaw is the overhead perspective. The overhead camera angle limits your view of the surroundings to a huge degree. You end up relying on a radar in the upper corner of the screen to navigate the levels. This is simply wrong. If I am supposed to be the character, then I should be able to see what the character sees. The game does allow you to go into 1st person view, but you can't do anything other than look around--not even move. This control system is far too limiting, especially when much of the game is sneaking around, which requires you to really see your surroundings. The aiming system is dumb too: you hold down the fire button to aim, then release the button to fire. This means there is no way to aim and then not shoot, and no way to hold onto a target between shots. I also tired of the interuptions in game play by all the cut scenes and radio conversation with home base. Get Syphon Filter instead-not as in depth or graphically detailed, but way better game play.",3.0
"Well, being new to the Tomb Raider games, i just tried this game for a few moments on my new PlayStation 2.  Whoa, this was not what I expected at all, in both a good and bad way.  First, the good side.
I was always a Nintendo gamer, naturally with a Nintendo 64.  In that case, this game was the first ps1 game I've ever owned.  Knowing that ps came out much earlier than n64, i was amazed by the graphics in this game.  Voice and backgrounds are all very nice and realistic.  Plus you get to play as a teenage Lara, which makes it even better.  You also get even more weapons, moves, and length in this game as well.
In this aspect I was very pleased.  But there always is a downfall:  THE CONTROLS!  What an impossible game to play.  And i'm not talking about difficulty, the controls make it difficult.  You move the analog stick from side to side and instead of moving Lara sideways, you just changed the direction of her view.  Then when you are lined up, you must push forward to move.  It is very difficult and some of the views do not help.
Just to show you how hard this really is to master, I've been playing this game for 2 and 1/2 hours now and still haven't advanced past the training at the beginning.  Ha, and the training barely helps with the controls.  All you will hear is ""To do a long jump, press forward.  Then immediately push JUMP.  Then push ACTION to climb up the ledge.:  Yeah, like you even know what they are talking about or when exactly to push these buttons.
Overall, I give it 3 stars. Why?  First off, if you are an experienced gamer with Lara, I'm sure this is easier for you.  Second, it is rather enjoyable considering I have tried to play it 5 times now in a course of a day.  At these facts alone, the game deserves a 2.  But hey, it's 10 bucks. Thats it.  For that price, it deserves a better rating.
BOTTOM LINE:  You've played and like Lara, get this one too.  If you are a beginner like me, try an older version or another console's version of Tomb Raider instead.
WARNING: Just a warning for all PS2 users, if you only have a PS2, you can't use your normal memory card to save.  You need a PS1 memory card.",3.0
"Tomb Raider. I've played TR2,TR3 and i was looking foward to TR4:TLR. Know something? This ain't a bad game but it isn't a great game either.
Nice  FMV, lots of jumping and shooting. Maybe it's really fun but i still think  that i could do without the long long levels that sometimes stretches too  damn long that it seems that i would give up first.
Lots of backtracking.  Graphics and sound- pretty good but not spectacular or amazing. The story  is kind of good at the start but becomes ridiculous as the plot  thickens.
The last boss, an egyptian pyscho-freak is pretty dumb too, the  TR3 last boss was better, much more exciting.
Lara dies in the end or  maybe not- they have milk this money-cow. Anyway, i'd suggest you rent this  game first. And while i feel that the negative reviews of this game are a  little uncalled for-i have to say that it does get boring and it does fall  short of greatness.
But sadly, it's the only PS franchise i truly admire.",3.0
"Unlike the other reviewers I had never played the previous Tomb Raider games. I bought this one because it looked cool. Yes, the graphics are excellent and so is the music, but who can control this game? The movements  are jerky and highly inaccurate. This requires countless replaying of  certain parts, since jumps are not exactly perfect or she is not standing  at the exact spot to trigger levers, etc. Even though I like the  ""look"" of the game, it is very tiring to play it for longer  periods of time, since the controller problems really get on my nerves. The  camera angle is not that great either and wastes time trying to figure out  which way she is facing now.  Yes, the game is beautifully animated and the  story line is kind of cool (since I love Egyptian stuff), but so far this  has been more a pest than a fun game I can't get enough off.",3.0
"I am sorry but the game is not that good.  I concept is great but the game play could have been better.  The graphics are great for a play Station and that seems to be more important than game play.  Aiming is awful.  You only have up, down or straight.  I would like it better if it had auto aiming.  Unless you are playing a first person shooter aiming should be auto.  The story is boring, I do not mine long stories but the Japanese makers just did not get the American culture right in this game.  The story is silly.  Why would a agent have a love affair during the middle of a mission.  I hated having to listen to all that nonsense when i want to shoot people.  Really, it was not important to the story.  I would have loved this game if the game play was different.",3.0
"Instead of all these ones from newbie gamers who are fixed on graphics? Alright. Instead of calling this the best PlayStation game of all time, or even more laughable, one of the best games of all time, or even sadder, the best game of all time, let's get a couple of things straight first, shall we? While not bad, Metal Gear Solid left me wanting more and getting less than you'd think. Hideo Kojima set out to make one thing: a movie-like experience game. On that level, Hideo created an unrivalled masterpiece that has few equals in the action and story category of movies... but that's just it: movie; we're supposed to be playing a game here, not watching a movie. And on that level, while Hideo didn't fail, he didn't succeed either... You play Solid Snake, an ex-Fox-Hound, just out of retirement, cold, 30-something, living legend whose whole life seems to circle around the battlefield. Your mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons disposal facility in Alaska being ran by terrorists Fox-Hound, and rescue hostages DARPA chief Donald Anderson and the president of Armstech, Kenneth Baker. On top of that, you are to find out if Fox-Hound really has the capability of launching a nuclear attack like they've threatened, and stop them if they do. This is one job you wouldn't want to take for all the copies of Radiant Silvergun in the world. The controls are fairly simple, nicely responsive, and easy to pick. The music ranges from the typical stuff you'd expect to hear to an action game, to some beautiful, almost opera-like vocal performances that are dark and astonishing. The sound is also well done, and very detailed. You (and your enemy) can hear everything: from footsteps, to tapping on the wall, to gunshots that you'd swear were the really thing, even the most jaded would be impressed here (hey... stop looking at me!). Speaking of the enemy, the AI to the game, while not all that intelligent at times (walking a course? Come on), is very interesting. They pick up on footsteps, gunshots, knocks on the wall, and even good ol' David's... I mean, Solid Snake's cold--impressive. The characters are lively and very real. I loved all the characters minus Otacon and Meryl; Otacon who I was hoping would ""accidentally"" get shot, and Meryl who, well, just felt out of place. The rest though, were amazing. Personal favorites were Sniper Wolf and Vulcan Raven who are, hands down, two of the coolest bad guys ever. There are also some cool bonus stuff to do, like the VR missions and taking pictures. You can also talk to your friends (that word being used loosely...) through Codec, which is like an ultra high-tech walkie-talkie. Occasionally the voice actors sound out of place (""Japanese animes""? Hello!), but that's very rarely, and the rest of the time they manage to not only avoid the trap of the Resident Evil trend, but do so with grace. Then, there's the problems of this game... The small ones would be the over-head camera, which gets annoying quickly. There are times when I'd miss an enemy, who was five feet away from me, all because the camera wouldn't give me a good view. No big. Then, there's the length of the game--it's EXTREMELY short. Scenario: I buy the so-called ""best game ever"" for ... (that's what it cost when it came out, mind you). I play game and enjoy the gameplay I do find. Metal Gear Solid is beaten in less than a day. Argh! I think you get the point... Not a major, major problem, but enough to deduct a star. But the worst problem is the story itself. Sure, it's impressive, and one of the best stories of all time (forget game of the year, call it movie of the year), but as Hideo himself said, combining a movie and a game is like combining water and oil--they just don't mix. Meryl and Snake's relationship ""mature""? Please. By video game standards, yes. I suppose Squall's and Rinoa's was, too (I still shudder at the mere mention of those two Dawson's Creek stars...). But by the real world standards, it seems like cheesy puppy love that quickly becomes hard to swallow. That's not the problem, the problem is this: the story takes up WAY too much time of the game. And that's where everyone who's giving this a top-notch, perfect, five star rating (which seems to be everyone from Amazon reviewers to NextGen to your own ma and pa) gets confused--Metal Gear Solid is supposed to be a game, not a movie. As a movie, it's a masterpiece of epic proportions that can rival even T2. As a game, it's only fun for the few hours it actually lasts--or should I say, the hours where you're trying to stay awake through all the Codec talking. Sure, sure, you can argue that Xenogears was the same way, but A. Xenogears had a groundbreaking story, that just so happens to be the best story of all time, and B. I actually got more gameplay time out of the short and heavily texted second disk of Xenogears than I did the entire two disks of Metal Gear Solid. It gets sad when you're spending minutes upon minutes hearing about Snake talk about how he has no family when you're supposed to actually be playing the game. And while the gameplay that is here is fantastic, it's too-good story is not so surprisingly its own downfall. Just an idea, but wouldn't it be fun if we, I dunno, say, actually played a game, not a movie? Great idea, huh? Afterall, that's what this is supposed to be: a video game, not a movie....",3.0
"This game could have been wonderful. It has a lot of innovative stuff, has great graphic and an almost perfect control system. HOWEVER, it has VERY little game time. You spend more time watching the video parts and (worse) the CODEC parts than controling Snake itself. Moreover, even though the story is ok, it becomes a soap opera after a while. Some dialogues are really silly, like when  Snake shares his feeling about being a soldier, or when he tries to justify himself for saving Meryl instead of finishing his mission. It becomes ridiculous too often. It is really too bad, because the overall story and the innovative action would have made it a must have.",3.0
"Metal Gear Solid has won just about every gaming award possible and has been lauded by critics and fans worldwide.  Despite the fact it's not really my area of interest (I'm a Resident Evil type guy) I bought the game (heck, it was 20 bucks, why not?).  This was last year.  I never finished it, and finally sold it.  Why?  Good question.  I finally decided that, ultimately, I wasn't involved at all with any of the characters or story events.  I didn't care what happened.  Do I think MGS is overrated?  Well, sort of.  Granted, the graphics, controls, and audio are as perfect as perfect can get, and there is no doubt that there are innovative elements (especially the sneaking about and the enemy soldier AI) but I found the characters and story as cold and sterile as the Arctic location in which most of the game is set.  It has no SOUL.  For this type of game, I feel this kind of personal involvement is VITAL. I wasn't swept up in the events like in Parasite Eve or Vagrant Story.  Metal Gear left me with the feeling I was performing a chore rather than embarking on a world-changing adventure.  The story felt scripted and unnatural, the characters flat and lifeless.  I think Metal Gear affected me the same way as this year's Shenmue for Dreamcast:  an undisputed technical masterpiece that felt devoid of humanity.  In any case, any gamer with a pulse should play through it (for the Sniper Wolf bits if nothing else), but be prepared for Snake and Co. to keep a distance from your heart.",3.0
"This wheel has such an awesome feel to it. The buttons are great,and the stick shift is fun. Even the innovative pedals  work flawless. However, the darn thing isn't fully compatable with Gran Turismo 3. It wouldn't swich between modes, the pedals didn't work, and niether did the shift knob. I'm sure this wheel is the bomb when it comes to other games, but if it can't work correctly with the god-like GT3-A-SPEC, then it's not for me.",3.0
"If you want a simple description for the feel of this game, think ""Blade Runner"" meets ""Resident Evil."" However, the game  has several flaws which take away from it's beautiful backgrounds, and  scenery. First of all, thi sgame should have had some live action in game  movies. This would make the story, and gameplay more fun. Second, it is way  to easy to get killed. This is soooo not fair. When your fear meter gets  red, you can die with one shot. And no continues? What's that all about?  These are just to name a few flaws. This game would be much better if it  was rented at Blockbuster for the weekend. Once you get going, the game is  pretty simple, and short, but too many flaws take away from it's over all  presentation.",3.0
"The one thing that grabs your attention right away in Fear Effect, is how good the game looks.  The graphics are incredibe, giving the game a movie  like feel.  But that's all the game is, a interactive movie.  There is too  much of the game dedicated to the graphic elements, then there are to  actual gameplay.  It's good to have a very detailed story, and this game  has that, but there needs to be more then four stages.  There is one major  flaw in this game, the game is too damn hard.  Even on normal, some of the  bosses are so damn tricky that you spend hours reloading your game and  taking another crack at him.",3.0

"I got this from Gamestop, for $5.00 used.  I kept wondering if it was good or bad.  Well it breaks down like this:
Pros:
-Great Graphics
-Great voice acting
-nice selection of weapons
-excellent storyline
-has a bit of comedy in it(Like when hana takes her towel off in front of a soldier, and Deke snaps his kneck)
Cons:
-Puzzles are COMPLICATED(I died, and tried many times trying to get them right)
-The inventory system takes too long for me to get a weapon, so I died sometimes, trying to get my favorite weapon
-After you play it the first time, there's no real thrill to play it the second time, unless you're trying to get the best ending on hard.
I still play this game when I want to, it's just that it's just not the same like the first time I played it, cuz I didn't know what was going to happen(I didn't use a guide because I didn't want to ruin the suprise, and man it was a painful long jurney)  If you like games like Silent Hill or Resident evilm I would definitly recomend this game, but rent it first.

"This game is the predecessor to Fear Effect 2 and the upcoming Fear Effect 3: Inferno.
This game and gameplay are very similar to Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and all those action/adventure games where you have to solve puzzles.  This game actually does deserve a mature rating -- with unadulterated gore, some suggestive sexuality and mature discussions of vengeance and under-the-table monies. The graphics is also well-done using a combination of anime and 3-dimensional graphics.  The child's playroom in the Hell level is particularly creepy, and it is very reminiscent of Nightmare on Elm Street.  The voice acting is done well, but Hana has the whole Valley Girl thing going on that becomes very annoying after an hour or so.  Hana was actually much more mature in Fear Effect 2 than in Fear Effect.  The music in this game also wasn't as good as in Fear Effect 2.  The cinematics in this game are great and are nearly as good as Metal Gear Solid (as a date-to-date) comparison.  The only faults of this game that I can see are the long loading times -- before and after deaths.  I liked the Fear Effect series over the Tomb Raider and Resident Evil series because you have to have patience, a whole lot of moxie, some more brainpower, and a whole lot more reflexes.  Overall, buy this game cheap, and you won't regret the purchase.  Otherwise, stick with Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix.",3.0

"When I saw previews for this game, I knew that I was going to have to get it. Turns out that the game really is as good as I thought it would be, only about 10 times as hard! I have never died in ANY game as much as I have in this one. one of the bad things about the game is that there is no way to heal yourself, you just get healed when you get to certain points. The other bad thing is the loading time when you continue after dying. The inventory is very hard to work with also, it takes a lot to get used to. The graphics in the game are great and the cut scenes are like watching a cartoon. You need to have a lot of patience to play this game but it is pretty fun.",3.0
"Don't get me wrong, I'm an avid fan of the HM franchise! I do love the SNES version and so forth, BUT for some reason I can't seem to get attached to HM:64, I don't know if it's because it's so choppy, or if it's because the old 3D aspect at the time is just confusing. It seems like back then 3D graphics were just utterly confusing, thankfully now at least for the most part its fixed.

I do plan to go back and try it out, who knows maybe if I give it another go I may get attached and change my views. I'm willing to try anyway...

I'm more of a fan of the original HM, HM:STH, HM:AWL, HM:MM, HM:ToT, HM:AP, and so forth. HM: 64 just doesn't hold appeal to me, but who know that could change as I dive deeper into it.",3.0

"Plagiarizing makes the video game world go 'round.  Sega had Streets of Rage, Nintendo had Final Fight.  Before that, there was Double Dragon and Renegade.  And that's just one subgenre.  It is perfectly common for a game to be released on the heels of another game, utilizing the same structure, topic, and style of gameplay.  In the case of Carrier, it is obvious that their developers stayed up a lot of nights playing Resident Evil.  But if you're going to rip off a game, at least attempt an improved version, not just a pale knock-off.
This game does nothing better than the Resident Evil series.  The graphics are worse by being so simple (and dark, dark to the point where I had to turn up the brightness on my TV to see necessary objects.)  The premise is twice as hokey as RE's S.T.A.R.S. group.  It isn't nearly as scary as RE.  The long stretches of dialogue exposition in Resident Evil were tolerable because they were interesting and revealed plot points.  Here, they are tediously boring.  RE has minimal backtracking, this has copious amounts of backtracking.  And, most comically, Resident Evil had one of the most cheesy, hokey, unbelievably delivered dialogue of any video game EVER.  So Carrier should have at least got THAT right, huh?  Well, sadly, no.  How Jaleco managed to find voice acting even MORE uninspired, boring, and wooden than RE, I'll never know, but they did.
So that's the story.  Gameplay is a mirror image of Resident Evil.  Same artistic backdrops, same wanky control, same ""spooky"" atmosphere and gradually revealing storyline.  Just twice as boring and unnecessary.  Especially now that RE2 and RE3 are available on Dreamcast, you might want to make Carrier the last of the ""survival horror"" titles you obtain for the Dreamcast.
Well, it is better than Blue Stinger.  That's a plus, right?",3.0

"Dogz for GBC is a good game for all ages. It is a lot of fun for a little while, but if you like action, it's not for you. You will get tired of it easily. Even I did, and I'm a die-hard fan of the computer versions. From the start, you choose one of three breeds of dogs (Mutt, Chihuahua, or Scottie) and take care of it until it is old enough to be retired. Each game comes with a variety of toys and objects to care for your dog, and one special toy is included in each game. To collect all of the breeds and toys, you have to trade with other gamers. If you liked the first version of Dogz for the computer, you will probably like it. For another game like this, try Catz for GBC. My overall recommendation would be to buy Dogz 3 or 4 for the computer, where you can feed, groom, play, and even breed the dogz. Hope this was helpful!",3.0

"This was the first MK game to be in 3D,using motion capture technology. When I first played this game I did not like it. I could not grasp the new idea that Midway had with this game.

This Playstation port is decent,but not great. Far from it actually. The textures on the characters are pretty bad. The characters look a bit blocky and the gameplay can be a bit choppy at times. Another problem is this game loads ALOT.Overall though,this port of MK4,is just okay at best. If you got a Sega Dreamcast,pick up Mortal Kombat Gold instead. It's the same as MK4,but it has extras. Such as bringing back characters,Baraka,Mileena,Kitana,Kung Lao and Cyrax. Plus the graphics are ALOT better. They are very smooth. Pick that up instead if you can.

If you specialized in Lou Kang, you were already good at the newest release of the MK series. What I wasn't ready for was the change in controls for Mortal Kombat 4. They re-arranged everything to better suit the weapons concept. I did not enjoy this game as much as I expected because I didn't accept the change. i like to stick with what works.

"Rampage World Tour did well in the arcade scene as it picks up from the first Rampage title back in the 80's and updates it for the 90s back then. Then, Midway decided to port it over to the N64 and in 1997, it was released and sold a decent number of copies. It's exactly like the arcade and it's decent fun for awhile. Then, it just gets old fast and you realize you do the same thing over and over again.

The police and military are hot on your tail so grab various health power ups to stay alive (or eat the many innocent people running around.) Eventually, you'll fight all the way to the moon where you'll defeat the mutated CEO of the company responsible for turning you into a monster. There's only one mode to play so grab 2 more friends to play along with you for even more destruction. At various points, you're allowed to save your progress and since it's a big game, it will take you awhile to see everything.

The PROS: Midway did a nice job at duplicating the arcade game so it looks, plays and feels just like you are standing in front of the cabinet. Playing by yourself is fun for awhile but it's better when 2 other players join you and you can either work together or just beat each other up. If you meet certain conditions, you'll access secret areas just like you can do in the arcade version.

The CONS: The fact that it's just like the arcade game is its biggest drawback. Even if you play with your friends, you're doing the same thing over and over again: destroy cities, eat people and rack up as much points as you can. The repetition kicks in pretty quick and just seeing it to the end will feel like a chore. It's also easy as hell since you have unlimited continues and there's no penalty for not clearing out stages in time. The stages pretty much look the same except for the major ones since they feature famous landmarks but overall, there is little variety. Midway didn't bother to put in extra content to unlock so when you beat the game, that's it. The only re-playability comes in finding the secret areas/cities tucked in somewhere in the game.

Rampage World Tour is not a bad game at all. It can be fun if you play it in chunks and it certainly is even better with other players. If you loved the arcade game and can't get enough of it, this game won't disappoint. But with no extra content and repetition sinking in after playing it for awhile, it keeps it from being better than it should be. Get this one used if you want to try it out.",3.0
"Alright, I don't like this one as much as World Tour, but this is a solid game in and of itself. You have three basic monsters to chose from (Rhino, Rat, and Crab) and you set off to unlock the original three monsters (Gorilla, Wolf, and Lizard). You can actually save in this game and progress through the story unlike the pick-up-and-play nature of World Tour and there is a secret character to unlock. This is a good game for kids and a better game for kids who like a challenge.

That said, older kids will get bored. It is repedative and monotonous at times. Your kids will likely tire of the music and play something else. But for what it is worth this is a solid entry. Get it if you are on a budget and your kids like to see monsters eat sprites for a few moments.",3.0

A really good game kinda disappointed tho that the game freezes when you beat the boss and when you let the timer run out when it says to press start to continue,3.0
Overall decent game.  I just hate the constant load times it really slows down the game and just makes it feel very stagnant.  I also think the CPU is unfair because the game becomes next to impossible after about the 3rd fighter even when it's on very easy!!!! every move you do is countered perfectly by the computer which is the thing I hate the most.. however I do like the one button fatalities and the huge selection of characters.,3.0

"This game has it's good points and it's bad points.  If you are a die-hard MK fan, chances are that you already own (or have owned) this game.  The good points include the wide range of characters.  This game has every single MK character to date, including ""classic"" version of some of the characters.  Many of the characters have new ending, and some of them also have new moves.  The combo system and MK-style fighting engine are both intact, and you can even play as the bosses, plus there is a secret character (Khameleon) to unlock.  There is also the all-new ""Brutality"" finishes and the ""Aggressor"" mode. And, of course the unlockable ""?"" game options.

But there are the bad points, too.  First of all, although you can play as the bosses, there is really no reason to do so since none of them have endings.  And the gameplay difficult seems to be much too hard even on the easiest level.  The game almost seems psychic in countering any move you try.  Pure luck and a Gameshark are about the only way you will get through this game.  And with the return of one of my favorite fighters, Johnny Cage, comes complete with two moves missing.  If you think the good outweighs the bad, then get this game.  But if you like MK the old way, which is to say one that actually fights fair, then I do not recommend this one.",3.0
its ok.not good nor bad its another PS1 game that you might enjoy if your a fan of the series.,3.0
"Even though this game IS fun, I must admit, this game is REALY old, especially now that the newest MK game vs. DC Comics is coming out this fall. This game is pretty fun, like I said before, but the game is almost impossible to beat and I think I only beat the game a couple times. If you want something challenging that's classic, get this game.",3.0
"The game is fun, but when you are playing alone it gets a little boring after a while.  This type of game is made to play against a friend(or enemy.)  It's better when you're actually playing someone else so you can talk trash about crushing the other or making an excuse because you lost.",3.0
The only thing that's really bad about this game is the A.I. and a few other things. No matter what difficulty you have it on it's good for like the first four fights. After that the computer somehow anticipates your every move and there's nothing you can do about it besides get lucky and manage to get at least 1 hit. But even when I do beat the game the game it freezes. I don't think you should get this unless you're an extremely good player or you have someone to play with.,3.0
hard?? this game isn't hard a all that is y its not fun the CPU  is like freaking retarded even if you put it in very hard  mode the only people that present a challenge are goro montauro and  khan other than that the game is like cake  i wwas able to beat the game with subzero by cheaply refreezing people over and over again  and doing it with ease ... i like the one for sega genesis more it was much harded a challenge and better music... unless you got human players to play with u  don't waste your time with this game,3.0

"Mortal Kombat Trilogy, a fighting game that takes all of the characters from 1-3 and Ultimate MK3 and placed in a massive (at the time) fighting game. basically all of the same sprites from the other games (excluding Johnny Cage, which is the only new looking sprite in the game) put them in a fighting game that is just Mortal Kombat 1-3 with a few missing levels, missing the Pit 2 fatality animation, and adding 4 older versions of the characters with some horrible animation. I still like the older MK games, but with the age of the newer mortal kombats (Deadly Alliance, Deception and Armeggedon), these games feel a little too outdated. I think this is a great game but it has a ton of glitches (and there's only one good glitch in this game). when you turn on the 1 button fatality option and when you try to finish your opponent with your 1 button fatality, it doesn't always happen. sometimes you might end up still trying to finish your person off and no matter if you hit that person or whatever, you have to wait until the match is finished. When you play this on a PS2, if you have the speed doubled and you finish a match, it freezes on you, if you have the graphics level doubled and you either finish the match or something else that you do, it might or will freeze up. If you don't have either option on and you decide to start over from the beginning (that stupid buy in screen is what I am talking about), it freezes on you. The only good glitch in this game is that when you play as Noob Saibot and you do that jump and grab move, if your opponent is to the point to uppercutting him/her off the bridge and into the Pit 1 spikes, you can actually have that person fall all the way to the ground instead of just landing on the spikes and having them stopping the opponent falling all the way to the ground. you can actually see a little bit of blue on the bottom of the screen when this happens.

because of these horrible flaws, thisis why I am giving the overall rating of 3. If this didn't happen, then yes I would recommend getting this, but because Armeggedon is coming out in a few days (which has all of the characters from the series, including Chameleon from the PSone version of MK Trilogy, Meat from MK4 and 2 new characters from the Konquest mode in that game and hopefully won't have any horrible glitches like this game does), it's probably pointless to get this. If you don't like PSone and you have a N64, get that version. If you don't have either but have a PC, try getting Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition and the PC version of MK4 (I think they released it for PC too). If you hate either PSone or N64, wait for Armeggedon. If you don't like the 2 systems and don't care for Armeggedon, get Deadly Alliance or Deception on the PS2, GC, or Xbox. If you don't like that, then youare out of luck.",3.0
"I bought this game yesterday because I wanted the nostalga of mortal kombat.  I was very unimpressed with MK:DA on XBOX so I bought this game.  The store only had this game on Playstation and not N64 which I what I wish they had.
I took this game home dusted off my Playstation and popped this game in. Almost immediately I remembered how cheap and chessy these game can get.  I had no problem getting to the bosses but once you get to Motaro and Shao Khan, the only way you can win is with luck and not skill.  They both do the same chessy move over and over and over and over again, and there is nothing you can do about it.  If you try to do a move, the computer's apparant pshychic ability counters your move before you even do it; very lame programming.  They also added a throw to Shao Khan's already cheesy arsenal which makes him even more cheap. This game is better when playing other human players, ...  It takes more luck than skill to beat this game.  Another drawback is the slow loading times on Playstation.  ...  These slow loading times and also slow loading times during Shang Tsung's morphs's helped me remember why I hated playstation so much and stopped playing it in the first place.",3.0
"This item showed up well in advance and was clean w/ no scratches.  The seller was fantastic and even included a note in the package offering any help if I should need it.  The cd case was slightly cracked and ended up falling apart after I removed it from the packaging, but it was old and looked original.  It did come with the original cover; I can tell because all the colors had faded out to purple.  lol

Now, about the game itself...

I played this originally on the N64, and have found this  game to be lacking to the point where I can't play it on playstation.  You cannot sell items to buy power-ups, the game itself doesn't seem to be as smooth, and the worst part is  IT's ONLY 2 PLAYERS!

I can't stress that last part enough.  It was fun to play for a few levels, but my wife and I couldn't get beyond that.

The seller was great, the game was okay.  Cheers!",3.0
"I never played this game back in the day, so I figured I would go back and check it out. It was an interesting game and pretty fun in its fighting mechanics.

Platforming was very difficult and frustrating at times with the old mechanics and lack of camera control unless you held a bumper.",3.0

"If you like the era, and if you like micromanaging as you build an empire (here, a business and crime empire), this is a fun game. The strong points include nearly infinite replayability, its nice mix of strategy (mixing  legal and illegal businesses) and tactics (arranging and responding to  street ambushes and hits), and the amusing grace notes -- like bribing  police, intimidating jurors, and torching rival speakeasies The designers  went to great lengths to give the gamer many choices, both strategic (there  are three ways to win) and tactical. The game's drawbacks include the steep  learning curve, a rather cumbersome interface, and the difficulties of  keeping track of multiple events happening all over the map; the pause  button helps here, but if you try to keep on top of everything, each game  turn (one week) can become long and tedious. This is definitely  for your  more cerebral moods, not when you want a beer-and-pretzel quick and easy  game.",3.0
"This game has a very big learning curve.  It took me a long time to ""get it"" on how to play the game.  Unfortunately, just as it started getting interesting it would crash around turn 35 or so just as I  began to win.

"This game is o.k. Take my word for it, that's all it is, o.k.! Well I didn't want to give it a two or three, because it does have goodpoints, but it's not nearly good enough to get a four or five, those ratings are there for games like Goldeneye!  I rented the game yesterday, and I got frustrated, because first of all, you have to have a ""controller pack"", (I always called them memery packs), but anyway, that's what screws you, because once you turn the game off, you have to start alllllllllllll over again, which sucks, believe me!  Second of all, ... the camera views will definetly screw you, and I use that word loosely, because when your in a bad position, like in front of a bad guy, the camera won't give you the angle you want, no sirre, it gives you a behind the trees view, giving you a better chance at getting shot. And the third thing, which might be worse for some people, theres not much you do but go around shooting people, which is cool, but it gets old, and it gets old fast! I wish it had objectives like in goldeneye. But if your looking for a game that will be awesome at first, and then screw you, get this game. Ok, so maybe I am too hard on this game, if you've got the time to master the controls, and get used to the camera view, ok, get winback, but if your looking for a cool first person shooter, get goldeneye! It's the best game yet! Believe me, I'm a 14 year old critic/gamer, just like you, and I read these reviews just like you, so go back and look at what I have said, because I'm sitting here typing this review so you won't throw your money out, like I would have if I had bought this game, before renting it.

"Rampage is a classic series no matter what anyone says. But Rampage 2 Universal Tour isn't that much different than the previos Rampage World Tour. Granted yes, there are new boards, new challenges (from both mankind and outer space!) and you do get to use new Mutants but when it all comes down to it, the game gets a little repitive after a while which always makes a game boring.
That and this game was really long, and if you had the Continue option, I couldn't find it and that's another dimension that made this game too difficult for what it was. I won't deny that I had fun while I played but after a while, it seriously goes out of normal rotation.
I loved the fact that you (like the last one) could rampage with 2 of your friends and wreak havok on the world but still, I would make this a renter first before you committed to buy. I'm not saying it's not worth to buy but I am saying that you could easily get tired of this after a weekend or two.",3.0

"Rampage 2 is awesome. It's more of the same from the orginal but moooore monsters. I was up all night with this game, plus theres a twist..YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE MONSTERS FROM THE ORIGINAL IN ORDER TO EARN THEM! Thats pretty friken awesome. The 3 new memebers of your team are a krab dude a ryno dude and rat name Kurtus I think. I don't remember there names because I played this game awhile ago.

There is also another monsters thats and extra for the game. I think the monsters name is Miyakis or something like that.

WAY TO GO MIDWAY! This was a great game.

I hope they make another sequal in the future RAMPAGE 3 which takes place in iraq or something like that well that would be mean I guess if they do that...ALL IM SAYING IS THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER SEQUAL! It's bin to long.

The sequal to the original is better if not just as good as the original.

"I was always a fan of MK.  I always felt that the first MK gave the best atmosphere, and the sequels killed that aspect, instead adding more characters and 'neat' moves rather then the Goth dark horror I perceive the MK universe to be.  This game steps back into that style, with a feel for what is truly behind the characters, and the meaning behind the tournament.  However, this game has some bothersome aspects, like too few lives, too precise timing required (especially in the second stage with the windmill platforms), and too much to guess at.  Over all, this game is better then average, but could have used a little more, in controls.  A good buy, for MK buffs.",3.0

"I did enjoy ""AMBER Journeys Beyond"" up to a point. The puzzles varied in their difficulty from amazingly simple to frustrating and illogical. The storyline was less than I imagined it to be, but still interesting. The atmosphere was enthralling, but the display was far too small for comfort. I would recommend this game for a busy time in your life, because if you play it nonstop then you will be dissatisfied. The game is TOO SHORT! I expected much more play time, and was quite disappointed by its speedy ending. Don't get me wrong, this game has many good points. The graphics are very realistic, and scene movement is smooth. The voice acting is flawless, which is very nice seen as how it is important to game-play. I greatly enjoyed the storyline, and I'll state again that the atmosphere was spectacular. It has a unique eerie quality that I have not seen anywhere else. This game is a good buy for [$], and I would recommend it to bored adventure game players, who have limited experience in this genre.",3.0
"Amber is another first person puzzle game that is also a bit strange , and for some people scary. The graphics are not bad, even though it is a frame by frame view. The puzzles are not really challenging at all, so if your looking for another Myst type game, this is not the game for you. If your looking for an easy going, non-gory, scare type of game, then you have found the right game for you. Some parts of game play are a little confusing, like trying to move around and that sort, but over time you will get use to it. I also was able to finish the game in two days, so it is a bit short, and the ending is kind of dumm. I would also not recommend this game for younger children, it may frighten them to much.",3.0
"Amber is different than most games you've been playing. There are no puzzles to solve. That's right! No tricks, no frustration. Amber is the name of a paranormal psychic energy -measuring device that leads your friend Roxy to utilize the new equipment in an old haunted house.  Something goes awry and you travel to this home to see what happenned to Roxy and her new equipment.  Sound fun? It is.
Mysteries. Mysteries. Why is Roxy unconscious wearing the Amber head gear in the garage, of all places?  Should you experiment with the equipment? Sure.  Beware as you follow in your friend's footsteps while trying to figure what happened to her. This PC game is fun. It takes you through portals of time to uncover the secret of the hauntings. I found the game to be quite thrilling. Things really do go bump in the night!
So why only three stars? While the idea of mystery puzzles vs. physical ones seems original and fun, the game is easy.  A young high schooler could figure the ""moves"" out. You are given a place, a circumstance, and an enviroment with tools. Everything you need to solve the mystery is staring you in the face. Go ahead and give it a go. The plot, first-person scenario, and all the truly frightening hauntings make this an easy going game. A perfect breather to play in between the usual brain-frying choices.",3.0
"I got Amber from a freind and was so excited to play it. When I started playing, I thought it was an awesome. But, after a few days, I was starting to get bored. The game took too long to load, was very hard to play, got boring, and, after you get into the garden, you get vary vary lost vary vary fast. I am not saying that the game isn't awesome, but it is very boring and very hard to find exits after you get into the core of the game. There is one nice part of the game and that is the under water roller coaster. That was the big highlight for me.",3.0
"Interesting little game, though it's nothing to write home about. Graphics are passable, acting pretty good, writing fine (better than the execution, unfortunately).

"I found that the game was interesting, but I wasn't pleased with the ending. I'm a person who likes multiple endings and Amber doesn't have it. Besides that, your co-worker, Roxy, is a very ""perky"" person who  tends to become annoying while watching her on the videotape and at the  finale. Edwin's story was heart wrenching, and Margaret and Brice's stories  were tragic as well. The only thing I have to complain about was how  shallow the stories were. Margaret, for instance, touched lightly on World  War II but her story never gets any farther than a few rooms with a radio.  The graphics were great, as well as the music and techno babble of the  paranormal. I just wanted some multiple endings and a new co-worker, but  besides that, it was a good buy, but not great.",3.0
"Omega Boost - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- Overall fun game to play

- Fast and furious gameplay

BAD:

- Graphics might look a little dated

- Controls can be a little tough

- Game gets pretty is tough on higher levels

- Short game with no real unlockables or bonus

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- A 3D shooter which plays like a fast and furious version of Panzer Dragoon

- Simplistic arcade style presentation

- Panzer Dragoon

- Colony Wars

- Zone of Enders

"I've always had a thing about buying 3rd party controllers. I've always felt that since all of the thought went into the design, it would feel great. And this one feels great! However, it is massive! It covers the console if you set it on top. It has a more natural hand placement (it is like those keyboards with the separated keys) and has a couple groves for your fingers, but the fingers don't fall into them, at least mine. The rubber grips on the sides and on the stick give a feel of greater control than the sega one, but the rubber on the D-pad mades sliding difficult. The slots are a bit sticky, and the VMU is kinda hard to get out. the buttons only go down when pushed directly down, and are also covered in rubber. The triggers don't have the range of movement as the sega one, and feel different (it's hard to describe)
Verdict: A cheap(er) alternative the sega controller made by a well known game accessory maker, however, as many people on the site have said, sega makes the best.",3.0
"As one reviewer has stated, there are two versions of the Mad Catz Dream Pad -- one great, one not so great.  The not so great one only comes in white.  The great one comes in a variety of colors.  With the former, the directional pad is much too stiff and unresponsive, making it impossible to consistantly perfom special moves in fighter games.  The second version is as commendable as the controllers for the Sega Saturn.  My advice, if you are going to get a Mad Catz Controller, the safest thing to do is to make sure it is not a white one.",3.0
"Finding a good Dreamcast controller these days is kind of rare, and finding a good Dreamcast controller for the killer fighting games for the Dreamcast is near impossible. The Dream Pad is decent. It's comfortable, and the inclusion of Z & C on the face are great, but they still are in an odd position. One can get used to it, but this would be a second choice for me, or even a third what with the now super rare ASCII Pad FT for Dreamcast (only released in the Asian market) or a Nuby Tech Street Fighter controller for PlayStation and PS2 + a 3 in 1 Dreamcast controller adapter, which accepts PS2 and Saturn controllers as well as a VMU, which can be found at some import gaming web sites.

"I was a little disappointed in this game. I love the ambience of the first Quake, and Quake2 just doesn't have that frightening, creepy aspect. Also the first Quake is much harder. I beat this game's butt in less than 2  weeks on the HARD difficulty setting. A word of advice: after installing  the game, immediately download the patch from ID software. Otherwise, games  in progress will be unplayable after you install the patch. Like I said,  all this and I STILL beat the game in less than 2 weeks.

"A few years ago after SC 2K came out I participated in a bulletin board discussion on the Maxis site about what the next version should have. I suggested editable buildings and real-life landmarks like the Eiffel Tower.  I was happy to see that both suggestions (probably also made by others)  were to be incorporated into SC3K.  But the building editing tool,  available via free download for PC users, is not available for the Mac  version, and they have no plans to make one! While I can't agree with some  reviewers who call the Mac version worthless, this is a strike against it.  After all the original SimCity was designed on a Mac! Otherwise, there are  many cool things about SC 3K, and enough entertainment value for me to give  it 3 stars. However, some cool things about the previous version are now  missing. For instance, you can no longer place signs wherever you want  labeling various sections of town. This added nothing to the success of  your town, but it was fun. I've run across a few bugs and yes, it takes a  hellacious amount of hard drive space and time to install, but once it's  running it performs fine on my 200 Mz machine.",3.0
"If Dreamcast is the only system you own then by all means this is a must have for MK4 fans. However the presence of the new fighters are not enough to constitute a new game. The characters that were not in MK4 bring with them their signature moves to this Sega Dreamcast version, but their weapons have the same moves and fuctions of the already excisting ones. Also the throw moves and bone breaker moves are already owned by MK4 original characters. As for the new fatalities, nothing new either. The MK4 fatalities are some of the best, but the new ones are not impressive here. Save your money if you already own MK4 for Sony PS1 or N64. If you do not own any excisting versions, the needless extras don't hurt I guess.",3.0

"In the spirit of the game itself, let's start this review with an Epic Prologue:

~~1998. One year ago Final Fantasy VII singlehandedly transformed video games forever and ushered in the Golden Age of Square. SquareSoft was now officially a Big Deal. A VERY Big Deal. Super Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, and Final Fantasy VI had all been megahits, but Final Fantasy VII was a phenomenon. The back of the CD cover art says it all: ""Quite Possibly the Greatest Game Ever Made."" Afterwards, Square had just about cemented its reputation as Quite Possibly the Greatest Video Game Designers Ever with a string of successful titles that included Final Fantasy Tactics, Parasite Eve, Einhander, and Bushido Blade. It was like they were incapable of making games that people didn't love. Square was at the top of its game. Its popularity-- and profits-- had never been higher.

But there was one small problem.

There was no avoiding it. It HAD to happen. Square was now faced with the unenviable task of producing a sequel that could live up to and surpass ""Quite Possibly the Greatest Game Ever Made.""

Square had been in the game long enough (so to speak) to know what kind of a situation they were in and what kind of people they were peddling to. An unpopular sequel has the potential to wreck a franchise-- and if it's an especially high-budget sequel and the franchise in question is your main moneymaker, it can sometimes even prove fatal. Square could not afford to screw up Final Fantasy VIII, and any final product less than ""Quite Possibly the Greatest Game Ever Made"" would have constituted screwing up.
~~
Final Fantasy VIII is an aberration. Everyone wondered where the franchise could possibly go after its groundbreaking and apocalyptic seventh installment, but NOBODY could have possibly predicted how VIII would actually turn out. The Materia system-- which was a modification for the Magicite/Relic system-- was swept aside completely and replaced by the Junction system. Armor and accessories vanished; party members now equipped Guardian Forces and spells. Weapon upgrades are no longer necessary. SeeD, the mercenary group for which your characters work, introduces a salary mechanic, making slaying monsters completely irrelevant to earning Gil. Enemies leveled up along with the party. Cutscenes and conversations constituted a far larger portion of the game than ever before, and the exploration and battles the series was built on became far less prominent. The whole package was presented as a vehicle for a new breed of love story. The designers defied expectations the only way that was sure to work: warping and breaking every rule they could, catching everyone off guard and keeping their heads spinning. It's a Gordian solution: if a standard can't be met, CHANGE it instead.

Doing things differently, of course, isn't a fault in itself; but whether the changes are improvements makes a big difference. Just look at what happened with Final Fantasy II. Final Fantasy VIII and its plethora of new concepts and mechanics are much less of a failed experiment than the series' ill-fated second installment, but they're still, at best, a mixed bag.

Final Fantasy VIII is the first entry in the series to use realistically-proportioned character models that remain consistent between field maps and battle screens. In addition to making its cast more realistic in their physical appearances, Final Fantasy VIII also strives to depict them thinking and acting more like actual people instead of exaggerated cartoon characters who rely on gimmicks and archetypes to define themselves.

The game centers mostly around Squall Leonhart, the shining star of Balamb Garden, who is often characterized as a lone wolf who has difficulty expressing himself to others, but it's much easier and a lot more accurate to just say Squall's an enormous jerk. All throughout the game, you're forced to watch him whine and sulk about whatever happens to be bothering him at that moment. People speaking to him annoys him. His friends annoy him. His instructors annoy him. His job annoys him. His fellow students inexplicably look up to him, even though he treats most of them like subhuman mongoloids. On the plus side, Square does an admirable job of fleshing him out. I don't think any game that came out before Final Fantasy explored their protagonists' inner lives so thoroughly. It's a shame that this protagonist happens to be such an unlikable, angst-ridden, jerk.

His love interest for the game is played by Rinoa Heartily (no, really). As ""princess"" of the Forest Owls, a resistance group fighting for Timber's independence from Galbadia, Rinoa commissions SeeD for assistance with the Owls' harebrained schemes. Rinoa is the outsider of the group. She never attended Garden, and isn't a SeeD, (huh, I just got that) like the rest. Rinoa used to bump uglies with Seifer, but she develops a crush on Squall because she evidently has a fetish for self-absorbed jerkwads with gunblades. She has a down-to-earth and impulsive personality, and the only possible way Square could have possibly characterized her any more maladroitly would have been to make Cyndi Lauper play over the soundtrack whenever she appears onscreen.

The rest of the party is sadly somewhat two-dimensional. Quistis is a former SeeD instructor who occasionally acts as an advisor to Squall, but doesn't do much beyond that. The only two emotional states Zell seems capable of are ""OHH YEAH!"" and ""AWW, MAN!!"". And Selphie, the transfer student from Trabia Garden is a typical perky Japanese schoolgirl, who also happens to have paramilitary training. Battle Royale has NOTHING on her. Irvine Kinneas is a sharpshooter from Galbadia Garden who is responsible for some really tense and emotional scenes at the end of Act 1, but then takes the entire rest of the game off afterwards.

Over the course of the game, Squall periodically falls into a dream-like state in which he experiences the world through the eyes of a stranger. This stranger is Laguna, a Galbadian soldier who aspires to be a famous journalist. His wacky misadventures lead him all across the globe until he finally finds himself stuck in Esthar. Laguna is Squall's opposite: clumsy, good-natured, loquacious, and...well, likable.  His character is an intentional throwback to the less brooding and more cartoony heroes of Final Fantasy V and VI. His two level-headed war buddies, Kiros Seagill, and Ward Zabac, also recall JRPG's 16-bit days, when it was excusable to have a character without a complicated backstory or complex psychological motivations to explore. They have cool weapons, even cooler fighting styles, and that is enough. Seriously, screw the main cast. Final Fantasy VIII should have been about these guys.

The main headliner antagonist for the first Act of the game is Sorceress Edea, who received her sorceress powers first at the age of five, and then once again as an adult, thanks to a mix-up involving time travel. It might be worth noting that a terminology change was made in the North American localization of Final Fantasy VIII. The English script refers to Edea as a sorceress, but what she's called in the original Japanese is evidently a lot closer to ""witch."" Interesting choice. ""Witch"" is a bit of a loaded term; Square's American branch probably worried that players would associate it with pointy hats and broomsticks, inadvertently softening the impact of the sleek, stylish, and genuinely menacing trio of Edea, Adel, and Ultimecia. But ""witch"" still might have been the better choice: Possessed Edea's speech and manners are very evocative of the Hans Christian Anderson breed of witch, especially in the scene in which she lures Seifer to her side. (The old woman in the gingerbread house probably spoke to Hansel in the same tones.) And since Final Fantasy VIII's world was designed to have a more predominantly Western feel than previous entries', it makes sense for the game's story to tap into Europe's traditional witch-phobia. Possessed Edea speaking of the populace's deep-seated hatred and fear towards sorceresses isn't terribly evocative; the scene probably would have struck more of a chord with English-speaking audiences had she referred to people hating and fearing witches instead. Ah, well. In any event, the series never had a better villain than it did in the first half of Final Fantasy VIII. She is a mix of the queen from Snow White, Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty, and the stepmother from Cinderella mixed and stirred together with honey and arsenic.

Supporting her is Siefer Almasy, who is talented, self-absorbed, short-tempered, and fiercely independent. Soon after his arrogance costs him his last shot at becoming a SeeD, he defects from Garden to serve as Sorceress Edea's personal knight. He is her bodyguard, commander of her armed forces, and an anti-SeeD bloodhound. When Edea is neutralized, Seifer retains his control of the Galbadian Army and continues to take orders from Ultimecia out of sheer stubbornness - to prove that he was right and will come out on top over Squall in the end.

His rivalry with Squall is one of the games other main highlights. Square knew it had scored a hit with the Cloud and Sephiroth face-off in Final Fantasy VII, so they tried taking the idea a step further in the next game. Cloud and Sephiroth were basically just two guys who happened to get in each other's way, but Squall and Seifer are two sides of a coin. The conflict between them seems so much more fitting and inevitable. They have known each other their entire lives. They use the same weapon. They have polar personalities. Their hair and clothes are opposite colors. They have matching scars. They have both been romantically involved with Rinoa. You could probably say that Seifer comes out the loser because Squall discovers the POWER OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP over the course of the game, while Seifer insists on going off on his own and pushing his friends away from him. Its a shame he has to share the stage with Edea, Adel, and Ultimecia, who all take turns stealing his thunder. And never once does he post a serious threat when you actually face him in battle.

The final foe you go up against is Sorceress Ultimecia, a cruel and vastly powerful foe from the distant future who seeks to achieve Time Compression for incomprehensible reasons only she knows. To accomplish this, she uses a machine to bring her consciousness into the present to possess people and find a girl named Ellone (who is nothing but a plot device that walks and talks) whose unique power can take her even further into the past. Only there, apparently, can she cast the spell that results in the compression of the past, present, and future into a single moment in which only she can exist. Really, I don't have a clue, and I suspect Final Fantasy VIII's writers didn't either. The whole scenario practically screams RUSH JOB. Thanks to some trickery involving Ellone's powers, Squall and the heroes manage to allow Ultimecia to only achieve a partial state of time compression - just enough to let Squall and co. vault into Ultimecia's time period while retaining access to the present-day world map, certain dungeons, the airship, and all the important Triple Triad players from Balamb Garden. Don't ask how it's supposed to make sense. It doesn't. Time Compression was also a great excuse for the producers to slash the production budget for the ending sequence. Why is half of the ending movie made up of distorted and looping FMV clips from earlier in the game? TIME COMPRESSION. If you want a few laughs, check out some of the bigger Final Fantasy fansites out there and watch them try to analyze and explain Time Compression. See what they come up with. It's really surprising how many of them have convinced themselves it's legitimate. To Ultimecia's credit though, her battle is amazing. She puts up a tougher fight than any Final Fantasy end boss yet, including Kefka and Sephiroth.

For all Final Fantasy VII's ambivalence towards urbanization and industrialization, Final Fantasy VIII presents a world of modern, clean, and relatively harmonious European-inspired cities. And whereas Final Fantasy VII's world, sharply divided between pastoral Arcadias and industrialized sprawl, embodied the game's themes, Final Fantasy VIII's sometimes seems like it was designed to be little else than a pretty-looking place for the heroes to run around in. This isn't surprising; Final Fantasy VIII's narrative intentionally directs its focus almost exclusively on its characters rather than any underlying social or environmental messages. The game's cities, ruins, and remote railroad tracks are designed and rendered beautifully, to be sure, but its world often feels a lot less diverse and more compacted than Final Fantasy VII's Planet.

The latest incarnations of the famed Final Fantasy summon monsters are Guardian Forces, independent energy sources that SeeDs capture and junction to their brains (no, really) to augment their fighting abilities. One of the benefits of having an elemental deity living in your head is the ability to manipulate certain types of energy. This skill is called Para-Magic, and was developed as means of giving normal humans a way to counter the ""real"" magic that only sorceresses have access to as descendants of the Great Hyne. It's possible to play through Final Fantasy VIII half a dozen times and still not pick up on this. The game is full of tidbits and plot points like this; in order to really understand what's going on in Final Fantasy VIII, you need to talk to everyone and explore everything. It's a real treat for players who enjoy meticulously exploring every corner of a game, but potentially alienating for those who'd rather just play for an hour or so a day to unwind after class or work.

Speaking of unwinding after work: Triple Triad. This is probably the best minigame in any JRPG to date, and possibly Final Fantasy VIII's most influential aspect. The rules are simple, the matches are quick, and the rewards are great. Since it's low-maintenance and totally optional, casual gamers can play only occasionally and still get some neat stuff out of it. But there are also enough tricky rule changes, special opponents, and rare cards to seek out that the more hardcore audience might actually spend more time in Triple Triad matches than actual battles.

There are multitudes of fans out there who hold Final Fantasy VIII as their favorite game in the series. Fine. I can live with that. After all, the Junction System and Triple Triad are loads of fun, and they're both exclusive to Final Fantasy VIII. But it has come to my attention that there are people out there who love the game for its story. That's something I have a much harder time swallowing.

Even today, video games are still a developing medium. It wouldn't really be fair to sit here and try to compare the love story of Final Fantasy VIII to the multitude of far superior efforts out there. This game's love-themed plot may have fallen short, but you can't say the developers didn't try.  As bad a taste as the Squall/Rinoa melodrama leaves in my mouth, Final Fantasy VIII attempted something that hadn't been done before in video games, and deserves kudos for that.

But what they don't deserve kudos for, is ""Eyes on Me.""

Final Fantasy VIII intended to make the line between video games and cinema even blurrier. Somewhere during the development, it was decided that the game needed a signature theme: a song that do what ""Dont You (Forget About Me)"" did for The Breakfast Club, or that one awful Aerosmith single did for that one awful Bruce Willis flick about asteroids. So Square called up Yu Yamada and Faye Wong, who went on to write and record six minutes of constructed sound so trite and sterile that even Lite FM would be reluctant to spin it. Final Fantasy VIII's signature tune, ""Eyes on Me,"" is as much a love ballad as Grape Drink is a fruit juice. It's comprised of ingredients that are derived from or resemble things you'll find in a good love song, and it almost sort of sounds like one-- but it's really only pretending. ""Eyes on Me"" is a spiritless and artificial affront to music, and should never have been a big a deal as it somehow became.

In the end, I'm still scratching my head here. Final Fantasy VIII succeeds and innovates on so many levels, but fails and trips over itself on just about as many. It has some of the most realistic-looking characters ever seen in video games (at the time of its release), but they still act like two-dimensional cutouts. It has the best party customization system since Final Fantasy V, but the dungeons are short and the enemies easy enough that you could theoretically play through 90% of the game using nothing but GF attacks. ""Premonition"" and ""Vithos Lusec Wenos Vinosec"" are among the best and most evocative tunes ever composed for a video game, but ""Eyes on Me"" is a stinking bottom-feeder. Final Fantasy VIII attempts to blend video games and cinema; the result is half above-average video game and half evil omen of things to come (Final Fantasy Spirits Within). The list goes on.

Final Fantasy VIII isn't really a step forward for the series, but not a step backwards, either. It's a hop to the side; a change of direction of an even greater scale than the false start in Final Fantasy II or the steampunk Renaissance of VI. This is the new face of Final Fantasy. From now on, expect the norm to be Japanese teen-idol heroes, millions' worth of eye-popping special effects, epic Hollywood storylines, and a general sense of substance being overidden by style and high-end fluff. Success can sometimes be the worst thing to happen to a creative outfit.",3.0
"This game was...my first ever introduction to Final Fantasy back in the days when the internet started becoming commonplace (circa 2000-2001). I was first introduced to it after playing the great Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time since I was new to the plethora of RPGs out at the time. I have gone back and played this game many times since then. I give it credit for bringing me in but I do not deem it the best Final Fantasy game. Let's start with the pros.

PROS
For PS1 graphics, the character and monster modeling was really good. They everything seem more realistic by having the characters' heights and widths proportional during and outside of battles. The animations during battle had more detail than Final Fantasy 7. For example, looking at a Tonberry from FF7 and comparing it to FF8 I could see more detail and texture in FF8. The Full motion video cut scenes were also really nice to look at. Everything looked smooth and transitions to the normal graphics weren't terrible to watch.

Having the ability to summon your espers (Guardian Forces) during battle an endless amount of times assuming it was still alive, could help during some of the more difficult battles (Con on this aspect mentioned later).

Easy to level up for those who get tired of that aspect and know where to find the right enemies (i.e. Vysage, Lefty, and Righty in that one gorge on the Galbadia Continent).

A vast selection of spells and abilities.

Challenging Sidequest Boss fights (but not impossible)

The music was awesome. There may have been a few tracks here or there could drive one nuts (Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec playing in the sewers at the end of disc 1)

Now let's talk about the Cons. These will outweigh the pros.

CONS

The junction system.
I don't hate on this setup completely because it could employ strategy. There is no MP like in the most other FF games. You draw and stock magic from enemies and warp points to boost your stats, elemental defense, and status defense but you have to watch which spells you use and how often or your stats will suffer. Leveling up doesn't seem to affect your character growth much. For example, junctioning 100 Ultimas to the strength of a level 15 character could produce better results than raising that character's level to 100. Character levels truly come into effect when determining the strength of the monsters since they level as you do. But this can make story line bosses less challenging.

The drawing.
So, you go into a battle against a caterpillar creature and you see spells like Thunder and Cure that you ""need."" Your goal as an RPG player is to make your characters the best they can be. So to do that you stand there and draw the spells that you want/need. But you realize that the more you have the better you'll become. Thus, you will take 1, 2, or all 3 characters available and just draw the limitless amount Thunder and Cure spells to fill up your 100 stock limit. All the while being smacked, or chewed on by this giant bug. It's damage is minor and if you see your HP getting super low just cast a Cure spell on yourself and you are good to go! 10 to 15 minutes later you have 100 stock of each spell for each character... Now let's do that again with a different enemy and for different spells. Oh wait, some characters only draw a few at a time while others draw a larger amount (up to 9) per turn. Gee, their magic skill just sucks! You will spend hours just drawing magic to junction to your stats and never use for fear of weakening your character. Later in the game you will be able to Refine magic from items in vast quantities but even still if an enemy has a spell you don't have access to right there and then (cough meteor cough aura) chances are you will spend the time drawing to have it for ""just in case measures."" I could go on and on with this but this drawing really is nothing but busy work.

The summons:
Yes it's neat to interact with them more often than previous games but that can be a huge detriment. They are best known for helping you learn abilities. The game has an algorithm where you get your money based on the steps you take around the world and it goes up the more monsters you defeat. At the same time it will go down by a set amount if you haven't battled enough and just walk around aimlessly for hours in circles. You have to keep battling to maintain it at the highest salary given. The catch is if a summon defeats the enemies you don't get the credit for it. It has be done by your party members. This makes the summoning less appealing. Granted there will be times you will feel the need to let loose the destructive power of Bahamut or Doomtrain but at later points in the game your characters can become so strong that it would be a waste of time to summon. Plus, your character has a compatibility with each summon and it goes up or down with every summon depending on which spells you cast and other summons you use. Need to use Shiva on a Bomb? Go ahead but every time you do, Ifrit will be harder to summon! Some people will just save them for the boss battles but either your characters will be at a decent stat level after all the drawing or the instant you summon a GF some bosses will go ballistic on the summoner and severely hurt or kill your GF. The abilities are useful and come in a wide range but until you find the right places to get the ability points for each ability faster (Cactuar Island) it will be a long wait before getting Encounter None or Call Shop. How do you even get these summons? Most if not all are optional and minus a few, you just draw them from boss battles. I would have preferred the old ways and actually fought to have them at my side.

The story:
I won't give too much away if there is someone out there who wants to play it for the story and overall experience to make their own conclusions.
The overall idea  about time travel and tragic love stories intertwined are intriguing and it has left some open ended areas for fans to speculate how it all began or why it all ended the way it did. Was it all a dream? Was she the future evil form an alternate timeline? But there are some plot holes that really drove me nuts. If these young adults can summon almighty beings to fight off the evils of the world, why haven't they done so already? Let's sneak in and assassinate a powerful figure with a sniper rifle. Wait, why not just summon Ifrit to throw a giant flaming meteor at her and kill her on the spot? Three discs saved! This could be a complaint with other Final Fantasy games (like 7). The difference here is that you can summon these things in battle multiple times until they, you, or the monsters on the other side are dead. In FF5 and prior you were limited to your MP pool and you could argue that ""with great power come great responsibility"" and that could carry over to realism. In FF6, espers could only be summoned once per battle and with the required MP. In FF7, up to 5 times (ignoring the master materia stuff from sidquests) but still you were limited to your MP pool. It was a basic stratagem of conserving your resources for the right times. This could roll over into the story and play parts into why the characters made the decisions that they did. Where is that conservation in FF8? Ifrit can rain fire down on people so long as he stays alive. It doesn't tax Squall's health, stamina, or magic stock to do so. If there were seemingly realistic limits in place (like using a set amount of fire spells to summon Ifrit each time) maybe I could get behind it more.

And then there's the part where one character appears at the end of the first disc and it takes him a full disc to reveal that he knows who everyone is except for one person, how they grew up together a long time ago, and how the evil they are fighting is someone dear to them from their childhood. WHY WASN'T THIS TOLD WHEN THEY TRIED TO ASSASSINATE THE NOW EVIL PERSON? No justifiable reason is given. The others forgot thanks to the use of the summons and how it affects their memory. This was barely explained at all but even if it that works why would the one person who remembered everything not try to tell them something rather important? If there had been more thought put into this being plausible like he had amnesia and being around everyone stirred up memories, that would at least scrape the barrel. The problem again was that he knew the whole time because he didn't use the GFs...GAHHHH. Noah Antwiler was right.

There are a lot of other things to nitpick about here like how a prominent non-playable character allows you to see the past and tries to change it for the better knowing it is futile and not having their powers ever given an explanation on how they got them or why they got them...but I have droned on long enough.

For me, if you leave out the story, the game play with battling can employ some strategy to a point but by amassing enough money, finding all the right places to level abilities, and go to  the right shops, you can buy and refine rare items to boost stats and abilities to near or at max. As an addition I forgot about the card mod ability that can turn enemies into cards and you can refine items from them (like the morph materia in FF7). So, just for game play and experimenting, it's not a terrible game but it definitely is not the best>

If you leave out the battle system and look at the story alone, it has some serious plot holes and would require fan speculation to fill those in. It has prompted a lot of thought on my part to fill in the voids. But part of that is the beauty of it. Love it or hate it, this game has given a lot fan speculation and theories on who these people are, their backstories, and their future stories. I am ignoring the fanboys and fangirls jumping on the ""Emo-coolness"" of Squall. I can appreciate and understand Squall's motives and like his design and abilities but it's a rehash of Cloud from FF7 only with a more involved love story. Cloud and Tifa shared feelings with each other but it was more of companionship and sibling-""hood."" I don't recall them falling in love with each other to the point of boyfriend and girlfriend. Final Fantasy 8 is not the best game of the series but like I said before it actually brought me into the series so I have to pay it homage. I give it a 6/10.",3.0

Quake3 has the best multiplayer deathmatch ever, There is not a single dull moment as you keep seeking and destroying your friends or enemies before they get you.

I have both Unreal tournament and Quake 3. Even though I like Q3 I think UT is a better choice. Single player in Q3 totally lacks.. it gets old quickly. The multiplayer is nearly unplayable unless you have something better than 56k or something over a 600mhz processor. Don't get Q3 if you have less than a 500mhz processor..unless you have a VERY good video card. You won't be able to enjoy Q3's best quality..GRAPHICS. Im not putting Q3 down it's a revolutionary game and a good high action deathmatch... I still enjoy playing it online with other people. But check out Unreal Tournament first. UT beats Q3 in most aspects.,3.0
"Final Fantasy 8 begins with a CG video so impressive, you think yet again Squaresoft has managed to create an excellent RPG adventure. The opening sequence switches between an intense swordfight between the game's hero, Squall, and his archenemy, Seifer, and scenes of Squall's soon to be lover, Rinoa, dancing through a field of flowers. It's artfully done, and very exciting. However, the results of said battle are underwhelming. Both men receive as wounds a scratch on the cheek, which happens to deliver Squall to the hospital. And so, in a matter of moments, the game switches from awesome to disappointing that its hero is such a wimp. Despite some triumphs in the graphics area, FF8's lame story, uninteresting characters, and step away from the traditional RPG norm make it a forgettable experience.

The main problem comes from the game's plot, which wouldn't be so bad if cutscenes weren't so long and there weren't boring and cliched characters populating the story (the only non-human characters in the game are enemies). Squall is a Cloud wanna-be, only he takes his role a little too far. He becomes an emo, depressed teenager who delves too much into his own thoughts to notice that the game's three beautiful female characters all have feelings for him. Right. Squall, along with his archenemy Seifer, is a student at a school called SeeD, whose purpose is to train teens to fight and undergo secret missions. Seifer is a much more childish version of the frightening Sephiroth from FF7. He bullies fellow students by calling them ""chicken-wuss,"" rebels by not wearing the school uniform, and intimidates his teacher. Just an immature little punk if you ask me. The other characters include Quistis, the teacher barely older than her students; Zell, the friend easily fumed by such comments as ""chicken-wuss;"" Selphie, the vivacious girl who tries to be so cute and air-headed it's annoying; Irvine, the cliched ladies' man that can't get the ladies; and last but not least, Rinoa - who finally gets Squall out of his thoughts of himself and into thoughts of her. I would have liked it more if the characters were mature teenagers rather than your cliched self-absorbed ones.

FF8 takes a stab at a rather unique combat system, which is great, but the problem is it doesn't work very well. You don't get money or weapons the traditional way. The money part is pretty neat. You earn a weekly paycheck through employment with SeeD, and you earn more money by being promoted to a higher rank. The weapons part is a problem, however. The only way to earn stronger weapons is by taking material to junk shops and having it made into a weapon. The problem is the game doesn't give you these items very easily. You can only retrieve these items by fighting monsters that have what you need. Problem is, you can't know what monsters have which items unless you glue yourself to a strategy guide. For those who want to play the game without a guide, or those who don't want to spend their time fighting monsters and hoping they'll drop the item you need, you'll probably finish the game still equipped with the game's weakest weapons.

Not upgrading your weapons means you'll only do minimal damage with them, so you will want to look to other sources of damage. There is magic, but magic doesn't operate on MP and is limited. It's more like a usable item, and the only way to get higher quantities of said items is by drawing it from enemies. Plus, if you junction certain spells to your characters, you most likely don't want to use those spells in combat. That leaves the Guardian Forces. These summons can do a lot of damage, and while you are waiting for them to be summoned, they protect the summoner from attacks. The GFs will carry you through the game, though they have the drawback of having to sit through sometimes lengthy summon sequences every battle. Making matters worse is the experience system. Every 1000 experience points earns your character a level, but the worst part is that enemies grow levels with you. This wouldn't be so bad, but it means random battles last longer than they should.

"first off i am still glad i bought this gameboy! i love it. However i wish it didn't come with so many scrathces and also it had left over sticker residue on the battery cover. It could have arrived in a better shape. also the volume knob might have a short because when i plug in my headphones into the system and i mess with the volume it fades from left to right ear with an annoying sound. Its a minor detail though. also the speaker is not very loud at all, like its super quite. not sure if its because of my batteries and i just need to replace them. I still love it thought! great color! feels great in your hands. off to go save Zelda!",3.0

"The improvements of the graphics are very good, quake engines are always constructed well in sounds and graphics, being a reason of buying a new graphic card most of the time.  But this time, in terms of playability, it wasn't quite a succes for Quake.  I don't have any complaints about the lack of the single player mode, I play quake multiplayer most of the time.  Bots are ok, if you want to play in single.  The problem is quake 3 turns out to be a game that rookies have more advantage.  It is easier to frag than quake and quake II, and I don't get the same quake pleasure I used to get.  It is not a bad game.  Even a good one for somebody new to multiplayer first person shooters, but for an experienced player, it is a disillusionment.  I'll continue to play quake2 and counterstrike, but when I'm in need of some more blood, it is still a good game.",3.0
"This game is great as far as death match play goes.  It has great  graphics, the game play commentaries are a nice touch but what is missing  is the sense of a real challenge.
Don't get me wrong.  I have been  playing this game ever since it was called Wolfenstein 3D. But Id should  have put some sort of mission to go along with the great gameplay and  graphics.  It took me only three days of regular play (about 90minutes a  day) to go through the game at the ""hurt me plenty"" level. Versus  the weeks spent on Q2 and Half-life.
Unless you have cable or DSL or  planning to throw many LAN parties, you might feel you are not getting your  monies worth.",3.0
"Probably the least good among the pre-online Final Fantasies.

THE GOOD:
- Mood and ambience.  The visuals, soundtrack and storyline are pretty emotionally cohesive, though all of those have their problems.
- Improved graphics over FF7, but whatever.
- The card game, though that was kind of a mixed bag for me.  I liked collecting the cards; I really liked winning the most important cards from important characters (though it's odd to play Edea's husband twenty rounds after you find him on this barren rock and he tells you the whole sad story of blah de blah etc.)  What I didn't like was that new rules became a permanent part of the game as you played people in different regions.  And that the AI--particularly in the little guys in the domed village--seemed at times poised to really screw you.

THE CONCRETELY BAD
- The requirement that you synthesize your new weapons is kind of annoying.  It also doesn't particularly matter whether you do, because of problems with the GF/Junction system outlined next.
- You equip spells (counted in straight quantity, which is weird) instead of equipment.  They correspond directly to your stats, as in, you can manipulate your own HP.  This is a problem because a) it almost defeats the purpose of earning gold, since you aren't buying armor, accessories, etc; b) You can't equip and use the best spells at the same time unless you want your stats fluctuating significantly mid-battle; and c) the fact that you can refine the best curative spells early in the game and attach them to your HP makes it so you can have 3000+ HP by the time you take on your fifth boss.
- Because you don't get decent spells for your Attack stats until relatively late in the game, you spend most of your battles repeatedly summoning GFs (during which time you hold select, watch for an icon and mash the square button).
- Enemies level up alongside you.  Looks good on paper, but in the end you have something like 50 regular enemies, compared to several hundred in previous titles.
- The world map is almost totally wasted.  There are maybe two or three instances where you need to travel somewhere new on foot.  There are almost no points of interest.  The huge and elaborate continent that takes up the world's whole eastern half is a grey steppe with a city in the middle.  The waste is especially annoying because it looks so pretty.",3.0
"Well, I don't know happened but when I received the game - the game's cover art was broken :/ !",3.0
This game was kind of disappointing. I am not sure if it was the story line or the characters themselves that did or did not do it for me. Aside from the beautiful cut scenes and graphics this game left me feeling sort of aching to play a good rpg. Which is sad because this is a Final Fantasy game and I should not feel like that after having playing it.,3.0
"I have to admit I've been a bit of an Unreal fan in the Quake/Unreal debate over the years. Sinlge player wise, mulitplayer and engine. I prefered Unreal to Quake 2 single player but liked Unreals bright graphics  better. Quake II Multiplayer was the nuts!
When Quake 3 came out I found  I had played the Unreal Tournement Demo more when I first got that!  It  doesn't detract from a great game but any game I can complete in one  evening (on level 3), leaving me wondering if I can be bothered to do it  all again on a higer level, doesn't warrant a classic game for me.
The  engine is the best ever and the bots are gorgeous as is the level design.  It just lacks the cutting edge that UT has and I'm still playing that now.  I do go back to Quake 3 to make a change to UT but having completed it in  one evening I really cant be asked to go all the way back and do it on a  harder setting - The lastability just isn't there. Still a great game  though - just not as good as Unreal tournement (demo!) HA!",3.0
"I admit that I was one of those nailbiters waiting eargerly for Q3 to be released. When I got it running, I was more than a little unhappy with the single player mode. It is completely different than what you got from Q1  and Q2. In single player mode, you fight in.. well.. simulated deathmatches  with computer bots. Now, when I read this on the back I thought 'Gee.. What  a great idea.' Unfortunately, most of the bots act like what they are:  Computers. The scripting on these things is way too linear. Not to mention  that the difficulty settings are completely out of whack. The second to  hardest (hardcore) is almost impossible, even for a seasoned deathmatcher,  while the nightmare setting is absolutely impossible. My final complaint is  this. Why am I holding the same double barrel shotgun and rocket launcher  from all the other quakes? The game offers only 2 new weapons.. which is  sad.
Now, There are positive aspects of the game. The fun-factor of a 8  player human deathmatch is unbeatable. If you have the means to play in one  of these with Q3 you can expect all the fun as from the previous versions..  Of course, you will need a fast internet connection or a local area network  to do this.
All in all, Quake3 was.. Ok. It saddend and disappointed me  that the loss of a storyline did not produce life-like and enjoyable bots  in single player. However, mulitplayer is still a riot. You want a good  single player first person shooter? Get Soldier of fortune.. You will not  me disappointed.",3.0
"The grafics are good but the one thing i did not like about it was that you could only frag poeple and you have to have more than one player to play the game. So i give this game three stars.

"This review will be cut very short. the graphics are good...very good...but not many graphics cards can handle it on middle graphics resolutions. Gameplay is OK. It gets boring after a while. Basiclly this  game was over hyped, and you'll need one heck of an internet connection to  run this game smoothly online. Don't expect this game to hold your  attention for a long period of time.",3.0
"I love Id, I am very glad they made this game but not because i actually wanted to play it. I knew that what we really got from Quake3 (Q3) was a new Engine. And thats important for the games to come in the next year and  beyond. This graphics engine is excellent, John and the boys are masters of  engine creation. But they have dropped the ball on EVERY other aspect of  this game. The multiplayer connection in very difficult compared to Unreal  Tournment (UT). UT makes finding and joining a game as easy as Diablo di so  many years ago. I was looking forward to seeing some new guns in Q3, I  figured since Unreal Trumped Quake with wepons (duel-mode of fire) they  would have went with all new and creative wepons. Not so they are virtually  unchanged, don't expect anything new here. For the rest of the review i will  just list each game and which is better in that catagory:
  Graphics -  Q3 This new engine is awesome and kills the now dated Unreal engine.
  Wepons-  UT - A clear winner here Unreal has great wepons and you can fire  each one in 2 ways with the right or left button and get a different effect  for each. Effectively doubling your wepons. And the sniper rifle is a must  have for a game like this I wouldnt want to live without one (even if I get  my head blown off and have no idea where my enemy is from time to time)
  Bots - UT wins hands down. If not just for the reason that the Q3 bots  CHEAT. They can track you and that is not fair at all. UT bots can do hit  and runs work ijn groups and lay down covering fire for their teamates. The  UT AI is superior.
  Levels - UT Wins again, while Q3 levels are  beautiful the UT levels are ORIGINAL. They include battles on space  stations and a space city where the gravity is reduced and you can jump  from building to building. There are oils rigs a pirate ship interior of  space ships etc. Much more diversity and FUN.
  Multiplayer - UT  wins again, the menu system for finding the game you want to play is  superior to Q3. In UT You don't have to pick throught every server to find a  team deathmatch for example you just click on the ""Team deathmatch  Tab"" and you have a list of every server for that type of game. In Q3  they all are under one tab and you have to look for the type of game you  want. I also had ALOT of lag with Q3, but in UT i never seem to get ANY lag  (Using a 56k modem).
Bottom line is: if you you have a good GForce card  and want a game that can actually use it then get Q3, but if you want to  have fun and play the current king of FPS' then get UT you will not be  dissiponted.
I almost forgot, UT has a built in system for logging ALL  you frags and does so automatically. Just be sure to enter a password and  pick a single user name, always join the games with the UT tracking  ""Enabled"" (Most Games) and  EVERY kill, death health pack etc  will be permently and automatically recorded. A very nice feature.",3.0
"Quake III could be an awesome game. I bought it for multiplayer and tried to use it, everytime i get on it says ""connection interrupted"" and freezes up. I have contacted customer service and they weren't to  helpful. I wouldn't recomend buying it for multiplayer unlessd you have a  cable modem, which aren't available here. Single player doesn't cut it. If  you're lucky enough to have a cable modem this is a great game

"The graphics on Q3 seems to be slightly (reads very, very slightly; asymptotically so) superior than UT, but that is where the positive comparisons for Q3 stops.  UT's map is a lot more creative (including such  settings as a moving train, underwater base, and an old wooden ship), and  the variety of options other than deathmatch (capture the flag, assult,  etc.) puts Q3 to shame.  Other than the nice upgrade in sound and graphics,  Q3 is just same ole.
If you appreciate long lasting playability and can  only buy one game in this genre, UT, I submitt, should be your choice.",3.0
"Quake 2, even without the 3d card, is possibly the greatest game of all time. Until two years ago, it was turrican on the cbm Amiga, but a couple of letters - id - turned that all upside down. Secrets, skills, intelligent enemies, depth depth depth. And that's what Q3 lacks. Depth. What you get  at the beginning is what you'll end up with when you're through. Perhaps  you'll be a little better, but the game is too sporadic. Q2 made me lose  sleep; Q3 makes me want to sleep. It's a cracker, and better than Q1, but  if there's going to be a fourth, let's have two versions. One for the  multiplayer freaks, and one for the insomniacs - the 'true' players.",3.0
"I had been looking forward to Quake 3 for ages and if it had been released without Unreal Tournament biting at it's heels all would have been well. Unfortunately Quake has really not offered anything new, brilliant graphics  and sound but take that away and you have nothing thrilling, even the  weapons are the same old thing.
UT is a much more interesting and unique  game...",3.0
"I'm not going to go too in-depth as it has been done to death already - just giving my two cents as I recently decided to play my huge backlog of RPG games.

To the good:
As an avid rpg player, I found that the most important part of the genre is the story, and this game does not disappoint. The whole piece is a cinematic love story with various plot twists to make it interesting to find out what happens next. The graphics were beyond phenomenal for its time and has hold up pretty well over the ages due to its pre-rendered back grounds. The CG as most reviews have said, are a work of art. Music are up to the veteran composer's standards and the new Junction system is an interesting departure from the norm.

To the bad:
The only thing about this game IS the story. There is nothing to ""Role-Play"" in this game. None of the choices I make have any lasting decisions and I am just left pressing the okay button to literally tens of minutes (if not more) of dialogue and in-game cut-scenes (which are admittedly gorgeous) before the next few random battle/boss battle only to repeat it over and over again - I am not kidding about this either - let me interact and play! It's called a ""game"" not a ""book"". You also can't really explore the world until late in the game, every area is off-limits until the appropriate time it's introduced. You can't modify your equipment as readily as you were able to in previous games and there is little point to the weapons themselves as the entire battle system seems to revolve around the Junction/GF system (Unless of course, you're doing limit breaks). Magic too is not as effective as the GF system - which is another fault on its on:

  As beautiful as it is to see these gargantuans of magic come to life to slay my enemies, each summoning takes around 30secs, and there is no turning off this animation - the worse part is that the amount of damage they do does not correlate in any way to the amount of time it takes to summon them. This means that every random battle (and there are a LOT until you learn the appropriate skills) takes about some amount of time to finish just due to the summoning animation.

I had some high hopes for this game as I really enjoyed the preceding games in this series - overall, it's not a BAD game as some would suggest, but it's nowhere as addicting or fun as it could've been.",3.0
"In my opinion, I like Unreal Tournament better.  Now, this is my opinion and I shall explain it.  Quake 3 is no doubt a great game, but it falls short in my mind.  The largest problem with Q3 is the lack of tactical  skill required.  I sat at a hall conjunction, shot missiles down the  corridors and killed 3 people in 4 seconds.  Why?  1) The weaponry is . . .  well, destructive, to the extreme.  Guns either explode in a huge manner,  or shoot an absurdly amount of rounds in under a second.  It's reasonably  easy to kill people,  Worse? You know how the rocket launcher was god in  the first Quake?  Then, they fixed it in Q2?  Well, it's worse (or better,  however you put it) than it was in Q1.  It is purely, THE weapon to use.  2) The levels are small things.  Maybe this is preferance, but it's nice to  have variety.  I believe there should be levels where you encounter someone  every 5 seconds, and levels where you have to make an effort at hunting  your opponents. Now, as far graphics and models.  I don't really care,  graphics are graphics, gameplay is what defines a GREAT game in my opinion.  If anything, I admire UT designers for holding off on the thick eye candy  for the sake of performance.  Models could be nice, to help define the  opponent.  But, when you are pointed at someone in UT, the name appears to  help identify them.  . As for the ""real feeling.""  Well, Q3  probably feels like that because of the tight levels and the fact that once  someone gets a hold of the Rocket Launcher, everyone's like ""Get the  GD rocket launcher away from <insert person>!""  Now, as for  originality, HA.  UT and Q3 BOTH fall short.  They go by the standard  concept of point, shoot, unload 50 rounds into opponent to kill.  Now, if  you like that, fine, play them.  But, games that are really pioneering the  way to 3d Multiplayer gaming is games like Rogue Spear, and Rainbow 6.  Also, Team Fortress 2 will come out.  I believe that TF2 will outright wipe  the floor with UT and Q3.",3.0
"After playing the full version of QIII and the Demo of Unreal Tournament, I would have to say that there are many areas of GT's Blockbuster Multiplayer game that beat the heck outta Quake III.
  Graphics:  Quake III requires a powerhouse computer to milk out the graphics pictured  on the outside of your box.  Unless you have a PIII or 450 or higher PII  with a good Riva TNT 2 Ultra board or better, don't expect much.  UT was so  much better graphically on my 350 PII than Quake III, not to mention that  the level layout in UT is awesome.
  The Game:  Single player in QIII  is both nonexistant and totally horrid. This, for activision's standards,  could have been so much better, and as for multiplayer, Quake III has but  one option...deathmatch.  UT has much better options and a large variety of  game types other than deathmatch (i.e. capture the flag, domination, team  deathmatch).
  My Opinion:  I gave this a 3 stars because although  Quake does have some nice touches like character skins, awesome weapons,  nice sound effects and textures, and other things here and there...There  are just too many things that are wrong about this game, when compared to  UT, to rate it any higher.  The single player, the multiplayer, the  interface, the levels, and many other areas of UT, even just from what I  saw in the Demo of UT, are much better laid out.
  The Good:  Lives up  to the Quake rep.
  The Bad:  Very little Replay, Hardware Reqs too  high
  Recommendation:  If your computer is NextGen and you love the  Quake series for the Multiplayer, then you'll enjoy this game.  If you're  looking for a good quality game with high replay value and awesome  gameplay, For the love of god stay away from QIII and get Unreal  Tournament.  Save yourself the Agony!  GET UNREAL TOURNAMENT...Enjoy!",3.0
"That's funny - I've got a Voodoo3 3000 and the game looks fantastic.  However, it's missing something --- fun.  The weapons are weak at best and the game generally feels like you're controlling a lead brick.  Stay away  from it - it's a proven fact that playing Quake 3 is detrimental to one's  Unreal Tournament skills.",3.0
"I don't know why users rate UT way above this title. UT uses more textures to make up for lack of advanced geometry (more slow swaps), still has spotty networking code, and more sluggish overall play over net (mine on  cable speeds). Its weapons are way cooler, though.
QuakeIII may still be  the overall winner, but only just, with more varied and subtly balanced  multiplay design. The bots are predictable, but impressively adaptable.  However, the weapons are the same old, which adds to the all pervasive  quake fatigue.",3.0
"Final Fantasy VIII was a beautiful game for the first Playstation. It has likeable characters and a good storyline, by video game standards. The thing is, the battle system is terrible. It's not fun to play (which is the whole point of video games), and the Guardian Forces (summoned monsters) scenes are cool the first few times, but take forever and can't be skipped.

Is realistic to expect Square/Enix to remake the title with a different battle system? Something more akin to FF X?",3.0
"Well, here is review number three of this game from me.  I just finished it over the weekend, and it's good, but that's all.  True, the graphics during battle are somewhat better than the original ""Starfleet Academy"", but there's less interaction in this game.  You don't even get to see Torlek's face, like you saw David Forrester's, and you don't get to do a tour of the bridge either.  As I keep saying, I hope they come out with another Academy game with other worthy adversaries.
I'll say this as well:  You have a hard time getting through this game without the players guide.  Get it if you haven't already.
One other thing, when are they going to release ""The Secret of the Vulcan Fury""?  That game was advertised with ""Starfleet Academy"", and we've never seen it.  As far as I know, all the voice overs were completed, even before DeForrest Kelley passed away.  That's a game I'm waiting to see.
All in all, many of the latest ""Star Trek"" games have not been that great.  ""Klingon Academy"" was good, but I would not call it the best of them.  As the phrase goes, ""Buyers beware!""",3.0
"Finally, they're getting Star Trek right. This is a thoroughly enjoyable  game, with incredible graphics and wonderful (if not always engrossing)  sound. There are a number of significant, but not crippling, flaws which  mar an otherwise great game, but for Trekkies and sci-fi sim fans, this is  definitely a game to get.
The gameplay here is solid and easy to  understand. The designers understand that you're flying a capital ship, not  a snub fighter, and the physics reflect that through lethargic turns and  gradual accel/decel curves. Even though this may sound like it would lead  to slow and boring gameplay, it's anything but. The tension builds and I've  found myself squirming, trying to get my targets lined up for that perfect  shot--a great feeling of satisifaction when I succeed.
The controls are  easy to understand, but slightly cumbersome to use. Though innovate, the  VOS (Voice Order System) takes too long to utilize during the middle of the  battle. VOS relies on the use of the keypad to issue orders and to  distribute power to the ships various systems, and between maneuvering your  behemoth mass of destructive power, and then using that power to blast your  enemies, you just don't have a third hand to play with shields, weapon  charge rates, damage control, and countless other things. Hotkeys are  available, scattered through the keyboard, but they are far from intuitive  and too numerous to quickly memorize.
The designers tried to compensate  by creating Power Macros, and it's a great move. Using the F1-F8 keys, and  a control board under the Engineers screen, you can define preset levels  for all of your ships systems based on the tactics you plan to employ.  Which is fantastic... if the battle goes the way you plan. Still, the Power  Macros enable the player to quickly redistribute power during the middle of  battle, a vital necessity, but one that looses the need to quickly change  small details (like overcharging weapons after you've made your approach  under cloak for a devastating first strike.)
The graphics are incredible,  with fantastic debris fields and damage representation. Blast a photon  torpedo into the enemies hull and see the flames consume the decks. The  movies are equally well done, but are prone to stuttering (you'd think  they'd have this problem fixed by now.) Yet when the movies do stutter, you  don't loose any of the lines, it just keeps repeating until moving out of  the trap.
The sound is well done, with quality music and a delightful  environmental background during battles, but will occasionally cut out  without reason. Other reviewers have had this problem as well, and it just  seems to be a problem in need of patching, as reducing the demands on the  soundcard make no difference.
The game has also caused the system to  freeze up on occasion, and blue screens on exiting are common. All of these  bugs are typical of Interplay productions, in my experience, and I got  Klingon Academy expecting them to be there in one form or another. And,  ironically enough, that's testimony to how good this game is. Despite these  problems, it's a great game, and the gameplay isn't seriously affected by  these problems.
In summary, there's nothing particularly revolutionary  about this game except the fact that they finally got the Star Trek genre  right. There's a great feel to the game, and a good plot line to carry you  through it. The gameplay is solid and easy to understand, if a little  cumbersome during the middle of battle. And the bugs in the most basic of  program functionality (ala Interplay's legacy) are really unfortunate as  they add frustration to what is otherwise a great experience--I'd have  given 4 stars if it weren't for these.

"Its good to see that Christopher Plummer and David Warner decided to  reprise their roles as General Chang and Chancellor Gorkon. The cutscenes  with them are fantastic with performances that rival the movie. Seeing them  alone might make several Star Trek fans want to purchase the game. However,  the other actors are not as polished, which may be of some concern to some  gamers.
The game allows you to fly eight different Klingon ships with  various weapons and power levels for each vessel. This is one of the  highlights of the game, as you get to destroy the enemies of the Empire  with several cool-looking ships. The enemies of the Empire include the  Federation, Romulans, the Gorn, Tholians, and the Shakurians(?). There are  about twenty-five missions in the game, so no gamer can really complain  about the game being too short. The graphics are good, but it looks a  little dated. Maybe this is because the game was over a year late. How  sad!
The game does suffer from some bugs. First, the enemy ships have a  tendency to try to ram your vessel. This is extremely annoying and  frustrating at the same time. This has been a problem for many gamers, and  you should be aware of this if you want to purchase the game. Also, you  need to be aware that Interplay will no longer offer any support for this  game. The design team has been broken up to work on other projects. So if  your expecting updated patches and expansion packs then you can simply  forget it.",3.0
Ummmm where do I start yeah this game isn't that great how everyone loves ff7 and ff8 and you know what those two in my opinion there not that great there really boring so I mean if you like ff then try it out I bought it many years ago and I still haven't finished it,3.0
"I picked up this title, a good ways back. It was a Final Fantasy I had played when it was new and then lost access to. So, being somewhat of a game collector (my series of choice to collect is Final Fantasy and Armored Core) I picked up this one pretty cheap on amazon. The gameplay itself is pretty much standard fair, of when JRPGs or Final Fantasy's were still you know. Good. I'm sorry, I can't stand in any way shape or form the horrible ATB system that Square seems to have such a hard on for in their semi turn based gameplay. I couldn't stand it in X, was even worse in X-2. (I can't call it ""10, 2"" It's degrading) and guess what horrible thing they are including in 13? Yep you guessed it.

Twelve gets a reprieve from this sentence because of the Gambit System and the fact that unlike 7, 10, and X-2 it actually has a plot worth mentioning. But I will get back on target now.

My biggest problem with Eight, is it has a large slew of Happy coincidence that would make even Charles Dickens cry. I mean seriously, damn.  Squall being well...Squall... ugh. Why couldn't this game be about Laguna instead? *head desk.. head goes through desk* Squall continues the paradigm set by Cloud, in that they have to stick the worst or one of the worst characters in the game, as the main character. Because the guy that makes the 7+ (Tactics, IX and XII aside) can't write good characters up as protagonists to save his life. I hate, squall. Really hate Squall. Almost as much as Selphie.. No scratch that.. more than Selfie.

Unfortunately as Squall is a core component of the game he drags down what could have been a good story down to mediocre. Every other character in this game is far better than he is in terms of character development. The plot itself is standard fanfare of a group of mercs, end up fighting some evil big bad thing bent on world domination/destroying the world (I'm trying not to spoil things here), and discover their significance in the greater scheme of things as the story progresses.

So they have a solid working core for the story, and the secondary characters stories are fairly well constructed.... but Squall... again rears up his head and smites the story down from any high heights this solid foundation can achieve. Just like Cloud.

The battle system can be turned into turn based combat (which given that there are no AI scripts for Allies, is a very good thing), thankfully. But there are hints of cracks in the franchise's integrity that appear in this game.

I think personally these cracks were evident in 7 in abundance but the majority of gamers were too busy doing naughty things to themselves over 3-D graphics to notice. 8's coming out did not receive the fan fare because by the time it came out Gamers were used to 3-D. These cracks become larger as the series progresses. At first of course it's the little things _like those Dickens Coincidences) and a poor main character... Later it becomes things like basic premise and story. All in the trade off for shinier and shinier graphics. And of course stupid gamers buy more and more into this.

My biggest beef with 8 is that reviewing it Four Games Down Later, that honestly you can see the start of Square's fall with it. And that fall started when they let go of the original Final Fantasy creator.

Eight should however be cherished though, as it in my mind is one of a dying breed. Good JRPGS. JRPGS in general need to smack themselves silly and ditch the TROPES they have been running with for umpteen years, Japan is quickly losing relevance on the stage of the gaming world, because quite frankly American and European Rpgs decided ""you know what? let's make a good story, rock solid characters, and an enjoyable non turn based experience"" And you know what? You can't argue with the results. I doubt anyone would disagree with me when I say this. Mass Effect and KOTOR are some of the best rps ever. Fable II easily blows the post 6 FF series out of the water.

So don't hate on Eight. Hate on it's maker. There is alot of gold left in 8 to be enjoyed all of these years later. There's still rock solid gameplay, a good enough to get the job done story (Damn you Squall damn you), and even better it's cheaper than the modern JRPGS to pick up.",3.0
"I still remember the day that I first popped FFVIII into my PSX. I had just gotten the system for Christmas, and I had never played another Final Fantasy game before at the time. Needless to say, I was swept away by the sheer magnitude of this game and instantly became a FF fangirl from that point onward. I loved the game back then, with the exception of some very obvious things that I found incredibly annoying. Now that I have played through FFVIII again, almost a decade later, I can say that I don't enjoy the game nearly as much anymore, but I still think it was a solid installment in the FF series. Perhaps finally getting my hands on the rest of the Final Fantasies set my expectations a little higher. Anyway, here is my review.

Story (7/10): You know what? I liked FF8's story. I liked the serious, realistic atmosphere which was such a deviation from past FF's. To me, it seemed like an interesting change. I loved Sorceress Edea, and enjoyed how the plot developed...for the most part. However, and I say this as an author of fiction, the love story between Squall and Rinoa was HORRIBLY done. My hatred of Rinoa's character aside, it seemed like the game designers didn't even care about realistic character development. Play through the game again, and you will see what I mean. Squall makes little advancement in his character in the first couple disks, yet in the third, he suddenly becomes incredibly gushy over Rinoa. Grr. The poor character development just slaps me in the face every time I play this game. I do understand that this is a video game, but I am one of the few who enjoys playing RPGs for their interesting storylines, and this just insults me.

Characters (4/10): In FF8, you have your typical cast of characters. However, unlike most other FF games, I wasn't able to connect with the characters as much. There were only a few which I really liked. I probably enjoyed Zell's character the most for reasons which I'm sure fans of this game can easily identify with. I actually really liked Selphie as well. I thought she was a hilarious take on the whole ""hyperactive girl"" role. Squall was...all right. Now, I can't say I was a huge fan of Irvine. But most importantly...RINOA. I know that there are a lot of Rinoa fans out there, but I'm not one of them. In my opinion, she's a helpless princess-type character and is a horrible love interest for Squall. How many times did we save this girl throughout the course of the game? And, most annoyingly, she acts like a royal brat and is overly clingy to Squall. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the majority of the guys I've met can't stand clingy girlfriends. Most of her dialogue makes me want to claw my eyes out. Just...no. Square, please never put a female lead like this in a game again. Terra and Aeris are good examples of female leads who should never be mentioned in the same breath as Rinoa out of respect for their well-designed characters and stories. And here ends my rant, for it could go on forever.

Graphics (7/10): I'm being lenient here, taking into consideration that it was a PSX game. The backgrounds were well-detailed, and the cinematics were gorgeous. I would have liked to see some more attention to detail on the character models, however. I never managed to fall in love with them as I did with the cheesy, blocky characters from FF7. Polygon Cloud was just too cute.

Gameplay (7/10): Not the greatest of the Final Fantasies. I liked being able to customize my characters' stats by junctioning magic, and on my first playthrough, I thought that the whole drawing system was kind of neat. Having played through it again, I now realize how tedious it is to sit in battle drawing magic for 5 minutes just so you can improve your characters' stats. I still love the customization, just not the drawing. GF summons are cool for the first few hours of the game, but eventually you realize how much they slow the game down and it gets to be a bit of a drag. Unfortunately, especially with bosses, you have to sit there boosting your GFs' attacks with the square button, so it's not as if they could just stick a ""short summon animation"" option in there or something. My aching thumb could say some more about that whole method of powering up abilities, but I'll save it. I did like the whole trigger system for normal attacks, and I thought the pacing between random battles was pretty good (but then again, I just finished FFX).

Music (10/10): Uematsu shines for us once again. The soundtrack is rich with brilliant songs, many of which you'll remember long after you've completed the game. I frequently find myself looking FF8 music up on Youtube to leave as background music while I work on other things. This element may be why I enjoyed this game so much.

Miscellaneous/Extras (9/10): One of the things I enjoy most about FF8 is the sidequests. That may sound stupid, but it's true. There are so many different things to do once you get the Ragnarok on disk 3. Also, unlike many other reviewers here, I liked the card game. I found it addictive and fun, although the Random rule in some areas annoyed me.

Overall: 7.33/10 - This game had great potential, but it fell short in very important ways. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good RPG with some creative twists, but be warned...it's missing some things. Like a good heroine, for instance.",3.0
The game is alright but they made a huge mistake on how you use spells.  I would much rather have mp than limited times to cast a spell.,3.0
I would have enjoyed this game more if I would have gotten the walkthrough guide I order with it.,3.0
kids had this a long time  ago so were excited to play it again,3.0
"The Ultima Collection include what could possibly be the best RPG games of all time. UC includes all of the Ultima titles from Akalabeth (the game the Ultima series was based on) to Ultima VIII.
In order to run these games, you literally have to be a computer expert.  You have to run these games from the DOS prompt. Before you get to play any of these games, you have to fix a lot of settings which an average computer user would have no idea how to set them up, or even what they mean (I'm still trying to find out what an ""IRQ"" is.) Also, many of the new computers do not have a PC Speaker, which all of the games require to play any sound effects and music.
By the way, do not expect Ultima I: Exodus to look anything like its NES counterpart.  In Ultima I through IV, graphics are very poorly defined; everything consists of plain colored squares.
If you can actually manage to setup and execute the programs smoothly, then have at this game.  Otherwise, I would recommend playing the NES and SNES Ultima titles.",3.0
A great RPG but it doesnt play anything like the rest of the Final Fantasy franchise.,3.0
"I have had problems with not only the Ultima 7's but EXODUS and Ultima 2 as well.  They barely work on my computer and are a mess to start or deal with so I don't play them.  As for 7 and serpent Isle, these were very good games even graphic wise but now that my old SBPro card has been damaged I can't play them despite the fact that I have a SBLive.  I warn you, there are NO cards that use ISA slots(required for these games) You can't buy them, you can't special order them, and half the ""tech-heads"" I talk to don't even know what they are! You'd better have a good ISA card if you want to buy this product. Or Roland Daughterboard which cannot be purchased anywhere these days.",3.0
"I recommend buying this because it's a compilation, and it's worth it to get all those games.  It's even cooler because it has video interviews with the creator of the games, and I like to see stuff like that.
There's  only one real downside about the games.  If you want to play Ultima VII  (both parts) you can't be running an Expanded Memory Manager and some sound  cards require Expanded Memory Managers to work so on some systems (mine  included) you cannot have sound in the game.  The audio in the rest of the  games work fine.",3.0
"Final Fantasy 8 feels like its taking off and about to deliver the post FF7 glory. But alas you feel like you are being led around by the hand. I felt like agents from the matrix were controlling my every move.
Me - ""Excuse me agent FF8 Can i go over to that sweet new area i see? or even explore the map?""

Agent FF8 ""No..... you can't...you must complete these tedious levels so that you can enjoy the Movie Cutscenes.""

So i enjoyed the movie cutscenes. Squall was an even less complete version of Cloud although he has amazing clothes. There were a lot of great moments to be had...but the overall experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

Although..if you wait (like all good FF players) to the very end you get  treated with a classic secret movie...the scene is great but what really shines is the 1:38 second symphonic piece played over it. Sweeping, deep and beautiful, probably one of the greatest FF musical pieces to date.

I don't know whether i would suggest playing ff9 over this ff8. Ok game...play it ..but don't expect the best.",3.0
"i was attracted to the game by accident. i was enjoying my stay in a hotel room at the Marriott and was playing their Playstation video games like Rayman 2 and LOVED the story, the sound, etc. A beautiful female narrator (LY) telling the story about their doomed world, the physical thunder sounds, the vibrant colors, beautiful worlds, NOBODY speaking gibberish. I was hooked!
then, i buy the game on my Nintendo 64 platform (i'm a nintendo 64 devotee), and it's like buying something half-baked!! everybody speaking gibberish, no verbal sounds by any narrator, am not able to save on my expansion pack.
if i had known, i'd have just bought a playstation and bought the game on THAT platform. oh well!! :-(
it's still a great game, but a better platform is Playstation, its original platform",3.0
"Rayman 2 is a decent game.  I bought this game mostly for my younger brother, but ended up playing it a lot myself, remembering the first Rayman game I had on PC a few years earlier.
The graphics on this game are some of the best suited for the N64.  There are other games, with better graphics, but those are games like Perfect Dark, which has realistic characters that under 64 bit graphics still look choppy and somewhat ugly compared to the newer consoles.  Rayman 2's graphics are cartoonish in nature, so the lower quality display does not effect them too much, therefore the game wouldn't look all that much better on the PS2 or Gamecube.
The one thing that I did have a problem with in this game was the camera!  The camera usually places itself dirrectly behind the character, but seems to have a mind of it's own 75% of the time.  And although you can control it to an extent, it always snaps back to the over the shoulder view once you start moving again.
All in all a good game, both for younger gamers, and older gamers who just want to goof off and have a little fun.",3.0
"To start out, Rayman is this unique character, who has cool powers which he gains along his adventure to save his frog friend Globbox who is being held captive by pirates. It is a Mario type game with tougher bad guys and Rayman can throw balls of light at everyone. This game takes you to a whole new 3D world with a few dozens of levels, each huge and challenging. The challenges are full of puzzles, traps and monsters. It is a good game to improve problem-solving abilities. Despite the challenge they are all fun challenges that differ from level to level. Such as one level, you must fly through a tremendous lava tube, another you must ride a rocket through a twisting and turning pirate ship. Fun for younger ages and it will take about six months to beat. You may want to rent it before you buy it, but when you rent it you will be hooked.",3.0
Final Fantasy VIII is an awesome game.  It's a classic game.  The cinematics are awesome.  The game itself is vast(4 discs).  The only sad part of the playing this game is turning it off.  I give it 2 thumbs up!,3.0
"Although it IS incredebly demonic with crucified bodies and those little Lucifer stars everywhere, it has great graphics.  If your looking for a great online game, this and Unreal Tournament definantly match the bill.  But, if you need to decide between one or the other, get UT.  Because Q3 is  so dark, gloomy, and bland, UT is a whole lot more colorful than Q3.  UT is  also expandable with maps and mods galore.  The only feature in this that  tops UT is that Q3 has curved surfaces, but UT makes up for it with great  physics and cool futuristic levels (for the most part, if you like old  fashioned castle tpye levels, UT has plenty of those, too).",3.0
"First off, this is stricktly a multiplayer game catering to the multiplayer market. It is best played with a cable modem or some other form of high-speed connection. Those of us with dial-up modems are at a sore  disadvantage. Those with dial-up connections move far more slowly and are  easier to hit than those lucky souls with cable modems. Also, the short  single-player game included is not only boring, but is really just a way to  train for multiplayer bouts online. Furthermore, the game, while a solid  offering, isn't nearly as fun or a technically impressive as Unreal  Tournament.  Buy this game only if you don't have the cahoneys to buy  the far-superior Unreal Tournament.",3.0
"It is the most unique of all the final fantasy titles. It is also the most despised. I didn't like the magic system. It was as if they took the Blue Mage ability and just used it for everyone. The system is so unconventional that it throws you off of the idea of typical RPGS. Something else that was irritating was after you learned a spell, you would lose it afterwards making it something like an item. I would argue that FF Tactics difference was more obvious than FF8.

The story is great. Theres a few slow parts but they make up for it later.

Music, sounds like classic Nabuo.

Graphics, slightly better than FF7 during action sequences. The movies are far and few between. The best one is near the end.

Also the battles can seem slow and drag.

No matter how great a story is it can't make up for poor game play.",3.0
"Though I admit this game title is old, that does not mean the product should be damaged.  1 of the discs were probably damaged in storage and the game system is having trouble reading the disc.  This was my second attempt at getting the game; the first time all the discs were broken so I returned them.  But this time only 1 was broken and I found that out too late.  Final Fantasy VIII is a great game but if only the discs were not broken.",3.0
"Of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. I'd say this is one of the finest. Although the battle sequence isn't that good. I would definetely recommend this game to anyone whos a dire fan of Final Fantasy or looking to complete a set. Although I wouldn't discourage other people from this game I would advise not to get it, if you have no previous past knoweldge of FF. The junctioning menu is a great change from the older versions of Final Fantasy. Because it allows you to customize your character very well with different GF abilities. The graphics are decent. And I absoutely love the cutscenes. (It's a break from all that tough fighting I suppose) Again I must say what a great storyline because since Squall joined SeeD , (the main character) He has been faced with many challanges. All of which contribute to a great and addictive storyline. Well, I'm not going to ruin the ending or anything like that. So I'll leave it to you. You just have to buy this game and find out for yourselves what you've been missing! Also Best of luck to you once you get it! :)",3.0
"I definitely agree with the above statement that there are too many random battles.  The other thing is that as your characters go up in level so do the monsters they fight...Not in the sense of different area different/stronger monsters...no no...same area same but stronger monsters.  This might not be a problem except that in order to upgrade your weapons you have to steal certain items from monsters, but as the monsters go up in level the probability of them carrying certain items changes.  So at a certain level it becomes very difficult a) to survive a fight with a formerly moderate strength monster and b) to get the items you need to morph your weapons so you stand a chance.  This game was definitely a challenge.  The plot was pretty decent.  I have definitely liked other Final Fantasy games better though.",3.0
"Final Fantasy VIII - Circa 1998

GOOD:

- Considered a pretty good PS1 RPG by many people

- Famed ""Liberi Fatali"" song/intro, as well as other pretty cool CG movies between gameplay

BAD:

- Graphics are pretty dated

- Game play may feel a little dated

- Not considered as classic to many as Final Fantasy VI, VII, or X

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Turn based RPG

- No voice-overs, so there is lots of reading

- Card Battling as a mini game

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Final Fantasy VII

- Final Fantasy IX

- Legend of Dragoon

- Chrono Cross

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is a version for the P.C. as well

- Squall (the main character) makes a cameo in Kingdom Hearts, and calls himself Leon

- Note: all Final Fantasy are not related to one another, think of each Final Fantasy a it's own game not connect in any real/true way to another Final Fantasy, the only exception is Final Fantasy X-2 which is a sequel to Final Fantasy X",3.0
"A lot of elements in FFVIII are pretty creative.  The storyline, as in most FF games, is award-winning good.  The graphics are good for its time, and the customizing system (Junctioning) is really innovative and simple to use.  Music is really nice also, as well as the sound.  But still, not among Square's best Final Fantasy games.  This game tends to be almost too easy through the story, but getting some things is really hard (e.g. getting Malboro Tentacles for Doomtrain.  I really hate Malboros!!!).  Also, junctioning makes the game even easier than it normally is, which makes it less and less fun to play, and the card game is addicting, but silly.  But nevertheless a good game.",3.0
"This Game Boy Color light does a good job of magnifying the screen and lighting up the dark. But the thing is, the batteries run out too fast, and the light keeps getting dimmer the more the battery runs out making it useless about halfway through. The screen also smudges a little too easily. It's a good item to have for night travel, just make sure you have a fresh pair of AAA batteries.",3.0
"First of all, I want to start off by saying that this is an amazing game if you go for graphics; the movies that play throughout FFVIII were enough to make me want to continue to play the game. And like all the FF's, FFVIII has absolutely beautiful music that fits the game quite nicely.

  But all the hype aside, this was not enough to make me stay up way into the early morning playing till my eyes hurt form looking at a TV screen to long. Although FFVIII has a decent story line, I found the game to move at an almost painfully slow pace and almost found myself stopping halfway through out of pure boredom. No other FF has made me wonder if I should go outside and take a walk.

but I'm sorry to say that FFVIII ended in me taking many walks indeed. I don't understand the reviews where people praise the characters in this game. Personally, none of the main characters grabbed my attention. When I play a game I want to actually CARE about the characters I'm playing with, I want to feel like I know them. FFVIII had a few slightly memorable characters to me.. But most of them I wouldn't care forgetting.

  Selphie was annoying, Zell is amusing for about the first 20 minutes of disk one, Quistis seemed to have no real personality...I could go one, but I have to say the only enjoyable character was Seifer... and he wasn't even that great.

  Then the main character.. Oh my god! Kill me now! Squall has all the personality problems then Cloud (FFVII) for god's sake! AND MORE! And I even found myself Likening Cloud later on! But Squall...? This guy made me cringe. He may be VER VER good looking...but From the moment I started playing nothing about Squall made me care about what was going to happen to him at all, I couldn't care less if he ended up dead. And a few times I found myself shutting OFF this game simply because I couldn't take him anymore! Who wants to play a game as a bitter, emotionless antisocial emo kid? ...Sorry Squall fans, but this guy just rubbed me the wrong way.  not that it makes any differance...but I hate the way he runs...

  If you want to play a game with characters you can actually care about, I suggest you all pick up a copy of FFIX. (Zidane is SUCH a refreshing change from Could and Squall!!) Now Zidane is a character you can actually fall in love with.  But before I go into FFIX worship mode. lets get back on subject.

  Besides the complete LACK of ANY character development WHATSOEVER, FFVIII has absolutely NO game play at all. This is a final fantasy game and your not supposed to EXPLORE the world around you?? And infact.. if you spend to much time looking for items and gil that won't be there, your seeD mark goes down?? Besides the horrible characters, this was possibly the WORST part of the game for me.

  And the battle system is just plain bothersome. But I won't get into details because I feel bad bashing Any Final fantasy too much.",3.0
"I bought this together with Final Fantasy VII, and when I played VIII, I was somewhat displeased with it.
  Let me start by saying that the graphics for this game are the BEST you'll find out there for the Playstation game console; the cutscenes almost seem real.
  Now, the disadvantages:  Tutorials make the game extremely boring.  Towards the beginning of the game, some lady teaches you something about ""junctions"" for a half an hour, and I couldn't remember any of it afterwards.  There is also no plot.  You seemingly walk around different towns and fight random bosses that have nothing to do whatsoever with the actual story, if there was any.
  So, I recommend that you try other Final Fantasy games first, like IX and VII (those are excellent ones).  If you can't help yourself, rent this one and see if you like it or not.",3.0
"okay first of all, this game like any other final fantasy is different from each other which is good but you have got to know how  to divide yourself from your predecessor. This game was very good on certain standards but i Expected more. I have played every final fantasy and this one is in between the good final fantasy and the bad final fantasy. I liked this game and in fact i own this game but i was dissapointed. Overall, it is a game to check out.",3.0
"when using this product it's very bulky and it has a glare when another light source comes in contact with it, and its very hard to talk off once on.
overall good product for the price",3.0
"Ah yes, this is my Final Fantasy VII Review.  Those that have seen my review for FFIX and FFVII, know how I revere the Sixth game in the series.  Which, apparently, most of you have never played.  Having stated my reasons of reverance in my FFVII and FFIX reviews, Ill review VIII on its own merits this time around.
First, This game quite possibly has the most stirring and excellent FMV of any playstation game I have witnessed.  epic battles, grand dance numbers, moments of comedy, personal trauma, Action, and despair, are all rendered through CG and look throughly Excellent.  The in game graphics are remarkable as well.  Created too show a realistic, sci fi other world feel.  Space ships, sleepy meadows, and fierce monsters all look remarkable even without the looping FMV.  A true breakthrough for square.
Gameplay, This is where the game Falls Flat.  First of all... the juction system was creative and dynamic... yet flawed immensely.  Do you mean too tell me my characters cant use a potion unless they have a GF junctioned too them that ALLOWS them too use a potion?  That sounds like a little thing, but represents just how little thought was given too the junction system when creating it.  Its almost as if square wanted too make a system so complex and intricate... that they forgot tradition and past gameplay staples.  Then theres the summon animations.  Okay, Shiva looks cool the first ten times you summon her, the twentieth is repetitive, and the 100th, while watching the same minute long animation before you can actually play the game, is just not fun.  Then We have the DRAW system.  Yah, we can cheat and draw 100 spells from a weak monster.  But youll have too do it 40-80 times, per character, per spell.  which gets old.  REAL OLD!  REAL FAST!!!
The music helps too redeem the game.  While Uematsu sat on the Bench entirely in this game, much of the music that is here is well composed, and fitting.  But only the ending vocal track is a piece of music Id want too listen too over and over again.  The Rest of the music, despite being very fitting for the game, just doesnt have the staying power too warrent a non fanboy like myself too buy the game.
Lastly, The story is probably the most personal, tender, complex, and emotional tale of love that square has ever written.  Layer by layer, squall is peeled back as he finds himself leading his comrades, falling in love, and facing his nemesis.  Its the love story that eventually develops Squall the most.  And is the main crux of the game.  Other elements, like the time warping, are very well played and scripted.  Laguana's goofy yet charming shinnanegans are a perfect foil too Squall's Poker face and indifferance.  But its the supporting cast that seems too fall flat in terms of development.  We have one character in which the plot points out that he was a mama's boy as a child, but grew up too be a martial artist.  he still cares for his widow'd mother, and has a secret admirer.  But the game doesnt let you explore either of these relationships besides pointing them out too you.  This is Standrad practice for the other supporting cast as well.  Its sad that a character from laguana's past, who is in the game for a total of ten minutes, is a more well developed person then the remaining characters in your party.  Character related subquests are even Scarcer in FFVIII then in VII.  Which Was weaker in comparison with its predacessor.  Shame, since its really the story and characters that make an RPG TRULY memorable.
Too wrap up this review, I did like the personnal and tenderness in FFVIII's Story.  It was a nice change of place from the *I SHOULD SAVE THE WORLD* Tone of most RPG's.  In FFVIII, you do indeed save the world... after you grow up and learn a bit about love and maturity that is.  And the ending is the most tender and heartfelt Since FFVI.
Im glad that Square learned all that it did From FFVII and FFVIII.  For the ninth game, and onward, they didn't have too prove thier technical wizardry any further.  Safe and secure in thier mastery of technology after this game, Square has since gone back too focusing on Story and Gameplay, which are what matter the most.  Final Fantasy VIII is the best MOVIE on the playstation 1, but Final Fantasy IX is the best GAME and STORY.  and is Far more reccommended provided you WANT a story, and not an interactive movie too drool over.  If that is all you desire, stick with FFVIII Until you come too appreciate that Video games are too be PLAYED and too CHALLENGE you, not too Give you pretty pictures.",3.0
"Everyone kept telling me that this one was the best FF ever. Well, I disagree. I actively disliked most of the characters. The goals are not well explained, nor the means to achieving those goals. The Graphics are only good when compared to earlier installments in the saga. The sound is terrible. I couldn't get into the storyline. I was fairly irritated by how long the game took to get into anything like gameplay. If I wanted a tutorial, couldn't I have asked instead of being forcefed every 3 steps? I'm going to try to struggle through the rest of the game, but for my money, you'd do better with IX or X.",3.0
"I must be playing this game wrong or something, because it seems like I'm just summoning the GF's over and over again (since they do the most damage), which means that I have to watch the long animations (which were cool at first but just annoying now) a gazillion times.  Otherwise, a very gorgeous and fun game.",3.0
"After playing Final Fantasy VII(perhas the greatest game known to man), I was impatiently waitng for Final Fantasy VIII. When I finally got my hands on it, I had a big smile.  It was going good in the first disc, second disc, it started to go into a slump, the 3rd, and 4th disc were straight out boring.  It pissed me off when I had to fight bosses just to break Ultimacia's seal, that was dumb.
Story:
Well, you are seed, destroying monsters is your business, then they run into a sorceress who's trying to destroy the world with time compression.  THat's why she's trying to find Ellonie.  But why does she want to destry the world, that's the dumb part.  I mean come on, someone's gotta have a reason to destroy the world, Sephroth had a reason to desrty the world(Sephroth thought the human race was stealing the planet from the cetra(his race).  So to cease the humans exsistance, he was going to destry the world).  Kuja had a reason to desrty the world(Kuja was created to be evil, but he knew that the old dude created him, so that by the time Zidane got stronger than him, he would die, so he seaked the crystal and tried to desroy it, and take the world along with him), but no Sorceress Ultimacia had no reason to destroy the world.  (Hmph, nice storyline)
Characters:
This was sad: When Square made Final Fantasy VII had you emotionally attatched to the characters, in Final Fantasy VIII they made characters that you would want to forget forever:
Squall is a lone-wolf ... and a 18 year old loser(So don't call him Cloud); Rhinoa has a the face but everything else...NO(So don't call her Tifa); Zell whines to much, and goes on about dumb stuff(So don't call hin Cid); Seifer is a pitiful Mr. I wanna be the sorceress' night wuss(So don't call him a 50% version of sephroth); Irvine is a sharpshooter that's trying to act cool, but he ain't(So don't call him Vincint); Quitis is trying, but can't fill in a good love triangle at all(So don't call her Aries); Selphie, is just annoying, and she just isn't strong(So don't call her Yuffie); Laguna, is a real good character(He shoulda been the hero instead of Squall, a loser); Kiros has some pretty wicked blades, and woulda been a great replacement for Zell; Ward is big dude, but he ain't no, I'm-gonna-bust-you-up character(So don't call him Barret).  I only praised 2 characters outta that bunch(Laguna, and Kiros).  That's pretty sad.
Graphics:
The game's only high point.  The PSX never seen anything as good as this.  While the gameplay grahics are very well done,the FMV's get tha cake.  I never saw anything so freaking real.  So if you only buy games for graphics, this will be your first choice for the PSX(But FFX punched it out by a long mile)
Sound:
Pretty good sound effects and music.  I like the boss fights music.  At time to time, it makes you wanna say, bring da ruckus from time to time.  That's only the second thing that capitalized on Final Fnatasy VII
Gameplay:
Well, here's the biggest downfall of the whole game.  It was like they were master... while making the junction system.  Because it's a real pain.  No mp, like when you have a good majic spell for strenght, and you wanna use it, you lose strengh as well(Same for everything else).  The GF's are annoying, they take a while to work, and they take damage for you, but when they die, waht are you gonna use then?  And why are you stuck with something like poison, even after a battle.  That was very annoying.  And when you have limit breaks, you have to stay with low hp(you'll eventually die) or use aruas(which willrun out, and are hard t find).  Charging was easier.  This really hurt the game.
Replay value:
Heck, anyone who finished this game, had to win medals, cuz, I felt like dying just trying to beat.  Breaking the seals was the biggest pain I had.  I had to fight bosses without Limit Breaks, which was dumb.  I was about the quit, but I kept going, and somehow did it.  Then when I went agenst Ultimacia, she chose my first 3 characters, which was BS.  I mean, when she finaly picked my 3 main characters, Squall, Irvine, and Zell, it was a lucky shot, so I took it(After losing 4 painful times).  I kept Squall, and Irvine's hp low, so I can do the Renzicuken, and fire Paulse ammo.  Hell's judgment, and the biggest thorn in my side, but thanks to the bahamut card, I traded that for 100 megalixers, and ended up deafeting her.  It was a fluke.  Then I never played the game again, so as for me, so much for replay value.
Overall:
This game had to be one of biggest dissapoinment in history.  The only reason I gave it a three, is beacause it had a good ending, unlike Final fantasy VII which showed what happed 500 years later in the other ending.  This game was boring, and lacked anything of the final Fantasy name.  If you are a die-hard, hardcore FInal Fantasy Fan, the you probobly got this, but if you want to start playing the saga, for god's sake start with Final Fantasy VII.",3.0
"Out of all the Final Fantasys of this generation, I enjoyed this one the least.  I had a feeling of blandness when I played it.  The main character was very bland as well. Still, it was good enough to play through to the end, but that's about it.",3.0
the game is cool rpg everything is goo about but you cant beat the last boss. the only way to beat him is to get LOINHEART SWORD for squaal. PLUS the weapons geting is very bad and to orqnize the magic spells take to much time but besids that the game is good buy it play it wint it,3.0
"In the interview from Eidos prior to The Last Revelation release, fans were promised a game 1) that returns to TR roots, 2) is puzzle based, and 3) Lara's objectives would always be clear (probably in response to all the  complaints received over TRIII).  Eidos also promised that Lara wouldn't  have to run around so much to find objects and that the emphasis on bad  guys would be downplayed.  Put simply, TLR would be a return, in sorts, to  the original Tomb Raider.
Using the Eidos interview as basis, let's look  at their claims.  First, yes, TLR does a nice job returning to TR's roots,  at least in terms of atmoshpere and looks.  That's my number one praise.  But in terms of gameplay, TLR is far from puzzle-based.  It starts out so,  but about halfway through the designers decided to return to the convoluted  ploys that plagued TRIII.  And, having just finished TLR, I'd say that  Lara's objectives are far from clear.  There are still a lot of thugs to  kill off and Lara does an awful lot of running across multiple screens to  obtain objects. (there aren't really levels in TLR; Lara passes from one  area to another--with a download time in between!)
I think the biggest  problem is that the designers simply ran out of great puzzle ideas (which  occurred sometime after TRII) where you actually have to use some logic and  your brain.  This is what made TR1 so fantastic: you knew that if you sat  in front of the screen long enough, you'd eventually figure out whatever  challenge TRI threw at you.  TLR however, beginning with the Cairo section,  becomes frustrating because it stops being puzzle based, and to make up for  this lack of puzzles, resorts to annoyingly complicated, nit-picky,  non-logic based ploys to make the game more ""challenging"" (and,  thus, ensure more sales of their strategy guide).  I've never had to use a  forum/walkthrough site so often in my life.  Let me make my point as clear  as possible: puzzles require brain power and logic.  Trial and error is NOT  equal to good gaming and is NOT fun.  I seriously doubt that there are many  gamers out there who made it through the entire Cairo sequence without the  aid of a walkthru.  This could have been a great game (and it was for the  first half)  The graphics in TLR are outstanding, and the Desert Railroad  level is innovative and fun.  Sadly, though, this game was ruined by  ridiculously complex, illogical levels that surrogate for a lack of puzzle  ideas.",3.0
"As I've said in other reviews of this series, the first one is the best.  It wasn't needlessly difficult, and the puzzles made sense.
I just played through the first few areas of the last revelation, and to my  disgust eidos has not fixed the problems that first appeared in tomb raider  two and became rampant in tomb raider three.
puzzles are okay, PUZZLES IN  WHICH YOU CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO, OR CANNOT FIND OBSCURE  ITEMS BECAUSE YOUR BRIGHTNESS IS TOO LOW, OR THE ITEMS AREN'T LOGICALLY  CONNECTED TO THE PROBLEM AT HAND ARE NOT OKAY.
the series still looks  great, but frustrating backtracks and endless wandering looking for the  hidden button have consistently robbed this series of the splendor we saw  in the first incarnation.  Remember just wandering through the lost valley  or jumping into the waterfall over and over again?  If that level was  redesigned under the current standards, you would have to endlessly reload  the game because the waterfall kills you and you have to hit a button on  the way down which you don't know is there and can't see so that a door  half a mile away opens up.  And there's no reason to think a button a will  even open the door.
I refuse to play a game with a hint guide on my lap.  Guns and ammo are way too hard to find otherwise.  I gave this game one  more shot at recapturing my interest in the series.  I guess I'm done with  Lara, which is a shame because I've really loved the series.",3.0
"The graphics are beautiful (and there are plenty of hot guys :P), but I couldn't even bring myself to finish the first disc because of the battle system.  It seems as if I need to use the summons in each battle and they take FOREVER!  I found the graphics dazzling the first time, but by the 500th time, they began to get a little annoying...",3.0
"To be completely honest, I really liked this game, but there were just too many things that kept me from enjoying this game on the same level as other Final Fantasy titles.
Pros:
- Excellent characterization. I couldn't get over the focus on character development.
- Great ambiance. The pre-rendered scenes, music, and sound were all done beautifully.
- Graphics. They were the best of the time.
- Liberi Fatali. The introductory cinema alone is worth at least renting the game.
Cons:
- The storyline. Starts off great, leaving you wanting more, but only deteriorates as it moves on to the third and fourth discs.
- The Junction System. Whoever thought of this needs to be shot. It makes the whole concept behind battling quite tedious.
- Summoning and spells. Sure, Square's known for the drama, but sheesh... I think they overdid the effects this time.
- Too much of a focus on love. Sure, it's been a staple of Square games, but it was focused on too much in this one.",3.0
"There's a lot to like about Final Fantasy VIII coming out of the experience of FF7, but there's also some things not to like. I admired the more realistic and correctly-proportioned characters in the game, but disliked the final battles and the preparations needed to have some chance at the final conflict.
All RPGs tend to have super bosses and lengthy final battles, but the story itself wasn't compelling enough to make me really want to care, or really curious, to bring the game to its conclusion. FF9 and FFX both have been a lot more compelling in this respect.",3.0
"This game was supposed to be great. It had good hype, and I was looking forward to it. Upon playing it, I have discovered one of the most contrived, boring, bland games ever. A huge difference from all that came before it, and the ones that came after. If they had worked a little longer on it, they might have done a little better and maybe worked on the plot and characters a little more.",3.0
"Pharaoh is every positive thing mentioned by the other reviewers. I wouldn't argue with any of them. It is a great game: ""great"" in terms of magnitude and scope. But it fails to be ""fun."" It's one of those bizarre instances where a game is addictive and enthralling but also infuriatingly difficult. I've just spent eight hours on a particular mission only to have a glitch in the behavior of the bazaar traders wreck everything. A few more courses to go on the pyramid...oops, so sorry, start over. Unfortunately problems like these have been commonplace since I started my campaign. Even when things go smoothly, most missions require four to eight hours. I'm sorry, I can't spend my life building cyberspace pyramids. Pharaoh is definitely a case of ""more is less.""",3.0
"This was the first Final Fantasy game I purchased, and it didn't exactly blow me away. The first FMV sequence was extremely cinematic, and it was compelling. The music was the worst aspect. After playing FFVII and FFIX I knew that FFVIII could have made more effort with the music.
  The characters... I felt Quistis didn't have to be there after Dollet. She didn't really have a prominent personality, and I thought that if she suddenly fell into the path of an oncoming train, fans may not have cared. Making all the characters 17-18 years old narrowed the personality barriers, and caused the character difference (which is necessary in a well-balanced game) to be very small.
  I liked the plot twists, which were good, considering the storyline was only lukewarm. The thing I like which lacked in FFVIII was that the characters were all picked up on the way, rather than having a really strange addition to the party for a strange but believable reason. In this game, it was the teacher, the friends, the school bully and the hangers-on - typical schoolyard antics, not very appropriate in a FF game.
  One other thing. Blaming their loss of memory on the GFs is possible one of the worst plot moves in the history of gaming, if not the world.
  This game was too complicated. The Junction ability was irritating, and the tutorials warped your mind so badly that it was impossible to understand the Junctioning. Buying materials to refine weapons rather than just buying them seemed like the producers simply wanted to make the game more difficult.
  However, it is a good game, but a bit too much like an ornamental box: Pretty on the outside but hollow on the inside.",3.0
"Sure, don't be mistaken, I own FF8, love Squall to DEATH, and generally like the FF Series.
Not with this game.
At first, I liked it. The opener kicked butt over most other games out there. But, FF8 is too...rigid. The magic is gone, the fantasy, nice weapons, and the characters with an actual background were not here. The music was extremely annoying. The graphics of the FMVs kicked butt. The storyline is bad. I didn't GET the idea these people were fighting a witch in this certain setting. It's just stupid.
So, in short, if you want a game with a monumental storyline, developed characters, and good music, don't buy this game. (Sorry Squall!!)",3.0
"My very first Final Fantasy experience came from FF6(or FF3 in the State), and I loved every second of it.  What I must say, must say is that Final Fantasy series does separate itself from rest of RPGs out there with the excellent graphic, skillfully done music score, and last but not least, story line.
However, FF8 was something different from rest of FF series.  For couple hours, I thought it was good, then it became apparent eventually that the game doesn't live up to its legacy.  I easily stopped playing it because simply the magic it used to pull me in from FF series wasn't there anymore.  I didn't think the plot was something which i would go 'wow' nor characters were fresh visually for being realistic rather than super-deformed, but other than that there was nothing, nada.
Personally I love Dragon Warrior series.  It doesn't boast any graphic, nor has well plotted story lines of FF series, but Dragon Warrior does a really excellent job in game play balance.
The FF series was able to go head to head, shoulder to shoulder with ENIX because of their graphic, music, and storyline.  But this time, it was way out of its own league.  Graphic was good enough, music, however, didn't give that masterful feeling, and ultimately storyline was just,,,horrible.
It's a decent RPG.  However, I would consider it as a failure from FF's perspective.  I really did expect alot from FF8 since the main theme is love.  I really did anticipated alot...  Play this game when you have plenty of time to kill, no other game to play.",3.0
"this game is fun building the buildings and stuff like that but you cant controll your army which came to quite a shock to me becasuse i have all of the age of empires games (gold edition,age of emipires one, age of empires 2, age of emipres rise of rome, age of empires the conquers)you get the point and the real setback is you cant controll the army if you could i would give the game another try, if your an age of emipires fan
this game is not for you of course there nice buildings but 2 little battle.",3.0
"I like all of the ff's but this is the worst ever!! I do like this game and the love story is great but no matter how hard you try when you get on disc 4 and beat the game all you can say is ""wow...now wheres my ff7 disc?"" get ff9 before this one...",3.0
"Square got really ambitious, I think, when they developed Final Fantasy 8. They had (as usual) a great storyline, and decided to take a somewhat more dramatic angle on it. The characters are easy to relate to because they're students, like most of the people who will end up playing FF8. The FMV animations are exceptionally good, and a few of the music tracks are -really- good, but the game lacks consistency and suffers from too much character micromanagement. Also, the story moves at a jerky pace that often left me wondering, ""What do I do now?"" And frankly, the random battles suck and chocobos are too hard to get.
The main downfall of the game is the junction system. Although it ended up serving as the rough basis for what is used in FFX, in 8 it was a system requiring a lot of time devoted to 'drawing' magic from monsters or draw points. This magic is the main factor in how strong your characters are, so you don't have much choice.
For some reason, Square decided that parties would no longer gain experience from battling boss monsters. This riled me a little bit, because I do not enjoy random encounters. However, the monsters in 8 level along with you. The bosses, of course, don't.
The 'Guardian Forces' that allow characters to junction magic can be summoned with devastating attacks, but I hesitate to use them because the summon animations are roughly 30 seconds long each. They're cool the first few times, but give me a break, and give me a way to skip them, please.
Finally, the sub-game of 'Triple Triad' is very well done and adds an additional way to acquire hard-to-get items. However, it too is very time-intensive and the hard-to-get items aren't that important in the first place.
The major pluses for this game are few but strong. Squall, the main character, and Rinoa, the love interest, are both realistic characters with believable depth. And the time-shifting and multiple parties/identities is a pretty damn cool idea.
Play this only if you are an FF fanatic. You'll never, ever, finish it otherwise.",3.0
"I made the mistake of installing this before I was finished with the original Roller Coaster Tycoon, and it replaced all the old scenarios with the Cork Screw Follies scenarios. I could not find a way to go back and play the old scenarios, so I had to start with these. That alone really upset me. I thought there might be new coasters and things to research for my existing scenarios, like other software companies did in their add-ons. Also, there's still no option to create your own open ended scenario.
Aside from eating my old games, Corkscrew Follies isn't bad.  It's nice to have new scenarios and things to do, and the game play didn't differ from the original. the graphics are still like the first, a little cartoony but still fairly good.
Overall this isn't a bad add-on, but I was sorely disappointed when it took away the original scenarios.",3.0
"Pharaoh is different, in the sense that the workers in the game tend to act randomly and can be hard to control. This game just never really clicked with me. Starcraft, Warcraft, Age of Empires, and Civilization were more enjoyable to me. But if you have played these to death give Pharaoh a try.",3.0
"Although they attempt to distinguish this game from Caesar III with some minor religion and ""family reign"" type settings, this game is Caesar III with a different front end.
If you like Caesar 3, you will like this game also.  It plays very well and the movies aren't bad.  If you got tired of Caesar 3 (as I did) don't buy Pharoah... it is close enough that you won't want to play it.",3.0
"This game was a fun game, but it could have been made so much better. It had many fun points to it, with a lot of variety, although theirs so much variety, and since everything can be made in the form of something else, it can take a very long time to get to ""point A to point B"". The game also has a very boring ""custom land"" game, where you are given a type of land, and you just build, as their are no more than 12, and only like 3 or 4 are any good. The campaign is VERY confusing, as i was in the 4th level, i accidently chose ""continue playing level"" after i beat the level, and now it won't let me advance, won't let me replay the level, won't let me rebeat the last level, etc... So I had to restart the entire campaign, which is very annoying. Also, the game is extremely easy. My friend, who had never played Pharaoh, or any game like it, played for about 15 minutes, and had already made a city that could rival the greatest city ever built in Egypt. Also, this game seems just to be Caeser 3 in disguise. i have Caeser 3, and this game bears amazing resemblance to it. i know their both made from the same company, but many aspects of the game are almost identical, and the only difference is the picture. Which is why I gave this game 3 stars, it's a fun game, but if your even mildly good at any ""city-builder"" you'll beat this game in about one coffee break. Or if you've played Caeser 3 and you didn't like it, expect the same reaction from this game.",3.0
"Maybe it's because I got it late in life.. This game just didn't impress me.  The graphics were alright, the sfx were nice but the gameplay left a lil to be desired.  I like third person games that have more hrmm functions.. She basically just jumps and swings a sword.. oh and she can mount a dragon and fly around.  I mean one of the biggest third person games right now is Max Payne and all he does is shoot and kill but they added fast paced action and that cool slow mo thing.  I never grow tired of max payne.  Drakan does have a neat lil story though so it captivated me almost all the way till the end.  The game also doesn't like xp very well.. which is an issue since I'll be damned if i switch os's just to play a game heh.",3.0
"Off the bat, I can say that Final Fantasy 8 is not a very good game. The game abandons many features that made Final Fantasy games so great. One of these features is MP.  Now instead you have a certain amount of magics, almost like items. I found that I ran out of magic faster with this new system than with the MP system. Another disadvantage is that almost everything you can do relys on the moves that your Gaurdian Forces has learned. Worst of all you just don't feel like you're playing a Final Fantasy game. If you want to get an excellent Final Fantasy game take my word and get 7.",3.0

We bought this after the Pokemon Go craze hit and we wanted to play the original red/blue games on our Gameboy.  Perhaps it is just because it is so old but it seemed to run out of batteries very quickly so we wanted a charger.  It does it's job but my complaint is that if it gets unplugged while playing your unit will turn off.  I had it happen a few times and I hadn't saved in a while which was frustrating.

"Does the game look great?  Yes.  Is it challenging?  Sure.  But...  I found it painfully repetitive.  You start out by building a city.  Once you get it to prosper, you move to a new location and build another city.  You  may have a few more building options, but it is basically the same thing  over and over.  Building monuments does give a sense of accomplishment, but  they do take a long time.  The graphics are fun -- dancers and jugglers and  thieves running around (my personal favorite are the hippos munching reeds)  and the music adds nice flavor without being repetitive.  But I would  advise anyone interested in buying this game to play the demo (available at  GamePower.com ) first.  This will give you all of the Pharaoh phun you  need.",3.0
"Let me start out by saying that I am a huge RPG fan and an even bigger Final Fantasy Fan.  I have own all final fantasy games that were released in the Us.  8 is the worst.  It is a game with good graphics and excellent characters, but the overall environment leaves something out.  In all of the other Final Fantasy games, you can feel something magical and it keeps you playing until the end.  The storyline, while ok, does not do what the other games in the series did.  With other final fantasy games, you actually feel bad when something bad happens, with Final Fantasy 8, when something happens, you think ""so what.""  Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy 8 is a pretty good game, but in the Final Fantasy series, theres no place for ""pretty good.""",3.0
"I like this game, it's really good... but it's got a bad main character... Squall. I really don't like him... he sorta gets better toward the end, but over-all, no. And Selphie is too hyper and annoying. However, I liked Rinoa. Along with a just-ok cast of charcters, the storyline wasn't the best either. It's good at first, and the Time Compresiion, but it turns into a kind-of love story, so you if you don't like love stories (which I don't, really) it will be disapointing. However, it's got a nice new battle system, with GFs (Guardian Forces) and they have their own HP! Also, there is no MP, which is my favorite thing of the game I think... to get magic you just draw amounts from monsters or draw points. The FMVs are really great too, there are lots more in this one than there is in FF7 and 9. I would suggest this game for gamers, but go for FF7 and 9 first if you want something more thrilling.",3.0

"FF8, ah yes FF8. The ugly stepchild of the Final Fantasy Series. I went out and purchased a playstation primarily for this game when it was first released, and i was quite disappointed. Here's why. First of all, and most importantly, the storyline doesn't belong in a game named ""Final Fantasy."" There's no fantasy involved whatsoever. The main character wields a ""gunblade"" which is a hybrid of a gun and a sword. You can rent CARS to travel around the map, you even end up heading into outer space! Plus, the storyline itself is very predictable, and by the end I found myself caring not even a little bit what happened to any of the characters. In an RPG, story is paramount, and this is precisely where FF8 is lacking.
Another huge complaint I have deals with the combat system, well the magic system in particular. In order to cast any magic, you have to ""draw"" it out of an enemy. It can then be junctioned to your stats to increase them, which was innovative and pretty cool; but having to spend 15 minutes just drawing magic out of an enemy WILL drive you crazy believe me.
As far as side quests go, FF8 has a lot, and they are pretty fun to complete (the battle with Omega Weapon was definetly the best part of the game, he's probably the hardest boss in just about any RPG i can think of). Triple Traid, the card game which is also a side quest was AWESOME and is the main reason why this game gets 3 stars, I would often turn the game on and play nothing but the card game! In short, if you are a diehard fan of the Final Fantasy series, or rpgs in general this game will almost undoubtably disappoint you. But if you've played just about everything else, it might be worth a try (if only for the card game).",3.0
"Well, this was the first in a series of disappointing games from SquareSoft released for Playstation (followed by SaGa Frontier 1 and 2, Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana, Vagrant Story...)  Don't get me wrong, even the poorer SquareSoft titles are a cut above most games, but compared to the innovation and quality of previous stories, Final Fantasy VIII really falls short.  The magic system is irritating at best, and the story isn't nearly as compelling as Final Fantasy 6, 7 or 9.  Worth playing, but not worth playing instead of FF9.",3.0

It is impossible to place third on two of the tracks even through the secret passages, which are also short cuts.  I played this game the first time at an arcade place and I loved it.  It was played so many times that all the tracks were available to race in and those other tracks were alot more fun, than the first three.

First off you need a very fast system to run this game (it runs fine on my PIII 500 but lags on my neighbors PII 400).  The story is noteworthy but seems to borrow heavily from the Resident Evil series.  The graphics are  outstanding and the sounds will scare the socks off you especially if you  play the game at night or with all the lights off alone.  But from here on  out the game takes a turn for the worse as the controls and camera views  are sloppy and erratic and at times just plain frustrating.  It still is a  fun game to play and the goosebumps and chills that I recieved from playing  were very much from getting the crap scared out of me.  Overall the  controls are annoying but the game still has its moments so if you like the  scary genre type game it is still well worth purchasing.,3.0
"Beautiful graphics, good story, nice voices....unfortunately the control factor shoots this one in the foot.

"I really did like this game while I owned it.  It's a nice attempt by Squaresoft, and I think this game really could have been a whole lot better than the way it turned out.  I give it 3 stars for its good aspects, and for the POTENTIAL it had.  Well, let's get started.
First, as anyone will notice, the graphics are excellent.  They are some of the best that the Playstation could possibly put out, from what I can see.  But, aside from that, everything else about the game gives me mixed feelings.
For one thing, there's the music.  Music is very important in an RPG because it sets the whole mood of the game and affects the mood of the player.  Unfortunately, there are not many quality songs in this game.  The battle music is somewhat blah and a bit overdramatic, and the music in towns seems a bit uninspired.  This is compounded by the fact that many tunes are repeatedly recycled.  ""Eyes on Me"" wasn't bad, but as far as songs of that type go, I think Marle's theme in Chrono Trigger was just a little bit better (that is, her fully orchestrated theme song, not just the little music box tune).  The worst song, though, by far, is the overworld map music.  It is so uninspired, irritating, and boring, and I know it could have been much better, considering the world map songs in previous Final Fantasy games, even the original on the NES.
Now, the storyline of this game is excellent.  There are enough twists here to satisfy those who like depth, and the story goes far beyond the simple ""group of heroes out to save the world"" plot--not that there's anything at all wrong with that plot, mind you.  Every RPG since the beginning of the genre has ultimately boiled down to that anyway.  Really, what stronger motivation is there?
Now, despite the good story, the game was hindered by poor character development.  Somehow, everyone seemed very 2-dimensional in this game.  I think one of the problems is that the characters looked too old.  This might sound odd, but let me explain.  The characters are supposed to be teenagers, and they have teenage personalities, but the graphics make them look like they're in their twenties.  As a result, the characters personalities don't match their appearance at all.
My other problem with the character development is Squall and Rinoa's love story.  Don't get me wrong, I like the fact that there is a love story here.  But, I don't think it was handled very well here.  Rather than developing over time or having some reason for it, it just seemed to come out of nowhere.  One minute Rinoa just gets on Squall's nerves, and the next, he's head over heels for her.  All of this happens so suddenly that it makes their relationship lose all credibility.  Squall's personality is horrible all the way up to the 4th disc, and Rinoa is just sort of annoying at times.  I think Chrono Trigger's romance between Crono and Marle was handled better.  Even though Crono does not speak, you can tell that it developed properly, over time.
The next part, and probably the most important, is the gameplay.  There are some nice, innovative ideas here, but I have the same problem with this Junction system as I did with FF7's materia:  they both take away all the uniqueness of the characters.  In FF6 and other games around its time, each character had a unique ability that only he or she could use, and the characters had different strengths and weaknesses.  But now, with junctioning, all of the characters are basically the same except for their limit-breaks.  So, there is no strategy involved in making a party.  Granted, there is strategy in the junctioning, but it's just not the same.  Also, the Draw command is far too tedious.  I think the junctioning should have functioned more like the Espers did in FF6.
At any rate though, I did enjoy playing this game while I had it, but once it was done there was really no replay value.  It has some major flaws though.  Those introduced to RPGs by FF7 and the like might enjoy it, but anyone who prefers Squaresoft's older RPGs should be careful with this one.",3.0
"I'm fairly new to the computer gaming world, but I definately have a love/hate relationship with this game. The graphics are excellent, the sound is very good as well are the voices...I love the idea of 4 different  stories on one game, and there are plenty of different monsters to kill.  Thats a few reasons why I like the game. The reasons why I don't are as  follows: If you don't have the cheat sheet (which you can get off the  Nocturne fan site...Nocturne.com) this game is practically impossible to  figure out. Also, the monsters come up on you so fast in many situations  that you don't have time to react and therefore are constantly saving the  game and going back trying to figure out how to get away without being  killed. I found myself cursing at the game many times, but I kept going  back wanting to figure it out somehow. If you're a pro at these kind of  games, you'll probably love this one; if your a beginner like me; be  prepared for some long frustrating nights.",3.0
"After just finishing Final Fantasy 7 I was very disappointed by this game. The first thing I noticed were the graphics. The life size characters just weren't working for me. They tried to put too much detail into them and ended up making their image distorted. The world map is terrible. Very grainy and terrible music. Not to mention uninteresting. The best thing about a Final Fantasy game is the amazing storyline. Not so in this. I'm not really clear what the storyline is in this game and I've played it. You never get to know the enemy in this game or why he/she is evil. That makes fighting them pointless. The fighting in this game is horrible. In order to get strong you need to draw from enemies which leaves you open to attacks. If you use magic you loose your strength. I did like the gfs having their own health though. Rather than taking away mp when summoning, a gf will take hits for you and they can grow their own levels. They have too many levels though. In order for some of them to get strong you need them at level 100 which takes many many MANY hours of countless fighting. I haven't seen the ending of this game. The final battle is the only thing I have yet to do. I got bored and quit. I've switched to Final Fantasy 9 for now. I'll finish up 8 after I'm done with 9 which is a FAR better game.",3.0
"In fact, I can honestly say that I enjoyed FF4 better than this game.  The higher points in this game were the complex battle system and the orchestrated music.
Square decided to drop their morals a few notches by letting you summon butt-naked women to smash your enemies.",3.0

"FF8 in my personal opinion is not as good as FF7.  The story is an epic, something Squaresoft is famous for, but the way it's told is not as good as it should have been, and that, is the most nagging part for me and it just brings down the game.  Also, the materia system which I grew to love as been destroyed and replaced with this stupid junction system.  I see it's good points but it's too confusing.  Even with the in-game tutorial, and even to this day, I don't fully understand it to my personal satisfaction but good enough to beat the game.  The graphics have been greatly improved.  The people look like real people.  They have hands instead of blocks, and don't have lethal looking hair (CLOUD).  The fighting is the same turn bassed action as before and some battles can take up to 10 minutes, not a good thing when you're in a hurry.  Another bad thing is how much you have to rely on the GFs (summons).  It's nearly immpossible to beat a boss with out using them and most of them take a long time to use.  The anamaters ovously had a lot of time on their hands and decided that summoning a simple summon like brothers will have to take a couple minutes instead of a quick 5 seconds.  Sure it's great for the first few times but after a while, it gets old.  The world is completely futuristic and has nothing to do with it's title ""FANTASY"".  Sure it's not a big deal, but I'm just pointing it out.  The story is good, but the character development is terrible.  They have to make a game where you actually like the character you play and not one where you constantly yell at the screen calling him an idiot for doing something stupid or saying ""SHE LIKES YOU, CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?!"" because this games' story is based around love, yet the characters that are in ""love"" hardly show it, or at least the guy.  I still don't see what she sees in him.  The FMV is greatly improved and also the ingame graphics as I said before.  FF fanatics should get this game but just be warned, the story has a lot going for it, it's interesting, but the characters just make you want to scream.",3.0
"well,at first, i loved this game.the graphics are great. I sorta didn't like the new ""junction"" system. i like the Final Fantasy 7 straight out ""materia"" and ""equip"" not this. All in all,this game was fun but sorta futuristic. i mean i played all through it the first time. but the second time i played it was because i didn't have any other games in the house and i was bored. AN OKAY GAME",3.0
"Square only seemed to spend time on graphics and FMV.  They didn't seem to take the time to review the storyline much, because after the first two discs, everything tends to get rather dull and boring.
First of all, I really wasn't fond of the battle system all that much...I didn't like the idea of the enemies leveling up with you.  I guess Square did this to make the game go quicker, but that just made things dull.
Second of all, the junction system wasn't a bad idea, but the idea of relying on the GFs and Squall's Renzokuken doesn't really appeal to me or any other gamers.
Third of all, it just seemed too rushed.  They didn't spend the proper amount of time on this game as Square did in number seven and number nine.  It just seemed like everything was assembled in only a series of two months.
Well, I don't wand this to seem negative, so I'll just jump to the positive points.  First off, the graphics.  Everything looks crisp, clean and very attractive to the human eye.
Second of all, the music.  Nobuo Uematsu is a VERY talented composer, he comes up with some amazing musical scores that is well on its way to blow you off of your chair.  However, it seems that he was rushed on some of the pieces, and it didn't look like he had enough time to finish some of them.
Third of all, the storyline IS a good storyline, but the game just seemed far too linear, and extended over a long period of time.  When you first play it, you can't get away from it.  But after you complete it, you may not want to start a new game right away.  And the second time, you may not play it as often as you did the first time.
So, in conclusion, it was a rather inconsistent game.  It had its ups and downs, but all in all, it's not a bad game.",3.0
"Whenever a role-playing game has the words ""Final Fantasy"" in its title, gamers immediately attach the loftiest of expectations to it.  In previous Final Fantasy titles, Square did not disappoint, delivering RPGs that blew away their closest competition.  Sadly, Final Fantasy VIII is a bitter step back for the series, a decent, borderline good RPG, but not worthy of the Final Fantasy name.
In an effort to be ""different,"" Final Fantasy VIII's magic system is cumbersome, forcing many battles where upwards of twenty minutes can be spent ""drawing"" spells from enemies.  Then later in the game when spell inventories begin to fill, because you cannot discard learned spells, you then spend hours casting old, weaker spells repeatedly to make room for newer, more powerful magics.  Worse yet is the SeeD ranking system, which actually punishes you for taking time to explore, when exploration is the inextricable heart of any RPG.  And because puzzles, paths and graphics are often times not clear, you sometimes get punished just for trying to figure out where to go next.
Visually the game is admirable, but FMV cutscenes often seem to be inserted just for show, not for flow.  The soundtrack is decent but lacks the epic qualities found in previous titles.  And the plot of the game suffers from stoicism, with character development being forced at best, non-existent at worst.  These problems, in tandem with the ill-conceived game engine, make Final Fantasy VIII a choking aberration from an otherwise stellar series.
While adequate on its own merits, placed against the rest of the series Final Fantasy VIII clearly lacks the elements which make other Final Fantasy games so beloved.  Final Fantasy junkies will pick it up no matter what, but newbies to the series should start with Final Fantasy VII.",3.0
"The story  is cheesy. The graphics are good. The music is depressing. When I started playing this game I was pumped. The beggining fmv got me going. Then I started playing... Will someone please get rid of that annoying music that you won't stop hearing! You'll get so frustrated when you have no clue on what to do. Random Battle after Random Battle,music after music, same gf after same gf, getting no where after nowhere. Gives you a headache. Do yourself a favor and get FFVII or FFIX",3.0
"This game is alright, but it just isn't what I am looking for in an RPG. I will explain in order of,Story,Graphics,Gameplay,and character design.
Story: FF8 is a true love story. But it is too serious at times. It lacks the carefree attitude that previous titles like FF5 come equiped with. FF5 is more of a kiddy game. If this game was more like FF7, I would play it more. FF7 took the laid back attitude of FF5 and mixed it with the more serious atmosphere of FF6. FF7 is not entirely funny though. Like FF8,it is mostly serious. FF7 has that kind of,""Spur-of-the-moment"", humor. One of the characters will say somthing that will crack you up and then the game goes back to being serious. FF8 is serious all the time.
Graphics: the graphics are great. The cinematics are well worth the time it takes to trigger them. But the in-game graphics are sorta blocky. But I don't really care about the graphics. It isn't the graphics that make a good RPG, nuffsaid.
Gameplay: The random battles make the gameplay tedious. Thats all there is to say about the gameplay.
Character design: The characters are well drawn up,but are just emotionless
Overall this is an alright game. But the game that blows this and final fantasy vii out of the water is Wild Arms. Which you can also purchase on Amazon.com",3.0
Sneaking around= cool. Human guards just asking to be knocked out= cool. Zombies and floating attacking fireballs= stupid. Thief as a game= mostly good. Its worth the measly 20 bucks. Buy it today.,3.0
"Ouch, only three stars from this reviewer. FF8 was amazing graphic-wise, and it opened the door for a few new ideas such as the card game which was included, and the pocket station edition to it. The cinemas were astounding, as were the graphics, the amount of game play was great, but besides all that it wasn't the best Final Fantasy I ever played. Plot wasn't to think, to much of a ""once upon a time"" romance, music didn't impress me, and the villains had no reasoning behind their insanity and they had poo poo personality. Good for a avid fan, you might as well play it to waste and few good 20-80 hours of your life.",3.0
"This game was somewhat of a disappointment.  OK, yeah the graphics, play control, and GF's were cool, but where was the story.  You never have an enemy you truely hate.  In FF7 you hated Sephiroth, and for those who played the game you know why.  The Junction system was also a huge pain. I'm a big fan of the FF series but this didn't live up to the normal standards",3.0
"First of all, I love the FF series. So of course I got this game when it came out.  At first, I loved it.  The animations rock, the systems are all new, and I like that.  Storyline is interesting, and overall, this is a beautiful and extremely well done game. But it is a game with one major flaw - a flaw that actually made me stop playing it out of sheer boredom.  It's too easy.  You are given these guardian guys and they are so powerful that you can't loose.  Not only that, but every time you use one, you have to watch this really long animation.  (like summon materia in FF7) Not using one would be foolish because of how things are balanced, and there is no such thing as MP to waste, and I almost never used magic.  It draged on so bad that eventually the story couldn't hold me any more and I lost interest. Sorry, every imaginable facet of this game is totally awesome except one, and unfortunately, if a game isn't any challenge at all, I can't force myself to play it.",3.0
"I *loved* Final Fantasy VII.  I thought it was the best video game I had ever played.  So, naturally, I was chomping at the proverbial bit for FF8.  Having played it nearly to completion, I can honestly say that Final Fantasy VII is still the best video game I have ever played.
I realize I'm probably not being fair, because I hear that the end sequence is an audiovisual treat nonpareil; however, much of the game is aesthetically fantastic, and that still wasn't enough to keep me interested.  Although many of the miniature quests are entertaining, I never really got into the plot, and that is what has drawn me into every previous Final Fantasy game, to the point where I played to the exclusion of all other necessary life functions ....
I would sing the praises of SquareSoft from the highest mountaintops if I didn't have to waste so much time drawing magic in random battles, fighting random battles in order to get items for weapon upgrades, and scouring the world, enduring tons of random battles, in search of more GFs with more skills so that I could spend more time... fighting random battles.
Don't get me wrong; the character customization system is wonderfully involved (although completely attached to random battles...*sigh*), and the graphics and music, especially in the backgrounds and SGI scenes, are *AMAZING.*  The artists outdid themselves this time... if only I could just look at all the parts of Final Fantasy VIII, without having to slog through playing them.",3.0
"Remember those Don Bluth cartoon games in the 80's - the ones where you had to guide a guy called Dirk through maze of deathtraps by waggling your joystick at the correct time?  They had great graphics and sound, but no gameplay or replay value.  Well, Final Fantasy VIII is the RPG equivalent.  Actually RPG is't a very good word because there's very little role playing whatsoever - the player doesn't have any control over the actions of their characters at all.  You just have to tap the X button of you control pad when prompted. Guh.
Its not all bad though, there's some very pretty cutscenes and the characters do develop as the story progresses.  There's also plenty of little quests to do - the game provided me with 100 hours of game time, so its pretty good value for money.  Still, the linearity of the game cut badly into my enjoyment value - its not a patch on either of the Fallout games or even Baldur's Gate...",3.0
"After Final Fantasy VII, this was a significant disappointment.  The graphics were ok, but the character movements were very jerky, which defeated the attempyt at making them look more lifelike than those of VII.  The junction system is an interesting attempt to make magic different, but  it was rather complicated.  I'd say that replay value is very little and  the battle system was nothing exciting.  It's a decent game with some nice  new ideas, but disappointing.",3.0
"I got D2 Oct 10 2013 and began playing as a Paladin. As it unfolded I saw where Torchlight
, Fate, and Titan Quest Immortal Throne got many of their ideas. It is those three games I
played long before getting D2 and I realized that I could be perceived as being 'spoiled' if I
didnt 'like' D2. I  played about 20 hours before wrapping it up and tossing it in the trash,
(i only spent 8 bucks on it and got a Ultimate Strategy Guide tossed in for free so little was
lost). Though the graphics are every bit 10-13 years old its not the reason I tossed the game
in contempt. Actually I value a game by how much fun it is to play and not how it looks <--
Ill revisit that point.
 The movement behaviors of my character were so erratic and clumsy they reminded me of how a
roach skitters across a floor. Some examples:
I click on a skeleton to attack and my paladin runs right past it to a door and opens
it....OPENS THE DOOR!!! to allow a host of other foes to flood the room ! WHY did it do
that? The door was yards away from the target ! How about standing in front of a target and
swinging and swinging and SWINGING your weapon only to whiff repeatedly. How about swinging at
a foe and repeatedly failing to connect until its reinforcements show up. How about actually
trying to close a door behind you to try and control the 'battle field'...apparently doors
can only be closed by accident. OH ! How about trying to run through a room only to have the
damn door 'accidentaly' shut in your face while foes catch up and throng around you! That
happened to me a few times but I wonder if thats actually an 'in game' spell a foe uses, im not interested in finding out. How about actually trying to use some of the objects in the dungeons for cover and your character
not only will not line up behind any protective object it will CONTINUALLY run around like a
goddamn headless chicken! It will EVEN run into clusters of foes that surround you and cut
off your retreat!....REPEATEDLY!! I swear I cant tell if my Paladin is mentally
challenged,disturbed or suicidal. its a joke! I achieved level 18 with a singular emphasis on
developing the shield battering skill. I was killed twice but both times it was a direct
result of chronic controls failure.
  All games of this nature experience the previous examples to a degree and its an acceptable reality easily offset by the fun ( D2 DOES have ENORMOUS fun potential BTW but its a potential squandered by clumsy controls....for shame. Even I (in the
real world) could preform better than my 'trained' paladin and what I wrote about a games
value being measured in fun and not graphics is spot on true. There is a game called Dungeon
odyssey thats created by Malfador Machinations. It is a 'budget title' (All Malfador
Machinations titles are), thats clearly inspired by D2 but isn't exactly a graphics heavy
game.... to put it mildly :) . That game is far more fun than D2 and I can recommend it
without hesitation to anyone who enjoys Diablo style games. It is IMHO a superior product than
Diablo 2 despite the fact D2 has ALL the ingredients for great and absorbing fun and though D2 ultimately wasn't worth the 8 bucks I spent on it even with its User
Guide, Dungeon odyssey is worth every cent and no user guide is needed. D2 is in the trash and Dungeon odyssey is still on my hard drive.. I think im gonna boot it up and work on my Paladins career.",3.0

"This is a fun game.  I purchased it a few weeks ago and have been playing it every day.  I guess I am biased against this for a few reasons.  The first reason is that the camera angle is set.  You cant zoom in on your character, and you cant differ the angles.  I have played Icewind Dale, NWN, and Morrowind.  These are all superb in graphics and camera angles to Diablo 2.  You also cant save on this game without exiting?  This stinks!  When you do save, it puts you back in the village.

Overall, its a fun, fast paced game that keeps you interested.

"Blizzard's ""Diablo"" certainly made waves in the gaming industry when it was released in 1997. Its strange mix of action and roleplaying kept many glued to their chairs for months on end, and spawned nearly as many imitators as the legendary ""Doom."" In 1997, the formula worked splendidly - but it's the new millennium now that ""Diablo II"" has come to store shelves, and it just feels a little long in the tooth. That hasn't kept it from becoming one of the most overwhelmingly critically praised games of 2000, though. One PC Gamer reviewer went so far as to call it ""the best game ever"" at the time. Apparently he enjoyed the minimal story, the pithy roleplaying elements, and the repetitive click-fest that is ""Diablo II"" - or maybe he just needs to play more games, because this one remains tremendously overrated. I really want to stress how gratingly easy critics were on this game, just because it had the Blizzard logo on the box. Much better games have taken critical beatings, and justice dictates that ""Diablo II"" is put in its proper place. Even so, it's certainly not a bad game, and can become very engrossing despite its lack of depth and dearth of variety.
Though the ""Diablo"" games can often be found in the roleplaying section, there is little actual roleplaying to be done. You are offered five character options at the beginning of the game, and you pick one of them as your avatar - it's that simple. It should be noted, though, that each character plays quite differently, and all have unique and impressive skills (or spells) that they can employ when things get rough. Of course, you will also tweak your character's stats to your liking as you gain levels, which is why this is considered roleplaying at all.
In reality, though, ""Diablo II"" is a top-down isometric action game, and that's just fine. Wading through hordes of demonic baddies is certainly an enjoyable experience - though I myself couldn't help but wish there was more to the game. Combat only ceases when you're in one of the game's three cities (one city per episode), and you really only visit these cities when you need weapons or other items, or perhaps when you're ready to receive your next quest. Quests are extremely linear as well. While playing through the game, I didn't encounter a single quest that was designed to boost experience and was not somehow related to finishing the game's main storyline. I enjoy linearity, personally, but the inability to do your own thing, even just a little bit, keeps ""Diablo II"" from maintaining its freshness. It all boils down to hacking and slashing, leveling up, and repeating that process until the credits roll. It's certainly fun at times, but it's not enough for the game to stay compelling for long periods. Great games transport you to another reality, but ""Diablo II"" will never allow you to forget that you're just staring at your monitor and constantly clicking on things with your mouse. Even the outdoor environments just feel like the spruced up tabletops upon which you are playing with your fantasy-themed action figures.
Oh, yes, and I can't forget to mention that ""Diablo II"" has a truly awful save system that would be more at home in ""Everquest."" In other words, there's an autosave, and that's about it. It makes casual sittings with the game become more frustrating than they should ever have been, since when you die you'll lose key items in your inventory (like your primary weapons), and you'll have to find your body to recover them. To make matters worse, enemies respawn like rodents when your back is turned, and it's just so bloody  aggravating!
In the end, I have been focusing more on the game's faults than its virtues, since I feel that its faults have been least touched upon in the press - but it really is a good game. It is far from achieving the greatness others have claimed, but it's good. If you're one of the few people with a PC and a penchant for gaming on planet earth who hasn't yet picked up a copy, you could be well-served if you're in the mood for some lightweight action. Don't put too much stock in those editorial reviews you've read, though, and take note that games like ""Icewind Dale,"" ""Baldur's Gate,"" ""Divine Divinity,"" and ""Nox"" have all done this isometric roleplaying thing considerably better than ""Diablo II."" They actually offer depth as well as frenetic combat. (Well, all except ""Nox,"" but it was just so bloody fun!) It's inevitable that Blizzard will eventually begin working on ""Diablo III,"" and though it will certainly make plenty of money for the company, if it's to attain true success it had better acknowledge its peers and offer more than its shallow predecessor.
Final Score: C+",3.0
"Diablo 2 is a game where you choose a class and run around exploring dungeons gaining experience and collecting items. This concept goes way back to the old days of Rogue and Dungeon Hack and perhaps even Adventure! so the idea is nothing new. Regardless, it is a fun game. The classes are different enough to make one interesting and there are tons of items to equip your character with. However, what keeps it from getting the 5 stars?
First of all, the classes are inbalanced as only a few of them actually are able to complete the game on the hardest setting (Hell, Players 8) where as other classes do not even have a chance. If you want to make  a character that is different from the run-of-the-mill fantasy stereotype it will be hard to make a good one past nightmare. Also, the spells need more variety as alot of them are just hopped up versions of the ones you get earlier in the game and some skills are just worthless. Add that to the slow and unreliable servers Battlenet has up and running, and your online experiences will be varied on the scale of entertainment.
It is a good game for a while and offers plenty of replay value but it only takes so long till you are bogged down by the imbalances and repetiveness. I would definitely recommend buying the expansion in addition to it as it would greatly heighten your gaming experience.",3.0
"Read all the other reviews, then this one.
This Diablo has an incompetent save feature that precludes you from saving back to your most advantageous moment. Instead, it saves you back to the status you have after a loss. Wonderful!!
Secondly, when you leave, you might start back with a loss of materials painfully accumulated after hours of play.
Thirdly, after increasing your skill level you'll find that the monsters have increased their strengths, etc.
Why bother? Save your money for some other way to waste your time.
Thank you for your time.",3.0
"Diablo 2 is not much different from the first.
  This game is so addictive that it causes loss of sleep and you have dreams that your playing it and you cant quit.  The graphics are pretty good but the game playing is kinda hard to understand and all you do is kill monsters and buy new weapons.
This game is pretty boring but it hipnotizes you into playing it.  And plus Blizzard entertainment gets all these awards and shows off about it but when i play Blizzard games they don't impress me much.",3.0
"Diablo 2 by Blizzard Entertainment is a great strategy game and can be fun.  However the fun starts wearing off after the first set of quests is complete.  The game then takes on the role of not being a game but a task.  Trust me, using the mouse to point your character get's very tiring and dull.  It made put the game aside due to lack of time as well as excitment towards the game.  The reason why I gave it a 3 is because it is way better than the first Diablo and can be fun if a person (1) never played the original Diablo and (2) has a few days to sit in front of a computer and play the game.  One more insight, the Battlenet feature does increase the fun and excitement, but that will only last until the first hacker kills you and steals everything from you.  Diablo 2 just isn't fun, it's a workout which gets very tiring.",3.0

"This game is a potentially very well-done sequel to Diablo, one of the most addictive hack & slash fantasy games of all times. Well-done because of the spiffy graphics, the balanced game play, the gorgeous sounds, the smooth interface, and - last but not least - the variety of monsters and magic items.
What spoils the fun is that the game is heavily REPETITIVE. As enphasized by previous reviewers, you simply kill 'em and collect gold and items, then go on and on doing the same for hours on end. That was the core of Diablo I as well, but there are a few important differences: first, the sequel is four or five times larger; and secondly, all special missions are always there in every campaign, in an exactly identical order of apparition, instead of being randomized as in the original.
As this game genre basically allows no space for tactical or strategical thinking, what remains is an arcade situation repeating again and again. The designers probably projected it to suit the tastes of the teenagers forming the bulk of the gaming public, with their heightened resilience to repetitiveness.
Do not misunderstand me - the game is still good, and I would eagerly give it four instead than three stars if not for the comparison with its predecessor. I was able to end a full cycle of campaigns playing the magician, but is't unlikely I shall find the energy to start it all over again with another character.
In the end, I must note that I found especially distastful the Politically Correct decision to make two out of five characters women, and one of them (the Paladin, traditionally represented as bearing Nordic features!) black. Games are stopping to be a heaven against the vulgarity of contemporary mithologies...",3.0
"Okay, multiplayer is TERRIBLE!
If you're looking to spend loads of time downloading mandatory buggy patches, and you're looking to attract obnoxious teenage boys and men with bad attitudes and personal issues, then multiplayer is definately for you. Anyone with a bad attitude can kill your character and take anything you've worked for in the game, and the bugginess of the patches randomly closes the game or kicks you out of the game.
D2 has so much potential, but Blizzard and Battle.net really need to work on how well they serve their consumers, otherwise people may be wary about the purchasing of future Diablo - related products.",3.0
"The 3 stars I've given are for cutscenes and graphic alone. The game play is fine, but the save-and-exit system is beyond horror. I don't understand people who say that the quesets are fun the the storyline is great. I suppose they don't know what 'RPG' means. Let's see in detail...
Storyline : It's completely and utterly linear. The kind of 'hero-of-the-day-save-the-world-from-evil-dudes'. Oh yes, most of the games use this kind of plotline, but it depends on how they relate the story, not just 'I'm a hero, so I decide that it's my duty to punish this evil lord'.
NPCs: The voice acting is undeniably good, but otherwise they're mindless ragdoll. All cities (and areas) have only a small number of NPCs, each of them has his/her duty, be it selling stuff or giving quests. But all in all, when you have no chioce in dialogues, what are they if not mindless ragdoll?
Gameplay: What part of body do you use except yout fingers to click, click and click? You don't even need strategy, just hack and slash.
Quests: One of the worst point of this game. All of them are either 'Go there and fetch this for me' or 'Go there and defeat that for me'. Can't we have anytihng more intriguing?
Graphic: The only thing that I give this game credit. It's good and beautiful.
Monsters: Yet another downpoint. Monsters look just no different than they did in other areas, just change the color and, lo and behold, we've got stronger monsters!
Replayability: Some say the the maps are random and give more replay value but, come to think of it, it's just change this think to that direction, left to right, north to south, two rocks instead of one, five trees instead of none. You call that 'replay value'?
And, oh, if anyone want to argue or flame me, please do so with my open invitation. I love to argue anyway. :P",3.0
"Literally too, expect your clicking finger to be tired after playing this game.  It's just hours clicking on the screen endlessly to hack and slash the enemies.  I don't even know why this game is called an RPG...it's more action than RPG...

"I have a love/hate relationship with Diablo 2. The new characters are wonderful; I especially like the sorceress. And all the characters have special abilities that they can put ""skill points"" into. Blizzard simply went crazy peppering powerful magic artifacts throughout the game. Be ready to spend long hours contemplating if you should wear the armor of the fox or the beryl chain of light. I like the town-portal function A LOT, which the Baldur's Gate games don't have. This saves you the time of traversing through multiple levels of dungeons just to get to town. There are also things called ""waypoints"" scattered at intervals that transfer you back to the town.
BUT. . . I hate the fact that you can't save without exiting the game. When you do save and exit, you start in town again, regardless of whether or not you were in a dungeon when you saved. Any town portals you have will disappear, so you have to take a waypoint to the nearest area. Unfortunately, the areas are repopulated with monsters. So, if you just spent a bunch of time killing a difficult unique monster, get ready to do so again. Plus, although you can hire mercenaries to aid you on your quests, they have little or no combat value and are basically a waste of gold. Diablo 2 is VERY extensive. Too extensive. If you are searching for anything, be prepared to spend a lot of time going over seemingly endless areas in search for items to satisfy the quest you're on. Also, the plot isn't very involved, so sometimes playing feels pointless. But, I still devote much of my time to playing this game. The reason it got three stars is because my not-so-minor annoyances have won over my overall enjoyment of the game. I would think twice before buying this, escpecially with games like BG2 out, and things like Myths of Drannor and BG2:Throne of Bhaal on the way.",3.0
"I'll start by saying this: yes, ""Diablo II"" is a good game, but no, it simply isn't where it should be: considering the huge hype and all that.
The gameplay is still the same. You choose your character from five different classes, and than wear out two or three mouses as you battle your way to the Lord of Terror himself, Diablo. The most significant difference is the new character skills. You now how the ability to choose from a set of skills as you gain in level, and thus customizing your character to fit your style of play. The game levels have moved above ground, so that you can explore wilderness areas (but also dungeons). There's a weather effect which allows for rain and lightening. And there's different NPCs you can interact with and even hire to aid you. But other than this, the game is exactly the same.
The graphics is the biggest let-down of the game. They're horribly outdated. The cinematic sequences, however, are the best I've seen. So if you don't mind going over the first game in a bigger scale, you'll probably be able to extract some excitement from the game.",3.0
"Do you really need a review? If you loved Diablo, you'll probably love Diablo 2. It's the same hack-things-up-and-revel-in-the-bloodshed good clean fun of the original, but a whole lot bigger. Everything about it is wonderful... except the save game ""feature."" And that's bad enough to knock my rating down two stars. Now, when you save, you're forced to exit the game, and you start back in the main city where you begin whichever act you happen to be in. If you're between ""waypoints"" (and there are sometimes rather large expanses between waypoints, especially in Act III), there's no easy method for saving. It seems Blizzard forgot computers are used for playing anything but Diablo, and thus didn't feel the need to create a game that can be saved when necessary. If you can get past that, though, it's just as much fun whacking monsters as it always was. (The nod to Trilogy of Terror is also wonderful. Take a real close look at the Rat Men/Soul Killers, then go watch Trilogy of Terror...)",3.0
"I have been playing this game for about a month now.  It only took a week or so to beat it, but since then I have re-started it countless times trying to revise the way I evolve my character.  Although I think this is a great game and worth the price, I feel there is something missing to the story line.  The episodes that you get to watch as you progress through the game are done extremely well, and I have watch them several times in awe of their attention to detail.  But besides the episodes there was no story line to follow or maybe it was just assumed (did not develop along the way).  But that didn't stop the fun, and the internal desire to figure out how to evolve the greatest charter and try out all their abilities, with limitless possibilities (I'm gonna be awhile).  Which has caused me to lose a lot of sleep and start this game over and over.  It's a good thing I don't have a life, :).",3.0
"This won't be popular but it could have been much better. Shall we start with some of the dated graphics? The game was pushed back so much they could have updated the beginning. How about the save game feature? What? You say there really isn't one? That's right; save the game and exit and the next time you begin, you're back in town and you have to retrace (read that as refight) your way back to where you left off. Improved inventory? Right! If you try to keep the good things (like gems) so that you can upgrade them, you'll run out of room real quick. In Diablo I, at least you could drop items on the ground and get them later. Not here. Exit the game and come back and all is gone unless it's carried by you or in your inventory chest.
After all that negative, it's still an addictive game; just not worth all the hype. Act II can take forever when you're searching the jungle for one particular village. I've played it as Barbarian, Paladin and Amazon and the village is always in the last spot available. (Perhaps the game was designed that way.)",3.0
"Diablo 2 is a great game when you first start out, but then after you clear the game the first time, things go downhill really fast from there on. The action gets monotnous and boring. Although I like the character advancement system, gameplay and graphics, playing it once through normal mode was enough for me.
Multiplayer didn't work too well for me either since I had to play on the Asia server. Oh yeah, I have a character there, but with 0 playing time and level 1 thanks to lack of server space, it really wasn't much fun.",3.0
"Okay. I was never a big fan of the first Diablo game. One dungeon. Many levels. Many monsters. Many weapons. Many left clicks. That was really it. The story was decent, but as far as ""engrossing"" RPGs go, it could've been a lot better.
Along comes Diablo II, and I hoped it resolved the problems of the first game. First off, the graphics weren't really updated. In Act 1, the monsters looked bitmapped, and the animations weren't too hot. As the game progressed, the graphics got a little better, but still, I don't play games for the graphics foremost; it's the gameplay that counts. And again, this is where the Diablo franchise stalls. I like the 5 different classes; it makes for terrific replay value. But then again, when Icewind Dale, Planscape: Torment, and Baldur's Gate I and II are out there, do you really have time to go ahead and play the same game again as a different character? The skills were pretty cool and the plot was masterfully written and detailed in breathtakinig cutscenes. But something is missing in this game. I found some of the quests tedious and boring, without any real fulfillment when I completed them. It was like, ""go here, kill this thing, and come back when you're done."" Still, I did find myself battling hordes of demons well into the night, so it did keep my interest, simply based on the fact that I wanted to kill the big dude at the end. I worked hard to build up my barbarian, and I wanted it to be all worth it. The different locations were nice, although slightly formulaic (desert, jungle, ruins, etc.), and the ability to customize your character was a breath of fresh air. NPCs were okay, as your interaction with them was limited to mostly gossip and a few quest checkpoints. But don't get me wrong: Diablo II is a nice game, and probably worth the money. But if you're looking for a real story with a ""true"" RPG feel (a la different characters in a party format), do yourself a favor and pick up Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. But if you're into tried-and-true, mindless hack-and-slash, Diablo II is your game.",3.0
"First of all let me say that there is a large audience who loved the first Diablo and will undoubtedly love the sequal.  This review is targeted for the rest of you who may not have caught on to the craze or the hype.
Like many long awaited sequals, Diablo 2 was destined to receive as much anti-hype as hype.  One of the biggest challenges Diablo 2 had to overcome was the treemendous anticipation and expectations that revolved around it.  I wasn't one of the fan's who were waiting with baited breath for the release, so I'll try to remain objective.
One of the nicest things about Diablo was the cool CG scenes between chapters and at the beginning of the game.  The story was well thought out and after watching the first movie I was really hyped to play.  While not a facet of the overall game, they were impressive and worth mentioning.
Another cool aspect of the game were the tons of weapons to choose from, especially with the barbarian who can use two weapons simultaneoulsy.  Unfortunately you can't leave things sitting on the ground like you could in the first Diablo.  gold and weapons go into your stash.  Once it's full anything you leave on the ground will disappear when you quit the game.
Diablo 2 is entertaining, but failed to really captivate my attention to the very end.  I found the game to be unstable on my system which meets the minimum requirements, which was a constant annoyance.  It may not happen to you, but it was a contributing factor to my level of satisfaction with the game.
One of my biggest complaints with the game is that it seems repetitious.  The hack and slash elements are fun, but RPG's have come a long way since the first Diablo was a hit several years ago.  There is little in the way of variety.  The same monsters are colored differently, given new names, made a little tougher and we're supposed to believe it's a new monster.  Eventually even the combat, the saving grace of the game, gets old after you wade through wave after wave of monsters that are far more irritating than threatening.
The other big letdown is that they really haven't evolved the RPG aspect of the game since the first one.  Unlike other RPG's (which I'll get to in a moment) the hirelings and NPC's are static and almost worthless.  You can't interact with them, you can't change their weapons and all their really good for is taking some of the heat off your back until they are inevitably slaughtered.
The game is far more interesting in multiplayer as long as your not trying to connect to battle.net.  If you're like me, however and are barely able to meet the game's minimum requirements and aren't priveleged enough to have a cable-modem, you might as well give it up.  The lag will drive you insane.
All in all, Diablo 2 is a nice little distraction for a couple of days, but it is no t the best RPG or dungeon crawler on the market.  If you want a REAL RPG and not just a dungeon crawler, get one of the many fine Interplay games on the market.  Baldur's Gate 2 may be available by the time you're reading this, but you can already get Icewind Dale, Torment (which is fantastic), Baldur's Gate 1 and the expansion pack, and even the Fallout games, which may be dated but are far more entertaining than Diablo 2.",3.0
"To compare Age of Wonders to any game other than Masters of Magic is ludicrous.  This game is blatantly an MoM clone with  deprecated gameplay and better graphics.  Granted MoM was a  terrific game, but surely Triumph Software could have improved on  more than the interface. The few improvements over MoM are:
- better (barely better) graphics  - a couple new races - a few new spells (most spells are exactly the same as MoM) - tactical combat inside monster lair locations - simultaneous turns - game doesn't end when someone researches the mastery spell.
Its list of features that are lacking from MoM are:
- brutally simplified town management (is this a shooter?)  - can't build new towns  - no town growth  - an 'upgrade' option to replace individual building - one player per race - confusing diplomacy that changes round to round - no improvement to combat, identical to MoM - no improvement to heroes, identical to MoM - no improvement to magic system, identical to MoM
Perhaps I shouldn't be so hard on this game.  Other reviewers and friends say that the simplified interface is a blessing.  That the micromanagement of MoM was tedious.  But what is wrong with having an AI do your town management for you if you  choose?  In all fairness I have, and will, be playing Age of Wonders for  hours.  Buy it for MoM with a facelift, but it is not MoM2.",3.0
"I bought this game not too long ago never having played a turn-based strategy game, although I am a longtime veteran of RTSs.  At first it was a lot of fun, researching new stuff, taking over towns, etc, but it began to  get boring.  Three or four levels into the single player game, it was still  extraordinarily easy, and I already had access to most of the upgrades, but  it was getting annoying.  You can't have parties of more than eight, so  when taking on a castle garrisonning 20 enemies, things get quite  ridiculous.  All of the units are pretty even in strength, and the  cutscenes were not very good, basically a bunch of still shots blending  together.
I do buy games for the single-player, though.  I don't have a  great internet connection, so my reviews don't apply to multiplayer aspects  of games.  It may be great online, I don't know.  However, offline it is  fun and addictive for the first few days, and then it quickly becomes yet  another game junked onto the shelf.
Caution -- when you're playing, this  game becomes one of those ""Just a couple more minutes"" games that  you never stop playing.",3.0
"The guys from Blizzard seem to favour two things :  1: The crow.  2: the  resolution 640x480.  Both of them appear as frequently as possible. The  first one, though, I don't mind. The second - I DO. Well, I don't think  640x480 is the screen resolution of year 2000, the year of the 32, 64 and  even 128-megabyte video cards. Gamers with the dream hardware (700Mhz.  Athlon/PentiumIII, 128MbRAM, Voodo 5/GeForce2) have a lot of extra power  unlike the gamers in 1996 when 800x600 was rare. The resolution, offered by  Blizzard is just not appropriate for nowadays.  As for the gameplay - it's  quite good, but Killing the same monsters several times is not much fun.  Multyplayer is cool, too, especially in cooperative. The storyline,  coloured in the typical for Blizzard pessimictic tones, is nice. The  cut-scenes revealing us the story are well done too, but in 640x480 they  look a bit bixelated on a 17"" and larger monitor.  Overall, this is a  mediocre game. It has strong and weak points struggling to win just like  Diablo's servants and our hero. And none of them seems to be succeeding.",3.0
"Diablo2 is actually nothing more than the upgrade pack for the original Diablo. The graphics are still almost the same 640x480 with so-limited  colors. The gameplay is still nothing more than clicking and clicking on  the enemies, until they're gone.
This game has a very good story and  plot.. However, all of wasted on the repettitive gameplay.. no matter what  the plot or the quest is, all you have to do is running around and kill  everything to obtain some certain item (sometime just kill some boss, and  the quest is over). I think... games with the story and plot as good as  Diablo2 should be much more interesting if there're more things to do with  those plots. (It is, however, still better than the original Diablo, and I  hope it would be better in Diablo3).
One thing, the Cinematics are very  good, and is one of the best I've ever seen in any computer game. Even now,  sometime I still load the game just to watch those cinematics.
Another  thing.. this game was way too short and too easy. I finished it within 3-4  days after I start playing it. As a veteran Computer RPGer, who had been  playing a lot of RPGs including BioWare's incredible line of RPGs like  Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment and a lot of older titles (since the  AD&D gold box and Betrayal at Krondor), I feel that this game is far  too short and too easy.
Anyway, this game is still fine.. as a time  killer. Since Icewind Dale is not yet release in Japan.. I'll enjoy  clicking in Diablo2 for a while.",3.0
"While I think Diablo 2 is a great game and I enjoy playing it a great deal, there are negatives enough to make this a title better purchased on sale. On the up side, the plot is phenomenal, the characters are very  exciting and interesting, and the world is more fun to be in. On the down,  though, is the utter lack of replay ability, even given the new character  classes. Unlike its originator, Diablo 2 featues only 6 quests per Act, all  of which are set in stone - the order of presentation doesn;t even change  game to game. There are numerous glitches in the game even after 2 patches,  and there is no strategic thought into how to complete any given activity -  the quest log leads you by the nose through everything. Overall the game is  fun and I am pleased that it was money well spent for the entertainment,  but after 3 years, I think Blizzard could have presented a much better  game.",3.0
"It has been almost a year or even more since I found out about Blizzard's new project...Since then there wasn't single moment that I didn't think of an excitement that this game will bring(well not in such extreme way, but  still). And finally two weeks ago there it is, brand new on the shelf, so  long awaited and...so not worth of waiting. I do agree with most about the  great cinematics and good graphics, but for the sake of a good RPG,  advanced 3D technologies and good plot line, what happened to the tradition  of Diablo...why the greatest hack 'em up, get cool stuff and spend good  time game turned to be a boring decade old idea...Tell me, what was so bad  about monsters just staying dead and not reapearing every time you save,  and why the character has to appear in town every time you save and hack  through all those hordes of monsters again(including Quest  monsters...Mephisto, Smith, and etc.) The items in every town are so  expensive but give not a very good advancement before the truly hordes of  monsters that there are out there...Those endless lacking any innovation  sandy or forestry planes, where some of them with inclusion of some  dungeons and labyrinth are not related to the game in any way...I played  Torment before this game and in comparison the puny 15 quests which I  finished in less than a week, the easy to kill Mephisto and Diablo(even  easier then other lesser magic monsters...say with stone skin)just weren't  worth that nervous waiting and the truly briliant legacy of Diablo!",3.0
"If you like the battlenet play and the multi player mode you will like the game. I like the single player mode in Diablo and Hellfire and this new game does not save and let you continue to play. Trying new wepons is a  nightmare! you get killed you lose all your cool stuff!  Hackers need to  make a thing to save character and restore it, like they did for Diablo. It  is a good game but not if you like collecting the cool armor and trying new  stuff. Also the spells are messed up, you are only allowed to use specific  ones for each character (this is really stinks! )",3.0
"Well after about 2 years of delays to get it right you'd think this game would be the greatest thing since sliced bread. Blizzard is one of those companies that I hold to a little higher standard. In my book, they have  fallen a little short. There are no glaring flaws with the game, but it  just isn't the next step I'd hoped it would be. Sure there are nice  additions  like a few more skills, being able to run, and a stash chest,  but it's the same depth lacking RPG the first one was just with a few  additions. Don't get me wrong, I'm not slamming the game. It is a very  DECENT game; it's just not a great game. If you like myself have been  burned out on Diablo for years and were hoping that DII could rekindle the  flame, I believe you are going to be disappointed. If you're looking for  some easy hop right in point, click, and slash action then this is for you.  If you're looking for Diablo but with more depth and more emmersive game  play, then you may want to pass it by. If I were on a limited budget and  needed a gaming fix, I'd look elsewhere first.",3.0
"There are obvious improvements with Diablo 2 such as improved character developement and better graphics. But there really isn't a whole lot better about this game than its predicessor. Also, the fact that the game has been  delayed and delayed some more has really got me wondering if they are ever  going to get this right. Who knows, maybe the final version might change my  mind, but this latest beta doesn't make me want to go stand in line and buy  it whenever it does come out.",3.0
"Half-Life is the coolest game I have ever played. You know, creatures eveywhere, great strategy game, how do I get over there kinda game.

Once I  beat the last boss I was so happy thinking, ""Wow that was a tuffy!  Cant' wait for the next"", but then the game ended! I expected it to be  a lot better than that! The thing I thought would be awsome in it was that  you could lead a ""squadron"" of grunts and medics and soldiers.  The most you ever get to come with you is 3. 3! That's not a squadron. The  new guns were cool though. The graphics were good too but thats about it.  So if you wanna get a game DON'T get this.",3.0

"Granted, the pictures and graphics are good, but the storyline could have been a lot richer - I felt like I was missing out on a large part of the story - the puzzles were good 9 there was a real-world logic about them,  but DO NOT expect an exciting ending...considering how cheap it was, I'm  not surprised.",3.0
"This game, in the tradition of Myst and Riven, has appealing environments, reasonably challenging puzzles and a solid storyline, and is ultimately fun to play.  Unlike Myst and Riven, Crystal Key offers a 3-D environment to  navigate via Quicktime movies rather than clicking through two-dimensional  snapshots.  There are some disappointments, however.  Graphics quality is  uneven, and while I avoided serious difficulties the software does seem to  contain some bugs. The soundtrack has some pleasing snippets of music, but  clearly the producers didn't bother putting together much of a musical  score.  The interface, while easy to use, reveals some solutions through  its highlighting of ""hot spots"" on the screen.  The end of the  game lacks the payoff sequence you'd hope to see after spending all those  hours working through the puzzles and saving the world.  Ultimately, one  has some sense that this is basically an unfinished product, but at the  price offered, its not a bad value.",3.0
The Crystal Key is probably best for players that don't have much experience with these types of interactive games.  The puzzles are not too difficult for the most part and it does get boring rather quickly.  Each section of the game is too limited as to how far you can explore an area.  The scenery is not as lush and interesting as some games and the musical scoring could have been much better.  I played this after playing Myst III which had more interesting graphics and characters to interact with.  This was a gift so if I had payed for it myself it would have been a bigger disappointment.,3.0
"I actually really liked this game -- or most of it.  The scenery was beautifully rendered and the locations were interesting.  The story line was not really very compelling, however.  It was more of a reason to put you in the game in the first place than a driving factor, but that didn't bother me too much.  I also liked the puzzles, many of which involved lateral thinking and looking around the environments for hidden clues.
However. There were an awful lot of bugs in this game and it crashed frequently.  And it seemed that just when things were starting to get interesting, it was over.  The ending was abrupt and dissatisfying.
If you're jonesing for an adventure game, go ahead and play it because there are many enjoyable moments. But you might want to borrow a friend's copy rather than buy it.",3.0
"This game had fabulous graphics and really seemed to have potential--unfortunately, it was over in no time. When it ended I literally sat there thinking. . .that's it? Too bad. I usually expect an adventure game to keep me occupied for weeks, this was over within 3 days of buying it. There are better games out there, don't bother with this one.",3.0
"I really don't think this game is as bad as a lot of other reviewers say it is.  It's basically a good game that's fun to play, with fairly decent graphics.  Of course, there are some major problems.  For one thing, the game routinely crashes on my computer.  I can't go 15 minutes without it locking up.  This doesn't make much sense because my computer meets all the right requirements, and it should work fine.  Plus, it gives me weird error messages every time I try to save a game, but it still allows me to save, so I can let this slide.  And not only that, but at times throughout the game, the screen will suddenly start to flash green, and I can't figure out why. But the worst problem this game caused was that it slowed down my computer immensely, so that I had to reboot every time I played the game.  Because of all of these problems, it drove me to uninstall the game before I got to the ending.  It's a real shame, because it's a fun game and I wanted to finish it.  Oh well, perhaps another time.
Another problem is the story.  I didn't find myself caring a lot about the characters (when there were characters), so I give the story a big thumbs down.  The story got slightly better when you enter the Jungle World, but not much.  I also wish there were more music and ambience effects, but there weren't.  There were some nice ambience effects, like in the Jungle world, but not many.  One last thing I didn't like was that it took a long time to move between scenes.  Just walking along a corridor can take longer than it should.  But, besides the major flaws and bugs, the game is fun to play.  The puzzles are kind of cool, and exploring the new areas is fun.  That is, if you like adventure games.  If you don't like adventure games, you will loathe this game.  I just wish it worked right on my computer, that's all.
Pros: Basically fun to play.  Some pretty nice graphics in some areas (the Jungle World is really cool).  The puzzles weren't too hard, so they weren't frustrating.
Cons: Major bugs in the game keep it from being completely enjoyable, and made me unable to finish the game.  I didn't enjoy the story.  Perhaps there should have been at least some harder puzzles.  Hardly any music and sound effects.  Pretty much no replay value.  (Even though I do want to finish it someday)
Overall: 3 stars.  I wanted to give this 4 stars, but the bugs and the lame story brought it down.  It's worth buying only if you really like adventure games, and are willing to take a chance that it will work right on your computer.",3.0
"Generally, I love this type of game...  I had some fun with this one, but, honestly, there was much to be desired.  Here's the deal:
The storyline was very compelling.  Unfortunately, I had gotten about two thirds of the way through the game when I realized how interesting the concept was, especially combined with some smooth, detail-filled graphics.  That meant that there was not enough left to really enjoy.  The game is so short that, by the time I got into it, it was over.  Bummer.
I was a bit annoyed that I felt I had to use a walkthrough for this one.  I got tired of slowly wandering through the game, hoping I would stumble across the clues I needed to find my direction, trying to exact a plan to get the bad guy.  Why did I feel like that?  Ultimately, the use of logic alone cannot be used to figure this one out.  The many of the puzzles, but, especially the end, I felt as though they were contrived out of chance alone, like a good book that suprises you with an ending that is ""just not right"" for the storyline, or incongruent with other elements of plot.
So, all in all, the game is nice and entertaining, but I was pretty disappointed at a premature ending.",3.0
"In my opinion, The Crystal Key is a good game. However, it does have some problems. First of all, when you're looking around the area, the graphics don't blend easily. Also, the puzzles are very challenging (actually, I love challenging games). But I must say it has a very interesting plot. When you finish the game, the villain dies and a screen comes up and says, ""Congradulations! You've defeated Ozgar and freed your people!"" Then it goes to the main screen. Not much of a congrats. This is the plot: Somewhere out there among the stars, lives another race of people. We know this because, just weeks ago our radio telescopes accidentally intercepted one of their interplaetary communications. When we were able to decode it, this is what we read: ""Danger: Ozgar has been defeated but not destroyed. Suralon is sinking. Return to Arkonia. Abandon all colonies at once."" Who were the Arkonians? And who or what is Ozgar? Only days later, a gigantic alien spaceship deployed powerful satellites around the earth. All kinds of upheavals occured in the next two days: devastating earthquakes, critical weather shifts, and drastic gravitational changes. Ozgar is coming after us. You, a hypership test pilot, are relatively safe in the polar research station, where the world's first hypership is being constructed. After scientists successfully pinpoint the origin of the Arkonian signal, you are chosen as the last hope; savior of the planet. Your mission? Find the Arkonians and defeat the evil Ozgar. I would recommend this game to people who are very experienced with strategy games.",3.0
"This game started out pretty cool.  Sure it crashed a few times, sure it  was pretty dark and hard to see, and sure some of the puzzles were pretty  obscure, (though not quite so obscure with a walkthrough...), but for  twenty bucks, I was right into it.  I felt emmersed in the environment and  was thoroughly enjoying it.  And what a relief to play a game rated 'E' for  a change.  They are hard to find these days.
In fact i was a little  disappointed that I was already halfway through it, but since I still had  two 'slots' left on my Key, I knew I had two more cool worlds to  explore.
Except you can't go to the next world.  Oh, and there IS no next  world after that.  And CONGRATULATIONS YOU WIN. GAME OVER.

"Hello, all. I am a lifelong Rayman fan, been playing ever since my parents set me up with the original when I was three or four. Before you consider buying this game for your Playstation, there is something you must know, so read on.

As some of you may know, Rayman was originally released as a PC game (and on Atari Jaguar, but that system died pretty quick). Therefore, you could say that the PC version is the definitive version of Rayman. It sold amazingly, but that's beside the point. The Playstation port of the game came out a month or two later, and unfortunately for Playstation fans, the PC version of this game is superior to all other ports. Let's take a look at this game while comparing it to the original, computer version.

This is kind of long, so if you don't have time let me sum it all up - PC version delivers where Playstation falls short. Even if you have XP, you can get the PC version to run with the official Ubisoft patch. Buy PC version.

PC vs. Playstation
Graphics - The graphics are one of many strong points in Rayman. They are lush, vibrant and brilliantly done. The backdrops are splendid and as a whole the graphics in this game do a great job of drawing you in. Luckily, I found that between the two versions of the game, there was no difference in the quality of graphics. However, for reasons unexplained, some of the backdrops were different in certain levels. This may not bother some people, but to me and my friends, we felt as if they didn't quite fit in that particular spot.

Music/Sound - I've noticed that most Ubisoft games have exceptional music that is played well by talented people and sounds good. In this game, the music delivers on those counts but also adds a certain level of emotion to the game. To illustrate, the music in Band Land truly allows you to appreciate the beauty of the world around you, while in The Cave of Skops the music alternately makes you feel apprehensive, at ease and lonely. There are a few different tracks for each level (I believe around three each) and at least one of them always makes you realize how beautiful the game is, while the others have their own quality to offer.

Now that you know how exceptional the music is, I hate to tell you that the Playstation version of the game cuts out a LOT of it. I recall hearing music in levels that don't call for that certain track, and I recall levels that didn't even have music at all, and only strange percussion solos. In the PC version, all the music from a world is featured in each level - they simply play at different times as the level calls for it. The music always matches the scenario in the PC version, and there are no strange percussion things going on. Also worthy of note is that in the Playstation version there are strange kind of buzzy sounds that occur every now and then (they are part of the game and I don't know where they come from) as well as a pretty annoying brass/giggling interlude when you complete a level. Both of these things were absent from the PC version, and it was for the better.

Gameplay - Luckily, the actual gameplay wasn't affected as much, but it still has some serious flaws. Rayman still obtains all the powers he needs to and controls the same, but some of the levels were completely different. I recall one level from the PC version of the game - the first level in Band Land which was a beautiful walk through the hills - removed from the game entirely to be replaced by a completely different monotonous level in the Playstation version. Another level in the Dream Forest was an exciting adventure through the swamps walking on logs, and it was changed to the point that it was completely unrecognizable. What's the deal?

All in all, at least Rayman plays more or less the same. However, I felt this Playstation version came short in too many spots for me to get the full experience. I would only buy this if I couldn't run it on a computer, and if that were the case, I wouldn't be writing this review because you don't need a very advanced computer at all to run the software. I only bought it because the Playstation version is available for download on the PSP and I needed my fix of portable Rayman. It was a little bit of a letdown, sorry to say.",3.0

When I opened the package, I thought I was being sent a blanket with measles.

"plenty of scratches and dings, but it works.

controller was garbage. joystick range-of-motion was 90% freeplay. So far gone that taking the controller apart and trying the old-school tape fixes wouldn't help. Be ready to buy yourself a new controller.",3.0
"The nintendo 64 is great. It works. Only issue is the controllerb analog use stick is damaged, so when I move my character in the game they move sporadically or run too slowly out of no where.  I have to shake the controller hard for the analog stick to unstuck itself. Also there was white bugs in the game slot. I recommend wiping down your system before use. But other than the broken controller the system is fine.",3.0

"While definately worth the money for the archives of Dragon-lore, the program it comes with really is poor - the only use is for searching through all the articles.
The issues themselvers are in PDF format, so I  recommend just using Adobe Acrobat to read them, and don't bother with the  built in one.
Another drawback is some of the coolest ""inserts""  from Dragons past are missing (Like the Deck of Many Things!), but you can  download them from the WoTC web site (at 5-10 meg per file).
Overall, I'd  say the product is worth it, but don't expect to be wowed by the  accompanying program.",3.0
"Overall nominal wear and tear. I will have to order a new controller due to broken joystick. However, product came as advertised and shipped very fast.

"We might just be cursed, but it seems every N64 we buy, we have problems with it. This is our third one, and it takes about a minute to get a game working (multiple games do this, so it's not the game, and yes, we are putting the cartridge in correctly). Still, it's understandably getting old, so this can be accepted. The games are worth the wait. I recommend Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, very great 3-d platformers and multiplayer (on Tooie). Hands down best two games ever, they are a huge part of my love for video games ever since I first played them about 10 years ago. But yeah, great system.",3.0
Two of the five games didn't work as well as the controller's joystick didn't work well. HOWEVER the game system itself works amazingly and looked new. As well as power and AV cords are good quality.,3.0
The system itself is not in great shape. I think that the general descriptions are now good enough to be able to predict how the system will arrive. It is very convenient to just pick a system that is affordable but be aware that it might be in rough shape.,3.0
"As with the other Star Trek games, New Worlds provides some interesting  game play.  It however does not provide any new or unusual twists.

The console itself it great but it's overpriced.,3.0
"I was given this game (it was literally falling to bits, but the CD is fine)
Of all the games out there, I think this game - if you look at it in terms of 'a concept' - is probably where the future of games will go (and should go)
someone here had mentioned the physics engine - I'm no physicist, but Trespasser's physics engine is the best I've ever seen (and I have used MathEngine and Havok) - a physics engine that was developed between 1996 and 1998
the highlight is when you push a Jeep off the side of the mountain - I must have repeated that performance about 10 times (upon saving)
you can't believe how GOOD - really amazing - the physics engine really is (it leaves UT2003 in the dust, let me put it to you that way)
that in itself is just simply staggering - who are these people at Dreamworks messing with a physics engine before anyone knew what a physics engine should be used for?
moving on - Trespasser's 3D sound seems to be appearing in games coming out just in this year alone - that alone, is simply another staggering concept
Trespasser is just way ahead of its time (the big problem inherent in it)
on to the game - it's awful; I'm sure - with the best intentions - that a whole load of dynamics were applied to the game to make it stand out from the crowd; and it certainly managed that. Only that standing out from the crowd and being a complete jerk is probably not the way to do it
I have noticed reviewers here not mentioning exactly what is needed to play Trespasser - well it sure is NOT a PII or an AMD K6. The best results I've seen were K7 (1.4Ghz) and an FSB clock speed of 166Mhz on the AMD platform - anything less will kill it when you switch on the full detail that Trespasser is capable of. And talking of the graphics card, you don't need anything special. The best one in terms of cost is the ATI Radeon 9500 Pro
As a concept - in 1998, people must have been in shock. Physics in a game? Woah! Hold the phone!
As a game - it falls very short
Someone needs to tell Dreamworks to give the license of Trespasser to someone who can combine Gameplay, 3D sound and Physics and pull it off so that it does work, and the story itself will lay claim to the fact that you can't beat it
Something special is here in Trespasser, but like a piece of coal, you'd never see the diamond inside without applying a bit more pressure (development)
Trespasser should have the emphasis on weapons, virtually removed. It's pathetically ridiculing the game's concept",3.0
"Overall, I liked this game. good smooth graphics speaking since it doesn't require high-end expensive graphics card. Only thing i hated was I can click tricorder map and go directly to the spot, i have to scroll slowly to the spot. There is no cheats to this game either unlike most games out there. You cant save games during missions, only between them. I don't mind this but you might.  I have AMD K6-2 500mhz computer and It hasn't crashed on me yet. It seems pretty stable to me.",3.0

The system works great now that I purchased a new Av cable with a-video and a new controller. The one they sent way NASTY. It was sticky and caked with something...so I tossed it. The rest of the system is fine and it's certainly fun. Would have given it more stars except that I had to purchas new cables and controller.,3.0
"Freespace 2 has a lot going for it. It's a model space flight simulation. You spend almost all your time flying and fighting with great controls, there's good AI both for enemies and your wing, graphics and sound are very good also. Additionally there's good multi-tiered story although part of it remains unresolved at the end. Some of the briefings that advance the story, introduce new weapons and review mission objectives can drag a little too long.

But as I finish the single player campaign what sticks in my mind isn't the good above but the disappointments. Most of the game takes place in a large nebula. Multi-colored 'gas' and lens flare effects fill the screen, the result feeling like playing with a large flashlight in your eyes. It doesn't improve the gameplay it just irritating. Most missions are the straight 'kill everything' type. Other missions seem designed to frustrate you. For example one mission requires you to fly a series of waypoints that are basically in a straight line. The catch is you can't see the next way point from your current one so if you waver off course you become hopelessly lost and have to start over. Finally a handful of missions are usually difficult, pitting you solo against a large number of enemies or timed with unclear objectives.

Apart from a badly-scratched install disc I had no trouble running the game in Windows 98. Nothing I tried would get the game to install in Windows 2000.",3.0
"All you get is the console. No cords, no controller. You just get a dirty console lacking a cover for the expansion pack port. Disappointed, but not worth the hassle of returning.",3.0
Didn't work well.,3.0
"The game of shear strategy is totally awesome. It is intense and may be as obsessive a game as Diablo 2. With the variety of characters available for play, boredom is not an option.
Though the graphics are fantastic and real to life, don't get too obsessed in any one mission, or game play, as some unfixed bug in the program will undoubtedly crash and/or lock up your system.
I have downloaded the update patch available from the online SFC2 site, but the program lock-up remains.
That in my opinion is the major pitfall of playing this game at all...the game has potential, but I wouldn't recommend it until the bugs are fixed.
After all, what fun is a game if you have to reboot your system just about the time things start to get interesting?",3.0
"In the past few years, Star Trek games have been getting better. With the release of Starfleet Command, the road to better games starts here.
Starfleet Command starts out good with a training mission or two and then goes into actual missions. The addition of Sulu training you is a big plus to this game. However, after playing a few missions, it gets very repetitive in action, despite the changing plots.
The graphics are good, but not great. A 3D card really doesn't improve things.
While this is one of the better Star Trek games, there isn't much variety to it.",3.0
"As far as gaming goes this a really great game.
I like the way one can manipulate the variety of views and create screen shots. The graphics are greats and the game play is smooth.
What I do not like is that it is modeled after Star Fleet Battles (SFB). I've played SFB in my teenage years and found it tediously boring, and not qutie in sync with real Star Trek theme. For example there is no Lyran Commonwealth in the paramount's Star Trek which is based on all the movies and the shows. There should be consistency in the industry and the story line.
This game would have been better if modeled after FASA's game ""Star Trek, the Starship combat simulator"" created back in the mid 80's, but now out print, because paramount shut down FASA's contract. Apparently FASA was getting a bit to creative, which I see as a double standard when you look the non existing Lyran commonwealth. The only thing FASA did was create additional ship classes for the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans and that was it.
I sorry but Star Trek vessels do not carry missiles, topeados Yes, missiles No! The game should have been named something different and have not been associated with Star Trek.",3.0
"While this game does provide very nice graphics, it doesn't offer much else.  One annoying 'feature' is that the Klingon interface is in Klingon, the Gorn interface is in Gorn, etc. which may be fine for Trek Heads but  most of us humans will only be able to read the Federation interface.  Once  you get accustomed to which controls are where and/or you learn the  keyboard shortcuts the gameplay is smooth and easy, but it takes time to  just to learn the interface.
The multiplayer game setup interface is also  quite awkward to utilize.  Unlike other games which have one player click  ""host"" and then the others simply join that game, this product  has one player hit ""select"" then ""host"" then  ""announce"" while the other players click ""select"",  ""setup"", ""join"" - why are other players ""setting  up"" a game!  While this isn't a show stopper, it is  annoying.
Another critical failing of this game is that the ships can  only fly in two dimensions!  This *IS* space, right?  Granted, the game is  modeled after the board game which only allowed two dimensions, but why not  allow the computer to do what it does best and add the third  dimension?
Besides the above, the game does have excellent graphics and  offers great multiplayer action (especially which each player taking a  different race).  Star Trek fans will love it and I suspect the board  gamers will like it.  However, it falls short of its potential.",3.0
"I was a late addition playtester for this game, winning a spot via a writing contest.  Star Fleet Command is based heavily on Star Fleet Battles, a strategic board game put out by Amarillo Design Bureau.  I  myself am more of an SFB fanatic than a Trekker, and like most SFB players,  have been wanting a SFB based computer game for more than 10 years.  Star  Fleet Command was a noble effort, but it falls short.  For myself, I feel  it was due to a ""rush to market"" attitude within the leadership  of Interplay.  They didn't seem to take the comments of us playtesters  seriously, and let most of the bugs we had found and had been screaming  about go right into production.  It left something of a sour taste in my  mouth.  As much as I'd like to say this game is the end-all be-all for both  Trek fans and SFB fanatics like myself, I can't.  It's a mediocre game,  falling far short of what it had the potential to be, and by all rights  what it should have been.  It's OK, but not great.",3.0
"This game is a decent enough battle simulator, and I have to give it that much.  My problem with this was actually with my expectations of it, and I guess I should take part of the blame for that for not reading more  reviews.  However, from looking at the box, and reading the marketing  descriptions, it seemed to me that this game was going to be what I had  been waiting for:  a non-mission-based fly-around-and-do-what-you-want  space game.  Unfortunately, as has been stated before in the reviews, it is  entirely mission based, there is no warp drive, and you pretty much just  show up where you're supposed to be, do what you're supposed to do, and  exit the game when you're done.  I find this boring.  I'm still waiting for  a good solid free-choice type of space game, where you can jet around and  get yourself into trouble on your own, without the hinderances of specified  missions.  As I said, I should've checked more reviews before buying this,  because I didn't realize it was just a battle simulator, but from what I  and my friends had determined, we thought we would have a lot more free  choice as to our actions, the battles we wanted to fight, and the places we  wanted to go.  Unfortunately, this is not so.  This is probably a good game  for what it is, I just wish the marketing had more explicitly revealed the  game's objectives.",3.0

"At first, I'd reccommend you to try building your own farm from scratch, even if its a failure, just so you get a feel for the game. Then try a  scenario.  The graphics are pretty bad on this one and its sorta hard to  understand at first, but if you are up for the challenge of a farm then try  out this game. It gets boring quickly so be sure to purchase this one from  the bargain bin.  Try new things to keep gameplay interesting, like  terrible conditions, having animals or buying more and more.",3.0
"This is a good game, but it gets boring after a while.  In the beginning, it's kind of exciting, because you have to make sure you have enough money for fields, machinery, irrigation, etc.  But after a while, you're just  doing the same thing over and over again, and it can really get boring.  It's neat when the house on the screen gets bigger, but it happens rarely,  so by the time it happens for the fourth time or so, you get really bored,  and it's time for a new computer game.  The good part about the game  (or, for some people, the bad part) is that it's really addictive, and you  won't want to do anything else. It's the kind of game that you play for a  week or so, get bored, and then maybe play it again in a couple of months.  It gets boring too fast, so it's probably best to play it until you get  bored, and then give it (or sell it) to someone else.",3.0
"I was impressed with SimFarm at first because of the wide variety of crops available to grow, in any region or climate of the United States.  Also, there are many temperature guages and budgets and things that show you all  sides of running a farm.  HOWEVER there was one major glitch in this game-  it's too much work.  You always have to be out spraying your fields, all  the time, for the same things over and over.  It got so that I didn't want  to play this game because it took too much work- kind of why I wouldn't  want to be a real farmer.  One other small thing-  once I finally made  enough money to get a spray plane, there was no way to get it to land!",3.0

"This game is really great, despite one or two ""little"" problems.  The plot, the characters, the vision of the future...  One of the few movie sequel-type games that uses its name to the fullest.  Even if you haven't seen the movie, this game's well worth the $$ for anyone who likes a  well-formed adventure story.  This game claims to be real time, but it's  not really (at least in the sense of The Last Express and other well-formed  real time adventure games).  Still, it's really fun, and you usually do  things at your own pace.  This makes this particular game more fun and  enjoyable than its real time counterpart could ever be.  I think the only  major mistake this game has is that it's too darn hard to get any of the  endings you haven't already seen.  After you've seen one, you've probably  seen all of the ones you can reasonably access without changing your  playing habits way too much.  And, some of the prerolled aspects of the  game (i.e., who's a Replicant and who's not) are completely random  (obviously, they're **prerolled**), and therefore you could get the same  ending over and over and **over** again without knowing why.  And, no, this  is not an exaggeration.  I've probably played the game five times, and I've  only seen three of (supposedly) seven endings.  One of these endings was so  revolting I couldn't bear to watch it (not violence wise, more... plain old  disgusting wise; you'll know it when you see it).  All three of these  endings were available through different paths the first time I played, so  I just saved and saw them all the **first** stinking time.  Anyway, I keep  playing it again and again to see the other endings, and, frankly, it gets  old.
To conclude, it's a good game, and, if you can bear playing it  about a billion times, you can take advantage of all the annoyingly hard to  get endings.",3.0

With rare VIP visits, bomb threats and Santa Claus this game doesn't have  tooo many unexpected twists. You have to do a lot of waiting to get to new  levels and to earn more money.

They are only supposed to live life half of what we do.  This movie also makes you think.  Like at the end when he was talking about the android that saved him.

"This is an old game.  A very old game, as you can probably see by the system requirements.  So you can't expect too much from it.  As an ant, you go around getting food for your anthill, and avoiding all the obvious dangers (spiders, bad ants, human feet, even lawn mowers.)  You can lead your ants as an army, whether to the enemy or just to food.  You have to conquer the yard.  The strategy is pretty simple, and it's pretty tough to lose (all you really have to do is block the red ants' entrance to their anthill using rocks, which makes their queen die of starvation.  The you just multiply.)  As for the spider shooting lasers, yes, it can do that, but only when ""crazy"" mode is turned on (you can turn this off.)  The game is mainly better for just goofing off (not actually playing to win.)  For example, you can become the spider, and walk around eating both bad ants and good ants.  Plus, if you are an ant, and dig far down, you actually get to these teleports underground (they look like little beetles) and you can use them to get to the red nest. Aside from the regular modes (quick game and full game), there's experimental mode, where you just goof around, and can't control any ants.  You can spray pesticides, make mazes (and put ants in them), put out food, kill the spider, kill the queens, etc. All in all, the whole point of this game is a little boring, but if all you want to do is goof off without trying to win, then this is the game for you.",3.0
This game is fun for the whole family with easy learning for the kids and  adults but this game could have been better at the start it is very hard to  get use to but in the end it is very fun but after about a 2 month period  it can get boring if you like simulated games go check out SIM CITY 3000  and THE SIMS they are great games!!!

"This isn't a bad game, actually. It's a great time killer and it is fun at some spots. The graphics are not good, obviously, but for the time it was made they are not that bad, especially the rain graphics. Do not buy this  game if you are looking for an engaging game that will addict you though.  This is a game that you will come back to every now and then and it will  probably stay on your system for a while. One more thing: Don't buy this if  you are afraid of bugs!",3.0
"This is the ultimate ant farm for those who can't afford one. You get an ant and you dig a nest. You bring green food to feed your queen. You avoid the spider. You repeat. You can while away hours and hours with this game,  digging away happily, but then you will suddenly realize that you were  digging for naught. Why?
- When you switch between yard quadrants, all  you work is replaced with a randomly-generated nest.
- The ""warp  spot"" is always in the same place.
- The ants do just as well with  your control as they do without such.
- The ultimate secret - tell to no  one: you can win the game by setting it to max speed and just waiting. The  ants will oust the reds, the humans, the dog and the lawnmower completel  without your supervision.
This game gives you the illusion of being an  ant. It also gives you the feeling of how worthless a single ant is. Try  this game. It grows onto you.",3.0

"It's definately a step up from the first Baldur's Gate but isn't as good as Shadows of Amn. There isn't much in the way of character development and items are scarce, which can be annoying if you're getting into fights and need armour (non-existent for the Nameless-One), though tatoos and such can tilt things more in your favour. Not being able to rest in dungeons, or anywhere outside of 'inns' really, so being a mage can be difficult and you might as well stay a fighter throughout the game. I get that they wanted to make a game where you can choose to avoid violence in almost every situation, but it can come across as frustrating. Same with the equips; there are ammo slots but no ranged weapons, you have to find the good teeth for Morte (which relies on either luck or checking faqs), and there really isn't much in the way of customization in the party members (you don't choose their proficiencies and some only have 1 type of weapon that they can equip).

Your alignment isn't as flexible as it's made out to be. Thugs will occassionally attack you, but there's no affect on you attacking them yourself. I choose to kill a quest giver who had a lot of cash on him early on and there was no affect. It doesn't matter how you leave the first level either. While it may have been too much to expect most of your choices to affect your alignment, it would have been nice if the instructions mentioned a hidden scale or something. As it is, I have to wonder why casual killing and being a very nice man has little affect. Maybe it balances out, but I have no idea.

The game is also praised for very different characters in the roster; an amnesiac immortal, a talking skull, a wizard permanently on fire, etc. But there's very little interaction. They're just there. And unless you talk to them, which rarely has much depth, they will only have a few lines of dialogue while in your party, very little taking place between them. In SoA, one of my favorite things in the game was Jan's conversations, the progression of romance plots (even if pickings tended to be slim, especially for women), and their reactions to certain situations. Avoiding spoilers, when someone close to one of your party members dies and you go to where the body is, it unlocks a conversation option IF you choose to talk to said person. Otherwise, nothing happens.

Most of my complaints with the game are technical, and it is over a decade old so allowances can be made. The plot is interesting, even if one part leaves you guessing as to your next objective (frosty mug and gallery. The Apothecary is surprisingly useless). And while you may lack the control you had over other Black Isle games, this is a decent experiment in fitting the character to the setting (i.e how many people really use bows in the city streets?).

It did seem really nice and brand new, but I wanted to inform anyone who would like it in the original box, it does not come that way.",3.0
"I really wanted to like this game, based on all of the praise it has received and the fact that I really don't have the time to play simply mediocre games.  After having played the Baldur's Gate series and thoroughly enjoying it, I thought that this would be more of the same immersive fantasy-based gaming.  On some levels, this game is successful in creating an interesting world to explore with some fascinating people to meet and things to do.  The story itself is quite intriguing and well-written.  The problem is that the game is slowly paced for the first several hours and is tedious throughout.

Gameplay: The controls are fairly simple and should be familiar to anyone who has played Baldur's Gate and similar RPG titles.  Your character is an immortal amnesiac who must find out who he is and how to resolve his curse of immortality.  The character creation options seem flexible at first, but they really aren't.  While you can change classes during the game, you had best learn how to do one thing well, or there will likely be problems later.  Also, your alignment (moral view) may change based on your actions, but many of the game's quests (including the main one) are scripted for ""right"" answers that might force your character to play out of character.  Also, there are some unreasonable limits placed on combat.  In 30 hours of gameplay, I didn't come across one projectile weapon, which meant that all fights were melee skirmishes.  Moreover, you can't tell how wounded your opponents are until they actually kill over.

Planescape: Torment is a very text-heavy game, which is both its strength and greatest weakness.  Whoever wrote the dialogue and story is a talented writer, and this would have actually made a decent novel.  However, much of the dialogue gets in the way of the gameplay in ways that are truly annoying.  You'll find yourself running back and forth between people, going through their entire dialogue trees looking for clues (several times).  Sometimes those clues will not be found unless you know exactly who to talk to, when, and about what topic.  Even then you might not get what you are looking for.  Some of the quests are very imaginative, but others are greatly hindered by this ask-everybody-everything-everytime approach.

The dialogue issue would not be such a problem if it did not plague the main quest, but it does.  I hate to consult walkthrough guides, but you will probably have to in order to get pass a few of the several places where you simply won't know what to do next, who to talk to, or what item you need.  There is an in-game journal that can be useful, but even it won't point you in the right direction on some occasions (and ""completed"" quests are not always taken out of the ""assigned quests"" category).

Actually, this is the first computer RPG that I have played that could not hold my interest until the end.  This was largely due to the tedious nature of the gameplay.  I knew that it was time to quit when I defeated the main boss, just to get a message afterward that said that, in effect, I had not chosen the correct specific dialogue options before defeating this enemy. What???  It was like finally meeting Diablo at the end of Diablo 2, or Dagoth Ur at the end of Morrowind, or Jon Irenicus at the end of Baldur's Gate 2 and winning the fight, just to learn that you had not been nice enough in your dialogue responses before the fight started and thus would have to redo the 30 minutes of dialogue that preceded the encounter.  Very frustrating.

Graphics: Visual representation is decent, even by today's standards.  Character models look good, as do environments.  The game does have a certain drabness about it, which is part of the storyline.  But overall, the graphics are fine.

Sound: Decent, but nothing memorable.  The weather in the main city of Sigil is always the same, so there are no thunderstorms or other ambient noises.  The voice acting is decent, but quite sparse.  More of it would have made the story even more immersive and less text-driven.  The music was okay, but again not memorable.

Replayability/Value: I couldn't bear to get through one complete playing of the game, so I can't recommend it for repeat plays.  If you insist upon playing this game, try to get it cheap ($10 or less).  The story and quests seem too linear to warrant doing them a second time, especially since you are the same basic character during every game.  There are a few interesting party members, such as Morte and Annah, but NPC interaction here does not measure up to the high standard set by the Baldur's Gate games.

Overall, I cannot recommend this game to anyone except very patient and/or hardcore roleplaying gamers.  For everyone else, there are many computer RPGs available now that are clearly superior to the gameplay, story line, and graphics of Planescape: Torment.  If you want to play a truely excellent, classic RPG, check out Morrowind, the Baldur's Gate series, Gothic 2, or even the Diablo series.  Though it has a good story, my suspicion is that Planescape: Torment largely appeals to a specific niche of the computer roleplaying market, which does not mind its tedious dialogue system, linear questing, and bizarre story.",3.0
"What would happen if there was a place where there existed a portal to anywhere you wanted to go, both real and imaginary?  You would find yourself in Sigil, the city of doors, deep in the center of the multi-verse known as Planescape; a place where the mere belief in something will cause its existence.  You play the role of 'The Nameless One' an immortal being with a touch of amnesia, in his search to find out about himself.

Gameplay:

Torment utilizes the Infinity Engine made popular by Baldur's Gate, yet it seems to be geared more toward the new RPGer rather than fans of BG.  The interface is probably, the only downside to this game.  Everything is accessed through a circular right-click menu that is accessed during a paused game.  Everything from talking to your characters, changing weapons, casting a spell and using special abilities is run from this window.  It's a good idea in theory, yet it tries to do too much with too little.  The original quick buttons found in BG were a much more efficient set-up.

The game uses a slightly modified AD&D second generation rule-set.  As with the interface, the rule set has been simplified in this game.  You have no choice to your starting character.  Simply put, you are the nameless - an immortal human male, who starts as a fighter.  During the game, you have the option of changing between your starting class of a fighter and a thief or mage.  There's no dual-classing, switching to another class is like building a new character, yet switching back, you will find all your previously earned experience saved.  Your available party members are not only locked in whatever class you find them in, but are, for the most part, locked in their weapon and armor choices.

What makes this game one of the better RPGs on the market is the story.  In your quest to discover yourself, you learn about the story and concept of the planeworlds, an interesting universe where belief is very fabric of being.  Though it introduces the player to the world, the story is very linear and you'll find yourself without much choice in the matter besides your decision to play good or evil.

Graphics:

If you've played any of the Black Isle games on the Infinity Engine, you'll be very familiar with the sights and sounds of Torment.  It's a bit more zoomed in than the others, and that can lead to confusion when trying to cross long distances without the use of your mini-map.  But for being 5 years old and only 800x600 it is very artistically done.  A lot of work was put into creating a town that looks and feels like it could be the center of the universe.  Besides the obvious, the game has aged very well.

Sound:

The ambient music is excellently done, as well as the voice acting.  The biggest problem is in the game's EAX manipulation.  If you have this turned on, you'll be hard pressed to hear the voice-acting in any outdoor or cavernous scenes as it just blends into white-noise.  Besides that, the only annoyance comes with the apparent necessity to have your characters have a voice prompt after they do *anything*.  After you've heard one of your character announce they have stealthed for the umpteenth time, you'll be hoping to never hear it again.

Overall:

While it's a fun game, it's not quite my cup-of-tea.  Your character is immortal, you die and wake up somewhere with your inventory intact.  For the most part, you can go around with your level one thief and try to take out City Guards with no side effect.  The game is just too easy, even at the hardest settings.  Add that to the severely linear gameplay and at times it becomes a little slow.  It's your typical quest driven RPG without much in the way of side quests.  Luckily, you have a variable alignment which can change depending on your actions,  and that adds a little to the mix, but not enough.  If the story wasn't as well written, then this game would have been a flop, so pick this up as a nice interactive novel, but don't expect a second play through unless the best RPG you've played before this is FF.",3.0

"I ordered this N64 system alongside two games and a new controller, and I'm thankful I got the new controller too as the one that came with this system is dirty to the point I have to put elbow grease behind the scrubbing, and I'll have to take the controller itself apart to clean/oil the inside to get all of the buttons working right again.

My biggest gripe with this is that it came in such ghetto-like lazy packaging; the system, controller, and cords seemed to be just flimsily wrapped in thin bubble-wrap and tossed into the box- a box which was about three times bigger than what this system could have been put into (which I fear for the system being tossed around during transportation as it is).  I payed $52 for this, and the packaging couldn't have been done just a little bit better?

That aside, I can say (after playing this system for the last six hours) that it does work just fine, and I did luck out that it came with a Jumper Pak.

"I'd like to add to the review of jilesmeacham below, which I think best highlights the shortcomings of this otherwise fine game. These problems are all true, and detract from the experience.
The main bug I encountered not already mentioned was the enormous amounts of casualties the skirmish formation inflicts, and the minimal casualties suffered. I have patched it, and it still happens. Try the three day battle at the easiest difficulty level with skirmish mode. The enemy, whichever side you choose will crumble. A 7-1 kill ratio is not atypical. At higher difficulty levels, this continues, but the skirmish units are very quickly routed, even if the enemy unit attacking has sufferted large casualties, and I've lost five men. This makes the skirmish the strongest formation, if you have a large amount of troops to hold objectives once they've been routed.
Another problem is that the division, corps, and army commanders, are not very useful, except for boosting morale and rallying troops, and seeing all units under the officer's command.
Also, the lack of friendly fire makes for unlikely movements. You must entirely surround a regiment to have it surrender. When it is routed and has nowhere to run, that is the only situation in which it will surrender. So it pays in the game if you manage to encircle a regiment(s), even if in reality, your own troops would have fired more shots at each other than at the enemy. But if it manages to slip through a narrow gap, which seems like computer cheating, it won't surrender.
And again, artillery and cavalry are not useful. You must mass a large amount of artillery to inflict the amount of casualties a brigade can. The only use is that they lower enemy morale at no cost. They provide opportunities for greater losses as well. Also, it's almost like the computer cheats, when it comes to using a regiment to capture enemy guns, they always run away, or the regiment is ""repulsed."" Cavalry are only infantry that cost twice as much to lose. They don't lose morale in skirmish mode, but their costliness leads me to pull them off to the or retreat when I have infantry to take their place. They have a speed advantage in column mode that can be used at times to capture unoccupied objectives, such as when a few routed enemy units recover behind your lines.
In the Pickett's Charge scenario, there isn't much Union artillery at the easiest difficulty level, and at higher levels, they don't do the damage that they historically did. It's likely at the hardest level for you to lose disastrously, playing as Union, because your own morale lowers more quickly than that of the computer.
I'd like to reiterate the point already made that the importance of objectives detracts from realism. If you know anything about the Civil War, then you know that, for the most part, successful generals pursued armies and not locations. There are no decisive locations on this map. Lee was trying to push north, and if there are to be any Southern objectives worth a small amount it should be to control roads to the North and the town itself.
The last problem I can think of at the moment is the significance of battle formations. It is difficult to take advantage of holes in enemy lines. You simply amass enough firepower and reserves to lower morale and cause the enemy to retreat, and it's sort of automatic. The enemy is certainly good at finding weak points in your line, however. Also, it is difficult to try moves that could be described as ""daring"" or ""risky."" I have attempted to outflank the enemy by swinging an entire brigade(s) to the side of their lines, and the problem is that it takes too long, and the scenario ends before I can get started. Also, realistically, the enemy would remove or realign some of its units from its locations if in a true battle I had troops almost behind it.
Still, given the price now, used or in a store, this game is worth getting. Lots of play on these 3D maps help get you familiar with the battlefield, if you decide to visit. Also, the PDF included has some basic information, as well as battle statistics. If you have a book on the battle, this is a refreshing way to experience it, and, despite the bugs and design flaws-it belongs on the shelf of every Civil War buff and battlefield visitor.",3.0
"Gettysburg is a title which will capture the interest of any strategy buff. Large scale and multiple units to command, what more could you ask for. Well, an AI with a sense of reality would help. Several aspects of the game just don't reflect military logic. Firstly, cavalry march (in column order) as mounted units but when engaging the enemy they dismount and fight like infantry (also looking exactly like them). Sure, mounted infantry were common but gone is the elan of a cavalry charge, the most debonair feature of the era's battles, VERY disappointing. The only advantage cavalry have in this game is their speed of deployment which is scant homage to Custer and Stonewall. Artillery, which are the scourge of infantrymen, cause very little damage. After bombarding a few enemy brigades for a half an hour with over 50 cannon I inflicted a mere handfull of casualties. In this game (historically accuracy, at least on green troops) the major affect of artillery is to lower the morale. Veterans would not be as easily affected but here all suffer to the same degree. The most glaring problem, not limited to artillery alone but endemic throughout the game, is that routed enemy units slip through your ranks (unmolested by your troops I might add!)and disappear behind your lines to reemerge as effective fighting units where they either harass your flanks or recapture abandoned victory locations. This is just plain ludicrous compared to the historical record. Routed troops, separated from their officers, rarely recover their composure. Even when routed (running through your lines or away from them as is the normal thing to do)these units will not be fired upon by your troops. Again history has proven that routed soldiers suffer excessive casualties, which is why they rarely reemerge as combatants. But by far the most annoying thing is to see your men completely surround several regiments and artillery only to have these simply run right through your massed ranks. This happens in every game I have played. There is a patch for this but I haven't seen it eliminate the problem. Artillery is the main culprit here. The AI just refuses to allow these units to be captured. All too frequently they just limber up and saunter through or by my troops without a shot being fired in anger. Unless you close with them when they are unlimbered they are invulnerable to infantry. Indeed, my cannon stand static as they get raked with shot when closed by enemy infantry but when I close with them my soldiers break and run or the battery limbers up and drives off. These are very annoying tendencies which spoil the accuracy of a game which is touted as being close to the historical record. I think they could have done much better. Sure the atmosphere is great: courier messages, bugle calls, gunfire, battle cries, feedback from troopers all add to the spirit of the affair but these are just side issues to the main. Troops are easy enough to deploy so long as you like a box formation. Deploying in lines is all that one can muster and brigades can thus be stretched very thin. In order to compact these you will need to manually adjust their placement. When dealing with several dozen regiments this requires a lot of concentration. The flagbearers are so puny that singling them out in densely packed groups is quite taxing. Also, units will tend to stand where you put them so you will need to babysit as some regiments will stand  back from the fray and allow their neighbours to be annihilated by the seemingly more cunning opposition AI. But no mind, it makes scant difference if the enemy is killing you at a ratio of 6-1 as victory is achieved through the capture of LOCATIONS.  To this end I doubt if the developers gave much thought to how the game should end. I have played to an outcome where I captured all locations and inflicted losses to the enemy of 16000 to my 2000. With nearly two thirds of his men KIA the enemy still kept on attacking. I wouldn't mind if this involved some sort of clearly defined battle lines but the opponent had simply dissolved into a dozen or so remnants which merely harrased my troops at victory locations. Never saying die is one thing but lets be frank, after suffering a loss of a third of his men any commander would order a retreat: at two thirds he would surrender and then blow his brains out. There is an option to CLAIM victory but I think this applies only to multiplayer. I would like to see this game fixed to show a bit more realism before I can start calling it a great game. As it stands it has limited replayability (it doesn't matter which scenario you play they are all just variations on a theme). If endless sessions of engage, flank and pursue is what your looking for then this is right up you alley. I just think with an overhaul the game could be much more.",3.0

"Nightlong is a good game in the fashion of the old King's Quest or Return to Zork. The graphics are spectacular, and it has an interesting storyline. The challenges you must complete are fairly difficult, but anyone could get  them eventually. The game is rated Teen because of some foul language and  the shape of the women, but it's nothing you would't see or hear on TV. The  one main problem I had with the game is that it's so short.

"When Nintendo 64 is compared to PS1, which is actually cheaper than this is, there is one weakness that Nintendo 64 has. And that is the lack of games. Also, N64 runs on cartridges, and many of its games are costly. Since the console is old, you can get many of the items for this console, and the console itself, for a fairly low price. Nintendo 64 was actually a big hit when it came out, I remember so many of the kids going nuts over it. I actually never had one when I was young, but I don't think I really missed out on much. If you are thinking of getting this gaming console as a gift to a little one, then you should try to get it for a low price. My Mom bought one for[dollar amount]for my brother on Christmas, but I got one used for [less]. Even though it is old, there are many great games, especially multiplayer games available on N64.
Pros:
1) Large selection of multiplayer games
2) Great RPGs, such as Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
3) Fairly cheap if you shop around
4) Pretty good graphics
Cons:
1) Lack of games
2) Old, so lack of new releases
3) Runs games on cartridges compared to small CDs.
There are many games which younger children will love available on N64, so it makes a great gift for young ones.",3.0

"Tachyon is one of those games that intrigues from the mini-movie intro. The graphics and colour schemes are so dazzling that you will instantly get an adrenaline rush. This has to be one of the best rendered games I have come across. The gameplay is simple enough to grasp, there is not much of a learning curve here. Sound,despite the odd shrill female voiceover, is very well done. So why do I rate a mere three stars? I have one rule to playing games. I play for fun and not to be aggravated. Unfortunately Tachyon has a few elements that are sure to tick some (certainly me) off. The game is played out on the ""Job Board"" where you will be hired to complete contracts ranging from deliveries to disabling ""Capital Ships"". Some of these quests require the player to repeat multiple times before figuring out how to find the proverbial chink in the armour. Try disabling a Battle Cruiser that outguns you 20-1. Good Luck. That (repetition) gets boring real quick. Each time one has to return to base, rearm and take off again, usually passing through multiple gates before reaching the target. That is a whole lot of lost gaming time. The thrill of the chase and intensity of combat (assisted by the A1 graphics) makes up for the lag. But my biggest complaint is that I have encountered difficulties with the docking controls. On a few occasions I have had to spend up to an hour just trying to dock (despite the autodock feature) because the AI wouldn't acknowledge that I was there. Indeed I had to abandon one quest (Rescue the Persephone) because the auto dock didn't work. It's not just a thing that makes you go ,HUh! but is also very annoying. The quests simply lack the depth and sophistication (lasting little more than 10 min. on average) to overcome the deficiencies. Don't get me wrong I still think this is a great game, graphically speaking, but the repetition and bugs really spoil the fun.",3.0

"This is a very pretty game. The graphics were top of the line when this title was released and it still looks very nice. However, the strength of the first 4 Wing Commanders was the storyline. The filmed scenes in WCIII  and WCIV told interesting stories that brought you into the game. The  filmed scenes in this version serve little to move the story along and are  a waste (I am sure they cost quite a bit to make). Furthermore the missions  are fairly repetitious - you are either in a dogfight or on a bombing run.  Try Independence War if you want a challenging space sim or X-Wing Alliance  or Freespace if you want a more traditional but fun space shooter.",3.0

"I bought this game while I was bored one evening. I went to my local best buy looking for something to hold my ever shortening attention span and I saw this on the shelf. For lack of something else I bought it and was  happily supprised. It entertained me for a good three nights while I played  it in the evenings with my shiny new Conjurer. The game play is sort of  diablo-ish, but not quite as much of a dungeon crawl. Your scenery  constantly changes as you wander on your quest to save nox (and get back  home to your... trailer park?). I had a blast playing this game and was  really eager to play it multi-player. Which horribly crushed me when I  discovered it was only death-match (okay, okay, it has capture the flag  too, but I still call that death-match). No co-operative play what-so-ever.  This really killed the games re-playability in my eyes. It's a lot of fun  winning the game solo, but I just can't bring myself to pick it up anymore,  and i'm sorry, but these types of games just weren't ment for deathmatch.
All in all, a great single player game, but if you're looking for a  lasting multiplayer experience, I'd go elsewhere.",3.0
"I could essentially reiterate my review of the original ""Delta Force"" game, and it would apply with equal validity to ""Delta Force 2."" Yes, it's an enjoyable game, but none of the weaknesses of the first installment were remedied. The AI remains woefully inadequate, and seems even a little weaker than DF1, if that's possible. The play features which were unrealistic in DF1 remain so in DF2. Game play in general seems to be repetitive and routine, despite the attempts to set imaginative plots for each mission.
Still, the graphics have improved a bit, as have the types of available weapons. The sound effects are more realistic, including the distinctive sounds when each different weapon is fired. The feature of insertion by parachute has been added, which (as a former paratrooper) I find particularly enjoyable. The huge playable terrain areas remain a great strength, contributing to replayability and freedom of maneuver.
Nevertheless, this is just a superficial makeover of DF1, without any real substantive changes that impact gameplay. It's fun but it could have been so much more. Sadly, however, the opportunity was missed. Better luck with ""DF: Land Warrior"", which is the subject of my next review...",3.0
"Delta 1 was an awesome game.  This follow-up was okay, the graphics were average, but the missions were sooo easy.  I beat the entire game in 3 or 4 days.  The really frustrating thing was that i couldn't control my teammates.  The commands are like something like ""Cover fire"" or ""resume mission"" which gives you no options at all.  You have to singlehandedly beat the missions.",3.0
"Rather like 'Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear', 'Delta Force 2' initially seems to be a slightly-massaged mission pack for the original 'Delta Force'. The graphics have been improved slightly, in that you now get to crawl through  grass, and considerably more of the man-made scenery can be blown sky-high  with a wider range of macho hardware, the but the actual gameplay boils  down to long-range sniping, followed by close-range sniping, followed by  grenades and a dash to the rescue chopper. Unfortunately for 'DF2', it  isn't enough. Crucially, the voxel-based graphics engine, whilst perfect  for long-range sniper-fests, is jerky and slow on anything less than a fast  PIII. Whilst not unattractive, the graphics seem shoddily done, with  buildings looking particularly nasty. It's a shame, really, as voxels seem  to be the only way to display convincingly-detailed topography without  curtailing the viewing range. The gameplay itself is hardly changed from  the original, and becomes quiet monotonous after a while - the variety  present in 'Rogue Spear' is missing here. All the original AI faults are  back, too - the bad guys have a habit of dashing straight past you when  they get up close, or running into walls and sticking there.
All in all,  it's much the same as the original, and if you liked that, you'll like this  - but only if you have a fast PC. It's important to stress this. On my  450mhz P2, the game juddered in 640x480 resolution, making it very hard to  accurately aim, fire, and shift my aim to another target.",3.0
"the first time i ever played this game was over at my friends house..... he had just gotten a new pc and the game was fun. but the next day i went out and bought it, and well it was very choppy. needless to say.... if you  don't have a really good pc don't get the game. get delta force not delta  force 2.",3.0
"If you're expecting many suprises, improvements and additions in the Delta Force sequel then don't. The first disappointment is speed. I really enjoyed Delta Force mainly due to its fast and smooth frame rates. Version  2 can get painfully low frame rates especially when you point your scope to  the action. I tried it on a 128MB PC with a TNT2 Ultra graphics card and  although movement was smoother it still showed signs of slowing down in the  action.
Graphics, sound, weapons and other gear are more or less the  same. That is not say the game isn't good. If you liked to pass your time  with Delta Force then version 2 will keep you busy as well. Just don't  expect all the new features advertised to make any significant difference  to the original. It's more like an expansion pack.",3.0
"One thing that you have to keep in mind when you play Delta Force 2, is that the game is not super realistic like Swat 3 or Rougue Spear. And that is where this game takes its dive.
Delta Force 2 is supposed to offer a  realistic quality, wind and distance effecting your accuracy. But, I still  haven't seen that done in my game. This game shouldn't be bought as a  realistic team fighter, but a gung-ho Rambo type game. Sure you have  teammates, but they are useless, and usually die. Also, hostiles who  wouldn't spot you in a million years, some how do. But, when you are  completely visable, and out in the open, many times hostiles won't even  react to you. Also, the graphics are not improved, but rather the same as  the first Delta Force. Multiplayer is crude, and often times uneventfull,  with simple maps. Really, this game is just an add-on to the original, so  if you have the first Delta Force, don't buy this one. If you don't have  the first one, and you are in to charging into camps, sniping everything in  sight, and a really easily beatable Campaign mode, come on in!",3.0
"I really enjoyed Playing Delta Force, and I thought that DF2 would be a souped-up version of the first.

If they  can get rid of the bugs with this one it will be awesome.",3.0
">This game, all in all is terrific for anyone who wants to become a serious pilot or have some real fun finding out what it's like.  The instrumentation is all correct, the exact method of navigation pilots use is correct as well as landings, weather ETC.
 >But the largest problem with the game is that it constantly reminds you that you're not really in to the pilots seat, you're behind your desk looking at a monitor.  How does it do this to you?  The slow load ups as you switch from view to view and the dispicable frame rates that can occur when viewing certain types of weather.  I am on A PII 450 MHZ 128 RAM with an ATI-RAGE PRO 3D with the latest drivers.  >Basically, my regular frame rate for this game 15 fps.  When i was right up close with dynamic scenery my frame rate dropped to a mere 8-10 fps.  And when I was viewing light clouds or transparent clouds, my frame rate dropped to an unplayable 1-6.  I was really disappointed to find this because I really wanted to experience this game fully, but constant slow loads and almost unplayable frame rates caused me to turn this game off in frustration many a times.

"I was both happy and disappointed with this version of Microsoft's Flight Simulation. I was happy with the fact that this version of flight simulator has about five times more airports and navaids than Flight Simulator 98 had.  Also, the GPS included with the simulator is a great tool for the novice pilot who has no idea how to get from one point to the other.  Another feature I liked was the realism of the game.  You can adjust the realism settings of your simulator and even download real world weather.  The cockpits of the different aircraft are also amazing with realitic panels and close attention to detail.  I also think the printed manual that comes with the game is excellent, even if it is a little thick.  There are also several things about the game that disappointed me.  First is the scenery graphics.  I was suprised that this Flight simultor did not use the same scenery graphics as Combat Flight simulator, which were excellent.  The scenery graphics in this simulator are not that much improved over those in Microsoft's Flight Simulator 98.  Second, I thought the playablity of the simulator lacked something to be desired. Even on fast computers, I experienced hesitations in the game when I was turning and landing the plane.  Overall, the playability of the simulation is not as smooth as flight Simulator 98.  Finally, I had trouble getting the simulation to work on a couple of computers.  On one computer, I had to tweak with the CD-ROM settings before the ROM would recognise the CD.  On another computer, I frequently got errors and freeze-ups.  Overall, Flight Simulator 2000 is not bad, but I was expecting a much better simulation.",3.0
"FS2000 Pro is a great simulator for the PC. I bought it about a month ago and I have been hooked ever since. But, there are still some things Microsoft has left, either for the next version or just abandoned. Like the scenery of most ""small"" cities is not so good. Theres just a tower which is same for most cities and there are hardly any buildings and houses. After a series of buildings in Chicago or NY, there are the plain lands without smaller buildings. I have boosted the RAM of my PII 350 to 128 megs from 64, but apparently, not much difference. Apart from the scenery, there are other shortcomigs too. Such as the crashes. They're not real. It seems as if a piece of glass is breaking, no sounds, no fire, nothing. There's no smoke puffing on the runway. The sounds inside the cockpit are ridiculous and it seems as if the plane is sliding down the runway without landing gear! The models of the aircraft might be accurate but there's still some attention required to be given to the fuselage. The real-world weather option should have customized networking settings for firewall users like me. MS should give more aircraft and patches on the web site to download and not leave them for the next version. I wonder what's left for this ""best"" labelled flight sim in the next version. FS 2000/Pro may be a great simulator but MS has neglected many countries like India, some south-east countries, and places like Kathmundu which could have had an excellent scenery close to the Himalayas. Another major thing that is lacking in FS2000 is that for newbies, who don't know how to go to a particular place and not an airport, there should be a country map or listing of all well-known places and the airports close to them. All these features, if included, can make FS 2000 a better sim. But, users or prospective buyers of FS2000/Pro should not care about all this, because its only for the die hard simulator enthusiasts and pilots who're deeply interested in this sim. Overall, on a 10 point scale rating, I'd rate this sim as 8/10. Have fun!",3.0
"This version of the Microsoft Flight Simulator program is easily the most advanced, graphically and sound effects pleasing ever made for the PC. Airports are accurately rendered, coastlines are not ""block""  drawn, but look like they are in real life, the engine sounds more real  than they do in FS 98. You can even see a sunset when you fly, and with the  highest resolution, it really looks neat.
The truth is, however, you  MUST have the fastest computer in the market to run this thing effectively.  I have a 266 speed computer, and I have to turn all the graphics bells and  whistles and scenery detail to the lowest setting or I can't land. The  frame rate is just too slow, and I was all over the place on the approach!  With all the stuff available for download on the internet, you can get  scenery just as good, sound effects that come close to the real thing, and  any plane imaginable and do just as well with FS98, save some money, and  actually be able to fly it with some semblance of control, as the frame  rate will be quick enough for you to be able to make those snap control  movements needed to land accurately.
If you have a fast enough computer  (should be 500 speed or more) with graphics accelerator cards, you would do  well with this sim. If not, stick to FS 98.",3.0
"The 2k version of MSFS is the best civil flight simulator ever created. It has a lot of improvements over the previous version (98). The enhanced graphics and the new engine sound schema (which has different recorded sound for each engine compression stages) are my favorite improvement. The  flight models are well built, as well the new weather generation algorithm  (The clouds now looks like REAL clouds...).
But...
What about the  machine? I think there's no computer to run this simulator with rasonable  performance. You see, I have a P-III 500 Mhz, 128 Mb RAM, Viper AGP 770  with 32 MB, a lot of disk space and... 18 FPS in Meigs Field with LearJet.  I tried everything to improve the performance (the most updated video  drivers and DirectX, MSFS 2k Patch, etc.) and....... well, you know.  Nothing! Microsoft released a patch #1 for MSFS 2k, trying to solve some  problems concerning turn gauges and  others issues. I install it and  nothing was changed.

"I don't play many games, but this one intrigued me - it had an interesting story, excellent graphics, and incredible cut-sequences.  I'm not too far into it yet, but so far the story and the main interface is immersive.
The main problem with this game is in it's  ""alternate"" user interfaces, for the game actually has four  modes:  adventure, fighting, shooting and swimming.  An somewhat uneasy  transition takes you from one mode to another.  Shooting mode is a  traditional first-person shooter; however, it's one of the worst I've ever  seen.  It's fortunate you don't have to spend much time in this mode.  Adventure and fighting modes are adequate; not the best I've seen, but they  don't detract from the excellent story.
Overall, I'd recommend this game.",3.0
"The game is beautiful, but I do think Quantic Dream could have taken some time to fix a number of things. For one, the game has a huge grudge against my primary display driver (which works fine on the other 3-D games I play) so I have to use the software rendering, which isn't too slow as long as  it's on 640x480 resolution and the detail is very low and the clipping is  very near...
Also, the shooting mode is insanely stupid as other people  have said. And the game refuses to respond to my keyboard about a third of  the time when I try to fight in the arena. (My roommate didn't have that  problem, however, so it might just be my keyboard.) And it would be nice to  skip the cut scenes...seeing the video for the 50th time at the arena is  really boring.

"I remember in 1999 reading rave reviews of Age Of Empires 2, and it was hard not to get swept up by all the excitment. And a few years ago I bought Age Of Empires 2 Gold , complete with The Conquerors expansion set. And indeed I had  a lot of fun in those early days. But as  my playing sessions progressed I got a bit disenenchanted. I feel that Age Of Empires 2 has some serious flaws.

Firstly I feel that instead if being a strategy game, AOK is mainly a race against the clock. The presmise is that your civilization has gour ""Ages"" Dark, Feudal, Castle  and Imperial. But it's virtually impossible for a an earlier age to defeat a later age. So *priamrily* what you do is try to advance your civilization as quickly as possible. Everything else is secondary. It would be nice to think that you could cunningly build a town on a cliff top for protection, or engage in intrigue and espionage to emerge victorious, but that's not important. Getting  your villagers to work as efficiently as possible to adavance an age before your opponents is what matters and that involves lots of frantic mouse pointing and clicking. Even in websites devoted  to Age Of King strategy people say things

like ""try to reach castle age in under 22 minutes"" If I wanted a racing  game I would have got Grand Prix 4.

Other bad points are:

* Only one zoom factor. Even on 1280 resolution it's  very hard to get the ""bigger picture"" of what's hapening and you'll be continually scrolling around the map to get an idea of what's happening.

* Scouting is incredibly hard. It's hard to figure out what to do if you don't know what the enmy is doing also, and most of the time when you send a scout to enemy territory it gets killed. And you'll have to follow it closley to gain any worthwhile info. By which time you'll be unaware of the assault on your town...

* You'll frequantly get SWAMPED by imformation. When you're massed army is in the middle of the deciding battle of the game, you'll suddenly get several irritating mesaages in a row saying that a farm has expired back in the town, or an ally wants more gold, or a Teuton archer has lobbed an arrow at one of your pikemen in some remote corner of the map. It can be total chaos, and often the only solution is to pause the game every second or so and issue tedious commands to order  a vilager to rebuild the farm back home etc. This game requires you to be everywhere at once. Computers can do it, humans can't

*Combat can be incredibly fiddly. With the limited zoom mentioned your situational awareness is terrible and most of the time you can only amass an army and let it loose and hope for the best. Very little tactics involved, simply a case of bigger army beats lesser army.

*Single Player can be brutally unfair. Since advancing throught the ages involves being efficient at gathering resources, the computer can  be better than any human player at it, because by definition computers are efficient. And trying to play against several Ai players often seems pointless bcause half of the time they all team together and do organized attacks against you. I would not advise against having the diffculty at any less than ""Moderate"" Ohterwise you'l just get massacred. If you're new to the game always choose an ally beforehand.

* Since the armies are often described as being rock-paper-scissors, the only solution is to build a balanced army, without specialising in any one area. You'll often end up as jack of all trades but master of none. The only *major* decision will, be whether to build a navy or not.

*Dark Age And fedual Age rapidly become a boring routine of gathering resources, that becomes incredibly monontonous after the 20th time. Only Castle Age and Imperial Age are interesting any more.

So that's the bad points. However despite all the disappointments, I find I keep come back for more. I'm less enthusiastic about the game as I used to be , but it can often be quite enjoyable. The graphics can be sumptuous, especially the Byzantines, and you can obtain real satisfaction in building a large town, complete with walls and towers. Siege weapons, particularly  cannons, can be great fun to use, and when you watch the cannonballs arcing though the air , you hold your breath in the hope that they'll actually hit their target.

And when they do you'll be tempted to say ""bullseye!""

And when you watch your massed army of plate mail clad two handed swordsmen backed by archers marching across the terrain to attack the enemy monastary, you can literally swell with pride at waht you've put together.

So overall as a *strategy* game the Age Of Kings has somewhat dissapointed, but in some ways it makes up for it in the satisfaction you get from watching your miniature army in action. I'm not saying there's no skill involved, but more often it's in the realms of management rather than miltary tactics.

Bear in mind I'm talking about singleplayer here. I hear mutlti player is meant to be better. But at the end of the day it's still the same game we're playing.

"It's a LOT like the first game, which was great, but I would have preferred it if we had been given more technologies to research. All the discovery seems to be over a bit too quick before each game boils down to the standard 'smash the enemy to pieces' part. In this respect it became quite repetitive, especially when you consider how long it takes to get a good game going. The only alternative is to try out different civilizations, and only then it's just the architecture that's different.

I do like this game a lot but I just wish for a bit more diversity and more surprises in the next one (as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Age-of-Empires-III/dp/B004LFX8FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Age of Empires III</a>, not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Age-Of-Mythology/dp/B000J14PBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Age Of Mythology</a>).

"The  year 2000's version of NBA live is good, bu badly needed some simple touches that it didn't provide. For one, the players miss easy shots and dunks a lot. When they are in the paint, they don't take lay ups, they take jumpers, and often miss them. The dunks aren't anything great, and they don't dunk a lot. You also  don't have much control over the players. The only moves are spin,turbo, and cross over. And, there actually are no post moves in the whole game. The post up game is horriball, because there is none. Warning:If you are looking for good game play in the game, DO NOT get this game.  On the up side of the game, there are good graphics(much better and less choppy on the N64 version), and the game also offers a unique one on one mode, where you can play and unlock Micheal Jordan. In the playstation version you can also unlock other legends from each decade. As far as I know you can not in the N64 version of the game.  The game also has a create a player mode, as well as a create a team mode. The create a player is the same as in  Live 99', but lost some of the cool features, like sun glasses, and afros. In the create a player, you can totally control how good your player is. Personally, I don't like this feature, but you might.  All is all this is a good game, but I would suggest you get shoot out, or an updated version of this game.

"""Age of Empires II: Age of Kings"" is a wonderful game of strategy.  It is not just about making large armies and crushing your opponents.  Economics plays a key role, perhaps ever more important than military considerations.  However, war is still the main occupation of the game, and it is the least rewarding.  There are no tactics involved whatsoever, and in order to accomplish anything, you need an army so large that you cannot manage it but simply just let it loose.  This lack of control really detracts from the game itself.  It would have been better if there had been a separate battle engine as part of the game.  However, overall this game is good for hours of entertainment, as you never have the same campaign twice, and on the higher levels it is very challenging to survive long enough to fight back.
The lack of tactics in the game lost it a star in my review.  The other star is for the general gameplay and graphics.  You are forced to micromanage your towns and all the villagers, as well as your armies.  This can be trying, especially the more units you have.  There is no option to order villagers to continue working on their own without you issuing new orders.  This is especially annoying with farms and fishing ships.  Also, the graphics of the game aren't great, so these two factors detract another star.
However, I still reccommend the game for anyone interested in real-time strategy.  It is probably the best such game out there.",3.0
"I've been playing this game for a while. It's OK, but not the most fun game I've ever played, or even the most fun RTS game I've ever played (that's still Total Annihilation).
The graphics are incredibly beautiful, and the sound is nice. The voices of each units aren't as entertaining as, say, Starcraft, but they're well done in several foreign languages. There's a lot of small nice touches which really add to the game.
Unfortunately, it suffers in several areas. It requires a little too much micromanagement for my taste. For example, you must actively tell villagers to replant their farms once the field is exhausted. It's quite frustrating to finish directing a major battle, only to return to your village and find that the fields have lain fallow just because the farmers didn't replant. The tactical options were a good idea, but not implemented well. They're nearly useless. Directing your units in battle is far more difficult than it should be.
If you want lots of eye candy, this is the game for you. If a focus on tactics or even overall strategy is your thing, then it's not. These failings aren't specific to AOE2, they're endemic to most RTS games. But for such a heralded addition to the genre, it really should stand far above the rest. As it is, it's merely a pretty good game, leaving you with a taste of what could have been.",3.0
"Good, but not great... When I got AOE2 from a friend of mine I found it quite good. You could choose from a selection of campaigns, and the tutorial showed you all the 'ropes'. You could protect Joan of Arc on her  journey to the King on help the Scots protect their lands and more besides  these. However, I finished AOE2 extremely fast, for a strategy game- in a  week. Also, there were certain things that I found extremely frustrating in  this strategy game:
- You had to 'baby-sit' your units. If you didn't  keep looking at each unit, some would stop their tasks (like chopping wood  for houses), when you were checking the soldiers. Call this being kept on  your toes if you like but in my opinion, it just caused tiny problems that  totaled to one mess. The least that could be done could be to put up a  message immediately after a unit becomes inactive!
-Secondly, when you  start the next scenario your wood, food, gold, etc. get reset to the  present scenario's default settings. So even if you had 15,000 gold in the  previous scenario, you might go down to 5000 gold in the present  one!
Well, everyone has an opinion and that's mine- so don't kill me! I'm  not saying the game is bad. It's quite good. You could build empires and  fight enemies using medieval styled armies. You could explore terrain and  the textures and colours of units and terrain were rather good. The story  lines for campaigns weren't bad either- quite interesting and motivational  in fact! And the game didn't get boring but held your intention throughout.  It still doesn't rate 5 stars though.
SOME 5 STAR STRATEGY GAMES ARE:  the Civilization series, Imperialism 2 and Majesty.",3.0
"Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the biggest fans of AoE 1 and Rise of Rome but I didn't like this sequel. First of all, maybe I bought a beta version or something, but why is it that when a Monk moves... abracadabra... he  turns back into our well-known priest from AoE 1?  Is it that the  programmers were too lazy to reprogram the game fully? Again, it could just  be that my version had bugs in it but it is still suspicious and VERY  annoying... this happens with other infantry units as well. Also, I don't  see all that much difference when compared to the original, in fact  whenever they have changed something it is usually for the worse... it now  costs loadsa times more to research new units (I know they are trying to be  realistic but c'mon...) Anyone who's thinking of adding this to their  collection should go for the first two titles, they are definately  better....",3.0

"This is an excellent ""product"" from a guy who admits he is just a ""casual"" gamer. He actually admits this in an interview somewhere and I think he's more competent than most designers and much  older. So there, you little whipper snappers.
My main complaint with this  game has nothing to do with the game or developers except that they should  be more careful about who they allow to start fan sites. A certain very  popular site, perhaps the best site with the best forum gave me a very bad  experience. In one of my first posts a regular there refered to me as  stupid and silly and wondered in public if I was senile. All this because I  questioned the diplomatic system in AOK, which any competent reviewer will  recognize as being a joke.  When I complained to the moderators of this  site about this abusive behavior and a general abusive behavior towards  Americans, I was banned from the forum and my ISP contacted for the crime  of contacting these people through e mail.  And now on to more pertinent  information.
I found the game easy to learn and fun to play. The  graphics were good but not great. Pretty soon I found myself relying on one  strategy. Wall out the invaders. Get to castle age as quick as I can and  build lots of town centers to expand and defend. Once you beat the initial  big invasion, the idiotic AI tends to just send invaders in little trickles  that never stop, but aren't that hard to deal with.
It's fun to use  the various seige weapons, but I didn't really bother mastering the armor  and tremendous variety of knights and swordsmen. They all looked about the  same to me with the exception of the english longbowmen. You could play  this game for a very long time, but there are lots of very good games to  play.
This is deep strategy, but not as deep as Railroad  Tycoon 2 and  Rogue Spear. It's also all tiny people and buildings. There's no zooming in  and out or rotating. The fans are kind of ummmm...well, you read what I  said above.
I only played twice on the internet and the first guy  left as soon as I knocked down his whole wall with a massive seige attack.  The game then ended leaving me without the ability to even finish off what  he'd built. My second game I used the wrong culture and after a prolonged  build up I quicklly got slaughtered by the elite teutonic knights. My Woad  raiders didn't have the ability to build cannons I found out too late. So  there you have multiplay in a nutshell. If you are winning, people leave  and call you a hack. If you are losing, they love you and possibly think  you suck.
There was no third, more experienced multiplay for me as I got  wrapped up in the incident up top and lost interest in the game.",3.0
"I am not camplaining about the games, just how it was packaged.  They completely left out Final Fantasy IV, which would have made the package even better, and then there should have at least been more computer generated scenes, because that would have brought the characters even more to life.  To me these two things were a major disappointment when I got this game.  One thing I thought was a great idea was the new ""Battle Transitions"".  I think they are even better that the new Final Fantasys, so I'll give them credit for that.  The games are fine and really do bring back old memories of the SNES days and are just as fun as any other RPG.  Oh well, if they had alot more CG scenes the package might have 15 cd or something, but hey, I wouldn't mind if it was the same price!",3.0
"This is probably the best WCW game out there, which isn't saying much since I hated almost all the other games. This game sports an impresive amount of wrestlers and areanas to wrestle in, as well as some of the best comentary in any wrestling game (even in todays standerds) The grapple system is easy to pick up and use since it's basicly the same as the smackdown games except grapple is square instead of circle. The problem with the fighting system is that almost everybody has the same moves, except for finishers which I still can't seem to do. The areanas look good considering the fact this is a PSone and the backstage areanas are fun to fight in, though they arn't interactive. Championship mode is basicly a tournament, if you win you go up in the ranks, if you lose you go down in the ranks. Doing this alows you to unlock new wrestlers which is rather underwhelming because all they do is basicly pat you on the back when you win, even when you win the world title. The bottom line is that though fun for awhile this game gets repetitive after awhile makeing you stop while playing to take a break from it. the only reason to buy this game is to have all your favorite WCW wrestlers on a game or for a quick fix considering all the great wrestling games out there. WCW mayhem isn't a bad game, it just dosn't really bring anything new to the table other than different areanas and wrestlers. For a game to play for longer periods of time, try something new.",3.0
"WCW Mayhem is a relatively old game (the 'WCW' should give that away) it was initially released in 1999. Yet it still has enough entertainment value to be worth a play even today.
1. Sound. The best sound effects I've ever heard on a wrestling game. I've played many titles in this genre, including Wrestlemania XIX and Legends of Wrestling II, and Mayhem is superior to both. The crowds roars and jeers, the thuds and slams, go together to make a fantastic atmosphere. Even better is the two man commentary, and it's like you're watching it on TV.
2. The wrestlers. Coming from the late 90's WCW era, this has got some of the biggest superstars in wrestlin history gruped together. Hollywood Hogan (as he was then), Macho Man Randy Savage, Ric Flair, Sting, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, Goldberg, Curt Henning, Scott Steiner, Rick Steiner.....it's a great line-up. I'd say it's the best line-up in any wrestling game until this years Showdown: Legends of Wrestling. There's 50 wrestlers all together.
3. The wrestling itself. Don't expect super-fast gameplay. Don't even expect the pace of the latest wrestling games. Expect the methodical, paced action of late 80's wrestling. It's spot-on. I haven't seen such an accurate representation of the speed of wrestling in any other game.
4. It's for PS1, so it's incredibly cheap now. I picked up a secondhand copy from this very site for a mere 1.99. Two pounds, and to think it used to cost about 34.99 originally. As far as value for money goes, it's a five star purchase.
Now the negatives. The graphics are weird and not especially attractive - the crowd is just a flat block of coloured blobs. The weak collision detection means your punches will often miss at point blank range. There's no season mode, you just fight for titles and defend them. The Create A Wrestler mode is so basic you won't be able to make any of your favourite wrestlers not in the game already. You can, however, make a knight in armour...
To sum up, WCW Mayhem is not the greatest wrestling game on the market. No matter what console you have, there is atleast two better games avaliable. For the PSX/PS1, WWF Smackdown and Smackdown 2: Just Bring It. For the PS2, four Smackdown games, and three Legends of Wrestling games. For the XBox, WWE Raw & Raw 2, and three Legends of Wrestling games. And for the GameCube, Wrestlemania X8 and XIX, and two Legends of Wrestling games.
Nevertheless, I'm still playing Mayhem today and I have both Wrestlmania XIX and Legends of Wrestling II on my shelf. The commentary, the wrestlers avaliable and the accurate pace of real wrestling make this unique and enjoyable. Add to that the fact that it's ridiculously cheap (even if you only played it for one night, you'd still get value for money), and you're looking at a worthwile purchase.",3.0
"WCW Mayhem seems like a pretty fun game at first.  You have over 50 WCW wrestlers at your disposal, the ability to take the fight backstage to one of twelve different areas, ring entrances for each wrestler, a choice of six different types of match, a smattering of weapons lying about such as bats, chairs, and - my favorite - tasers, the ability to wrestle (in all of the historical rings from  important WCW events) in exhibition and pay per view matches as well as go in quest of titles leading up to the coveted heavyweight championship belt, and the option to create your own wrestler.  Another important aspect of the game is the color commentary provided by Tony Schiavone and Bobby the Brain Heenan.  It doesn't take long for some of these plusses to start feeling like minuses, however.
I am not a big fan of the new manner of controlling your wrestler built into this game; it is much less intuitive than older WCW-based wrestling games, and I often find myself able to come up with only a very limited number of moves; still worse, I constantly find myself repeating moves I had no intention of repeating.  The announcers do at least have fun with this, talking about move repetition in disparaging terms as it is going on.  Their overall banter, though, while quite funny at times becomes repetitive itself after a short while.  Even the overexcited shouts of Schiavone declaring a victory in the ring grow stale, as do his constant calls for someone to stop the bloodbath and call for help.  I never get tired of the Brain, though; he is always hilarious.
I don't think the graphics here are much of an improvement over older games, either.  There's really not a lot of difference in audio and visual between WCW Mayhem and earlier WCW games for the Playstation.  You can fight backstage now, which is cool, but the graphics are largely unimproved and the gameplay is awkward and sometimes annoying.  I would much rather play the older WCW/NOW Thunder than I would WCW Mayhem, when it comes right down to it.",3.0

"Very stylish. Very engrossing. This game is a divorce in a box, I tell ya.
I recently found myself staying up and playing this game from 9PM until 7AM. Does this mean that it is a great game, or does it mean that I am insane?
I don't know the answer to that.
UPDATE:
I've changed my mind.  After playing this gems for a few months, I realized that it had turned out to be nothing more than a race to get more items, complete more quests, and build a better character than the next guy.
It's not the game developers' fault, though.  It's the virtual community that has come to call the game home.  The place became so full of ""power-gamers"", that there was no place left for people who just wanted to explore, interact, and role-play.  It's disappointing, because this could have been a truly GREAT game.  But the players ruined it.",3.0

"Take control of dozens of WCW wrestlers, from Hulk Hogan to Rey Mysterio Jr. Each with differnt moves, grapples and finnishers. The graphics are good, except for their mannurisms, because their normal stance looks like a T-Rex. Then there are the controls, which the buttons are oddly placed and from how slow and laggy the controls are it can be sometimes difficult to perform. There are a kick, punch, dropkick, grapple, run and taunt buttons. The selling point to this game were the arenas and the backstage areas, the arenas look nice, however the space is very limited and with a rotating camera angle its difficult to see where you are going. Another downfall to this game is that it is quite difficult to win a match because of the energy structure. You can beat down a person for fifteen minutes and then they still manage to kick out of a pin. This game is graphicly better and musicly better than THQ games, but its no WWF game.",3.0
"It was with joy and alacrity that I got this double disc set. I loved FF6, and spent countless hours exploring every corner of it. Playing through this version was just to see what was changed, and I was dismayed to see that very little was different. It certainly seemed harder, and while some of the bugs in the programming (particularly the Sketch glitches) were improved and corrected, I did not find anything to further impress me. In fact, the CG scenes at the beginning and end felt tacked on - like they didn't belong. They also failed to make sense to me. The little things - the galleries and stuff - seemed totally unnecessary and useless.
As for FF5, I almost immediately disliked this one. The score is often uninspired (and at times, downright irritating - take the music of Kerwin Town for instance), the plot weak, the characters totally without a personality (except Faris), the dialogue corny, the twists not that shocking. What's more, it doesn't look one bit better than FF4. The random battles are, at times, too many and too challenging. The side quests are without purpose, as are many of the villains, and the plot doesn't seem to hang together well. The opening CG scene has nothing to do with the game, and the ending one is a disappointment, and more than a disappointment. Taken altogether, I was very much disappointed with the set. I feel like I paid for tickets to a great opera and all I got was Tennessee Ernie Ford.
If you've never played either one, you will likely have a good time playing these two. Taken individually, they are good games. I love FF6 - always have - but FF5 ticked me off. If you're not expecting anything spectacular, you won't be disappointed. Guess I *was* expecting it!",3.0
"I bought this to play FFVI, so I never played FF V. This remake just sucked....for one thing, the sound effects were screwed up, as well as some slowdown.

"Final Fantasy 6 is arguably the greatest FF game and RPG ever made, and FF5 is another one of the greatest RPGs I have ever played, so how come this game didn't get 5 stars? Well, the load times would be a great place to start. Just like in FF Chronicles, one of the games has great load times, and the other is plagued horribly. FF6 has the worst load times I have ever experienced, even worse than all other ps1 games which have BETTER graphics and contain just as much if not MORE information ( remember Wild Arms? That game was huge, AND it had better graphics than FF6, but it's load times were very, very short, almost unnoticcable, so what the heck!?). Every time you enter a battle you are greeted with 5 + seconds of looking at a black screen, sound fun to you? I didn't think so. Every time you enter the menu you are greeted with another 5+ seconds of load time. Sure, it's only 5 seconds, but once you experience it, you will feel how long five seconds CAN feel, especially when you are used to fast-paced games (the load times are much slower than the PS1 ff's)But on to the games themselves...

Final Fantasy 6- Music- 5/5, Fun 0/5, Story 5/5 Gameplay 0/5, overall-1/5 This game is a masterpiece, the greatest RPG ever released on any system. However, given the poor load times, the fun value of this game is whiped out. Seriously, it's a chore to play it. If you have a SNES system i'd dish out 30 bucks for it if you can find it on Amazon or somewhere else. The SNES version has blazing fast load times, the graphics are better, and the whole experience is so much better. I think it is a terrible idea to release a masterpiece with flaws that whipe out any fun while playing the game. Basically, when you buy this you might as well save your time and throw the FF6 disk away, or sell it towards a SNES FF3 cartridge.

Final Fantasy 5- Music 5/5 Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Fun 4/5 Overall 5/5 Now this is why this game is worth the price. FF5 is without a doubt a masterpiece, and the version on FF Anthology is great. The load times are pretty fast, the sound is great, and it has the Job system very much like ff Tactics. The job system is a phenomenal idea, and FF5 executes it perfectly. Some hate this game, but I think 5 is easily just as good as 9. It isn't as good as 4, 6, 7, or 8, or heck even Tactics, but you have to realize that FF games are so good that even excellent isn't good enough, and this one is a masterpiece, like most the others. FF5 is much more difficult than any other FF game, even much harder than 4, and you will have to battle quite often for long periods of time, and sometime this can be discouraging if you aren't into battling for a while, but other than that it is a good game. It starts off pretty slow, but as you progress it gets much better, so don't lose interest right away, just wait it out and see if it gets better for you. (When i first got ff Anthology i didn't care a whole lot about 5, but when i got around to progressing through it I found it was a great game)

Overall, This version of FF6 might as well not even have been issued, but it is definitely worth it for FF5, and 15-20 bucks is extremely cheap for these two games, just don't expect FF6 to be as fast as the FF3 you remember playing as a kid for Super Nintendo. (Still, I don't get it. Why does FF4 in Chronicles have blazing fast load times, but FF6 is plagued...).

So anyway, I highly recommend buying this game, mainly for ff5.",3.0

Add-On aircraft are more easily sorted on 2002 than 2000, and the old game gains less in of an edge in framerate on 2002 than it lost over FS 98.

Inputed dedaults do not stay after one use, auto pilots don't work, and the lake I live near is unrecognisable.

"Let me start out by saying I've been a fan and owner of Microsoft Flight Simulator since version 2 back in the day..  I was excited to see FS2000, but not long after I installed it I ended up uninstalling it and returning  to FS98.  Why?  The main reason was performance..  I have an AMD K6-III 450  with 128MB ram and a Voodoo Banshee graphics accelerator and this thing  still crawls unless you disable all of the scenery and graphics detail  (which to me is the whole point of upgrading to FS2000)..  The other reason  I went back to FS98 was that FS2000 lacks some of the ""shadowing""  effects FS98 has, things like landing lights and airplane shadows.  I  really like to be able to see my landing lights on the runway and the  shadow of my airplane over the runway as I touch down.  Microsoft has  stated that these effects will NEVER be in FS2k due to changes in the  gaming engine.
  I'll probably go back to FS2k once I upgrade my machine,  but my advice to you is unless you have a 500mhz+ machine with a new  graphics accelerator and tons of RAM, spend your money elsewhere.",3.0

But still, the game is extremely  slow and prevents you from exploring.  For instance, the game is almost not  playable when i create a thunderstorm. But other than being slow, it is  rather decent.  the graphics do look superb(when the game is working, that  is)and the game itself is more complex and exciting than 98.

It is all right, and if you can't find anything to do whatsoever, it's probably worth a shot playing this.

"Land masses played a significant role in the sea battles during WWII,  especially in the Atlantic / North Sea Campaigns.  Unfortunately, Divide By  Zero doesn't provide any land masses.  Its like conducting a sea battle  where there is endless water and no land.  This detracts from the realism  of the game.
The US used air craft carriers during the naval battles in  the Pacific.  Also, the British Navy used air craft carriers in its  relentless efforts to sink the Bismark.  Yet, this game doesn't provide any  air craft carriers, air craft, and submarines.  Players are treated to Navy  forces consisting of battle ships, cruisers, and destroyers.  This is very  unrealistic.
Now, for the major problem I have encountered with this  game.  I have an opponent's vessel completely out of action.  I pull up  real close to the vessel -- say about 500 - 700 yards.  My ship blasts my  opponent's vessel with its main and secoundary guns.  However, at this  close range, most of my shots miss the enemy's boat.  How can that be?  The  enemy his helpless in the water; he is not moving, and I experience such  rotten accuracy.  even the most inexperienced gunners can hit a target some  500 - 700 yards away.
Another interesting problem.  Let's say I have  sunk all the opponent's vessels.  I click on acclerate end to move on.  Well, guess what I find?  Some of my vessels have either been sunk or  damaged because of ""Air/Sea Superiority.""  How can that be? --  Considering that my opponent's naval force has been sent to the bottom of  Davy Jones's Locker.  If Superior Air Power is used, then ships should be  allowed to defend against it.  ""Fighting Steel"" does not give us  the option of fighting air craft.
The images of the ships are  ""realistic.""  Battle Damage, however, is not.  True, when the  main gun batteries explode, they appear destroyed on screen.  However,  other battle damage is not all that realistic.
For these reasons, I  believe the game is still a Work in Process.  It is incomplete, and needs  enhancing.  The graphics are accurate, but they look like unrealistic  cartoon images.  Overall, it is not the worst game on the market.  But,  unfortunately, it is not the best either.",3.0
"My wife, 3 kids and I played this game for about 15 hours finding it to be entertaining.  We especially liked being able to select, develop, race, bet, and breed our horses.  However, the game lacked the depth I (daddy)  was looking for.  I would rate it 5 stars for people aged 5-14 as my  children loved playing and found it to be somewhat challenging.  Perhaps,  it would rate as high for older people if we raced our friends online; we  have not explored this option yet.",3.0
"My two brothers and I (ages 25, 23, and 22) love playing this game against each other and beating the trash out of the poor little guys on the screen.  We turn fouls off, rules off, and bomb treys the whole time.  That's about all this game is good for.  As an actual basketball simulator, it sucks.  The players are too inconsistent.  For example, in one game a guy can go off for 30 points on ten threes, and in the next he will go 0-12 from behind the arc.  But the game is still fun to play, in the tradition of NBA Jam and its offspring.  If you want to throw it down, bust a few treys, knock a few guys around, then go for it.  This is the game for you.  The draft feature is really cool.  You can create some awesome teams.  But it's not a realistic basketball game.  Look elsewhere, or get your ball and take it outside if you want a real basketball experience.",3.0

"Master of Orion II is a title offering a rich experience in very particular areas, emphasizing technological and military aspects of the creation of a galactic empire over elements that require more more character interaction and development.  It is a strategy game in the purest sense of the genre, and therefore learning its intricacies and more subtle features can be of paramount importance in a long game or campaign.
  In Master of Orion II, you direct the construction of a galactic empire.  In this turn-based game, you guide your colonies, command your space fleets, and dictate which technologies your scientists will research.  You can win the game in one of three ways: crushing all the other civilizations in the galaxy, building up the technology and military might to crush the powerful Antarians, or gaining enough allies to vote you galactic ruler at a council meeting.
  Master of Orion II has no storyline of its own.  While the conquests and trials your empire faces in each game could be considered a story that you generate, events that alter the course of galactic history are frequently random and unpredictable.  No story elements, characters, or mission goals persist from one game to the next.  This is in direct contrast to strategy games with a rich, evolving storyline, such as Blizzard Entertainment's spectacular game Starcraft, which prove that utilizing deep characters and missions that link together does not preclude a focus on strategy in gameplay.
  Storyline aside, Master of Orion II has an interesting and powerful interface.  You are given complete control over almost every aspect of your colonies, and assign crews of workers to either farm, research, or work on the construction of the colony's project.  Levels of progress in the different areas are represented graphically; players of Civilization II will find this interface very familiar.  However, its simple look belies the potential for automation that can be employed.  Up to seven or so build orders can be queued for each particular colony, allowing you to monitor areas of greater activity without worrying about lesser colonies for long periods of time.  When your empire grows gigantic, you can chose to allow a ""colony advisor"" to decide what to build and produce, saving you the large amounts of time that would be required to check each colony individually, again and again.
  Another enjoyable interface, starship design, was an element pioneered by the Master of Orion series, and still provides one of the keys to success in the game.  You design your own starships, choosing what hull design, weapons, computers, shields, systems, and special devices are to be incorporated in each ship.  You are limited by the amount of space inside the hull, and should keep the production cost in mind when designing huge, powerful battle cruisers.  There are even more subtle factors to take into account: you can modify the firing arcs of each weapon, choose how many reloads of each type of torpedo your ship can carry and how many can be fired in each salvo, and even chose special modifications to existing weapons, increasing their power, accuracy, firing rate, durability, or other qualities.  Perhaps the best interface in the game, the ship design screen takes what could have been a dauntingly complex task and makes it intuitive and convenient by providing information about each option's function and cost on-screen.
 The research interface is visually interesting, but annoying.  You chose which technology to work on, and the amount of research required is shown.  What is not shown is what the technologies do, making it absolutely necessary to look each technology up in the manual every time you want to research anything (until you get them all memorized).
  Diplomacy is a weaker area, where your interactions are constrained to a highly limited set of commands.  Besides declaring war and a few basic agreements, there is next to nothing you can do in cooperation with any of the other civilizations.  Soon you will wish you could coordinate attacks, interact with more than one other civilization on the same project, or make more complex deals and demands.  More or less, you take on the galaxy alone.
  Multi-player capabilities, a strong point in many games, are remarkably poor in Master of Orion II.  Being a turn-based game, there is the fundamental constraint that every player in the game must wait for the slowest player to finish his/her turn before moving on.  Worse still, space battles happen in between turns, in sequence, so everyone must wait for every player to complete every space combat before moving on.  Because space battles can last over 10 minutes if large in scale, or longer if you use an attrition-based battle plan, the wait can be utterly unbearable.  Additionally, while you are executing your turn, there is no chat feature.  You are isolated until you finish your turn, and even then your communications are limited.  Whoever is done with their turn sees a dialogue box, where everyone can type and everyone can see what you type.  So much for secrecy... your opponents can see everything you say as easily as your allies.  In a two player game, it is even worse.  As soon as the second player ends his turn, the next turn begins, so there is practically NO time to talk at all.  Between the long waits and the isolation, it is clear that Master of Orion II is not a viable multi-player game.
  Master of Orion II is an interesting game, and may be ideal if you wish to focus on a few aspects of empire building (colony management, ship design, and space combat) while ignoring nearly everything else.  Overall, however, it is possible to get tired of the repetitive gameplay and long time periods in between big battles.  Because multiplayer games are next to impossible, and diplomacy with the computer is so limited, expect play to have a solataire-type feel to it.  Ruling an empire is a lonely job.",3.0
"When I first heard that ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" was  going to be made into a computer game, I thought it would be nice to try  out. When I heard that the game was being developed by Jellyvision, the  makers of my all-time favorite computer game, You Don't Know Jack, I just  had to buy a copy!
Well, I was a little disappointed.
For one thing,  the ""multiplayer game"" only lasts for about 15 seconds. After  that, only one person gets to play until he reaches the end or misses a  question.
If you play solo (which is basically the best way to go),  questions repeat A LOT! But, don't worry, because I've had the game since  Christmas 1999, and I am still finding at least two or three questions I  haven't seen before.
In conclusion, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire, I must  admit, was a very hard task for Jellyvision to accomplish. It would have  been nicer if they had made a You Don't Know Jack-like version of the game  with Regis as the host or something.
But you know the worst thing about  it? You can now get the entire game FREE if you buy a box of Lucky Charms!  I SPENT ALL THAT MONEY ON SOMETHING I CAN NOW GET FOR FREE!! AAARRRRGGGHHH!  :-)",3.0
"The Game is fun if you are patient to sit through alot of talking by regis. the problems that I have found seem to echo those of others who have purchased the game. The questions are repetitive. It needs a larger base of  questions. I do like the timer feature. To me it makes the game more  exciting and faster. I you want to pause the game and go look up the  answer, just hit the ""esc"" button and that will do the trick. I  agree that the game can be a little insulting but the atempt here is to  mimick the real game. Even though I gave it only Three stars I still  Recomend this Game if you like the show. Not Buying the game (if you are a  fan )is like being a fan of the St.louis Rams And not owning as much as tee  shirt with their logo on it.",3.0
"I'm a little disappointed I spent [money] on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, however, I have read the reviews on this site, and I'd like to make a few comments.  First of all, yes, the number of available questions is too low, but it takes up a lot of space on the CD for each question.  The  Phone-a-friend lifeline, for instance, plays a sound file.  FOR EACH  QUESTION.  If you wanted 2,500 questions, the game would need to ship on 15  CD's!  It's forgivable, considering the overall quality of everything  else in the game, but I think people who buy this game should be entitled  to free updates/replacements when the improved version of WWTBAM is  released.
Overall, very fun and true to the show, but very limited number  of questions, the fact that they didn't include a SKIP button for some  graphics/sound (does Regis EVER stop talking?  ^_^), and a horrible  multiplayer mode, detracts from what could otherwise be a very enjoyable  game.",3.0
It's a pain to see the same questions but when new ones pop up they are very good and challenging.  The phone a friend people mostly don't know what they're talking about but Regis' wit and the shows music and graphics  are outstanding.  More questions=5 stars.  Buy the game.  It's pretty fun.,3.0
The questions keep repeating over and over and the game gets very boring after a while. Then why do I give it 3 stars? because the graphics and Regis are great. I'd wait until a new version came out if I were you  though.,3.0
I thought this game was very interesting! I found myself and family members huddling around the computer to try to win the million! The special effects were great. Although I did experiance the repeats like others had mentioned.,3.0
"Here are the pluses of this game:
1.) The graphics, sound and music are identical to those of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.  This creates the feeling that you are really on the show.  The first ten times I played it,  I had a blast.
2.) Regis Philbin is very funny in this game.  He is much  funnier in this game than he is on the show.
3.) This game follows the  format of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire exactly.  Thus, if you enjoy the  show, you should enjoy the game, at least at the beginning.
Here are the  minuses of this game:
1.) The questions repeat after only 10-15 games.  It is therefore only enjoyable for a few days (or a few weeks, if you can  limit the number of times you play each time).
2.) The questions are MUCH  harder than the ones on the show.  Unless you're a Jeopardy champion, you  won't have much a chance of winning this game on the first try (that is,  until the questions start repeating).  Many people will not enjoy the game  for this reason.
3.) You are not allowed to use the mouse in this game,  only the keyboard, which is awkward.
I would recommend not buying this  game until it is improved.  Given its strong sales, it wouldn't surprise me  if they released an improved version (with more questions) within the next  couple of months.",3.0
"LOVE the game, but it's VERY difficult to set up a modern computer to run it. That should have been made MUCH more clear by sellers as I can't imagine many people expect to have to create special zones in their operating systems just to run a game, albeit an older game.",3.0
It needed A LOT of Patches to make it run properly. I went onto a website for game users initially and they said it could not even be run....,3.0

"Well, first off, I must say I was dissapointed when I got to the ""Man your own mission"" part.  But otherwise, I liked the product.  It starts out with a prompt for your name, then you can go from there.  You  choose a class of starship, then you retro fit it with your choice of  nacelles, hulls, and saucer sections.  I was slightly dissapointed here,  because you only get 3-5 choices with each item.  What would be nice, is if  you could take parts from other classes of ship, and add them to your ship.  For example:  a set of Defiant class nacelles, on an Intrepid class ship.  But the 3-D view of your ship is incomplete.  In several places the hull is  discolored, and mishapen.  Pity there' s a 12 character name limit.  Pity  it assigns you a registry #.  As for the innards, you must really study the  TNG Tech Manual before you can fill up your ship in the Expert mode.  I  like the fact though, that you can choose whether you want high quality, or  discount parts in your ship, and you can forego the holodecks, and luxury  quarters, until you get some more credits.  As a Star Trek nut, I wish  there were some more things you could do with the bowels of the ship.  The  missions are pathetic.  It starts off with exciting music when it  automatically throws itself into warp, but after those thirty seconds are  up, it's quiet until you get there.  Don't run real-time mode unless you  have all day to play with your game.  What also really stinks, is you can't  just minimize the window, and do something else until your mission is  complete.  And if you do go into ""stealth"" mode, you can't get  back into the game.  Good if you want to know more about the insides of a  ship, bad if you've seen 10 or fewer ST episodes.  My advice, wait until it  goes in the sale bins, or check out the sequel coming soon.",3.0
"The game is a little limiting, but the missions can be different depending on your starship. Just the other day I almost lost a starship to some parasites. And to all those that say the missions are very slow, there is a  button that accelerates the mission time. I do, however, agree with other  reviewers on this point. THIS GAME IS FOR TREKKIES ONLY. Anybody else will  be bored in an hour or two. Also, those that say the game runs slow must be  running it on a 486,100 MZH computer. And even on that speed computer it  isn't that slow. However I recommend a Pentium 200 MZH or faster computer.  Well, that's all.",3.0
"I enjoy playing the Myst games once through, they are fun and challenging.  However my computer would not allow me to hit a certain switch for some reason, and I was therefore never able to get to the location on the cover.  Even if I had, I would never play the game again, I would know how to do everything, and therefore, what would be the point?  At least it is better then Myst in which you can win within about 15 minutes of starting the game, but still...  Any 60 dollar game (as it was when it was released) should last longer than this.  With the detail put in, the game itself is rather short, with puzzle solving accounting for much of your time.  Also some puzzles can be so frustrating when you know what to do, but can't (the stopping the scopes thing, the puzzle at the top of the dome on the first island).  I thought it was a beautiful game, but I wouldn't get it unless it is below 20 dollars, otherwise I don't really think it's worth it.",3.0
"M&M 6 was a blast to play back in the day, but the evolution of the PC RPG has made it almost unplayable today. M&M6 focuses mostly on doing battles in a first-person party-based setup. It uses classical fantasy elements (and a few sci-fi ones) to make a fun game.

You get to put points in skills and learn spells for your characters. You'll use those skills and spells to buy gear, kill baddies and venture through dungeons for more gear or to save a lost person.

It's alright, but there's tons better these days.

"I greatly enjoyed the 7th Guest. Its sequel, The 11th Hour, is not bad, but it's not very good either. On the plus side, the graphics and the music are just as creepy and cool. On the minus side, the plot is just too stupid, and the extra puzzle elements make the game too convoluted. In the 7th guest, the plot (although not the greatest) was creepy and entertaining, and held the game together. In the 11th hour, there are some elements that are so unbelievable even horror, mystery and intrigue can't account for them (example: somebody gets raped by a house: THAT'S JUST DUMB).

The actual gameplay is also unecessarily convoluted. In the 7th Guest, you solved the puzzles to open more doors, where you could solve more, and open more, until you've been able to solve the puzzle that will take you to the end of the game. The plot elements emerged around the house as a natural part of this process. In the 11th Hour, there are actually two different goals: you have to play the word-clue puzzles to unravel the plot, but you have to play Stauf's puzzles in the House to open doors and get to where you need to go. Perhaps this was an attempt to make sure the plot was revealed ""sequentially."" In any case, it makes the game less enjoyable, with the word-clues seeming kind of like nagging errands which distract you from the meat of the game.

Final verdict? Play it if you have the chance to borrow it from af friend, or if you have a buddy you can play it with. But don't pay money for it.",3.0

"Frogger is another one of those classic arcade games that any gamer should jump into. Whether it's on the old-school Atari 2600, or in one of the many game collections being released in recent times, Frogger is a game that should have been played at least once in one's lifetime.

This Game Boy version, however, isn't all that amazing. The graphics look very shrunken down, with the color just looking odd, and the catchy music of the original seems to be nearly absent, as the first few notes only play as intro music. Otherwise, it's still that arcade classic on the go.

But honestly, there are much better versions or games of Frogger. The Sega Genesis version is EXACTLY like the arcade game (Everything's untouched), and the Playstation version is a whole adventure, but stays true to the classic gameplay. Speaking of which, Frogger 2 is the best pick for Frogger on the go. See my review for that one.",3.0

"Mario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the ""Super Mario"" franchise.  The tone of the game, while clearly modeled after the original ""Super Mario Bros."" for the NES, has a much different feel to it than [any other Mario time] Mario game.  That is because Shigeru Miyamoto did not produce the game; instead, his mentor, Gunpei Yokoi, produced and directed the title.

Yokoi, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 in Japan, was Miyamoto's mentor.  It was because of Yokoi that Miyamoto's game ""Donkey Kong"" came before the leaders of Nintendo at the time.  Yokoi came up with the Game & Watch series, ""Kid Icarus"" and ""Metroid"" for the NES, and the Gameboy.  (A ""Metroid"" enemy even makes a cameo appearance in ""Super Mario Land"").

The game features elements not seen before (or since) in the Mario series, including Egyptian themed bosses (although the Egypt theme is common in Mario, the bosses from SML are never heard of again, just like SMB2), space aliens, an apparent unending fascination with Easter Island and its Moi heads, and even two Shooting levels.  Although Miyamato revealed in an ""Iwata Asks"" interview that the original ""Super Mario Bros."" was going to have shooting levels, and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea (along with Mario having a gun), this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of ""Super Mario Land"".

I grew up with Mario, like most other gamers. With only two exceptions, I have played every Mario title at launch or shortly thereafter, from the original 1985 ""Super Mario Bros"" all the way down to ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"" (yes I'm old). Obviously being American we didn't get ""Lost Levels"" until ""Super Mario All-Stars"", but I got the SNES version when it was released back in '93 and have played through ""Lost Levels"" so many times over the years I've more than made up for not getting it back in 1986.

Anyway, the two I missed? ""Super Mario Land"" for the Gameboy (which I did play very briefly back when it first came out, but I never had it; we went with ""Super Mario Land 2"" instead when I did get a Gameboy) and ""Super Mario Sunshine"".  The very few times that I did play the game on the original Gameboy back in 1989 or the very early 1990s, I do remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done.

Being the Mario fan that I am, I did play through ""Super Mario Land"" on emulator a couple of years back, beating  the game over two decades after it was first released. [Before I really played the game I remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done].  Since then, I purchased the title on the 3DS Virtual Console (love those restore points!)

So my thoughts on the game?  Well, of all the Mario games, this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper ""Super Mario"" games (I am not including spin-offs and subseries).  ""Super Mario Land"" was a launch title for the Gameboy, and boy does it show.  The majority of the sprites are small, including Mario himself.  Being monochrome, it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is. The game is SHORT - only twelve levels.  Each level has about a 400 second time limit, so to do a full run through of the game, even dragging your feet, will not net you much gameplay in terms of time.

Due to Miyamoto's lack of involvement, the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other Mario titles.  There are octupuses, jumping flowers that shoot fire (reminds of me of Panser from ""Super Mario Bros. 2"", Gaos (they resemble Egyptian sphinxes), robots (!!), Totais (running Easter Island Moai  heads), Pionpis (jumping men who shoot at Mari in the last world) and Yurarin Boos, who are fire-breathing seahorses.  The last two are the most interesting, as they are heavily reminesnt of ""Metroid"".  The Pionpis reminds me of Samus Aran's female sprite when the JUSTIN BAILEY code is entered, and the Yurarin Boos are identical to the seahorses (in terms of game play and species type, though the sprites differ somewhat) in ""Metroid"" as well.

The game is set in Sarasaland, comprised of four kingdoms, Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.  Suddenly an evil space alien named Tatanga appears, kidnaps Princess Daisy (who debuts in this game), and it is up to Mario to rescue the Princess (but it's not Princess Peach at least).

 Probably my biggest complaint about the game, besides the short length, is the looseness in the controls.  I don't know if this holds true for the original Gameboy (I suspect it does), but playing on the 3DS, I found Mario often times going slightly further than I wanted, [or not far enough].  I've never hard this problem with the other Mario games.  There is also some weird hit detection issues going on.  I was playing 4-2, jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant, and Mario did not lose his power up.  I've seen this happen multiple times.

The loose play control further exacerbates another issue: no saving.  If you run out of lives (unless you're on 4-3, the very last world), you have to start all over which can be frustrating.  If you die on the last level you do get two continues.  Often times due to the loose play control I would slightly overshoot where I was jumping and Mario would plummet to his death.  Now, to be fair, to expect such a short game all the way back in 1989 to having saving is ridiculous, but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over.  Nintendo could have at least provided continues (a more realistic option for a game of this age).  .

The game is clearly modelled on the original ""Super Mario Bros."", although with some noticable differences.  First, the music itself is unlike anything else in the series, and is one of the strongest assests the game offers.  Just like the first game, you can't go back to the left; the screen only scrolls right.  Mario's sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the NES title.

The power ups are pretty weak.  There are exactly three: the Super mushroom, the Super Ball, and an invincibility star.  The Super Mushroom will make Mario big.  The Super Ball (this game's idiotic version of the Fire Flower) allows Mario to shoot projectiles.  However, the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the Super Ball, the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface.  So on levels that are pretty open, you shoot the Super Ball, it hits the ground right in front of Mario, and then shoots straight up into the sky, never to be seen again, rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you, creating a bigger margin for error.  If you are in a more enclosed space, the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out.  Unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time, so if you have one bouncing around and it's not connecting with an enemy, you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappears.

Like the other Mario titles, ""Super Mario Land"" would prove to be a massive hit, selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run.  What's depressing to me is that ""Super Mario Land"" actually outsold the far superior ""Super Mario Bros. 3"".  Note: that does not count the rereleases and Virtual Console sales, only the intial NES release vs. the Gameboy release.

For a game of its time, the title is pretty fun.  But of all the games in the core ""Super Mario"" series, this is easily the least substantial title, due to its brevity, the loose play controls, and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series.  The games sequel, ""Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins"", is infinitely better, with bigger sprites, more engaging gameplay, and a much longer gametime.  The music though from SML is, admittedly, fantastic and is probably its strongest point.

Mario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the ""Super Mario"" franchise.  The tone of the game, while clearly modeled after the original ""Super Mario Bros."" for the NES, has a much different feel to it than [any other Mario time] Mario game.  That is because Shigeru Miyamoto did not produce the game; instead, his mentor, Gunpei Yokoi, produced and directed the title.

Yokoi, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 in Japan, was Miyamoto's mentor.  It was because of Yokoi that Miyamoto's game ""Donkey Kong"" came before the leaders of Nintendo at the time.

The game features elements not seen before (or since) in the Mario series, including Egyptian themed bosses (although the Egypt theme is common in Mario, the bosses from SML are never heard of again, just like SMB2), space aliens, an apparent unending fascination with Easter Island and its Moi heads, and even two Shooting levels.  Although Miyamato revealed in an ""Iwata Asks"" interview that the original ""Super Mario Bros."" was going to have shooting levels, and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea (along with Mario having a gun), this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of ""Super Mario Land"".

I grew up with Mario, like most other gamers. With only two exceptions, I have played every Mario title at launch or shortly thereafter, from the original 1985 ""Super Mario Bros"" all the way down to ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"" (yes I'm old). Obviously being American we didn't get ""Lost Levels"" until ""Super Mario All-Stars"", but I got the SNES version when it was released back in '93 and have played through ""Lost Levels"" so many times over the years I've more than made up for not getting it back in 1986.

Anyway, the two I missed? ""Super Mario Land"" for the Gameboy (which I did play very briefly back when it first came out, but I never had it; we went with ""Super Mario Land 2"" instead when I did get a Gameboy) and ""Super Mario Sunshine"".  The very few times that I did play the game on the original Gameboy back in 1989 or the very early 1990s, I do remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done.

Being the Mario fan that I am, I did play through ""Super Mario Land"" on emulator a couple of years back, beating  the game over two decades after it was first released. [Before I really played the game I remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done].  Since then, I purchased the title on the 3DS Virtual Console (love those restore points!)

So my thoughts on the game?  Well, of all the Mario games, this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper ""Super Mario"" games (I am not including spin-offs and subseries).  ""Super Mario Land"" was a launch title for the Gameboy, and boy does it show.  The majority of the sprites are small, including Mario himself.  Being monochrome, it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is. The game is SHORT - only twelve levels.  Each level has about a 400 second time limit, so to do a full run through of the game, even dragging your feet, will not net you much gameplay in terms of time.

Due to Miyamoto's lack of involvement, the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other Mario titles.  There are octupuses, jumping flowers that shoot fire (reminds of me of Panser from ""Super Mario Bros. 2"", Gaos (they resemble Egyptian sphinxes), robots (!!), Totais (running Easter Island Moai  heads), Pionpis (jumping men who shoot at Mari in the last world) and Yurarin Boos, who are fire-breathing seahorses.  The last two are the most interesting, as they are heavily reminesnt of ""Metroid"".  The Pionpis reminds me of Samus Aran's female sprite when the JUSTIN BAILEY code is entered, and the Yurarin Boos are identical to the seahorses (in terms of game play and species type, though the sprites differ somewhat) in ""Metroid"" as well.

The game is set in Sarasaland, comprised of four kingdoms, Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.  Suddenly an evil space alien named Tatanga appears, kidnaps Princess Daisy (who debuts in this game), and it is up to Mario to rescue the Princess (but it's not Princess Peach at least).

 Probably my biggest complaint about the game, besides the short length, is the looseness in the controls.  I don't know if this holds true for the original Gameboy (I suspect it does), but playing on the 3DS, I found Mario often times going slightly further than I wanted, [or not far enough].  I've never hard this problem with the other Mario games.  There is also some weird hit detection issues going on.  I was playing 4-2, jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant, and Mario did not lose his power up.  I've seen this happen multiple times.

The loose play control further exacerbates another issue: no saving.  If you run out of lives (unless you're on 4-3, the very last world), you have to start all over which can be frustrating.  If you die on the last level you do get two continues.  Often times due to the loose play control I would slightly overshoot where I was jumping and Mario would plummet to his death.  Now, to be fair, to expect such a short game all the way back in 1989 to having saving is ridiculous, but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over.  Nintendo could have at least provided continues (a more realistic option for a game of this age).  .

The game is clearly modelled on the original ""Super Mario Bros."", although with some noticable differences.  First, the music itself is unlike anything else in the series, and is one of the strongest assests the game offers.  Just like the first game, you can't go back to the left; the screen only scrolls right.  Mario's sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the NES title.

The power ups are pretty weak.  There are exactly three: the Super mushroom, the Super Ball, and an invincibility star.  The Super Mushroom will make Mario big.  The Super Ball (this game's idiotic version of the Fire Flower) allows Mario to shoot projectiles.  However, the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the Super Ball, the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface.  So on levels that are pretty open, you shoot the Super Ball, it hits the ground right in front of Mario, and then shoots straight up into the sky, never to be seen again, rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you, creating a bigger margin for error.  If you are in a more enclosed space, the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out.  Unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time, so if you have one bouncing around and it's not connecting with an enemy, you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappears.

Like the other Mario titles, ""Super Mario Land"" would prove to be a massive hit, selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run.  What's depressing to me is that ""Super Mario Land"" actually outsold the far superior ""Super Mario Bros. 3"".  Note: that does not count the rereleases and Virtual Console sales, only the intial NES release vs. the Gameboy release.

For a game of its time, the title is pretty fun.  But of all the games in the core ""Super Mario"" series, this is easily the least substantial title, due to its brevity, the loose play controls, and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series.  The games sequel, ""Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins"", is infinitely better, with bigger sprites, more engaging gameplay, and a much longer gametime.  The music though from SML is, admittedly, fantastic and is probably its strongest point.

While there aren't really any BAD Mario games (they all very fun), there are definitely some top tier Mario games.  Mario is like The Beatles - pretty much everything from the core series is top of the line and tremendously polished, sells massive amounts of product, and is loved the world over.  Even a substandard Mario game is better than so many other games out there.  That being said though pretty much any other Mario game is better than this one.  Unless you have a nostalgic attachment to this game or you just want to play Mario's first portable adventure, there's not a lot of reason to go back to this unless you've played the other Mario games first.  This one should be down pretty far on your list..",3.0

"Nostalgic fanboys might disagree, but in my opinion, Super Mario Land is hardly a classic and hardly worth mentioning in the same breath as the first 3 NES Super Mario Bros. games.

The graphics, while terrible, aren't worth complaining about since I grew up in the NES days of the 80's/early 90's and remember very fondly how terrible many graphics were.  No, I can't defend them.  Nobody can.  It's all about whether you grew up back then.  If you did, you can better understand and appreciate the way the game looks.

My biggest grip is that the play control is pretty lousy.  Mario seems to float whenever you jump, and the same can be said for many of the items such as the mushrooms that floats once removed from a coin box, and the star as well.  Oh, and the starman music is simply atrocious.  Ignore that completely.

The challenge definitely depends on how well you can control Mario's movements because if these controls were top-notch like Super Mario Bros, guess what?  Super Mario Land would be incredibly easy.  This is because a good portion of the game is basically the first Mario game blended with elements of Super Mario Bros. 3.  The only exception is the underwater fireball-spitting machine stage which is a nice shooting adventure type experiment, and the airplane stage which is basically the same thing but in the air.

The enemy animations are laughable.  The goombas look just like the mushrooms for crying out loud!  They also resemble ugly skulls, and the koopa troopas are really skinny and malnourished.  The dry fish that pop out of the ground and go directly up are mediocre looking.  Some of the other enemies that are brand new are actually reasonable.  Oh and an enemy that goes by the name of ""Bunbun"" (LOL!) is really nice.  I believe this enemy influenced the Super Mario Bros. 3 flying goombas but I could be wrong.  Actually I'm not sure I'm thinking of the right enemy after all.  Oh well, at least I got to say the hilarious word ""Bunbun!""

I just really hate how the first half of the game feels like a watered down Super Mario Bros. with the pipes and coins feeling like they're lifted directly from SMB.  Not *directly* of course, but close enough that the developers should have put in more effort to make the coins and pipes stand apart from any connection to SMB.

I HATE the music.  All of it.  Just really screechy and irritating bloops and bleeps that hardly resemble a melody (except for the castle theme which is some kind of cliched Egyptian music).  There's also a fairly melodic Asian theme later on that, again, is repetitive and cliched, and the game ending music is really spectacular as well.  That's it.  At least on the NES an effort was actually made to make ALL the themes memorable and bearable.

On the plus side, I like how Mario shoots fireballs.  The way they bounce and hit enemies on an angle is a nice surprise that takes a small amount of skill to master, and the size of them is quite impressive as well.  Fighting a variety of bosses instead of Bowser is definitely a plus in my book.  Oh, and the challenge is actually pretty high in a few spots such as the bouncing boulders that you have to ride over spikes.  This is pretty hard.

Oh, and Daisy?  She's a LOT better than Princess Toadstool.  By now you're probably well aware that the Princess allows Bowser to kidnap her because she's an attention seeker.  Daisy is not only more attractive, but more sensible and respectable, so you really WANT to put in the additional effort to rescue her.  In a perfect world Daisy would have been the one to face an enormous amount of success and Princess Toadstool would have been forgotten.  You see Princess Toadstool is too much of a fake, generic woman who's *supposed* to be attractive like Vanna White.  Daisy is a REAL woman that you want to cuddle and comfort.  There's a BIG difference between the two.

Instead of reaching a flag at the end of each stage, you're given a choice between two doors.  The top door takes you to a bonus area where you can get powerups and 1-ups.  Always go for the top door if you can.  This is mainly how you acquire 1-ups.

Nah it's not quite a classic but it's a commendable effort.",3.0
"Super Mario Land is unlike any other brand of Mario that I've ever played. Jumping right in to the first level, nothing is characteristic of a typical Mario; alien spacecrafts, exploding koopas, and airplanes abound. When the game came out in 1989, it was a testament of technology on the small screen. Those sentiments don't hold up as much today. Poor controls and awkward level design plague the game. The game is moderately difficult, but not anything an experienced player should have any problem overcoming. The game can be beat in an hour or less and makes the perfect time waster if you want to play a game, but your schedule doesn't allow you to do so for a prolonged period of time. Because of the lack of playing time, there is no save feature. The game does have some replay-ability, as once you beat it, the next play-through will include different enemy placement and a little more of a challenge (unless of course you shut it off or your batteries run out...d'oh!). The background music, while simple, is one of the more memorable factors of the game. I recommend picking it up, especially for the price on this site. However, don't expect a ""timeless classic"" like other reviewers have praised it to be.",3.0

"I've looked at quite a few retro X-Men games, and aside from the arcade game, this has been the only decent one I've found. This game lets you take control six of your favorite X-Men. You got your classics like Cyclops and Wolverine, but you also have the less-known but very well done mutants like Gambit, Beast, Nightcrawler, or Psylocke. Magneto also becomes an unlockable character after you beat a certain stage in the game. The level design for this game is superb. There are lots of different environments that use very vibrant colors, although some are better than others. Plus, you can team up with a friend and wipe out your enemies as a team. Playing co-op with a friend has always been one of the most nastalgic elements of my childhood so I always get excited when I can find games when I can team up with a friend. However, this game is far from perfect. It's main fatal flaw is that it is incredibly easy to walk right into the enemies because you're always on the right-end of the screen whenever you're moving forward. The only way I can play this game is when I just inch along from level to level really, really slowly. This gets boring rather quickly. Not to mention you only get a few continues before it's game over and there is no way to save your progress. This is still a lot better than the other X-Men games of its time, but is still in some need of a few finishing touches.",3.0

"The Genesis version of Mortal Kombat 3 is not that bad. The graphics are pretty good,as is the sound. The only bad thing about this game though,is it's VERY VERY hard to play with a three button controller. If you buy this game,I highly recommend that you buy a six button controller along with it,if you don't already have one,because it's hell to play it with a three button. Overall,this is a fun game. Not the best of the series,but still pretty good.",3.0
"The main things to remember about Mortal Kombat III for Genesis are that:
1) It's on Genesis and not SNES, so the controls are terrible. You will have to mash multiple buttons together to get one response, etc. I don't know if a snazzy 6-button controller fixes this issue, but I don't have one of those.
2) This is not Ultimate Mortal Kombat III, which is waaayyyy better.  You will find yourself wishing that it was mainly because of the much larger character roster.

Other than that, it's a pretty decent game that can offer a few minutes of fun here and there, maybe more if you are with friends, but I found that most of my friends can only get down on a game like this for a few minutes because the controls are so horrid.",3.0
"I'm gonna make this review short and simply say check out UMK3, its really like an improved version of this game.

This game has good graphics, good music, and decent character selection. You can play as the 2 boss characters with some kinda cheat during the options menu, that's a plus. But the game is just to weak by comparison. It lacks a lot of little things Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 has to offer. The gameplay isn't bad but with some better control options that could have really been improved.

Ideal for a quick thrill and small enough to be stashed away in the pocket of your pants, GBP can be quite amusing when played with the right cartridges. A few suggestions are the Pokemon games (very addictive at any age), Harvest Moon, and any game out of the Kirby's Dreamland series.",3.0
"It's such an obvious idea, I'm surprised no one has thought of it before: a game that plays like a comic book where you are in the panels and each page is a level. It has neat little features like how enemies are drawn into the page and you can choose different paths, but where the game falls short is in the gameplay. All it consists of is punch-punch-kick again and again; it gets old and doesn't allow for strategy or skill.

"Tried really hard to like this game, gave it many second chances and even went for the 'stage select' code, but this game ultimate failed in the fun factor. Graphics and sounds were impressive at times, but most of the game is spent trying to make death defying leaps, off by a bit often means instant death, or back to the earlier part of the stage. Also, much time will be spent simply trying to figure out what to do next. Some of the levels are intriguing and original, like the Level 2, and the Stampede. The other levels are dull and designed to frustrate. Even the great graphics and sound of level 2 are ruined by having to memorize precise jumps where any mistakes mean death and back to the beginning. Slow and plodding, too easy to take hits, rote memorization, repetitive stage design, blot out the few bright spots like cool cut scenes and animations. The Sonic and Aladdin games are way ahead of this one.",3.0

"When you look at the painstakingly long list of comic licensed games that were released for the 16-bit systems of years ago, most were basically just walk from left to right while beating up countless generic villians in a game which lacks any kind of spirit or feel of the comic it is based from and is pretty much Streets of Rage with a comic license attached to it (notably most of which were published by Acclaim or one of their other publishing divisions). Maximum Carnage is based on the mid-nineties massive event that took place in the Spider-Man comics in which Spidey had to team up with Venom to take on Carnage in a ravaged New York. In the game, you can play as Spidey or Venom, and you pretty much do all as I described above, and thats about it. Almost none of these games had any kind of save feature, and Maximum Carnage is one of these games, and it is a painstakingly long game to finish and does offer some high difficulty. Maximum Carnage's few saving graces are the game's music provided by Green Jelly (although it sounds a bit generic at times considering the Genesis didn't have the best soundchip imaginable) and the fluid and colorful graphics. There are a few guest appearances from other heroes (Firestar, Captain America) and you've got some tough villians in Carnage, Shreik, Doppleganger, and Demogoblin, but other than that Maximum Carnage is only a bit better than the heap of comic licensed 16-bit beat 'em ups.",3.0

Since the game came out early in the gameboy's life cycle it is no surprise at how simple the overall gameplay can be. Basically its the usual sidescrolling beat 'em up.

"Years before Michael Bay's would-be catastrophe came along, turtles ruled the world.  They ran all the industries that mattered; comics, TV, movies and games, like this one.

Based on the 90's cartoon show, the objective of this Game Boy title is simple: Rescue April O'Neil from the Foot Clan using one of the four Turtles.  With 3 basic attacks at your disposal, you fight your way through 5 level filled with ninjas, robots and floating boxes of pizza to replenish your health.  Though enough grunts are thrown in to increase the challenge, you can beat the end bosses wearing your ninja mask backwards.  On the off-chance you do use up our heroes, the game ends.

Besides changing the limited control scheme to one's own taste, the player also has the option to choose whichever stage he wants.  So you can either play through the whole thing and get the full cowabunga experience, or skip all the way to the end for near-instant gratification.  Kinda defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

"NBA Hangtime was originally an arcade game that continues on the NBA Jam franchise with updated roster, graphics and the ability to create a player with its own attributes. It did pretty well and eventually it was ported to the SNES, Nintendo 64, Playstation and PC. While it's a spot on arcade port, it's okay when you play it by yourself but best played with other people.

You start off by choosing to create a player or just picking a squad of two guys from any NBA team to go against the computer for 4 quarters each lasting 15 minutes. Whoever has the most points wins the game. Beat all 29 NBA teams and you will be crowned the grand champion. The game's option screen lets you choose to lower or higher the audio and sound effects, increase or decrease the game's difficulty and to slow down or speed up the game clock. As for creating a player, you choose a name and pin number, then choose a head for your player, color of uniform, how to distribute attribute points, pick a nickname and then save it all so you can use it during the match ups. You can bring up to 3 other players to play 2 on 2 matches at any time. As an added bonus, you can find online and enter various cheat codes to activate different effects, get additional players, courts and a different basketball.

The PROS: Midway gave us an exact arcade port of the hit arcade game. Everything that was in the arcade game is in here so you won't miss anything. Don't worry about the controls because it is easy to get used to. You can even customize the buttons to your liking. The create a player and cheat codes are welcome additions while the multiplayer portion proves that is where the real fun is at; especially if you and your friends like to trash talk during the match ups.

The CONS: Nothing else was added to make this port stand out; no extra modes or bonus content means that all is you do is play against the other teams. Also, no matter which difficulty level you put it at, the A.I. players will ALWAYS catch up and make sure they can beat you at the last possible second. It can get frustrating when your shots are suddenly blocked with perfect precision, get shoved to the ground with lightning accuracy and have the A.I. players make perfect shots no matter where they are in the court. You will lose games every so often and to earn more attribute points for your created player, you have to win 4 games in a row for 2 APs and that's the ONLY way to earn them. At least when you play against other people, you level the playing field enough for the game to be enjoyable.

There's nothing special about NBA Hangtime. It's a perfect arcade port so you won't miss anything if you didn't play it in the arcades. It's a game best played with other people as the A.I. players make sure you don't win by a landslide and do whatever it takes to rob you of a win right down to the last second in the fourth quarter. And there's no special ending if you do beat all the teams so this is really for the fans of the NBA Jam series and no one else. Get this cheap and make sure you have friends to play this with. Otherwise, pass this one up.",3.0
"Being a followup version of NBA JAM it should have kept some of the same options previous versions had. Particuly the ""dunks from anywhere"" and ""unlimited fire"" codes. Because it's more fun to play with those codes sometimes then it is to play this difficult game. The stratagy compared to JAM is a lot harder and makes it less fun IMO, you can't just turn up the juice and kick your opponents a## in this one because the computer will always make a comeback instantly every single time, even if you get 20 points ahead all of a sudden you cant sink a bucket, your instantly blocked by the comp or it will steal from nowhere and there 3 pointers never miss even with players who in real life cant shoot for $#!%.

It is very hard to block or grab rebounds against the computer, shots don't go in nicely like in NBA JAM,  and it's difficult enough to get on fire, let alone, stay on fire with the cheating computer instantly making come backs to make it a hard to win matchup everytime... eventualy you do work out the stratagy and it becomes a challenge to win instead of being fun to play.

There are some cool new options tho, the graphics are better then the old SNES Jams and there is new cool dunks and ally oops, double dunks, and ""team fire"" where if you can make 3 ally oops in a row both of your teamates become on fire with a blue colored flame. The create a wrestler is a cool idea, but you cant do much then just choose heads and attributes and a nickname.. tho I dunno what more you could create for a basketball game? Maybe a whole new team or something and a cheat to get max points, you have to win 4 games in a row to 2 new atributes... ok if you have a memory card, but it sucks if you don't and all data is lost when the machine is turned. Why does it use a memory card???? The SNES versions never needed to use them, and it takes up little space on the memory card, enough to have been in a battery backup option.

Overall I'd much rather be playing the much funner versions on the SNES then this one... I don't like that there is no ""unlimitd on fire"" or ""unlimited team fire"" cheat. The code ""461"" does enable a cool out=door, street style court to play on which is a lot easier on your eyes then the red and orange of the usualy looking indoor courts (codes hold left, block, block ...[<200])... but unless you are playing this game with 4 people then its no fun. probably a lot of fun with a game shark, but not on its own.. and when you get through the 29 teams, there is no cool ending like on the SNES one where it showed video things of real dunks... this one just rolls credits and says thanks for letting us waste your time.",3.0
"Generally I have always like Disney Interactive N64 games but this one was kind of a let down for me. Pretty much the whole game is 2D side scrolling. Pretty much every level consists of just getting from point A to point B. There aren't really any missions to accomplish. On the bright side, it has a degree of challenge in it and it can be oddly addicting. But if you want a really good Disney Interactive game with fun levels full of challenging missions and hours of fun, I would buy the Toy Story 2 N64 game rather than this.",3.0
"It is extremely rare for a game developer who can crank out hit after hit after hit. There seemed only a handful of game developers who could: Treasure Games, Natsume, and Wayforward Technologies. These brilliant and talented game designers have presented to the world gems of underappreciated value: Shatterhand for NES, Gunstar Heroes on Genesis, Shantae on Gameboy Color, and multiple other overlooked classics.
Treasure not only created Gunstar Heroes, but also classics such as Alien Soldier, Radiant Silvergun, Ikaruga, and Dynamite Headdy. These guys know how to make a fantastic game.
So what's with all the drooling fanboyism? These guys are awesome. That's why I want to pose a thoughtful question: WHY IS THIS GAME AVERAGE?!
Treasure was always known for inputting fun gameplay mechanics into their games, and Mischief Makers is no exception. The mechanic here is that your character can grab and shake things in order to produce some effect for the level. However, the controls are hilariously awkward: the controls for other Treasure titles are spot on, but here it just feels sloppy.
While some levels are fun and are cleverly designed, most are just boring or bland. One level, you'll be trying to escape an incoming wall of fire, and the next, you'll be trying to catch some negligent mother's bratty kids. Either way, all levels are too short: The fun ones often end right when they were getting REALLY interesting. It just feels as though the developers were running out of ideas for what to put in those levels.
Heck, even the grabbing-and-shaking gameplay is difficult to get used to. When they try to introduce something new in the levels, it often falls on trial-and-error execution. This can be VERY frustrating, and the loose controls don't help. While some aspects of level design work well with the gameplay mechanic, the rest feels like a big gimmicky mess.
The music is forgettable, the character designs are banal at best, the story only exists to get in the way (Trust me, the storyline here is simply not interesting), and overall, it's just an ""okay"" or average game.
But that's my prime concern. This game was made the same talented group behind Gunstar Heroes and Bangai-O? Surely, you jest: it simply does not show in Mischief Makers. When I play a Treasure game, I expect it to blow my mind. That's what they operate on: PURE GENIUS, not FLUBBED GAME DESIGN. Even though this is easily one of Treasure's worst games (The other being a hilarious McDonald's Genesis game), it's just okay, and should be added to your N64 collection just because Treasure made it. After all, this IS apart of the legacy of one of the most legendary game developers in the world, even if it isn't NEARLY as mind-blowing as their best stuff.",3.0

"Okay, so I'm six years too late in reviewing this game, but what the hey: I just recently picked it up really cheap, just to see what it was like since I'm a huge Mortal Kombat fan. Bottom line? It's better than I expected, but not by much.
I've bought around 16 Nintendo 64 games, and not once have I complained about the cartridge format: until now. It served me well through GoldenEye, Perfect Dark, Banjo-Kazooie, Battle for Naboo, and even through Resident Evil 2. Yes the video sequences in that game were highly compressed, but seeing as how squeezing them all in was a miracle by itself, I have no complaints. It's too bad Williams didn't try any similiar compression techniques for MKT. The game feels woefully incomplete, especially when compared to the PSX version. A couple of characters were sacrificed, including Goro, Kintaro, the unmasked Sub-Zero, and classic costume changes for Kano, Raiden, Jax, and a few others. A lot of the classic backgrounds are also missing, noticibly from the original game and Mortal Kombat 2. And then there's the sound, or what tries to pass itself off as sound. While the N64 was capable of Dolby 5.1 Surround by the end of its life span, here it can barely crank out decent mono. Other reviews have said the sound seems canned, muffled, and my personal favourite: like your speakers are set up behind a cement wall. It's all true, every bit of it. If Williams had given the game better sound, I might have been tempted to ease off on it a little.
The gameplay has been carried over from MK3, with a new aggressor meter at the bottom. Thankfully, for the characters that have made it, all their finishing moves are intact, and are still cool to watch. There are also various 2-on-2, 3-on-3, and tournament modes to mess around with. The game does get stale after awhile, but it happens to all fighting games. MKT is good for a few rounds of mayhem whenever you're bored.
I don't regret purchasing MKT, but I wish Williams had taken more time and effort to polish the game, such as reshooting the actors (Brawka in particular feels cut and pasted directly from MKII), and finding a way to cram everything in. MK fans without a PSX should definitely get this. It's not completely satisfying, but it gets the job done.",3.0

"As the Playstation heated up the console wars, Sega and Nintendo weren't the only competitors this time around. So N64 owners were delighted to hear that MK Trilogy would be released and in 1996, it came out and was a moderate success. But with delight came confusion and disappointment as Nintendo's version wasn't identical to the Playstation version in more ways that one. MK Trilogy turned out to be a decent and dated MK fighting game even by standards back then.

MK Trilogy is a fighting game combining all the stages, characters, game play mechanics and ""fatalities"" (gory special moves) from all of the past MK games into one glorious version with extra modes and options to give fans of Mortal Kombat the complete experience. Choose from one of 26 characters (plus 4 secret characters that you have to unlock) and you can either play one on one kombat, 2 player vs. kombat, tournament mode or 2 player three on three kombat. The main goal is to beat every fighter you come across and make it to Shao Khan, the game's main villain. Each character has its own background story, ending, moves and fatalities so the game will keep you busy as far as using different characters by yourself or taking on another player. There are numerous codes to enter with varying results so find a guide online and try them out yourself.

The PROS: Everything about Mortal Kombat is all in one game: the stages, characters, moves, options, music, game play, codes and secret characters make an appearance. MK fans will dive in head first and feel right at home. And the 2 player modes let you challenge another player for added replayability. Plus, no load times means every match starts immediately.

The CONS: While the Playstation version had loading issues, it turned out to be the better version overall. Thanks to cartridge limitations, the N64 version doesn't feature the extra characters found in the Playstation version and takes a big hit in the graphics and music department. Animation frames are missing which means the graphics are not as smooth as it should be. The music doesn't sound as good as it should be since it's been compressed to save space. The controls are spot on but some will find the N64 controller a little cumbersome at first so it will take some getting used to before you forget about the initial inconvenience.

What's disappointing is that had this come out a year later, MK Trilogy could have turned out better since other developers opted to ship their games in cartridges with more space and it would have helped out. Because of key sacrifices, this game will only be cherished by the fans and somewhat acknowledged by everyone else. This game would later re-inforce the notion that CDs were the better medium to make games on while cartridges had less space to work with and were more expensive to manufacture. You can pick this up cheap and I would recommend this game to the fans and those who never played the Playstation version.",3.0
"same as the other one but with a few glaring differences like the graphics stink like a butt on this one.theres a lot of characters in this one.theres robots,cops,martial artists,gods.......really theres only 2 types. 1-the kind that get beat down by the computer almost every time and 2-the kind you can win with all the time prettily easily through massive repition.they are lou kang,raiden and the cop.theres some male ballerina looking dude with a lot of flaming balls.......errr i mean fire balls.hes pretty good except for the whole spandex thing.its alright but 4 is way way better.im actualy suprised they're even from the same system considering 3 looks like a sega master system game.for all you bozos out there the sega master system came out after the intellivision and before the original nintendo.oh yeah,i don't appreciate the guys who made this making shiva a chick when in fact shiva is a very powerful hindu god with enough destructive capacity in his 3rd eye to destroy existence!",3.0
"Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a pretty good game for N64. But compared to the Playstation version, it's just a small combination of the past three MK games and nothing more. The graphics are okay, the animation is fair, but the sounds & music are ... poor! It would be better to put the volume on mute while playing it. Plus, the N64's control doesn't quite do well with this sort of game. There are three really cool cheat menu's on this game though. However, for whatever reason, there is NO one-button-fatalities cheat! You have to press a certain combination of buttons on your controller in order to do all the finishing moves. That really...!!!! Plus, every stage uses music from MK3. That gets really annoying after a while.
My advice to MK fans: BUY THIS GAME FOR THE PLAYSTATION! YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH! On the playstation version of MKT, you get all the characters from all of the MK games, including their own set of moves and fatalities. Plus, there are more cheats, secrets, and even the popular one-button-fatalities cheat is on here!!! All of the stages are here, and the graphics, sounds, music, animation, and controls are excellent!!! Buy this on your Playstation, and avoid the N64 version. ...",3.0
"At the time when racing games came out for Nintendo 64, San Francisco Rush was a game that was unlike anything that hit the street. The game showcased unlike anything imaginable with its high energy, and exterme driving. Nevertheless, any game worth driving always needs a second opinion. It is important to see it to know if you like it.
When San Francisco Rush came out in 1997, it was a little more crazy unlike anything I've ever raced. The graphics were just amazing, but unfortunately, the controls were just a little bit awkward, and hard to steer through the streets of San Francisco. The game anyway features six tracks to choose from, three not released in the arcades, and a extra special hidden track. Before it was a choice in Rush 2, it was featured here, Alcatraz. The amazing course did have some cuts, but it wasn't that extreme until nearly a year later. The game also features a couple of hidden cars to seek, while driving. There are hidden keys located on the street, unlocking 2 cars to choose from, once there accessed, a hidden taxi cab, and a devilish prowler.
Although there were two different versions of Rush that came out during the time, one for Playstation, the other for Nintendo 64, they both seemed a little bit flawed, but enjoyable. Nevertheless, if you had a choice, I would suggest picking up Rush 2 Extreme Racing U.S.A. for Nintendo 64. But, unfortunately, for Playstation buffs, that was the last Rush there was. If you like this game, pick it up. If not, depending if you own a Nintendo 64, get another racing game.",3.0

"I was really excited to get this game because I love both the X-men movie and 3D fighting games.  There are a lot of features and extras to unlock in  the ""Cerebro"" mode, but for the work you have to do in order to  earn some of them, it can be rather disappointing.  You can unlock scans  from the comic books by beating 10 rounds in survival mode using one of  their costumes.  But in order to unlock pictures from the movie you have to  beat 20 rounds with a character in their movie costume.  This gets very  frustrating because 1. they give you no indication of how many rounds you  have beaten until your game is done, and 2. the pictures you unlock are  awkward and some are just cheesy cut-out and paste pictures, not high  quality pictures you would see in a magazine review or at the x-men movie  website.  In fact I think the only worthwhile unlockable secret in the game  is after you have beaten the arcade with all 10 characters you receive a  ""story style"" FMV.  Basically it links the FMVs you see at the  end of the arcade mode together in a pretty cool way (but it doesn't  actually tell a story).  So basically if you are looking for a great way to  play and fight as your favorite comic book heroes I recommend this game.  But if you are only looking for a good fighting game to play for several  hours and unlock tons of cool extras I think you should try another game.  P.S.: I do recommend getting the strategy guide or downloading one of the  'net, because the manual is pretty terrible at describing your moves.",3.0
"Before the start of this review, I just want to say that I am a fan of the X-Men since The Dark Phoenix saga.  That aside, this game has the makings of a good start in truly representing the comic book medium.  In this incarnation of the comic book series, you must fight all of the heroes in order to advance to the villains and ultimately, Magneto.  While the 3-D renderings look great on the characters as a whole, the implementation onto a 2-dimensional environment loses the overall effect. While that may be a minor blow, the bigger problem is that it uses basically the same game engine as Street Fighter Alpha, which is very outdated.  The makers should've went all the way and created a rich 3-D environment for the characters to interact with, similar to the far superior Spider-Man (just released).  If you really like the X-Men, buy this game and overlook its shortcomings.  But for the casual fighter fan, wait for PS2's Tekken Tag Team.",3.0

"While I thought I would never play this game, I decided to give it a shot. I prefer Pirates of the Caribbean, American Idol, and Donkey Kong Country over this one, but some of the games are better than I thought. Game & Watch Gallery 3 consists of five mini-games: Egg, Greenhouse, Turtle Bridge, Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong Jr. Each game has about four possible combinations: Classic, Modern (if you consider 1984 modern), Easy and Hard. Egg is simply where you hold a basket out and either catch eggs or try to eat cookies before the cookies turn black or the eggs splatter on the ground.

 Greenhouse is a game where you have to shoot melon seeds up a pipe and stop this little white creature from stepping on this landing pad/matt-like object in the modern version, while in the classic version you have to emit a power-like zapping force to ward off spiders befroe they get to you and your greenhouse. Turtle Bridge is one of the more fun games where you have to hop from block to block in the modern version and turtle to turtle in the classic version while trying to make it back and forth delivering packages from one island to another. Be careful because the blocks or turtles will ""accidentally"" slip into the sea or lose balance, so try to be as fast as you can. Mario Bros. is probably the most fun, enjoyable game in that Mario and Luigi are both loading up boxes on a truck and they have to work together at passing the boxes from side to side on a conveyor belt before Luigi finally loads it up onto a truck. This game can be tricky as well, for the better you are, the more faster the boxes will come down, which means you'll be constantly having to go from level to level to make sure each box gets passed on to a higher belt while keeping track of Mario and Luigi in synchronization as well!

 Last but not least, there's Donkey Kong VERY Jr., a much more simplified version of DK that has the same concept: climb vines and avoid enemies while trying to get the key to unlock that door. All in all, I'm not crazy about this particular game, but two types of people will love it. (1) The really silly Game Boy loving kid that prefers arcade-style games on his GB and will buy any fun game at a bargain or (2) the kid at heart who absolutely  loves CLASSIC arcade games and views them as a collector's item without completely shunning the ""modern"" versions either.

"Believe me, this is nowhere near the worst game of all time. It is strictly an average game. It breaks no new ground, offers very little in the way of new and fresh adventures, and it's explicit blood and guts get tiresome after a while. But where it excells is in the horror aspect, with well animated and truely frightning monsters lurking in the back alleys, there is much to fear.
Set in Victorian London (circa 1840), you assume the role of either a preist or a young student apprentice. The former excells with strength while the other excells at agility. Both offers skills essential to survival. Your task is to defeat all the monsters that an evil scientist has unleashed. Cliched as the story is, the action is fun for any fan of ""Resident Evil"" or ""Tomb Raider"", with the action in the third person similar to the other survival horror games.
The graphics are nice, but dark and moody. This makes the gaming experience unpleasant over the long run. The music is nicely done, and reminds me of the moods set in ""Silent Hill"". The action is nice, and will please gamers who crave action and painting walls with your enemies. But in the way of deep story or character development, you may want to look elsewhere.

"Doom has returned with an all-new game for the Nintendo 64. As always you are the lone soldier in space sent to annihilate goat headed monsters, imps, zombie soldiers, arch viles and spider masterminds. But new to the Doom saga are very intelligent enemies and upgraded graphics, which look smooth and not pixilated like the PC and other versions. Also new are three new weapons, to help you tear through dark creatures on your way through 30 levels. The good part is that they are action packed and challenging, the bad part is that some of the levels take you an hour to get through them. Which sets Doom 64 apart from the Quake games for N64, because in Quake it is obvious what to do... go straight and kill whatever gets in your way. With Doom you use your mind to uncover things. However, this is a stereotypical shooting game where you can only point your gun forward and you cannot jump. Fortunately in this game you will not find yourself fighting monsters on staircases, ramps or shooting at them from miles away like in the other versions of Doom.

"Sometimes, you'll hear people say that a game is good because it takes like 100 hours to beat or something. What those people left out is that the game they're playing is fun, which makes them want to play it for 100 hours. Donkey Kong 64 has its moments, but I don't think it's fun enough to really finish 100%.. or at all. I played and loved all three Donkey Kong Country games back in the day, and I was pretty surprised that there was an N64 Donkey Kong title of which I'd never heard. But this isn't a Donkey Kong platformer: it's a mini-game marathon. It's like Mario Party, except not half as fun.

Let's start with the monkeys, which are arguably the title's greatest fault. You never, or at least I never, really felt like you're in control of an agile primate. These Kongs move far too slowly. You ""run"" in much the same manner that N64 Link does (rolling). But Link moves way faster than these monkeys, and and you might find yourself screaming, ""Oh would you just get to the warp point already!"" Furthermore, the jumping ability of Kongs in 3D space seems to be less than polished. They won't get you killed, as this game is ridiculously easy (in terms of staying alive). However, they will annoy you as big Kremlins knock you off ledges because your monkeys can't move like monkeys. Now imagine bad controls coupled knocking you off ledges with being forced to barrel roll back at 50% OoT Link's rolling speed.

All too often, Rare's solution to hiding 200 Golden Bananas throughout the game seems to be 'toss in a mini-game'. Some of them are fun, but these mini-games bring the term 'Wii Play' to mind, and that's a phrase I'm sure Cranky Kong wouldn't want to be associated with.

They want you to play with each character once in every level. This wouldn't be a bad idea if the platforming controls were better and there were a decent number of enemies to fight (outside of those two or three bonus levels). But if you want to get everything, you need to barrel roll through each level five times, killing the one or two enemies that oppose you, and exploring for the spots where Rare wants to launch a mini-game. Two of the mini-games were the original 8-bit Donkey Kong and Jetpac. They're easily the best parts of this game.

I got bored with it going through the water level with 80 or so Bananas. It's too long and it's not really that fun, but there is a lot of sort of ok content along the way. So, three stars, I guess.",3.0
"I have poured hours and hours into this game as a kid, but there is one fatal flaw that affects its overall greatness, and that is the requirement of beating the near-impossible 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game two times with only one life each time. I played the original 1981 arcade game at an arcade place recently, and that is lenient compared to the hair-tearing experience that the one in Donkey Kong 64 will offer you, and the player is required to not only receive a Nintendo coin from beating the arcade game twice, but the game also requires the player to play and beat Jetpac, which is actually more lenient than the original Donkey Kong, but it still can be a mess to beat. On a positive note, the levels are very detailed and beautifully designed, thanks to the Expansion Pak, but the fact that the player is required to beat the original Donkey Kong twice with only one life per attempt killed the fun, as I would put away the game because of that one impossible mini game to cool down, I even had to buy a Gameshark to beat the game the first time around; it was near impossible. I can now beat it without the use of a Gameshark, but I still find it completely unnecessary to hold such a hefty requirement just to beat the game normally, and if it gave the player a different ending I would understand, but the game forces the player to beat those mini games, and while it could add to the challenge factor, it is still completely unnecessary to just merely complete the game normally. I would still recommend the game, as it has some redeeming values such as advanced sound effects and detailed enemy and level designs, but the player must have extreme patience and be fully willing to take a couple of brutal beatings from the original Donkey Kong and Jetpac in order to beat the game.",3.0
They don't tell you up front the game requires an expansion pack just to work. This forced me into investing even more into my old N64 system. The kids did enjoy the game for about 1 week but then returned to Mario Kart.,3.0
"Donkey Kong 64 is a rather paint-by-numbers platformer that was released late in the Nintendo 64's life. It features a very basic plot that takes the player through about a dozen basic environments ranging from jungle to ancient ruins to caves to haunted castle. Following the standard plat-formula of its era, the game requires you to collect a wide array of goodies to proceed in your quest. There are a lot of things to find, and while you do not necessarily need to meet 100% completion in order to 'beat' the game, you have to come close. You are provided with an entertaining and rather impressive variety of actions (guns, musical instruments, special moves) and gameplay modes (platforming challanges, barrel blasting, shooting levels, minecarts, minigames, boss battles, etc), but things drag on into tedium rather quickly when the game runs out of tricks. Also, the game has none of the fast-paced 'WOW factor' of the SNES games, and is probably one of the slowest platformers I have ever played. A very significant change of pace, and one I can't say I'm a fan of. The SNES games were about charging through the levels, beating the crap out of everything in sight, and uncovering secrets and bonus items. There is very little of that in Donkey Kong 64, which is disappointing.

But one thing that bothered me about this game above all else were the 'classic' arcade segments that you were required to beat in order to reach the final boss level. Both of them, Jetpack and the original Donkey Kong, are obnoxiously difficult. I never actually beat them, and resorted to playing the final boss level on a friend's cartridge instead. I felt this was an incredible betrayal on behalf of the game, considering how many hours I had put into it. I bought this game to play Donkey Kong, not a bunch of rigged arcade games that existed for the sole purpose of stealing quarter after quarter from a desperate clientele.

Overall, I don't think porting this series to the world of 3D open-ended platforming was the best of ideas. It was worth a shot, and there are a lot of impressive and enjoyable aspects to this game, but ultimately it did not live up to the hype and does not age very well, especially up next to such games as Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie.",3.0
"This game intrigued me as I have always been a huge fan of the SNES versions so long ago. However, this game, while being a blast and a half, was very long. It was difficult to finish because the mini-games are frustrating and the levels grow to be a bit monotonous about halfway through the game. It will definitely keep you playing for hours though. Overall, Donkey Kong 64 is a very fun game. Okay, 'nuff said.",3.0
"well I've had this game for close to three years. a friend left it at my house and shortly after he moved I found it under some stuff. So, I decided to try it out. Since then i've played it about 5 or 6 times, and to tell you the truth, it's not that bad of a game. the original idea of transforming your characters into ferocious beasts is a step ahead of the other fighting simulators out there (tekken, battle arena toshinden, tobal) and is original in it's own right. However, I do think that some of the gameplay is slow and blocky, although the characters are well designed. The difficulty is a bit harder than your usual fighting game, but that leaves the player desiring more gameplay rather than beating it the first time with nothing else to strive for. The art section is interesting, and the characters are displayed wonderfully. One thing I'd like to point out though--I really thought Fox was cute...until I found out it was a GUY. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a pervert who obsesses over video game girls, but I thought fox looked alot cuter than alice...but when I found out that it was a guy...haha I just about smacked myself. So anyways, to sum it all up, this game is a good kick for 2 player or playing it once in awhile, but as far as total replay value goes, it's not all THAT great. I recently sold mine ot somebody because I never played it, and it just sat around. I figured with the extra money I could use it to invest in some shiny new guitar effects pedals or something of the like. so, having spent 5 minutes of my time, I hope I helped somebody in making their decision whether to buy this game or not.  -Jared",3.0

"If this game was more like the Donkey Kong Country series released on the SNES, then it would be a masterpiece. It's true that it has several of the DKC basics, including several monsters, massive bosses, the Kong Family-Donkey, Diddy, Candy, Funky, Cranky, and Wrinkly, as well as newly introduced members Chunky (Kiddy's brother), Tiny (Dixie's sister), and Lanky (DK's second cousin). However, the game is really more like Banjo-Kazooie, which is unquestionably Nintendo and Rare's trademark N64 series. Rather than having various levels in multiple worlds to trek through in a platform adventure, we get eight massive worlds for heavy exploration. It really just isn't quite the same. As true as it is that it is fun as hell to play, it doesn't get as high an overall rating because it strays so far from the classics. However, other than that, it is highly enjoyable.",3.0
"The one good thing about this game is the multiplayer, which is why I gave it 3 stars. When I was having a sleepover, we played the multiplayer mode all night. But there is always something bad though, and that is the single-player mode. I beat the game on agent in a week, which was too easy, but trying it on Special Agent was too hard. And the guns are horrible. So if you are bored you can get your friends over and play a couple of rounds of multiplayer, but otherwise the game isn't that great.",3.0
I was really looking forward to trying this game so I was pretty disappointed when I played it.  The controls on this game are terrible as is the camera angle.  There's a very brief tutorial at the beginning of the game but I didn't find it very helpful.  You're given a briefing on what you're supposed to do and what your goals are but I didn't find that helpful either.  This is one game that I would not recommend to anyone.,3.0

"I'd probably give PD 3.5 stars, where I'd give GoldenEye 4.5 or so.
I'll admit, the multiplayer option beats GoldenEye's, and the combat simulator, and ""training facility"" (which, in and of itself can open some cheats and special features) features are a great addition, and they're incredibly well-made.  I also like the added touches of hearing Jo's footsteps, and the guards that curse when they get shot (the guards are also more alert and responsive, which is neat, even if the game's noticeably harder for it).
My main problem is that the game itself sort of takes a back seat to the special features.  The missions, for example, get interrupted so much by the ""level"" ending that it's annoying.  The mood is enhanced by things like more bystanders, rain, etc., and the backgrounds are better, but none of the missions are noticeably more complex than the Mayan level of GoldenEye.
For all the extras, PD is awesome; for the actual game, I must say I prefer GoldenEye.",3.0
"It's fun to destroy stuff in this game.  Blowing up whole towns just doesn't get old.  I don't know how successful this game was, but it seems it was underrated.  I rented it once and enjoyed it a lot.  The only problem I had with it was it got pretty difficult after finishing some of the easier levels, and I don't think there were all that many easy levels.",3.0
"This is not a five-star game, and it's far worse than Super Mario 64.  The camera tracking and hint system are both badly programmed.  But its major flaw is the overall game design.  Rare came up with a truckload of games and ideas, and then just put arbitrary decisions into the overall game to string them together.  There are tons of things to do, but if you don't beat the level bosses, you can't progress.  Rare should have designed all the mini games and boss levels so that choosing another Kong character, or returning later on with more experience, would make the game easier.  They failed.  The hours you put into this game *let* you go further, but don't *help* you go further.
There's a lot to like, and after a few hours climbing the learning curve you'll have twenty-plus hours of fun wandering around.  But completing the game is an exercise in frustration, even with a game FAQ at hand.",3.0

"I must say, for multiplayer, this is another step in the right direction.  The fact that you can COMPLETELY customize the multiplayer options (unlike the preset options in Goldeneye) is a very nice feature adding a lot of replay value which is my favorite thing.  You can add up to 4 human players and 8 bots (computer-controlled opponents) to a multiplayer game for a whopping 12 people on the 64.  I really liked the shooting range idea and although it took me a lot of tries, I got gold medals on all of them.  But there is always something bad now isn't there?  One of the above mentioned disappointments is single-player mode.  Thank god for the bots because single-player mode is horrible.  The plot is uninteresting, the levels are quite long and monotonous, and the mission objectives don't have that Goldeneye ""007 Spy"" kinda feel.  I didn't even bother playing anything higher than agent after I beat the game on all the levels.  Keep in mind however, on Goldeneye, I beat EVERY level on 00 Agent and got all but two cheats on my own.  And to add to that, I had fun while doing it.  In Perfect Dark, I don't even want to TRY and get the cheats because I know I'll have to play single-player levels.  The other huge drawback is the multiplayer ""lag.""  If a group of bots surrounds you (2 or more) and everyone starts shooting automatics, the framerate is DRASTICALLY decreased, slowing the game down to a crawl.  The worst is when a bot/player starts using explosions...Just seeing an explosion will bog the game down.  You'll understand all of the lag when you play 8-bot games like me.  ....  Face it.  But Perfect Dark still manages to capture my creativity as I continue to come up with new multiplayer themes.  My favorite is probably the ""Matrix Remake"" on the Grid level.  Try slow motion with weapons like pistols, shotguns, automatics, etc etc (the stuff used in the movie, duh =)).  It really is fun and the Grid looks A LOT like that one lobby in the movie.  Anyways, all in all, I'd say this is one of the only 5 games to buy a 64 for.  I just think those two drawbacks are so major that the rating deserves -2 stars.  I still think everyone should buy this game, though.  Have fun.",3.0

I love F-Zero on the SNES and I was anxiously trying to get my hands on a copy of this version. And finally when I did I am very disappointed. the graphics are crap, the 3D polygons have no detail and the background is the same every time. Why can't there be a car that has all A+ categories, even if it's next to impossible to unlock, why couldn't they make the superior machine?

The race hardly goes fast enough. The only 2 tracks I did like where the ones with a tube pipe thing you drive on, like driving the outside of a tube, not the inside. And another track that had quite a few leaps and jumps... but over all, I still would rather be playing the original and best on the SNES. They should have included the SNES version on the 64 cartridge as a side game or something.

Overall:
Graphics: 3/10
Sound: 5/10
Controls: 9/10

This game might be better on multiplayer, but even a tho I have now unlocked every car and track up to the X round. I do have 30 days to return it if I don't want it, and I think I will be returning it. It's a rental game; tho you may not be able to rent them from too many places anymore, it makes me feel better that it will be out of my hair and I won't have it collecting dust rather then be going to someone else who might enjoy it more then I did.

I thought they would have learned from the SNES version, that the game needs a cheat for infinite turbo boosts... that doesn't require a game-shark.",3.0
"I'm not at all a fan of the first person shooter but I found it impossible to ignore the hype surrounding Perfect Dark. I never really got into the game, being an RPG gamer, probably the exact oppisite of this genre, and never found a reason to continue after the second level.

"You know when I sit here and think about it, does Mega Man 8 do *anything* right?  Oh sure I'm giving the game 3 stars because I'm such a big Mega Man fan and willing to defend even the worst moments of the series, but let's be honest- this game is mediocre the entire way through.  Not to mention gives the STRONG impression that Capcom tried to make too many changes and just about all of them fall flat on their face.

Let's talk about the levels.  Why does it seem like Capcom has done everything in their power to make sure these levels don't even remotely resemble the ones from the NES days?  I understand we're talking about a 32-bit system with the Playstation (and Saturn) so obviously the graphics will look significantly prettier than the ones from the NES and Super NES, but instead of running and gunning and strategically/excitedly shooting apart robot foes like most respectable Mega Man titles, this game implements too many unrelated ideas and thinks it's okay to pass them off as legitimate levels.  This is the same reason X5 failed so miserably.

Frost Man is all about riding a jetboard and jumping from section to section.  While I don't mind having most of the stage devoted to this particular feature, I do certainly mind when several levels in the game are devoted to similar ideas.  It makes me think Capcom didn't have enough creativity in mind when they made this game.  Also the game actually tells you when you jump or slide by stating it clearly ""jump jump"" or ""slide slide"".  I don't like being told what to do.  I didn't have to be told what to do in Mega Man 5 or Mega Man X4 while riding the bike.  Why do I have to be told now?  And this stage is entirely too long.  Hmmm maybe that's it.  Capcom felt an overlong jetboard riding level would wear thin on players and they thought it'd be too challenging for us so they made it so we're told when to jump or slide.  In other words Capcom knows they made the level too long!  In Tengu Man's stage, you're mostly riding on top of Rush Jet not by choice but mandatory to move forward, and battle several enemies at once.

This brings us to another problem- why are there so many enemies on screen at once?  It's nearly impossible to battle all this danger without taking several hits along the way since they all fire bullets in your direction.  This feature totally reminds me of the old NES game Gradius.  You can't really master these type of segments unless you have the patience to play the level a thousand times and memorize every enemy's location.  Anyway the first two Wily stages have more extended jet board or Rush Jet segments that hog up the level.  In terms of excitement overall the levels in MM8 fall way short compared to Mega Man 7 as hard as that is to believe (a game that was by no means perfect but better than MM8 by a longshot).

But it gets worse.  There's actually a circus stage called Clown Man, and oh boy is this stage a contender for the worst one to ever appear in a Mega Man game.  First of all you have trains that come out of the doors in the background moving on tracks.  When Mega Man appears on screen, get ready to battle them.  While incredibly silly for a concept and inappropriate for Mega Man, that's not even the main issue I have with this stage.  What I strongly dislike is the part that appears soon after where you have to wait for robots to ring bells so you can jump in the correct box that warps you to the next level up.  This is absolutely terrible and childish.

The music is really really bad.  Normally in a Mega Man game you hear catchy memorable melodies appropriate in illustrating the theme of a level.  Not so in this game.  This is all a bunch of fast-moving, unmelodic, indistinguishable techno gibberish that proves Capcom was more about making the levels look more futuristic than keeping the heart and soul of the Mega Man series in check.  Shameful move on Capcom's part.  Even worse, clearly the graphics are comparable to the ones in X4, X5 and X6 so Capcom had no desire to keep the two Mega Man series separate.

Okay this is another big issue I have with the game.  I almost never mention the voice acting since it's mostly tolerable and even irrelevant since I normally don't stop and think about it, but in this case I HAVE to mention it since it's unavoidable and overbearing.  I have to mention how much I strongly despise it.  Yes we all know that Mega Man shouldn't sound like a girl and yet he does.  However as it turns out *all* the voice acting in this game is really intolerable and way way off.  Dr. Light doesn't sound right at all.  I swear there were a few moments in the beginning when I thought he sounded like Mike Tyson!  However there's an even bigger problem than just the voices being unsuitable for each and every character.

The boss fights also have voices.  However Capcom didn't think this idea through because not only do they say really cheesy B movie-like lines before the fight begins and the moment before they explode, *while* they're getting hit they repeatedly say the SAME EXACT LINES OVER AND OVER.  This is really annoying.  Basically every time you hit them with a weapon, get ready to hear them speak.  I'd bet anything Capcom thought that making these bosses talk while taking damage would be more impactful and meaningful for action lovers, but it actually has a reverse effect on the player so it sounds incredibly cheesy and unforgivingly annoying instead.  Also let's not overlook that many of the voices sound like children speaking in an elementary school play, further annoying me with the perception that Mega Man is for children only. *rages*

Is there anything good?  Well sometimes a certain decent stage like Aqua Man might come along where you're swimming through the level avoiding enemies which is pretty fun.  Avoiding spikes while swimming in a bubble form reminds me of a certain level from Mega Man 5 where you have to avoid spikes while riding an elevator.  I have to chuckle at the way they gave Mega Man a swimming animation though.  I've never seen it before!  The Gravity Man stage is alright though sometimes generic with all the block-destroying segments that reminds me of X2.  Astro Man's stage is deplorable due to being too elaborate and maze-like which is WAY off track for a Mega Man game.  The boss fights themselves are often times slow and resemble the ones from X4, but they're passable I suppose in both design and the moves they have.  The only annoying part with the bosses is that it takes an eternity for weak points to be exposed, making these fights longer than they need to be.  Oh and what's up with the soccer ball kicking weapon.  A tribute to Mega Man soccer perhaps?  Some tricky kicking techniques are a requirement to effectively eliminate some of the bosses which is a nice feature.

Wily is boring and mostly easy this time around.  Then again compared to his second round MM7 battle, *anything's* easy in comparison, haha!  Weapons are a joke.  Completely uncreative.  Again the amount of foes on screen at any given time often comes across as disappointingly hectic without any time to catch your breath which means taking hits is most certainly a given.  These are mostly problems in the jetboard and Rush Jet stages.  Some of the enemies that I initially hated are actually okay now due to the realization that the game has so many other problems.  The robotic worms, spinning penguins, rock chucking apes (they're probably not apes but remind me of them), pearl spitting clams and several others are fun to battle.

Overall Mega Man 8 is a disappointment.  I now realize why my high school friend Kevin quickly moved on from this game despite being a huge Mega Man fan.  He had the Saturn version.  He wasn't happy with the game, and neither am I.  This was the only game he was talking about for a couple weeks leading up to the day it arrived in his mailbox.  Then after he went through the game, he pretty much dismissed it and barely spoke of it again.  I say avoid this one.",3.0
"Okay, perfect dark has the greatest graphics this machine has ever seen, and it's without doubt the greatest game on 64... if you haven't played goldeneye before. And lets face it who hasn't?

"Okay...now I'm not a fan of Mega Man, and I have only played this Mega Man, which I recieved as a Christmas present 2 years ago.

Anyways, I played this 4 times....out of the two years I've had it, and my 4th time was the day before the rummage (which was two days ago)...my advice is that if you like cartoons, then this is for you. Nothing but cartoon humor, cartoon mischief, cartoon talking, cartoon bubbles...THE WHOLE GAME IS A CARTOON! I guess if you have liked MM for awhile, MM8 would be good for you, but not for the average gamer. If I had to rate this at an age scale, I would say it is from ages 6-10. My lil step bro likes it, and he begged me to play it and he did, (even though he totally ... as it)...i watched him play it, and it was a cartoon. The only cool part was the TV-like anime at the beginning. I have the Collectors Edition, and there are only 10,000 ever pressed. I collect things, but this, I must say, even though there is a limited number, and they are no longer making this, ...I have to sell it. I won't ever play it, and I wouldnt ever spend the money to put this in a plaque cuz it just isn't worth the money.
So, to wrap it up...If you've liked Mega Man, or you're intrested in the Mega Man legacy...or, for that matter, if you like cartoons, then this is for you...and yes, agreeing with one person that said this earlier...Mega Man sounds like his little sister.",3.0

"Contra from Konami was the premiere side scrollin' shooting game of the late 80's and early 90's. It was both on the 8-bit NES and both 16-bit game consoles, and it reigned supreme. In this Playstation version, Konami changed the gameplay a little too much to keep it viable in the shooter market.  Contra's graphics aren't bad. In fact, the polygon environment is a great improvement over the old shooter genre. But, the characters are still bitmaps, and with the top down perspective they look squished and silly. All of the guns and battlements are made of polygons, have fluid movement, and are all around 'perty. But most of the enemies, power-ups, and items are bitmaps. This mix of graphics formats just doesn't fit well in Contra's case and shouldn't have been used, Konami should have stuck with one or the other. There are four different characters you can choose for your adventures. Ray and Tasha are humans. Also included is CD-228 and Bubba, a robot and a alien respectively. Each has a total of four weapons, and these weapons are different depending on which character you choose. Other than that, there are no differences. Konami should have included some different attributes for each character, for instance: Ray can jump higher, but Tasha is faster. Disappointingly, there are only six gun totin' levels. Although they are fairly large, you can run through the first two in about 5 minutes. Some of the deeper levels have some cool features, including a boat that you can drive around. In the second level, there is a ""jungle arcade"" that has two arcade machines with some old cheesy 80's games on them. Just walk up to them and it inserts the quarter for you! Get ready to play either Gyruss or Pactank. These little details and features are the ones that can really make a game stand out, but there just weren't enough of them in Contra. Throughout the game there are various big bad bosses that attack you. Most, if not all, of them are made of polygons, and they all have fluid motion and look great. Again, if they had made all of the characters polygonal, Contra would have been a much better game. But, then again, sometimes the game has some bad slowdown. When surrounded by tons of enemies, the game lost about 10 frames a second. Konami is trying to push the Playstation too hard in Contra and the slowdowns are annoying because of it. The sound is very good and the music follows suit. All the machine gun and laser fire sounds are 'realistic' (or at least sound good), and the ambient sound adds to the environment too. Even though the music is typical to a shooter, it's still enough to keep you going through the level. The game is really easy to control. Contra doesn't suffer any inconsistencies when slammin' buttons on the controller and it really shows as you go through the game. There is also a ""strafe"" button that allows you to side-step left and right. This is really useful while heading up in a level, you can just step side to side and keep firing instead of turning all around the place. Konami made it complex enough for advanced players and simple enough for everyone else. You also get some cheesy 3d glasses with the game. Turn on 3d mode in the game, but on the blue and red glasses, and get ready for a headache. There is some slight depth perception at the expense of all the color, and a flickering screen. It just a worthless gimmick. There was no point in including it, except for fancy packaging... I mean, who couldn't pass up 3d glasses!?
Contra is a decent game, but it's nothing like its 16-bit predecessors. If you want some real Contra action, just pull out your SNES or Genesis.",3.0

Another great part about this game is that there is an actual scale of challenge, which makes it anywhere from easy for a beginner - to difficult for a master gamer. The only disappointing thing is that the original fighters are better than the four new ones.",3.0

"Killer Instinct Gold follows in the first's footsteps by being a port of an arcade game on a Nintendo system. This time, being on the Nintendo (Ultra) 64. Seems promising. Hmm, even including a small batch of new characters, nice! At the risk of... losing Cindeeeeeeeeeeeeer. I mean, don't get me wrong, new characters are nice, but these new ones have no personality traits, nothing that sets them apart, really. And THEY AXED CINDEEEEEEEEEEEEER. A contender for one of the bet fighting game characters of ALL TIME! At least they still have Glacius, Fulgore, and Spinal. Right off the bat, the first fight with Saberwulf is a feeling of slight nostalgia. Over the first game. But this is all gone as soon as I realize, how slow this game is in comparison to the extremely fast-paced first game. There's still a 90-second timer, but you won't see fast combos very often, and when they do, they won't be pulled off by the NPCs, that's for sure. As a dedicated port to the arcade version, it stands as being better than the first's port, technically. But in terms of fun for me, good 'ol SNES Cineeeeeeeeeeeer will always be where my love is for this series.",3.0

"This game was obviously created quickly for the N64. It has good potential, but was not used in the creation. The best part of the game is the options. You can choose your truck, track and purchase items to  ""beef"" up your truck. I have to agree with other gamers who said  it was Cruis'n USA with dirt tracks and trucks. It has the same annoying  game control and graphics! I returned my Cruis'n just after I bought it. I  kept Off Road however. It is still somewhat fun to play just to see how  beefed up you can get you truck. Bottom line; If you are looking for a sim  type racer, don't waste your money! But if you want a racer that the whole  family can play(even little people)and have fun, this is not a bad game.",3.0
"A great N64 game in its own right although its a little too easy its still a fun game especially for kids. The game features a story mode which gives you the option of which levels to play and depending on how well you do you can unlock more levels in the next chapter, unlike traditional games where the level ends when you reach the goal the level only ends after you've eaten a certain amount of fruit. the game allows you to play as six colored yoshis as well as two special colored yoshis. Unfortunately as good as it is it still got a few faults for instance the story mode is way too short with only six chapters and two boss battles, though some of levels are super easy some of the latter levels are annoyingly difficult and the music can be incredibly annoying. While it's nowhere as good as Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story is still a pretty good N64 Game.",3.0
"My title says it all.  I bought this game back when it was released in 1998.  I was nine years old and thought the game was ridicuously easy, even back then.

I tried the demo twice and my system crashed twice.  I guess that has already explained everything.  How can I buy the full  version if I am not impressed with the demo?
Although the graphics and  sound effects are excellent, the game's stability is highly questionable.  I know that there are so many positive reviews for this game, but there are  several negative reviews too.  Before you spend $40+ for this game, I  recommend you to read the review on gamespot",3.0
"Okay. So back in 1996, the Nintendo already had Super Mario 64. The addition of the critically acclaimed Wave Race 64 made the Nintendo 64 even more promising over the then-somewhat-struggling PlayStation. Although it may be largely forgotten now after the relative failure of Wave Race: Blue Storm, Wave Race 64 opened to critical raves and is still a cornerstone of Nintendo 64 nostalgia for gamers.

But you know what? I think Wave Race 64 isn't really that fun! Is it a good game? Sure, it's a wonderful game when you talk about the technology relative to the time period. I mean, the graphics are phenomenal for 1996. The water is very nice, and so are the effects. The music is great. It has that soft jazz feel that appeals to people that don't work in IGN. The sound effects are pretty good, such as the ""blub"" sound when you hit a buoy. Heh. Blub. Blub. Blub. The announcer is just as annoying as the guy in Pokemon Stadium, but having that many voice samples in a game is something not even Super Mario 64 achieved. The guy just needs to tone down his enthusiasm. It sounds terribly hokey. And yeah. The game's physics are good, what with the waves and the water and stuff.

But you know? Aesop was right. If you are unable to succeed in something, then you are more likely to pass it off as irrelevant, or not worth it. The same thing applies for video games, and it is something I had discussed in many earlier takes. Games in which an individual sucks at are more likely to be labeled ""not fun"" by that individual. Well, guess what? I SUCK at Wave Race 64. I have never been able to get used to the wave physics, and I never remember specific controls. I do well enough in Normal mode, but every other mode pwns me. I was never into jet-skiing games anyways, so I am more apt to become discouraged, and I say that the game is not fun. It's a vicious cycle, and apparently the game is the victim. Oh well. I have other things to complain about. I can't do stunts, so I don't like stunt mode. (Gee. What a surprise.) And this game would have been PERFECT if it had 4-player mode.",3.0
"Not that often, video games can really be very strong at the sea. Most of the time, there often misplaced, or even forgotten. Just like most racing games, they all seem to be exactly the same like yesterday's newspaper. In the case of Wave Race, it is a little bit different than meets the eye. Since the late 80's, jet skis became a popular kind of sport at sea. Nevertheless, it continues to inspire some of the most interesting games ever.
Wave Race 64, was the very first racing game made for the Nintendo 64, in 1996. The game remains a classic, featuring over 8 different race courses by sea. The courses range from a simple pond, to a frozen course called Glacier Bay. As you win each cup, the races get increasingly difficult. Although the game lacks some value, with only four racers to choose from, it still remains a staple for any N64 gamer.
While many people stopped buying Nintendo 64 games for quite a long time, due to the Gamecube, and Playstation 2, it does run up a faster time than most video game that require CD-ROM technology. Get this one, and start wave running away.",3.0

Wave Race 64 is a great game. You get 8 courses, 4 players, create your custom jet ski, go into a championship, play againts your best friend.... and it's over. Wave Race is nothing special. I can't kill it too hard because it was one of the first games, but it's just too short. You can only have 2 players max. Only 1 player Championship which is 4 EASY tracks. The custom made boards arn't really custom, you just choose between 3 factors, and you can do 3 tricks! (Which, during racing, give you no bonus except if you don't complete the trick, making you fall in the water and get behind) This game get's old within 1 hour. It is not worth the price, I can guarrantee you.",3.0
"I'm a huge X-Files fan and therefore could not resist trying out the game.

"Excellent service.  I received the product right within the time frame estimated.

As for the game itself: the storyline is a little childish for my tastes, but the game-play itself was great.  I grew up with the platform games featuring Mario and Yoshi; and this game  reminded me of how much fun they were to play.",3.0
"I was so excited to play this game after I rented it from Blockbuster Video years ago. I played to death the awesome SNES title, ""Yoshi's Island: Super Mario World 2"" and thought Yoshi's Story would be like that game. As a matter of fact, many gamers thought so as well but once we all played through it, we realized that while it was good, it is nothing like the SNES classic. And along with a few other issues, Yoshi's Story is great for the kids to play but for everyone expecting a sequel to Yoshi's Island, it turned out to be bad.

Yoshi's Story was released in 1998 and was considered to be the spiritual successor to Yoshi's Island. Baby Bowser wrecks havoc in Yoshi's Island so you must defeat him to make everything alright. You control 8 different colored versions of Yoshi, the lovable dinosaur where for each stage you must search out different kinds of fruit. Find them all and you complete the stage and move on through the 24 stages that are available. The game ends when you die using all 8 colored Yoshis and you must restart the stage again. After you are done with the Story mode, there's a Trial Mode (see how much of a high score you can get) and a Practice Mode (it's basically one level where you practice all of Yoshi's moves.)

The PROS: This game looked real good. The graphics are smooth, sharp and bright. The music is very cheery and fits the overall mood in Yoshi's Story while the sound effects are exactly what you expect to hear in this light hearted title. The controls are responsive so getting used to how Yoshi moves will be very easy. It's perfect for parents who have kids that are starting to discover and play video games.

The CONS: Those who are looking for the deep, action platforming action and challenging game play that Yoshi's Island brought to the SNES will be deeply, deeply saddened by what they find here. This game is BRUTALLY easy and just as you start to get into it, it's over. Yoshi's Story has 24 stages compared to the 50 stages plus 10 bonus stages featured in the SNES classic. The only thing you do in Yoshi's Island is eat fruit. There is no rescuing Baby Mario, no magical vehicle transformations, no red coins to collect or any incentive to achieve the 100% complete rating at the end of each stage other than to move to the next stage. Don't bother trying to unlock extra stages, modes, etc. because there is nothing there to begin with.

It took me 1 day to beat this game and after two more days, it was time for me to return it. I was disappointed that it was such a short and easy game. If you're a fan of Yoshi's Island, don't buy this thinking it's the sequel. Get it cheap only because you have kids and want to keep them entertained.",3.0
"I played this so much when I was younger, I'm only 18 now, but I saw it on here and HAD to buy it. I basically went through the levels so fast, and kind of got bored, the game wasn't as interesting as I used to think it was. One thing is that I try going through it so fast that I end up falling in one place and get so frusterated I give up, but over all.. great game for kids or people who are easily entertained. I still play on occasion.",3.0
"When Yoshi's Story was first released, a lot of people immediately dismissed it as either an inferior version of Yoshi's Island or simply a colossal disappointment.  Nowadays it seems people generally think the graphics are too cutesy (and they are but Yoshi's Island was guilty of the same thing, as much as I love the game).  However, much to my surprise, the actual platforming elements in Yoshi's Story are better than I was expecting, and the fact the game sticks to 2D side scroller instead of going 3D like Super Mario 64 was a decision I agree with.  For a while I actually thought Yoshi's Story WAS a 3D game.

However, graphics aside, the game isn't *always* impressive.  A few of the levels are maze-like and they're pretty bland compared to the more straight forward levels.  It's because the platforms themselves are nothing particularly impressive- just your average platforms you've probably experienced since the NES days.  Jump on top of them, ride them, jump to next one, etc.  Not that I'm criticizing platforms I hope you understand or contradicting what I say in the opening paragraph- the idea just feels a little generic or perhaps undeveloped here.  Furthermore, these maze levels are lackluster compared to the more challenging ones from Yoshi's Island.  Feels too much like some of the maze stages here and trying to copy the special level from world 4 in Yoshi's Island with the water dripping inside what looks like a sewer.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that instead of collecting 10 red coins, 5 flowers and 30 stars which made Yoshi's Island gameplay so addicting and fun, now you're collecting fruit.  Grapes, watermelon, bananas, etc.  This is not only a rather childish objective, but not *nearly* as entertaining either.  Also, another big problem, perhaps an even bigger one- there's no flower ring at the end of each stage like in Yoshi's Island.  You can actually exit stages the moment you find enough fruit.  Really bad idea, because it means going through levels in search of fruit and nothing else, and when you find the amount you need for completion... the level could possibly end right then.  The sunburnt-looking flower in the top left corner of the screen jerking his face left to right the entire game is pretty funny though!

The boss fights are an absolute joke.  Similar to the one from Mario Is Missing.  Alright the ones here aren't quite *that* disappointing (if you've ever played Mario Is Missing though, at least the NES version, you'd know what I'm referring to!) but they are soooooo much easier than the Yoshi's Island boss fights.  Significantly less strategic as well.

Oh and yeah, we can't end a review without mentioning this issue as well- there's only 24 levels.  How many levels were there in Yoshi's Island?  48, plus 6 bonus levels (plus 6 more if you factor in the GameBoy advance version).  24 is too little!  Come on, the Nintendo 64 cartridges can handle more than that.  I remember how disappointing my classmates were in 1998 when this game came out and they played it.  They expected more levels.  I can't blame them.

Anyway, onto the positives.  Many of the Yoshi's Islands enemies make a return, and despite the levels being considerably less detailed as far as item-collecting and variety is concerned, most of the stages are at least loaded with plenty of enemies.  Even when the levels feel pretty basic and uninteresting in design, you can look forward to remembering the good ol' Yoshi's Island days with the same enemies, and now presented slightly bigger in size.  Plenty of new enemies too, such as Grim Reaper Shy Guy's, extended ghosts of many varieties that serve as odd short term platforms, and spike-tossing Lakitus.

Perhaps one could complain that the returning enemies should be different in some way instead of simply copy and pasting them from Yoshi's Island, and I would agree don't get me wrong, but it's not a big problem.  I like the gigantic-sized Mario eating fish that's not quite the same one from Super Mario Bros. 3, but the idea is exactly the same- he jumps out of the water and tries to eat Mario.  Yes it's hard just like it was in SMB3, but tons of fun!  He's like a huge red (or orange) Cheep Cheep and yeah, he doesn't like Mario too much, haha.

The music is actually much better than Yoshi's Island too.  Yoshi's Island had one particularly annoying theme that some of the sky stages would present (that I like to call Broadway theater music- ugh, so inappropriate for a Mario title) but the ones in Yoshi's Story are softer and more like lullabies, or tropical-themed but still totally tolerable.  There's even a Christmas-sounding theme used in the final levels.

This game is just not that bad.  Sure the platforming often times could have benefited by being less generic and obviously we expect more from Nintendo in that regard, and the maze levels are a needless and shameful way of making stages longer, but these problems aside, if you can find this game for cheap (and most likely that's impossible unless you can download it to your Wii or Wii U) then it's worth a few dollars and a few hours of entertainment.  Overall it's an easy game, even the later levels, and the appearance of the backgrounds may be rather baby-like, but remember Yoshi's Island has similar graphics and everyone considers that game a classic (including me, it *is* a classic!)  Check out Yoshi's Story.",3.0

"The first question hovering over Diddy Kong Racing is:  is it better than Mario Kart?  Well yes and no.  Mario Kart was virtually useless for any single player; Diddy Kong has a superb single player mode that will keep you busy for months.  However, Diddy Kong is let down by a less successful multi-player mode.  It's hard to pinpoint why this is so but all I know is that if I have a few friends around for a game, it is Mario that fits into the console.
Perhaps it is because Mario had more original power-ups.  In Diddy Kong, you get different strength speed ups or different strength fire-meters.  It is below-par when compared to Mario's lightning, star-boost, turbos, etc.  power-ups.
The strength of Diddy-Kong is with its triumphant single-player.  Sure, the arguments about its repetitiveness are correct but the courses that you have to repeat are spectacular.  You fly, hover, or drive through the courses but the pinnacle of the game comes when you have to face the bosses.  They're not easy, but they're not overly difficult.  In fact, the game-makers hit got the difficult setting just right.
To be fair, I got sick of the game after I thought I finished only to find myself up in space.  I can only take so many anti-climaxes before my interest collapses.  Otherwise, though the game did keep me occupied and I was glad that I purchased it.  Another winner for Nintendo.",3.0

It is so fun! The first level where you have to defend Hoth in a snow speeder against imperial machines is the best level on any game. The rest of the game is pretty tough, but well worth it when you receive your jet pack. Even as old as this game is, running down the narrow edges over the deep canyons still makes my stomach flip. It is pretty tough looking around, and you cant compare it to modern games, but for a game that is this old, its pretty bad ass. This game is way before its time.

"The Good: Great graphics, good sense of humor, torturing enemies is fun

The Bad: Unforgiving difficulty, collecting lives is impossible

Wild 9 is developed by those wonderful guys as Shiny who made Earth Worm Jim and MDK. First off, forget the story. The whole story is told in a three pages in the booklet. You play this kid who has this thing on his arm and it releases this energy that can grab enemies and smack them around. You're actually supposed to torture enemies such as throwing them in giant grinders, spike pits etc. You also have to sometimes throw them in a spike pit and use them as stepping-stones, it's very funny.

The graphics are really good for a PS1 game with bright colors, and smooth textures. You can collect coins for extra life, but I found this impossible. There are 99 in each level and you have to get every single one to get another life. So, if you run out of lives you'll be restarting the level constantly. The game is very unforgiving, but if you're good at these games you won't mind. The game controls very well and isn't slippery, unresponsive for slow. Everything is quick and simple. So, if you want a good platformer for your PSP or your PS2, or hey! Even your PS3 pick up Wild 9.",3.0

If you manage to get past the sandcrawler stage, you're in for a very fun game, particularly when you're allowed to choose characters- Luke, Han or Chewie. Perversely, that Sandcrawler stage is the hardest in the game- and it's the 4th level! I recommend this game for the patient, skilled gamer.",3.0
"This features a totally different button configuration that people were used to with Street Fighter 2 games. It also offers some very intense fighting with blood, bone breaking moves and a single fatality for each of the seven kombatants. You play as Liu Kang, Sub Zero, Scorpion, Sonya Blade, Kano, Rayden and Johnny Cage, and fight your way up through a ladder tournament. Eventually fighting in a handicapped match against two people (one after the other), and working your way to the boss Shang Tsung who can take the form of anyone! However infront of Tsung awaits the four armed 8 foot tall bodyguard known as Goro, who is the biggest challenge of the game. Good luck! A huge downfall of the game for the SNES and Sega is that there are no fatalities, instead you need a special code to enable them.",3.0
"Mortal Kombat was released in arcades in 1992. The game feautured digitized actors as the fighters, realistic fighting, bloody moves and outrageous finishing moves. Unfortunately when Nintendo allowed Acclaim to release a SNES version of the game, they forced the release of a ""softer"" version of the game. The blood was removed and the fatalities were down-graded. As a result Nintendo suffered big losses in game sales compared to the Genesis version, which included everything from the arcade. Whatever the case, along with Street Fighter II and Virtua Fighter, Mortal Kombat is considered a landmark in the history of fighting games.
Graphics and sound-wise, the SNES version is the best home conversion available. It manages to duplicate almost every animation and background detail from the arcade. The fighters look big and very realistic and have fluid animation. The sound effects are good and the music sounds like something out of an old kung fu movie, which is nice. It creates a true oriental atmosphere.
Controls are a bit harder to stomach. Although the special moves are a breeze to perform, the simple actions such as walking and jumping don't respond like you would want them too. It makes the fighters feel a bit awkward and down-to-earth, literally. If you get Rayden crouching in a corner, just go near him and start punching low. He won't be able to get out of that situation! That's not good for the game, balance-wise.
There are seven fighters who are Johnny Cage, Kano, Rayden, Liu Kang, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Sonya Blade. A few of them look quite different from their newer incarnations. The hidden fighter is Reptile, and the bosses are Goro and Shang Tsung. A very old Shang Tsung, I might add. You see, this was before Shao Kahn restored his youth... Each kombatant has one fatality, which is a tamer version of its arcade counterpart. For example, Johnny Cage's decapitating uppercut is replaced with a weird ""spear kick"". The blood has become dust. Yes, I said dust.
While this game is not as exciting as MK2 and MK3 (mainly due to the limited number of moves), it can still hold its own as a solid, realistic SNES fighting game. SNES owners looking for a worthwhile game to play for their now-dead system should buy this, especially if you are a MK fan. If not, I'd suggest you spend the money on Street Fighter II or SF2 Turbo.",3.0

"When Killer Instinct became a smash hit on the Super NES, it seemed inevitable that a stripped down conversion would come to the GameBoy.  This portable version of Killer Instinct is missing a fighter or two, but the graphics and overall gameplay remain remarkably faithful to it's arcade and 16-bit counterpart.  The two button control scheme makes the crazy multi-hit combos easier than ever before to pull off, but special moves themselves can be a pain to do.  Not to mention due to the fact this is a game for the original black and white GameBoy the graphics are very hard to see, especially if the background arena is dark.  Some of this can be corrected thanks to a lighting option offered in the game's option screen, but problems still persist.  All in all, Killer Instinct may not be the same great fighter it was in the arcades and on home systems, but it is one of the better original GameBoy fighters available.",3.0
PRODUCT WAS KEPT WELL. IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THE DESCRIPTION SAID IT WOULD BE. ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER,3.0
When this game first came out i did not have a snes so i had to watch my friend down the road play it and i never got to spoiled. Well its about 20 years later and i am about to beat it and am pretty disappointed. The game is way to easy I played it for like one week at nights and Im already to Gannon. I played the first one right before link to the past and it took much longer and was much more satisfying exploring and beating the dungeons even though graphically inferior. A link to the past is a beautiful looking and sounding snes game but there just not enough to explore and its to easy especially the puzzles so easy. I cant believe im done with the game I pretty much don't even feel like going ahead and finishing off gannon. I would recommend links awakening on the gameboy and gameboy color way better game in every aspect its how link to the past should have ben.,3.0

"Like most others who might've already discovered, this Nintendo 64 - video game is pretty much for kids (ages 4 to 10). But that doesn't necessarily mean that (m)any adults couldn't get a certain amount of enjoyment out of it. The player(s) have a chance to race on several different tracks - like a dinosaur valley, an ice track, a volcano island, etc. Have to admit that the graphics to the kid's game is really quite good - at least I thought so. Can easily switch over to this game to kill - say maybe thirty minutes.",3.0
if you ever thought of buying this game don't its confusing hard stupid has bad grafics stupid characters and really just stinks i just gave it three stars because #1 i felt sorry for it and #2 it has one cool course but if you want a better game get mario cart its so much better its almost like a gamecube game its so good buy mario cart instead,3.0
"This is hand down one of the coolest games for super nintendo- and one of the most advanced for its time. Theres a lot of options; many more than you would get in other earlier games. I have to say one thing: do NOT order this or anything else from Digital Future. I'd just write some bad feedback but I cant, considering they haven't shipped it yet (its been over two weeks), cancelled it, OR even emailed me back. Useless seller.",3.0
"Diddy Kong Racing is an awesome concept: an adventure game mixed with a racing game. Throw in some cute characters, cool bosses, three different vehicles, huge racing courses and some sweet secrets and you've got yourself an awesome game, right? Well...yes and no.
I loved this game when I was a kid. Diddy Kong Racing was the first game I bought for the N64 (in fact, it was the reason I purchased an N64). I played this non-stop then, beating the entire game, unlocking all the secrets, then beating the whole game again. Then I moved onto different games, and DKR fell by the wayside.
So, a few days ago, I decided to pop it in, for the nostalgia factor (and also to see if it was still any fun). I started a new game, and found the first track. So far, I was having fun, probably due to the nostalgia, but so far so good. Then I got into my first race. I was greeted by horrible controls- it felt like my character was sliding along on ice. I managed to finish the race in first place, soundly beating my CPU opponents, even with the controls. I thought to myself ""This isn't how I remember DKR...maybe I'll play some more."" So, I play for a few more hours, beating the world and the level boss. The controls have gotten slightly better, but are still very loose. The cheesy music is grating on my nerves, as are the annoying super-cutesy characters. I finally turn the game off, deciding too let my fond memories of the game remain intact.
In 1997, Diddy Kong Racing was revolutionary. Today, it stands as a failed idea. Still, I hope that some developer can take the basic idea of DKR and craft a decent kart racer around it. I really like the adventure game aspects of DKR; but the poor multiplayer and the loose controls are huge turn-offs. Ultimately, you'd be better off buying Mario Kart 64 if you need a racing game for your N64. I give DKR points for originality; it's just that the execution is way off the mark.",3.0

"This version of Mortal Kombat was a complete letdown to most fans,because of it's lack of blood and gore. That's not the only bad thing that this port had going for it. The gameplay was just awful! The character movements were very slow and could be very choppy. The Genesis version had SO much better gameplay compared to this. Most of the fatalities were changed to less graphic ""finishing bonuses"".Alot of the die hard MK fans were really pissed off about that too. Although I DID think that Sub-Zero's and Raiden's ""Finishing Bonuses"" WERE pretty cool. The two best things that this game has to offer are great graphics and really good sound/music. All the animations are here too. Everything from the floating clouds in the background's sky,to Shang Tsung clapping his hands,after a round is over. All the sounds are also included,that the Genesis version did not have. Overall...this is an okay version,if you can ignore the lack of blood n gore,the censored fatalities and the bad gameplay. If not,then stay with Genesis.",3.0
"Is that pretty much the entire game was based of the movie ""Bloodsport"" with Jean Claude Van Damme. And as you may know, they filmed actual people to do the moves in the game to give it a realistic look, well they originally wanted Jean Claude to be Johny Cage. You may have noticed Johny Cage wearing the exact same outfit as Van Damme did in the movie, and also having the same moves, mainly the splits nut shot. Anyways, Van Damme turned the role down due to other obligations, but I found it very interesting anyways.

The arcade game was insane, I can remember the massive lines at the arcades to play it. You would have to wait a good 30 mins to get your turn, and if you knew the fatalities, you were golden. I only knew sub zeros, which was my favorite so i was fine with that. The gore was so awesome back then, it hadnt been done before so you can imagine the frenzy.

Unfortunatley, the SNES screwed us all over and censored the best aspect of the game. Imagine buying this expecting something you know to be awesome, only to see everything you love about something to be completly changed. Lets be honest, the actual fighting in Mortal Kombat is not really good. Its not fast paced and does not require much use of tactics. Street Fighter had it beat in that department. What it had going for it was the graphics and extreme gore. Take away the gore, and at least half the game is in the toilet.",3.0
I played this as a kid when I was four and five. I got it for my son who is 4 and learned really quick this was way too complicated for him to play. I tried it out and was horrible. I was much better at this as a kid and I was floored by how much harder it was for me to play,3.0
"I cannot help but have mixed feelings about this game. It can get quite easy for new players to be confused by both the plotline(s), as well as what to do next.

The game doesnt save so its a bit deflating.,3.0
"Mortal Kombat, back in 1991, dominated the arcade scene and gave Street Fighter II a run for its money. So when news broke that it was coming out for the SNES and Genesis consoles, everyone rejoiced and the bragging rights for best version of this game was up for grabs. When the dust cleared, it was obvious each version had its pros and cons.

For the SNES this was, for the most part, a faithful port of the arcade game. It had all the stages and the ""Test Your Might"" mini-games, the original music, the original characters plus the secret character and the end boss, Shang Tsung. The graphics were crisp and clear while the music sounded just like in the arcade game; controls were easy to get used like in the arcade game. However, the game came heavily censored; the blood was changed to look like sweat. Some of the fatalities were toned down considerably and replaced with ""non violent"" finishing moves (Kano, Sub Zero, Johnny Cage and Raiden.) They even went as far as to make sure you could not send anyone through the spikes at one stage that takes place on top of a bridge when you wanted to fulfill the requirement to fight the secret character, Reptile. The controls, while easy to get used to, were slightly changed from the arcade game and some of the basic moves were taken out entirely.

So it was a major gamble for Nintendo that didn't pay off; the Genesis version, while regarded as inferior to the SNES version because of its fuzzy graphics and featured different music for the stages, had the gore and fatalities available as long as you entered a secret code. Sales wise, it beat out the SNES version as punishment for the backlash against Nintendo's family friendly policy.

Pick this one up only for nostalgic reasons as Mortal Kombat II, is the sequel and better game and it came out fully uncensored.",3.0
"I must admit I have never been a huge Mortal Kombat fan, I obtained this game from my brother not working when he was moving.  I got it working and played it at bit to my surprise no blood!  I personally could care less about this because honestly I never cared about the gore factor anyway.  Aside from that and I know for some this is a major buzz kill, the game looks great and moves are easy to pull off just like another reviewer said.  However two major down flaws your character's walks and jumps aren't very fluent.  Also it seems kind of slow I remember this game being a bit faster, the game looks wise is amazing however (given the time context and the original arcade version).  To be honest tho I remember this game in the arcades and not being a fan really I say this one is the best.  I have 2 and 3 on an arcade classic pack for Gamecube and the controls are pretty bad as well and the matches end fast.  So all and all if you have the patients for this game and you don't mind the no blood and some what shoty movements you will want this game.  As for me I mark it as just your average fighting game for it's time.  I would suggest over this game Street Fighter Turbo!",3.0

"This seems to be one of those games that people either hate or love, and personally I'm on the ""love"" team.
It definitely has its downfalls; the dialogue is shoddy, and some of the plots are very lacking, but I really love the concept. Seven different storylines to choose from, seven different characters to play as, and any of their storylines can cross over at any point. I also enjoyed all the different worlds you can travel to, and monsters you can battle.

The different character types were also very cool.
You had your garden-variety humans; mechs or robots; mystics, which have the ability to learn special magics; monsters, which can absorb enemy abilities and forms; and there were a few cross-breeds and special characters as well.

There were certain places and quests that were specific to a storyline, but there were also quests that you could choose to partake in with almost every character. The rewards were gaining certain magical abilities, or special weapons, etc. to help you in the game.
There was also an interesting battle system that allows you to create combos of certain abilities, which do a greater amount of damage and can lead to certain super abilities; they're hard to predict and perfect, but so far I've found they're only essential to one storyline, which is that of the monster Riki.

To sum up, SaGa Frontier may be far from the best game ever created, but it is unique and has provided me with hours and hours of enjoyable gameplay.",3.0
"Another one of square softs RPG but certainly not one of there best. On the other hand it is quite challenging and most certainly long.
You have your choice of 7 differn't characters with 7 differn't stories. Red, Blue, Asellus, Riki, Tz60G, Lute and Emelia. Varying from mage, to robot and even a couple of just plain fighters.  Each one has its own storyline and missions, with its own ending.
PROS: Graphics and music go together nicely, Challenging and interesting storylines. One of its strongest points is the combo's your characters can do. As you select which tactic of battle you want each member of your party to do it can create combos that can inflict serious amounts of damage. Saving anyplace is one of the best things about this game!
CONS: With over 140 hours of game play it gets very repeditive. Granted each character has differn't story lines, most end up taking the same quests.  A bit on the dull side after you have beat a few of the heros.
In a nutshell this is a good game. Certainly one that I recomend you beat one character or even two, then put it away for a while so you don't become sick of it.",3.0
Dk country 3 is an ok platformer; but is nowhere neer as good as one or two. The worst part is the characters. For a seires called donkey Kong county; why is he only playable in one friggin game.

"See, the Problem with this game is the choppy frame rate, the less then average graphics, and the poorly control system.

Overall, this game was a shameful port but not completely terrible, it goes for about 5 bucks so its worth the money. but if you have 5 more dollars pick up Daytona USA CCE.",3.0
"Even to this day DAYTONA USA is my favorite Arcade game. It's still even found in arcades around the world ten years or so after it was released. The arcade may only have 3 tracks to choose from, but it is it's multi player compedativeness that has given it it's awsome fun.

But bringing this game to the PC and Satrun did not bring the fun factor with it. It was pretty much the same game. There was a horse you could get if you won all races in a row (the arcade you actualy got a FWD type of car!) but the fun factow with the PC and Saturn versions where not there. The saturn version was only 2 players if you could hook it up to another Saturn.. and the PC version I think had a network game you could go to using the net, but I never tried it.

It was too hard to control the cars with joypads, and even using a steerwheel joypad if you had one didn't make it anywhere near as much fun as the Arcade.",3.0

That's good news because she can still whack enemies with her hair and glide like a helicopter.

"Well this is a very old game, that was released for the PSone system. It was re-released, on another console. As one of the first games in the series, it did a good job. It is nearly impossible to find in any store now. Used or new.

Gameplay: This game is a lot like Tales of Phantasia. It's a linear battle system with small sprites running around, attacking with swords or magic. There is not just one mage or sword wielder in this game. The style is that of all the other games, just earlier. If that makes any sense.

Graphics: Not bad for an old PS game, it was awesome in its' time. Now though, it would not go very far, as it has pixels, and not awe-inspiring graphics.

Characters: The characters were cute. Not as good as later Tales game characters. These characters could not talk, but they had talking swords, which was pretty cool.

Storyline: Basically, like all RPG and all Tales series games. Save the world scenario. Which, for some odd enough reason, never seems to grow old. The characters each have their own story and backgrounds, so it is cool to look into them. If you want to purchase this game, I would suggest to buy the remake if at all possible.",3.0
"I bought this game solely because it is Star Wars, because I am a big SW fan, and I would really only recommend this game for other SW fans.

Graphics are really bad, but that is a little expected for such an outdated system.  If you bear in mind how old this game is, then you can get past the disgusting looking stormtroopers and the similar looking levels.  I've seen screenshots from the PC version and they look much better, so if graphics are a big part of your enjoyment of a game, I would recommend the PC version instead.

Gameplay is very standard first person shooting, but there is an added facet of problem-solving.  There are many puzzles to solve in this game to advance through the levels, some diffucult enough for me to look up a walkthrough online.  I think that this kept the game interesting when the fun of shooting things wore off.  Most of the levels are very boring (slogging through stormptroopers, solving the occasional problem, etc.) but one I replay quite often, the third mission.  This mission is not for someone who likes the shooting aspect as there is lots of wandering through sewers, but it is quite fun to be scared out of your wits by a monster in the dark.  Bosses are usually difficult, which is either a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for.

The story is very straight forward.  Empire has new superweapon, you have to destroy it. That's about it all throughout the game, with an interlude with Jabba.

I would recommend this game to the serious/ mild SW fan.  It starts off a whole legacy about the main character, so it is important in this aspect, and there are a few entertaining parts.  If you are interested in the gaming aspect only, I would either rent it or skip it.",3.0
"As a first-person shooter enthusiast, I had high hopes for Dark Forces when I hear about it for the first time.

And as it may be a sin to compare it to Doom, because honestly and truthfully, this game is hardly what Doom is, I must say one thing....take Doom, send it through a meat grinder, out pops Dark Forces.

Everything in this game is ho-hum....half or less than half of what Doom gives the Playstation gamer.

It's not THAT disappointing....it's still very fun to play....but the whole game seems rushed. People forgot to add more than 3 colors to walls and background images, and the pixelization is unsurpassed. Stormtroopers and items laying about look like primitive Lego models. The soundtrack isn't all that bad, but could be better....the voices are really done well though.

The levels in the game are ok....I found myself getting lost on some of them though due to the fact everything looks the same because of the limited color palette....and even some areas I'm guessing are supposed to be covered in ""shadows"" are in all actuality, just black spaces with no graphics at all.

The weapons are typical Star Wars guns....nothing entirely special, but it is a fun selection.

If you're a Star Wars fan, and can get this game for 5 bucks or less, by all means, add it to your collection.

But if you're a first-person shooter junkie, look elsewhere for a top-quality shooter.

Overall, an average game, 5 out of 10, possibly 5.5.",3.0
"Ok.  This game came out in the mid 90's, but even for then, it's an average game.  Nothing stands out to make it a ""must have"" for the Star Wars fan and gamer.
Graphically, it's a step down from the old Doom days.  Characters are made of HUGE sprites--The closer you get, the more blocky they are.  Backgrounds/levels are huge, but poorly done.  Most levels are just plain boring and the colors are extremely dull looking.
The sound, out of everything, is fairly good.  Effects and voices are above that average level.  The music, though, is a disappointment.  This is a 32-bit game with an 8-bit soundtrack.  One thing in every Star Wars movie that's done well with pride is the music score.  All Star Wars games should be no different than the movies with the same score.  This game is one of those games where the music is just plain bad.
Fun value is on the average level, as well.  Where most everything is dull, the enjoyment of blasting Stormtroopers, Probe Droids, etc. is fun for every Star Wars fan.
If you enjoy first person shooters and the Star Wars movie series, then give it a try.  It's cheap money-wise, however, it's just that, as well (gameplay-wise)--cheap.",3.0

"Why the Yoda reference, you ask? Tolkien has absolutely nothing to do with Star Wars. However, Interplay's attempt at a Tolkien game seems to have suffered from the same problem as LucasArts' attempts at Star Wars games. Awesome concepts, wonderful stories to work with, but ruined by poor execution.
First off, this game does have wonderful graphics, especially considering that it was an SNES title. Some of the music is also amazing, capturing the mood of Tolkien's story perfectly, in my opinion. That title theme, and the song that plays in the Shire... excellent. The caves and dungeons are dark and eerie, just as they should be, and the forests are very lush and realistic. The sound of that wind blowing in the cave is simply chilling if you're really into the game.
Unfortunately though, there are some major flaws to this game which, in my opinion, make it unworthy of a purchase. For one, the multiplayer aspect is very poorly done. Like Secret of Mana, this is an action RPG with real-time battles. However, instead of being able to give instructions for the CPU to follow (like Mana's Action Grid), you must hold a button to guide their actions, which results in your controlling ALL of the allies at once--press Left for one person, and your entire party moves left, press Attack and everyone swings. Do not even consider relying on the CPU to guide them. They sometimes stand perfectly still and let an enemy attack them without even attempting to defend themselves. Or, even more often, they become utterly foolish and go wandering off alone into some odd parts of the woods. They are usually killed by an orc out there before you can find them.
That leads me to another flaw: characters cannot be revived. If someone falls in battle, they are gone permanently for the rest of the game. If Frodo falls, the game is over.
A third flaw is that the game, for some strange reason, uses a PASSWORD system instead of a battery save, with long and tedious passwords to boot. This is just completely impractical for an RPG.
Finally, there are two last things that really kill the game. One is that there is too much dungeon crawling--WAY too much. In fact, that is pretty much all you do for the entire game. The other is that there are too many odd events added to this game that are totally inconsistent with the book. This usually doesn't bother me too much, but this game just takes it way too far. They've made all sorts of completely unacceptable story twists, just to give an excuse for you go wandering into all these dungeons.
Ultimately, this game could have been an excellent addition to the Super Nintendo's already impressive list of RPGs, but it fails badly. I'd say stay away from this game, but get the soundtrack if one exists.",3.0
"This is to let everyone know that the game is priced at $63.00
I don't know if there are current updates, patches, or fixes.
I currently own Deep Space Nine The Fallen, and was given to me
by an old friend. The graphics and game engine were clumsy and
sluggish. The patches and fixes were hard to find, or the server
was down. I think a lot of good Star Trek games got rushed
assembled and crashed hard. I think Star Trek ran its course and
not as popular as it once was. Unless they made it a reality style
show? ;) I wasn't impressed with the story line of Voyager's Elite
Force. The Fallen did impress me with three different vantage points,
the way the game was put together disappointed me in performance.
Anyone else have better or worse commentary on this game?

"this game is old, ill give it that, but its still no where near as entertaining as its followup game, bloodlines, which is actually very fun and has a decent replay factor. This game engine, along with dynamics and over all suckage makes for a waste of money. even for a walking down video game memory lane.",3.0
"I am a huge fan of the pencil and paper RPG, and was very excited to see this conversion.  In the interests of simplifying the game (why would you want to I do not know), the creators modified the experience-point and atribute steps.  They have also included Diablo-style magic weapons and items, the effects of which are more subtle than those in Diablo, but somehow detract from the WoD mood.

In good news, the vampiric disciplines are converted almost flawlessly (except for why do Brujah have protean???), and in this aspect the game far surpasses its successor, Vampire the Masquerade bloodlines.

The game is split up somewhat unevenly between dungeon crawl-type sequences and dialogues that serve to advance a complicated and well-written story line.  You get relatively litle control of the dialogues and their outcomes, and as previously mentioned, combat is just a mess.  Party members unleash their most powerful disciplines on rats and spiders attacking them, and are constantly clamoring for blood.  This would have been resolved if there was a way to pause the combat and issue orders, instead of leaving everything to the piss-poor AI.

The new patch corrected the problems with save-games, but combat is poorly executed, and since it makes up 90% of this game, it can be very frustrating.  By the end I would just cast presence, draw the baddies one-by one, and drain them.  This is a repetitive and booring process, especially in the context of the well developed skill trees that the characters have.

The graphics definately stand the test of time, and are very creative in some ways.  Look closely in the silver mines: the texture of the walls is not just stone, but is actually evil faces staring back at you- very unusual and kind of creepy.  Its also quite fun viewing the world from first-person perspective.

With the ability to pause combat this game would have been great.  As such it is a fine product with much time and energy obviously invested into its development, but which is difficult to play and like, despite the engrossing story line.",3.0
"This game has a lot of good things going for it.

The graphics were really great for its time, and even now still look good...at least on the main characters.  The story, while not great, is still far above the average for a videogame.  The same can be said about the voice acting.

And probably most importantly, the game is *fun*.  Or at least it starts out that way.  By the time you get a 3-4 character party, the game's horrible AI and pathfinding are irritatingly obvious.

For starters, you have the choice between your allies sitting there doing nothing while you're in a fight, or them running off on their own through half the level in search of something to fight (and biting off more than they can chew and dying).  Babysitting them is extremely tedious, especially when you switch to control one from running off on his own, only to have another one do the exact same thing.

Pathfinding is awful.  Going around a corner and through a door and getting your entire party to go along is more difficult than any boss in the game (and some of them are fairly difficult).  On top of it, your allies will buff themselves with every spell they have (consuming blood...one of the resources you have to maintain at a decent level or suffer bad consequences/death) at the sight of so much as a rat.  There is an option to make it so they only auto-cast from a short list of spells (that you choose), but apparently the option is bugged and doesn't work.

In the end, I found it easier to go through a level with just one character. I left the rest behind, only using them to store equipment and for boss encounters.  That's how bad it is.

It's a shame because the character advancement system is very customizeable, and I would have liked to play the game multiple times to try things different each time.  However the annoying AI has sapped any replayability the game might have held.",3.0
"Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force is an fps with a great story driven single player gameplay and built on the fantastic quake III arena engine. It has a good storyline with perfect voice acting and a pretty good AI. I played it on the default opengl video mode and the game runs very smoothly. The graphics are fantastic, the xen like alien levels look very georgeous, sound recording is good. charecter animation are great, crew members look very life like. The level load times are good and save games do not eat up disk space. The length of ellite force is just right and it has a great multiplayer and single player tournament gameplay. The gameplay is good, but mostly you are playing with the AI team members and it is quite bad. The level design is good and there are lots of great puzzles to be solved, Action gameplay is slightly dissapointing as some of the levels are very linear and some of them are very difficult. I did not like the selection of weapons in ellite force, they are very badly done, their effects are very disspointing, almost all weapons just shoot a straight line of colored light. Star Trek Voyoger: Ellite Force is the best star wars based game ever made but i wish it was a little better as it is devoloped by raven software.",3.0
"If this were a review purely about content, then Redemption would get a well deserved 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the technical problems drag the entire game down.
The bad:
Horrible pathing!  Your party members block you all t he time and walls trap you sometimes.  In Neverwinter Nights, party members would just scoot out of the way when you needed to get by them.  In Redemption, you need to move around your party.  I can deal with that, except you're constantly put in scenarios where your 4 party group is traveling through a tight corridor, and needing to go backwards is a nightmare.  I finally gave up and switched control to the lagging member and used that character to move back.
In most other games I've played, you could just 'shove' characters other characters out of your way.  That's the best way about it, because when you're mid-fight, the last thing you want to do is reposition a stubborn party member who just won't get out of your way.  Absolutely abismal pathing in this game.
There's not much pizazz to the weapons and armor available, either.  Guns and ranged weapons are pretty useless in the game, and I've found sticking with the good old shield and sword works better.  Again, I blame the developers.
There is little to none available as far as support, and I've only found one patch so far.
The Good:
This game contains THE MOST engaging, engrossing and interesting plotlines I've seen in a game.  The story content is unparalleled.  You follow Cristof Romuald, a crusader knight of the dark ages who fights in the crusades.  He is wounded and nursed back to health in medeival Prague by the beautiful nun, Anezka.  You begin the game playing Cristof as a human, and you follow the character through his Embrace and change into vampiric state.
The game is based on White Wolf's 'Vampire: the Masquerade' and 'Vampire: the Dark Ages' tabletop RPG books.  The designers of Redemption did a good job of bringing WW's material into the game, and do so in a way that is pleasing to a V:tM fan yet still easy for a beginner to digest.  As the plot continues in the game, Christof's sire and friends explain to him about the vampire clans, vampire origins, etc. etc.  I had my doubts about getting this game because I doubted a game could do justice to WW's publications, but after playing it, you really can't help but enjoy the story.
Basically, you play Christof through the ages and travel through Prague, Vienna, London, and modern day New York.  He's basically on a path to redemption (thus the name of the game is Redemption), and depending on how humanely you act throughout the game, you may or may not receive redemption.  (A humanity score is kept.)
With the gaining of experience points, you can buy skill points, and with enough skill points (strength, dexterity, intelligence, charisma, etc.), you can buy discipline points.  That's where the real fun is at- the disciplines (vampire powers).
Multiplayer is ok.  I heard Redemption's multiplayer capabilities referred to as ""Neverwinter Nights Lite.""  There's not much by way of video-gaming you can do on multiplayer, but you can hold campaigns and assign a storyteller.  The storyteller holds GM powers and can access each player's advancement menu to grant exp, control players, speak through players, spawn items, and kill or revive players.  So if you'd like an alternative to tabletop and currently play V:tM, you can definitely check this out.
This game is definitely roleplay heavy, and they speak in Ye Olde English (at least Christof and Anezka do).  It's not to say it's corny, though.  They may say ""thee,"" ""thou,"" ""thy,"" and ""hath,"" but the dialogue and voice acting is *fantastic*.
Despite the (inexcusable) technical problems, Redemption offers the richest content and voice acting I've seen in a game.
I truly hope that game developers will pick up V:tM to base another game on, and hopefully, they'll do justice to all the fabulous content they put in it by making it sufficiently playable.
It's really worth picking up if you're like me and are more an RPG fan than a hack and slash powergamer.  If you want a game with a rich story, this one won't disappoint in that aspect.  But be warned of the pathing, lack of support, and other gameplay issues.",3.0
"This is an AWESOME game!! The graphics of course are old, this was from back in the day! But the concept is cool! A little repetitive but you also have to go through mazes and solve puzzles! I enjoyed it alot!!",3.0
"It's just typical.  That's the word of the day, it seems.  Typical.  Too many similar games available these days.  This means you really don't need to bother with most of them, and unfortunately, this is just another game you can skip over if you wish.

While the storyline is good, what you mainly do in Kings Field is walk around with a sword finding items hidden in treasure chests and... no, it's not Zelda.  It mine as well be, though.  Nah, it's not really a rip-off.  I don't know what it's supposed to be, but I think the game was a bit too heavy on finding important items.  It needed more action.",3.0
"A quick, fun little game that takes itself a little too seriously. It took me about six hours of playing time to finish this game. It is a fun, tame diversion that you will chew up and head back to the computer store for something new.
Here are my obsevations: The story is pure Star Trek. The voice acting is very good. There is not much difference between the many weapons you can use. There is health and ammo all over the place. The cinematics are long and boring. There is even one ""mission"" where you have to go to the lounge and hang around! Other characters are rude to you constantly. You are treated like some kind of dope until the very end when you (surprise) save the galaxy. You cannot kill other crew members. Even if you survive their counterattack, the game still ends with you in jail. There is a lot of waiting around on Voyager until the other crew members do what they need to do. Here is the main thing: I have an average system that well exceeds the system requirements of this game: 450mhz, 188megs, 32MB 3D card. This game takes forever to load and reload when you get killed. The sound skipped constantly. I followed all the tips on the website for making the game run smoother, even called their tech support, but nothing I could do would make the audio run right. Whenever there were more than 4 charaters in a scene, the whole thing slowed down so much I could barely play it. Buy it if-- 1. You're a die hard ST fan. 2. It's on sale.",3.0
"This game was so much fun during it's time.  Yeah this review is many years late, but still, very fun game.",3.0
"I just got done playing Duke Nukem: ""Land of the babes"" and noticed a few reviewers where saying that game was nowhere near as good as Time To Kill or the other title. So after enjoying Land of the Babes, I couldn't wait to get into this one and see what made it so much better? But to my disappointment... what the heck makes it any different or better????

This one here I say is pretty much the same game as Land of the Babes, apart from different stages and a few enemies, only a small amount of guns are different from the other title, but none the less, they could easily have both been part of the exact same game.

Now, I'm not bagging this game, don't get me wrong, but I think it's just as equal to Land of the Babes. Maybe this one stands out a little more because some stages resemble that of Zero Hour on the Nintendo 64, but lets be honest, Zero Hour is a far superior game on every level. Literally.

Maybe Time to Kill requires a bit more searching around to get through levels, that part may be a little bit harder, but in the end, I felt like I had played the same game twice, and was a little bored by the end of it. By the time I blew away the final boss, I expected the ending to be disappointing, and low and behold, possibly the most disappointing ending in Duke Nukem history.

Of coarse, maybe had I been playing this 10 years ago or around the time this game came out, maybe it might have seemed a lot better at the time... but no wait, Zero Hour was made too, and that game rocked my world... but this one here, euhhh, I can see why some might like it better than Land of the Babes, but it's only by a small fraction.

Overall, if you play another DN title on the PS1 before this, you may think either ""Ummm, this is the same game"" or ""Oh, goodie! More levels!"".",3.0
"Vampire really was almost a great game. Unfortunately, Activision killed it. Their support was almost non-existent, and ended far too soon. The game was released with some fairly serious and obnoxious 3d engine problems that cause characters to become irrevocably stuck in walls while the bad guys hammer away at you. As well, the AI that controls your allies is horrible. I cannot count the number of times my allies: blew me away with rocket launchers, fried me with flame throwers, or wated all of their ammo firing into a wall (yes, firing into a wall). What is sad and really aggrivates me is that this could have been such a cool game. If Activision had provided the level of continued support I have seen for games like Dungeon Keeper, or Diablo II, then I would still be playing Vampire. However, Activision just sort of hohummed it, and did not do a good job. The plot for the single player game is excellent, and the idea/implementation of the multi-player game is truly revolutionary. After this title, I don't think that I will ever buy another Activision title. It just makes me so angry that they ruined what could have been a very strong entry in the computerized RPG market. It also ticks me off that I played it for so long and finally had to just give up due to the frustration of dealing with thier poor AI and 3D engine. I give the game three stars due to the great vision from which it was obviously begot.",3.0
"This game is one of the good thriller's i've ever come across. It's a cooooool game with a good storyline but once the story ends the games over. I didn't feel like playing it more than once.
About the  problem people are having with the save game feature -all they have to do is press the ""Esc"" button on their keyboard and a box will appear asking them whether they wanna save their game or quit. So whenever u wanna save your game during game play at given time hit ""Esc"" on the keyboard and save your game, as soon as u do that u can continue with your game immediately. I didn't need to download any patches for the save game feature.
This game is a good buy. For those who haven't, try it.",3.0
"Awful AI, save and load problems, game interface is sometimes useless. I had expected much better from a Masquerade adaptation. The only positives are graphics and sounds, but not enough to save a boring game. Keep playing the pen and paper, and unless you are a world of darkness fanatic, spend your money for a better game!",3.0
"The Good: It was designed by Ravensoft (who have a lot of Id people on their team) and it's running off of the Q3 engine.  Graphically, it's gosh darn purty.  The lighting is superb and the architecture, creature designs, and weapon designs are all top-notch (as one would expect from Ravensoft). The only graphics niggle I have is that the mouths aren't made of polygons, but are synced bitmaps (of course, to date, Half-Life is the ONLY game to get that right).  The missions are, overall, interesting, with a nice mix between puzzle and action.  A lot of the missions include team members who are more than just grunts (many of the scripts work trigger individual members for individual tasks).  The puzzle missions are, for the most part, well designed and more interesting that the standard key-find quests that are typical to the genre.  The sound is very nice too, although I wish they had included explicit EAX support.  The one ""stealth"" mission, in particular, made good use of that.  Most of the weapons are quite interesting, with all of them featuring a secondary fire mode -- the default phasers, in particular, are very fun to use, I love beam weapons.  I especially liked the rationalization for the traditional FPS Bad o' Weapons: a portable replicator that you carry with you.  And finally, the Borg have that cool laser-eye thingie that's just oh-so-cool. :-)
The Bad: Well, it *is* Voyager.  For the most part, that didn't bother me, although the long (and uninterruptible) cinematics involving the REAL LIVE (tm) voices of various actors got on my nerves.  There's also a certain cloying PC-ness to the game that annoyed me, especially given that it IS, after all, an FPS.  The game's attempts to sanitize a massive kill-fest left me a bit woozy, at times.  The plot is also less than impressive, although (frankly) it was more interesting than most of the Voyager TV episodes I've seen, and it was more than adequate for a genre that is often allergic to the whole notion of plot.  There were certain points where the game suffered from ""What do I do now?"" syndrome, although nothing too bad (when it doubt, look for a tunnel to crawl into).  Likewise, on Voyager, the doors are unlabeled so one is often required to blunder around in the between mission phases.  On that note, some of the architecture is a bit ""crowded"".  This is especially true on Voyager where there are loads of fake doors that you can't enter (and I just HATE that in a game).  The game length is a bit short (but I've been spoiled by Half-Life, so take that with a grain of salt).  Finally, the great big bugaboo of most FPS's -- The AI: it sucked.  All too often, the game resorts to simply swarming you with enemies.  There were few cases where you couldn't even discern that there *was* any AI (although there were a couple of great skirmish sequences where the enemy actively sought refuge behind crates).  In terms of combat, much of the game resembles Doom.
Overall, I enjoyed it.  I'd recommend it if (like me) you're feeling a bit starved for a decent FPS.  Just don't blow any significant amount of money on it.",3.0
"I downloaded the 115 meg demo as soon as I found it was available, eager to discover if Activision had succussfully accomplished what I had  suspected about this title - the first good Star Trek game.  I believe from  playing the demo that they have finally done this, however, apart from the  ST genre, it's nothing new.  What it does have that UT and Q3A lack is a  single-player plot, which I think is the best part of ST:EF.  The borg are  very well done and the atmosphere in the small playable sliver of  single-player mode could not have been done better.  Cut scenes are done  within the game's engine rather than having been done by actors, which  keeps the game seamless.
There's really nothing here for non-Star Trek  fans, which is a real shame.  ST:EF has all the usual components:  Deathmatch, CTF, and team play (of which only deathmatch is playable in the  demo), but it doesn't introduce anything new.  This was one of UT's  strengths.  UT had several play modes that were new twists on the  well-established and tired deathmatch/ctf arena.
It has always amazed  me that the addictive spirit in the concept of Star Trek has never been  successfully reproduced in a game.  I'm still waiting for someone to  introduce one in which you can explore space, interact with people on the  ship, freely travel the ship and other locations.  Maybe if they ever make  a Star Trek EverQuest clone, this would be accomplished.
The real  downfall that annoys me most is the AI in the multiplayer mode.  I am a  HUGE fan of FPS and I have never seen bots move like the  computer-controlled players in this game.  Their movements are choppy,  random, and 3 times faster than any movement you can make yourself with  your character.  In Q3A or UT, an enemy might run down a hallway, stop,  look around or shoot, then turn and run some more.  In ST:EF, an enemy  would run down a hallway bobbing from left to right in erratic, super-fast  fashion making for a quick head-ache.
If I buy this game, I'll buy it  for the single-player mode which has me highly impressed.  However, I won't  rush to the stores as soon as it releases and once I have it, I won't be in  a hurry to introduce it in a LAN party.  After playing the demo for DS9:  the Fallen, however, I cannot wait for that one to release!",3.0
"Was looking for this Super nes game for an aunt that had a little extra time on her hands.

Well my aunt enjoyed the game anyways...",3.0
"I've never played Vampire in tabletop roleplay so I'm not quite sure how  true the game was to its predescessor. But it was still a very good  introduction to the system for me.  I learned about magic and lore and the  differences between a ghoul and a vampire and a human.
The main  character, Christof, was very interesting to play.  My first nervous twinge  about playing a vampire themes games was ""Ew... so I'm going to play a  bloodthirsty commando?"" but as I progressed through the chapters I  found that I was in control of my own destiny.  I could try to be kind and  just or I could be as  cruel a jerk as I wanted.
There were some  annoyances like the lack of saves and the utter confusion of combat and  lack of tactics (You pretty much just mobbed a monster with everything you  had and hoped it was enough) but I've heard that this will change soon with  a patch.
The game progresses from the days of the crusades to modern  times.  I didn't care much for the time jump (It would have been much  cooler to slowly progress through time to modern ages) but that might have  made the game ten times longer that it was, so that's just a small  gripe.
The characters of Christof, the holy knight turned Vampire, and  his love Anezka, whom he searches for out of guilt and out of love are  wonderfuly done and made the story more real.  The dialogue was well  written and made up for the messily done hack and slash fests one must take  to progress through each level.
Another really great feature is the  multiplayer capabilities.  One of the things that makes it so great is that  a person has the option to be a game master in an adventure and control  just about everything.  It's really great to be able to craft your own  games and so far this has been the first one I've ever seen with this  option instead of running Quake-like through a maze and killing everybody  in sight.
Overall there were some innovative options in this game and it  was well put together, just the combat was a little confusing at times and  the lack of saving points made it difficult.  Still, I think that the good  points outweigh the bad.",3.0
"The idea is sound enough:  Follow the life of a Vampire throughout the ages, in different parts of the world, battling different creatures of the  night.  If they had managed to make this game more suitable to a wider  audience of people with mediocre computers, it would have been a lot  better.  The Gameplay, equipment and character management are all  remeniscent of tried-and-true Diablo.  This is a good thing.  The bad thing  is that the large 3D areas you will encounter will leave the game very  choppy, even on Maximum installation. In short, I would recomend this game  to anyone who has a very high end computer, and enjoyes RPG games.  If your  like me with an average computer..I'd have second thoughts.
Pros: + In  depth story + Equipment and Character Management is good + Good  Cutscenes
Cons: - Game becomes very slow at times, even on my Pentium  Celeron 500 with 96 Megs RAM, with Voodoo 8 Meg Graphics Card - Giant  Resource Hog.. (1.25 GB for max install) - Combat is more than a little  mundane",3.0
"I would have gladly given this game 4 stars - without even trying the multiplayer side, which I hear is very awesome - if it wasn't for one great flaw.  I was almost 6 hours into the game, kicking vampire booty and taking  no prisoners.  Then, something happened.  With my usual grace I  accidentally clicked on the ""New Game"" button at the menu screen.  I thought it was little problem, and allowed it to accelerate me through  the first few cinema scenes.  I waited until it allowed me to control  Christof, then I opened up the menu to escape and load my old game.  Instead of seeing my old saved game, I saw ""Convent"".  Well,  needless to say I was very frustrated and angry, mostly at the absolutely  thoughtless save-game feature.  I still may try the single player game  again, but not anytime in the near future.",3.0
"Well, I've only played the game for the first few levels of single player, and toyed around with multi-player just a little bit.  So here's how I see it.
Pros:
1.  Graphics and sound are incredible.
2.  The game  ""feeling"" closely resembles the  pen and paper version
3.  It's a  good combo of RPG and hack -n- slash
4.  You don't need a ""super""  computer to play
5.  No real ""bugs"" so far (game crashes, lock ups, etc.  after playing for two days)
Cons:
1.  Player and AI (party members)  movement can be a hassle, because the have a tendency to run into walls and  such if you don't guide them through multiple obstacles.
2.  Not being  able to look up towards the ceiling can be a pain (sorry, I'm use to  Half-Life and Ultima views)
3.  Not being able to truly create a  character (single-player) takes away from the RPG feel of the game.
4.  The plot is linear, pulling you you toward the pre-set story line without  having to use your noggin to figure anthing out.
5.  The ""Save Game""  sucks, only allowing you to save in certain areas (your haven) or using the  Auto-Save when you enter new levels.
6.  Monster AI just sits there until  you get in range before they attack.  Using the `ole bait -n- hook, you can  lure one monster at a time to your waiting party members.
Despite the  Cons outweighing the Pros, I still give the game at least a 3.  As a true  RPG, it's lacking.  But as general hack -n- slash, it's awesome.
My  advice: If you're looking for an RPG, and have played anything from the  White Wolf collection, avoid the game.  If you're looking for a fun game,  with great graphics and sound, and a nice spooky feel to it, grab it quick.",3.0
"Okay, there is one thing indisputably spectacular about this game: the graphics. There's no arguing this fact, they're absolutely awesome with incredible cutscenes and very smooth performance--no jerking movements or  dialogue skipping. Transitions are seamless and the whole effect  compliments the game fantastically well, Nihilistic did not turn this into  a graphics symposium and you won't lose the plot in their  splendor.
Unfortunately, that's about the only really wonderful point  about the whole game. Don't get me wrong, I didn't find anything tragically  flawed about the experience, this -is- a very fun game, especially after  having played the pen-and-paper version for so long. There is a solid plot  behind the entire thing, and interesting dialogue (though it gets a bit  pathetic at times, and I bordered on wanting to slay Christof myself as he  bemoaned his fate and forbidden love.) But is the plot particularly  inspired? No. Is the roleplay that engrossing? No--though, to be fair, I've  yet to find a game that really lives up to the what roleplaying ought to  be. Is the combat exhilerating? Not in the slightest.
Most of my  complaints revolve around the mechanics of the game. If you're looking  solely for an action-oriented game, skip it. Though it might bear some  resemblence to Diablo in the way combat is visually represented,  disciplines (read ""spells"" to those unversed in the White Wolf  lexicon) are cumbersome and trying to use them in the middle of combat is  almost more dangerous than it is helpful. The player is faced with  exceptionally little creative opportunity in combat situations... just keep  clicking on the bad guy, and try to stay out of the way of your team so  they can join in too. I never felt my heart jump into my throat, or my  stomach shrivel to the size of an orange when faced with combat in this  game like I have in others--it's just not that exciting.
The soundtrack  is good, but repetitive. After about ten minutes in a new area, I was  pretty much over it.
So, what the heck am I saying? This really -is- a  fun game, but it doesn't live up to the hype (which may be making me overly  critical, but I don't think so.) Go ahead, buy it, play it, you'll have a  great time; but don't expect to stay up all night into the wee hours of the  morn slaying evil ghouls and denizens of the night.",3.0

The graphics are awesome and so is the  scrolling but there are areas the game could be improved...Your characters  seem to get in the way of each other, range weapons don't seem to 'snipe'  from a distance, characters like to do their own things.  That aside, I am  finding the game rather enjoyable.  If you like hack and slash type games  this is for you.  And keep the blood setting on! :)",3.0

"I bought this game from my local Gamers a few days ago, and while I have been spending more time on Super Mario 3 (from the SNES cartridge) I have spent a couple of days, off and on, playing Super Mario World.

It's a good game, all in all, with nicely done worlds (unlike Lost Levels) and well animated sprites. It has had some further advances made to it since Super Mario 3, such as a save point half way through each level, and more easy-to-beat levels. This can be a good thing, but I see it as a bad thing.

This game, in my book, is wayyyy to easy. For instance, if you get through a level, you get a 1-UP. If you kill a certain number of enemies you get a 1-UP. (This is very easy to do, and the chance comes along at least once or twice a level). If you save you get a 1-UP. There are little boxes, specially marked with a ""!"" that, if you hit, you get a Mushroom, a Fire Flower, a Leaf, or, you guessed it, a 1-UP!!

So, all in all, you get a chance to get a 1-UP at least three or four times a level. Which is way to easy.

Plus, the levels are designed so you can beat them in about a minute. There's no real challenge to the game. No real puzzles.

And, each level, you get a Yoshi. For those who are not experienced in the Mario Universe, a Yoshi is this dinosaur that you can ride around, and who will eat your enemies. So the entire game really ends up as you getting a pat on the back at every opportunity, and a dinosaur doing all your work for you. i played up till the second level, and I only died TWICE. Do you know how many times you usually die on SMB 3? At least ten times on a normal level. I beat the first level in 20 minutes and I wasn't trying. Case in point, extremely easy.

All you really do is hold a button in the direction you want to go, and press another button when you need to.

As with the music, it all seems to cheerful. When you die, it plays this sympathy music. Even when you enter the Boo Castles it only plays slightly scary music.

I give it a 3/5 for overall because it's gotta' get better. And a 3/5 for fun because of it's nice level design.

So if you scare easily, or like good graphics (which, I for one care not for, as I fall in with the more ""retro"" class), then you should get this.

But if you like a challenge and a more ""adult"" (I hate to use that, I sound patronizing, although it's true; this is a softer game), then go for Super Mario Bros. 3.

"I was disappointed by this game.  I found it pretty difficult, especially the ghost houses, which are annoying and take dozens of lives to get through.  Yoshi is adorable, especially when he eats the little fruits,  but he bolts if you get hit.  That's a drag since he is a main draw of the game, and he just can't wait to run away from you. (?)  I usually only play the first couple boards of this game, because they are the only ones that have a solid-ground type of 'feel', like classic Mario is supposed to. Even later in Worlds 1 and 2, the boards get way complex and lose that fun simplicity.
This one is better than Super Mario 3 (holy hell, that second world that is ALL water boards?!  Get ready to die a million times. Japanese Water Torture, that...)

So, it's worth trying out.  A lot of people like this game a lot and can actually pass it somehow, but personally I like the games where you can actually move up in them comfortably and not die forty times at every ghost house or water board or chasm-jumping board.

"As the first game in my SNES game collection, I had high hopes for it as I loved the movie it was based on. It uses a top down perspective while walking around the island and uses a 3D look a la Doom when exploring the various buildings and caves while offering you multiple weapons to use. It uses the likenesses of the dinosaurs and some of the main characters that appeared in the movie. The graphics, sounds and music are spot on and help you get into the game. It controls very easily and you get used to quickly. So why do I give this game 3 stars?

First off, this is a VERY LONG, exploratory and adventure game. The island is huge and you have to explore caves and buildings, which in its own, eats up a lot of time. Aside from figuring out which weapons to use against which dinosaurs, your memory skills will be tested as the game offers no hints as to which direction you should do or how to complete tasks. No map system is available while underground or in buildings so you'll get lost plenty of times. You start out with 5 lives and have infinite continues but no password or save system is available. If you intend to beat this game, you'll have to do it in one shot. After you finished all the objectives, you head back to the helipad. There, you get treated to the game's ending: the intro presentation of landing on the helipad when you first start playing....in reverse.

And that's it. It took me almost 4 hours to beat it and after seeing the game's ending, I was so disgusted that I went to my local game shop and sold it for some $$$. Bottom line: it's not worth it for the time and effort you spend on playing or beating this game.",3.0

  Sometimes the game will have you begging for a save point where you must successfully run from Scissorman several times before you can escape or find help.

  Overall, the game will probably satisfy people who enjoy thrillers and games like Resident Evil or Fatal Frame.  It is a race to find the critical clues.  However, it is a cursor-moving game.  You do not have free three-D movement as I thought you would.  Rather, you use a cursor for movement.

  It's not that bad a game.",3.0
"If you can find a copy of this game going cheap, by all means get it, as it's a great little shocker - but be prepared for some seriously lame graphics. And I do mean primitive. This was one of the earliest PS1 games, and it shows, which is a shame because the actual idea and concept are great. A crazed killer is on the loose with giant scissors and it's up to you to unravel the mystery and find out who he is and what he's up to.

There are plenty of good points to this game. One of them being that is really does present you with a mystery, and if you don't follow the clues provided, your investigation goes straight to a dead end and all your hard work ends up in a Game Over scene complete with credits that tells you that you have failed to solve the case. Quite brutal in a way, and daring, even, to treat the player so harshly. It happened to me, and I had no choice but to begin again and this time try and make some more well informed choices when given the chance. Once you get it right, the game takes you on the full journey to the climax of the story, which is well worth the effort.

So how is this story brought to life?...well, with the dreaded words ""point and click"". Yes, it's sad but true, the action in ""Clock Tower"" is completely mouse click operated, which means that you will be moving a cursor arrow around on screen with your D pad and clicking the X button when it's on hotspots to start action and make choices. For the WHOLE game. Be warned that if this sounds like something you have moved on from, you might want to think twice. However, then think a third time, because...hey, whaddya know, it works! The exploration, the combat, in fact all character movements and interactions are  done by clicking somewhere on the screen, and once you get the hang of it, you're away.

So let's get onto the gameplay. This is a game of fear and surprises. The villain of the piece, ""Scissorman"" can leap out at you at random points in the game and pursue you relentlessly until you either hide, run far enough away, or find something to stop him with. (Or get killed). Combat such as you may be used to does not exist in ""Clock Tower"", but it really doesn't matter. If you make it through to the last level, set in a sprawling castle, you'll have the gameplay mechanics well and truly in hand. It's by no means easy, though, and towards the end you'll still be in danger of blowing it all and getting one of the several endings other than the one ""good"" one, if you're not super observant and quick witted.

But castles, shock tactics and gruesome deaths alone do not make a game, and as I mentioned, you're going to have to work with truly dated graphics to play this baby. I'm not complaining, after all, we're talking about the earliest days of the Playstation here, but I really must make it clear how primitive it looks - especially now that we have moved up to the sophistication of it's PS2 third incarnation which allows full directional movement and 3 dimensional areas to run about in.

But hey, ""Clock Tower"" is the father of them all, and it deserves it's dues. Checkout screen shots on the internet first (if you can still find any), so you know what you're in for, and then brace yourself for an exciting dip into retro territory. And yes, it will STILL make you jump!",3.0

"IGII is a great looking game with a moderately original angle on 4x gaming, but it never really succeeds in becoming addictive.  What the game attempts to do is marry story elements to a traditional 4x platform, so  that random (and some not so random) events power the decisions you make  about constructing ships, buildings, research, diplomacy, etc.  But this  one original concept is never that well done in the first place, with a  relatively small selection of random events that quickly become familiar  after a few games (and surprisingly vary very little between the three  races in the game).  And the idea actually undermines the 4x aspects fo the  game, as you feel less in control of events than simply swept along  respnding to one manufactured crisis after another.  Add to that a  ridiculously difficult diplomacy system, mediocre AI, and surprisingly  little variety to the storylines (and even the building graphics) of the  three playable races, and you have an intriguing and great-looking game,  but also a game that is ultimately unsatisfying.",3.0

"here we have the only spawn platforming game to my knowledge. i won't get into who manufactured it or when it was released; who cares, the games is on snes. i will get into the gaming aspects of the game.

spawn kicks in with a decent intro with a panoramic scrolling view of the city skyline, whenst you see spawn perched on a church cross infront of a full moon. that alone looked so cool to me i went ahead and bought it!

it has that marvel-esque feel to it by adding comic clips to reveal the story, although they aren't official..or very many.. ""cyan!""

graphics: 3.5 out of 5
maybe i'm being stingy with this rating; the game actually looks pretty good! spawn in particular has the best sprites of all the characters with added frames.
his powers look sharp, aaah i love that green glow. another reason i purchased it is it is the only game where we see him sporting that awesome shroud of his. it truly defines him! it looks very nice when he's air-borne! level graphics aren't bad at all either. quite good rather. character's eh. the look good art wise, but the frame rate isn't the same as spawn. pretty good graphics, i dare say it would make a decent psp or ds port.

game play: 3 out of 5
i'm conflicted with this game. i kept saying how much i hated the controls, but kept on and on and on playing! hee. you can find videos of game play on youtube, but even my 1st time playing the game ever i did better than they did. they sucked and don't quite demonstrate the games gameplay. similar to shinobi III, spawn has many ninja qualities. he can bounce from wall to wall.. jump roof to roof. it was actually lots of fun, tho frustrating (controls)he has many moves too. the game doesn't lack and definately is not a mere attack and jump game. on a side note, the enemies in this game are like those in ninja gaiden nes; there seems to be an infinate amount of them, and they all don't mind jumping to their deaths like idiots one after the other. u'll see lol. also u have unlimited continues, that u WILL need and re-spawns you right at the stage u left off! nice

controls: 1 out of 5
i hate them soo bad! i thought it was my controller; i even unplugged, blew the port and connector, reconnected. tried different controls...all at no avail! there are a suprisingly abundant set of moves at ur disposal with controls similar to 2-d fighting games, with the exception that there's an actual block button, hold back turns u around duh lol... he can even crouch and block, walk while blocking, and summon his green powers from crouching block position mind you also he blockes using his shroud(cape)!!! he's has a chain attack that can hit enemies upclose and directly behind. he has a running uppercut, like ryu and kens, he has a flash kick, like guile, and he has a jumping angle drill kick thing, similar to dhalsim. yea rip-off i know, but it all looks good and works well when u can get it to work. he also had a dash attack similar to max from streets of rage 2. he can also float in the air using his shroud (cape) which i find looks really nice..all basic punches and kicks are there too, light punch strong punch, kick etc. and obviously if he can dash attack, he can run, but performing it made me feel like i suck! if you play this, don't worry you don't suck, it's the game.

music/sound 4 out of 5
i actually really like the music and sound effects. from the very fisrt level that will be one of the first things you'll notice. today's date is august 2010 and lemme tell you the music really hold up. NO, it's not cd quality, but with what it is, the beats are awesome and put you in the mood to kick butt! everytime spawn is injured he makes a grunt that suprisingly even has that spawn'ish (bass'y) voice like keith david from the animated hbo series...uughgghh! i dunno i thought it was cool considering most games where when u get hit, it sounds gay.

over all what kept me playing this game for hours was the fact that spawn is in it and loooks GREAT in it, and the music was cool, and it wasn't boring! until i got stuck at that fire dude and gave up after many times.. thats another thing, this game when u die, u will keep coming back for more! at least i did!

it's definately worth adding to ur collection and if u are a SPAWN fan and gamer, u have to have it. It is for sure worth more than the cheap $1 i paid for it!!!!",3.0
"I like this game overall, but as you can see by the other reviews, it does have its flaws.  What I liked about the game is just the mere fact that it is rather time consuming.  You don't just put it in and win.  You have to think and manage your planets carefully.  The ""normal"" skill level is just way to hard to be ""normal"".  I haven't even wanted to try to play it under ""hard"".  Why bother when I can't even beat it under normal.
I myself haven't had any problems with memory.  But, I can't see a lot of the text when the starfield is on.  This makes it hard to use the quick research function.  The text is there, just can't read it.  And it's not that I have a slow system, it's a brand new 866.

"This is potentially the greatest space opera game to come along in years.  It is depressing that this potential is lost.  First, expect to find sound conflicts with the game.  The game will lock up your PC or dump out of the  game during periods that you acess the game's personal communications  device.  (No, no option to avoid going there, so expet to get dumped about  every 20 minutes of game play).  But, this glich is based on your system's  hardware, so, maybe you won't have that problem.  Next, you will find a  game that bases interaction on diplomacy and spying without adequate  instructions on how they play against one another.  Worse yet, expect  diplomacy not to work at all.  The diplomacy function is extremely  frustrating as you seem incapable of generating anything from the other  races except a declaration of war, which they do as soon as they have more  ships than you.  You will also be frustrated in your inablitiy to  manufacture ships while the computer players just build them out the  whazoo.  You will also be frustrated in the need to micromanage all tanks  during any invasions.  You have 30 tanks?  So, what?; unless you give 30  indivdiual orders they blunder around the map and get shot up piece meal.  Forget about giving group orders. With all the negative said, this game has  a great concept, great music, fantastic cut-scenes, fun space battles, and  a flawless intergration of real time/turn based concepts.

"This is a very faithful recreation of the boardgame experience.  In fact, I wished they have gone for even more of a classic feel, because the CG battles were more of a distraction, and doesn't feel right when you are mainly playing on a game board.  The only disappointment was that I thought this would include the original European map, but it didn't.  Really, I mean, does it kill them to have that thrown in with the game?

"Risk has always been a great, classic game, and thought its been quite some time since I sat down to play the board game, and being that I just picked up the Lord of the Rings Edition of the Risk board game, I needed practice and I figured I would give 'Risk II' a try.
Risk II is definitely fun.  You can play alone, using computer AI to fill in where the other players would be, making for some great practice for when you play with your friends.  There are many different AI opponents to choose from, and presumably these different opponents use different strategies when you play against them.
There is a Simultaneous Battle mode that has you coordinating attacks at the same time that your opponents are.  It is easier to play with computer AI, since with human opponents it tends to take a while, or the game ends up ending in 3 minutes.  However, it is a very interesting way to play Risk and I enjoy it.  There are multiple options to choose from, such as setting the number of batallions you receive for controlling continents, how many territories are open(for example: Hawaii and some outlying islands are often closed, but may be set as territories), and how territories are distributed at the start of the game.
Battles are animated, which is a nice touch, and the graphics, while nothing impressive, are nice enough to look at for a while.  I give the game only 3 stars however because of the AI issues.  Sometimes, the AI opponents can be just absolutely stupid, barely putting up any challenge whatsoever.  But being that you are playing against a computer, it seems that the computer is prone to cheating...or at least, having just a wee bit too much 'luck' with the roll of the dice.  To this day, I will never know how my invasion force of 40 batallions lost to a defender force of 11...only 11 defending batallions!  Its things like that which kind of diminish the fun in the game, because for any player, AI or not, to have that much luck when they're the last territory in the game is, for lack of a better word, completely unprecedented.
Regardless, the game is fun to play, and is of course always more fun when you have more than one person playing it.  The computer AI serves as great practice and if you're just looking to waste time, and overall the game is a fine single player experience, even if the AI just happens to have unrealistic amounts of luck.  I recommend this game to any Risk fan, as it should keep you entertained for hours on end.  I'm already hooked, though when it comes to competing with other people, I prefer the board game.  The AI just fluctuates too much between being stupid and skillful, often going to extremes in both cases.",3.0
I like it but I have to get use to it because I'm terrible at this game. Must buy a guide.,3.0
"Donkey Kong Land is a pretty decent game, but it lacks the overall magic of the DK Country games on the SNES.  It is your basic side scroller adventure game.  The play control is good and the challenge decent.  You can use the animal friends like the Rhino and Dolphin.  But once you play through it, the game does not have that much replay value to it.  I really missed the barrel shooting like in the SNES version.  I get the limitations of the Gameboy system but it would have been nice to see in the game.

DK Land does have all new levels designs so you are playing a totally different game.  Most of the characters will be familiar with the same strengths and weaknesses.  The battery save feature is nice being able to save your progress.  I found the game pretty easy overall.  It just seemed to me it needed a better reward or incentive to play through the game again.  In DK Country getting that 101% was a nice way to keep playing the game.

What disappointed me most was the cheap ending.  I hate it when you invest your time in a game and all you get at the end is a cheap ""Congratulations"" with credits. It would have been nice to see a parade of characters like they do in the Mega Man games or just a nice snap shot like at the end of Donkey Kong for Gameboy.  Or like the Wario Land games your ending will be determined how many bananas you were able to collect and find making your way through the game.  I would rate DK Land 3 stars it is pretty average.  I would save your money and buy DK Country for Gameboy Color or just buy Donkey Kong for Gameboy.  The classic Donkey Kong game for Gameboy has a lot more replay value than this one and a much better challenge.

"This game is okay, but it pales in comparison to the PC/Mac version of the game.  I can't believe that so many other reviews on here focus on the lack of multiplayer.  This game has a bigger problem, it looks awful.  It's so sad that the PSOne didn't have the graphical capabilities of the PC that I had during the late '90s, a PC that was far from top of the line.  I've been playing Warcraft II: The Dark on my PS3.  Now, a PSOne game, with the upconversion by the PS3, is not expected to look great, but considering this game's simplicity, I expected better.  There are also little details that are missing, like sounds.  Each character on the screen, the even animals, are supposed to have multiple phrases that they say when you repeatedly click on them.  These are missing from Warcraft II: The Dark Saga.  I find them essential since they added a nice bit humor to the game.

If you want to play Warcraft II again, find yourself a copy of the Battle.net Edition of the game for PC/Mac, if you don't already have one, and download an emulator program that will allow you to play it on your new computer.  If you can't, then I suppose this game is okay, but I don't recommend it.",3.0
"Donkey Kong Land is a fairly fun game with lots of unique levels to it. Unlike the others in the Donkey Kong Land series, the levels in the game are not related to the original. They range from sky levels to city levels. Feels much more different than traditional Donkey Kong games.

The controls is my biggest gripe with this game. In every Donkey Kong game, if you press the attack button they character attacks and if you hold it you begin to run fast. It gives you a running start basically. Well, not in this game. If you press the attack button to get a fast start to jump over something, you will actually slow down almost to a stop after the attack before you can begin to run. If you jump after an attack, you will only go a few inches and fall. To jump far you need to already have had the run button held so you won't attack first.

That isn't the only problem though, because whenever you jump if feels as if some invisible weights are tied to your character. Your character gets pulled down when they jump instead of falling. The jumping in this game is horrible and makes any jump a challenge, but the worst is in the sky level.

The secrets in this game are easy to find for the most part. All you have to do is find the bonuses and KONG letters. I only ever got stuck on two levels looking for the secrets. Everything being in one color doesn't help finding them any easier.

Overall the game is a little fun but the controls are frustrating. It goes against everything you've learned from the Donkey Kong series and makes the game difficult in some levels. The game is short and only took me about 3 hours to complete 100% but for what it is, it isn't too bad, but I would not recommend it.",3.0
"A few months ago I picked up a copy of Donkey Kong Land III at a local game store and had a pretty enjoyable time making my way through the game. Because the titles that make up the GameBoy Land trilogy are so inexpensive these days - and given that I'm much more taken with retro games than current ones - I wanted to make an effort to try out the other games in the series. Long story short this is another solid game to add to any GameBoy collection... but unlike Land III the original game isn't quite as smooth in what it offers.

One of Donkey Kong Land's greatest strengths is while it contains the same gameplay as the Super Nintendo games, the level design is not directly ripped from those titles. This might seem like an odd thing to champion (and you really need to play the rather disappointing Donkey Kong Land 2 as a point of comparison to know why I'm stating this) but this makes the proceedings feel fresher than they would otherwise be. The importance of this comes into play late in the game when the player enters the final world (the city levels) which is unlike anything in the SNES trilogy. Ironically this is where the game almost falls apart. These levels are home to a rather significant difficulty spike and while it's kind of welcome (since the Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo is ridiculously easy) it puts an obvious strain on the experience. Additionally, the controls and character physics in Donkey Kong Land take some time to get use to. Donkey Kong and Diddy don't handle exactly like they do on the Super Nintendo. Jumps are much more ""floaty"" in this version and the Kongs move through the water with much less resistance. This will definitely throw players off at first but thankfully they will adjust and be able to compensate very quickly.

However, beyond that there really isn't anything else that holds Donkey Kong Land back. The game is an inexpensive and is easy to come by since the Land series games were produced in a pretty robust quantity and become part of Nintendo's Player Choice line-up. The only thing that really hurts Donkey Kong Land (and its sequels) is the fact the original SNES games were ported the GameBoy Advance a few years later which most players will probably opt for over these. Still, I think the Land trilogy is worth picking up despite the issues that hold it back.",3.0
Decent for an older PS1 game. Newer games have better graphics. Its Star Wars so I added it to my collection.,3.0
"This is a pretty cool, though far from perfect, Star Wars game.  As others have said, the graphics are not the best, but they aren't horrible either.  The moves, controllability, etc., are also not that great, but still not horrible.  And yes, the game can be fairly hard when playing against the AI.
So what makes it a ""pretty cool"" game?  Playing as Luke, Han, Chewy, Boba Fett, Sandpeople, etc.  And when you beat the whole game on the hardest setting, you unlock more characters like Darth Vader, Stormtroopers, Leia in her Jabba-slave-girl outfit, and for those of you who read the books, you'll like playing as Mara Jade.  Unlocking these characters is not easy, but if you just sit down and learn the combos (listed in the instruction book), it isn't that hard.  However, although there are quite a few characters to play as once you've unlocked the hidden ones, I think a few more should have been included.  I think Lando should have been in it, as well as the Emperor, and Obi-Wan Kenobi.
So, if you want a game where you can play as most of the fighting characters from the original trilogy, then buy this.  It isn't perfect, but it is good, and it's all there is so far. If you are a Star Wars fan, you owe it to yourself to buy this, considering how cheap it's gotten - I got it when it first came out, and I still play it occasionally.  I'll continue to play it, but I just hope they make a sequel with more characters, including those from Episode I & II, and improve on the flaws listed above, so I can quit having to look past them.",3.0
"This review is written in light of owning a copy of Armada 2, so I will begin by saying that if you can find a copy of Armada 2 (they've become somewhat rare) then I reccomend that title over this one, but failing that, this is also decent.

Armada has several flaws that keep it from being a truly great game, but several nice touches as well.

Armada fails in it's strategic edge for gameplay, and further in the simplification of both Borg graphics and the function of various ships.  In this game, the ships you produce behave much like footmen in Warcraft 3, the only difference being that your ships can be seen dogfighting and shooting each other with phasers and from time to time, being assimilated.

The function of ships also carries a few flaws, and the races are diverse enough to offer a few different options to battle, but for the most part, the same strategy works for any race: Blockade an enemy base and use built (or captured) artillery vessels to pummel its defenses until you can safely attack with your battlefleet.

The games economy is also overly simplified, starbases produce officers, a unit cap, each starbase you control adds to your crew pool ( a resource you will never find yourself running short of) and dilithium moons provide the only demand resource.  Gameplay therefor has the same frustrating tendancy seen in Starcraft, victory is a function of who can gather the most dilithium the fastest, and not a question of who can outwit thier opponents.

The scaling on the ships is also terribly off.  A Soveriegn is a fine, powerful ship, but it should not be able to singlehandedly eliminate three borg cubes, and although I understand this was a balance issue, I feel that it ultimately detracts from the games potential.

The next borg related quam I have here is the borg art.  They have chosen to use a mesh-like mass to represent the borg utilitarian look, all wires and pipes and stuff showing on the surface, but it rather just ends up looking like a big green (or try pink as your player color, that's really funny) blob that is only reminiscent of a borg cube.

Where this game shines, and it does a little, is in its singleplayer campaigns, which have a decent set of storylines and some good voice talent.  The federation campaign has the benefit of Patrick Stewart and Micheal Dorn, Stewart reprising locutus for the borg campaign, and as a special surprise to those who were her fans, Denise Crosby returns as the wily Admiral Sela, to champion the romulan cause in a souped up D'Deridex.

Overall, it's not a bad game, but given that Armada 2 exists, it pales and loses a lot of its appeal.",3.0

"Although LucasArts usually comes out with quality games, this is not one of them.

It becomes  a task in and of its self just to find one of your units to control it.",3.0
"System came in overall good shape, as did the cartridge. However, the game won't show up on any input. I did a little research and realized it's because it's a rather outdated system, and won't work with just the AV cords. It would need her RV cable in order to properly connect with the TV. That's my only issue. I do plan on going out and looking for a cable at some of my local stores. Other than that, seems fine. (The three stars are precautionary because i don't know how the game will play yet)",3.0
The game concole was more than just used. The reset will not work & until I bought control cord extenders I had to jiggle the cord at the connection point to make it work. Also the power pack broke when I plugged it in.,3.0
"Star Trek games are for some reason notoriously awful. I'm not sure if  developers are intimidated by the fame of the series, or if there simply  aren't very many programmers who can handle the Wing Commander level many  of us gamers expect from a good space game. While Armada is better than  most, it still could be so much more.
Yes, you can be one of four groups  - the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, or the Borg. Each has its own  ships and bases, and special abilities. The graphics are Homeworld-esque -  very lovely, with details on ships and other stellar objects.
I grew up  loving Star Trek, and it is neat to be able to manipulate the ships.  However, playing is like sliding miniatures around on a glass tabletop.  Where is the space aspect of this? Scales are not always proper as they  slide from Point A to Point B. You do traditional StarCraft types of  operations - mine your dilithium, build your base, kick out fighting units,  take out the enemy. Instead of choosing an attack stance, you choose the  red/yellow/green alert.
Getting into the game is extremely difficult for  new players. The manual itself is not very helpful, and the commands are  not always intuitive. One of our test machines was a P2-266, which they  list as supported, but the machine only ran at the lowest graphic setting  available, choking constantly. Even on faster systems the crash rate is  rather impressive.
I really, really wanted to enjoy this as a strategy  game. My love of Trek tried to get me to overlook some of the flaws.  However, no matter how gorgeous the ships themselves and the generated  mid-game cinematics, the AI is simply lacking and the gameplay itself is  nothing special when compared to other strategy games out there.
If  you're a Trek lover, grab a copy to play with the ships. If you're a true  strategy player, wait and hope that the next one that comes out resolves  some of these key issues.",3.0
"Well, I don't know if it's the fact that I'me one big pile of Star Wars geekischness but I found this game at least entertaining enough to justify the money I've spend on it. The units look great, and the maps fair enough.  The soundtrack is great. And the single-player missions are good enough to  keep you of the street for a while.
Yet,the game isn't as good as it  could have been.  For example, when a Tusken Raider riding a Bantha is  killed, the Bantha tips over like it where a schoolbus hit by a buldozer.  Aditionally, it looks like all the infantry units are skilled in the  Jedi-art of vanisching after death. When a Trooper is shot, you can see him  fall down, then lay there for about a second or so and then simply vanisch  in to thin air.  My last and main consern though is the camera, I have  played the game for a while and have figured it out now, but getting an  holding a good view on the battlefield kan still be difficult at  times.
All in all, I really don't regret buying Force Comander. Getting  the oppoturnity to order a squad of AT-AT walkers in to battle is one of  the most beautifull things that can happen to a Star Wars fan. Yet,I think  this game is mainly for the fans, people that are looking for a nice 3D RTS  game better look some further.",3.0
"This is a good game when it is running.  The problem is that it can lock  up your computer or just plain disappear without any warning.  They have a  couple of patches that are supposed to fix these problems but I have not  had any success with them.  I even went out and bought a new video  card(Rage Fury Maxx) and sound card(SB Live) and I am still having  problems.  If you buy this game, beware and good luck!",3.0
"The ships are gorgeously rendered, and the Enterprise even has ncc-1701-e written on the hull. Scaling for Borg ships a bit too small, however. Sound effects and music are top notch, and the voices of actors Patrick Stewart  and Michael Dorn add authenticity to the game.
Gameplay became  repetative and boring after awhile, with the only strategy being  ""whoever has the biggest and baddest ships wins."" Its essentially  warcraft 2 in space.
Overall an entertaining game and a must have for  trekkies, and certainly better than Command and Conquer, but I still like  warcraft 2 and starcraft better.",3.0
"Most Star Trek games turn out to be pretty useless (they do release a multitude every year) but Armada is pretty good as a real time strategy game.
The graphics are really beautiful, especially the cut scenes. You  can imagine what a ""Freescape 2"" version of Star Trek would be  like. However, the game plays in 2D only unlike Homeworld which is a bit  disappointing. The graphics can sometimes jerk quite easily.
The control  mechanism is quite easy to get used to and makes it enjoyable to play. As  for the reported bugs, I've downloaded the patch from Activision and the  game is running without any problems.
As a Star Trek game it also does  the business of creating the Trek universe really well. There's speach from  Picard and Worf and others during the cut scenes between missions and all  the ships are painstakingly recreated in great detail.
If you're a Star  Trek fan and like RTS then go ahead but there are better games out there in  this genre, especially Homeworld.",3.0
"The only reason I did not gave it one star is because I am a real Star Wars fan. The gameplay graphics are ok but could have been a lot better. Te soundtrack is quite innovative but the loops are simply annoying. Interface  could have been a lot easier, specially construction interface. The command  point system is interesting but it means once you start loosing the battle  it is extremely difficult to turn the tide, even with superb strategies. On  the oher hand Force Commander improves the Star Wars experience and the  cutscenes are some of the best I have ever seen. But besides this, I have  paid $20 for games of more less the same quality. Somebody should tell  LucasArts that the fact it is part of the Star Wars Universe does not mean  he can deliver a mediocre product and the public will accept it. I had  enough with Rebellion and now this...",3.0
For the steep requirments you would think that the game would look better. The combat interface takes up too much of the screen. Units walk right through buildings. The command point system is a pain in the ass. Most  battles come down to a war of attrition with very little strategy comming  into play. I would have given this game only one star but I am a big Star  Wars fan.,3.0
"The ""Resident Evil"" games--and perhaps all games in the ""survival horror"" genre--are about atmosphere. And in that regard, ""Resident Evil 2"" delivers. The graphics won't wow a hardcore PC gamer, nor will the sound, although the music is effectively eerie. This game offers a some good shocks and good-if-stilted cutscenes, intermixed with some so-so action.
The minuses are serious but not show-stoppers. The graphics and sound effects show the limitations of the consoles they were designed for--no Quake III here, nor even Blood 2, for that matter. (Resident Evil 3 actually goes a good bit farther compensating for this by offering much higher resolutions.)
Saving a game can only be done at a typewriter, and only using a ribbon, of which there are a limited number. I guess that means that if you haven't played through the game by the time you used that last ribbon, you're going to have a =really= long last session. Save game limitations drive PC players nuts, and is compounded here.
The camera angles, while usually quite effective in the atmosphere, also make it, em, challenging, to see what you're doing about a third of the time when you're zombie slaying.
The only other major minus is the dubious pseudo-adventure game puzzles. Find this key, find that key, hook that wheel to that valve, etc. It's not as big a minus as it might seem, because sometimes these slow periods lull you into a false sense of security and set you up for the next good shock. Other times, they're just teidous.
Overall, this game has won me over with its spooky atmosphere and ocassional shocks, but I couldn't call it a classic, unfortunately, at least not this version.",3.0
"My first impression of this game was ""Wow. Gorgeous. Amazing."" In all fairness, this game is very nice to look at; all the ships look fantastic, as do the environments (although none of the ships are sized to  scale; as a Borg fan, this bothered me a bit). However, there were a lot of  problems...first of all, all the races are pretty similar in how they  function...second, the game shipped with an absurd number of bugs (although  there is a patch that fixes most of these now). The AI presents no  challenge whatsoever, and the game gets very old very, very quickly. I  cannot recommend this one for hardcore RTS fans...this game will be a  breeze, and there really isn't anything 'new' here...you will tire of it  quickly. The only people I can recommend this to are hardcore Star Trek  fans, who will love the graphical interface (note that Multiplayer is  actually pretty entertaining when you toss a couple more thinking opponents  into the mix).",3.0
"This is a game that the Star Trek subgenre could've used about two years ago, but as it is now, it's too little, too late.  Yes, it's more, ahem, engaging than your average Star Trek game, but it does nothing to improve  upon the strategy genre as a whole.  As such, like most Star Trek games, it  can only really be recommended for Star Trek fans.
Having said that, if  you're unfamiliar with the strategy genre, you will find this to be an  enjoyable enough starting point.  The graphics are great, the sounds lush,  the cinematics impressive, and the vocal talent appropriately star-filled.  For the novice to intermediate strategist, the game's AI and missions are  enough to occupy the senses as you get the idea of the genre.
But, as has  been remarked before, if you *have* played strategy games before, it feels  like you're merely playing a buggy version of _Age of Empires_ in space.
Despite having installed the first update patch, the game still quits  unexpectedly.  It also doesn't work very well at all with multiple-monitor  systems, failing to stop mouse movement at the edge of the playing screen.  In fact, the whole mouse movement is awkward.  After fiddling endlessly  with the mouse control option, it seems to me that there is just some kind  of small programming flaw; it doesn't scroll particularly smoothly,  regardless of setting.  It's not that the flaw is enough to make the game  unplayable, it's just that it's difficult sometimes to move with precision.  Which brings up another point:  perspective.  There's something about the  angle at which units and objects are placed that makes it difficult to see  as much of the playing field as you want at one time.  There's so much  empty space in the game, by definition, that, in order to see everything,  you really need to be 'pulled back' more than the game allows.
Still,  there's hope that much of this will be solved by additional patches.  Clearly there's enthusiasm for the product amongst the Star Trek community,  and Activision has already serviced this community with one patch.  More  will undoubtedly be forthcoming, and the game might well work itself into  stability.
Of course, the larger point is that _Starcraft_ and _Age of  Empires II_ (among others) are already stable, challenging, and popular  among multiplayer communities.  Many people will therefore think that it  might well be worth skipping this satisfactory game for one that truly  excels.",3.0
"You play as Wario, and this is a typical platform game. Jump on platform, jump on enemies (some of them).
To make things interesting you collect coins and treasure, there is hidden treasure in this game and you need to complete certain areas, then go back and find the treasure.
You need 10 coins to open the last door on every course, the rest of the money you can spend on 2 different minigames.
The first one is simply luck, you pick a bucket that you think contains a bag of cash. If you get right, you double coins, if you pick the wrong bucket, you loose half the coins.
The other mini-game (you need at least 20 coins) you throw bombs at enemies, time their speed of movement with how hard you throw the bomb.
Depending how many you hit, and how much you paid to play (there are three levels), you get different prices.
The rest of the money goes into Wario's treasure ""vault"" (rather screen)

The graphic and the music are really good for gameboy.

There are power-up hats for Wario to wear.
A viking hat that enable you to ""butt"" the ground so enemies fall over and crush blocks.
Dragon-hat that breaths fire.
A jet-hat that enables you to fly forward a certain distance.
And just the regular hat, so you can become regular Wario instead of mini-Wario (which you become if hit by a monster)

The game automatically saves itself, so you just turn the game off when you feel like it.

My biggest issue with this game is how bad Wario moves at times.
In the beginning, he feels a little slow and clumsy.
Near the end, especially when fighting bosses, you get irritated.
Wario mostly died in the game because he jumped to short or he moved to slow.
I mean, the guy walks snail-speed!
And most of the bosses are very quick, so even if you jump, Wario is so slow he dosen't get halfway up in the air, gets hit and dies.
And other time, he LANDS so slow after jumping, he lands in the faces of the monster and dies!
Talk about annoying!
The last boss just feels helpless trying to have Wario save the day, you are supposed to climb up on clouds and hit the boss head, but Wario is so slow the clouds fly away before he can jump up on them!
He also dogdes the boss attacks badly, like mentioned previously, if he manages to get away from one attack, he usually end up landing badly on a monster and dies anyway.",3.0
"As a long suffering Star Trek fan who wishes that not almost every ST PC game turns out to be a stinker, I am glad to report that this game turned out to be playable. Like Blizzard's Starcraft, you control each of the 4  major ST: Next Generation races in turn (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, and  Borg), solving a series of liked scenarios for each, all linked through a  common storyline. I'd wait until a patch was available before buying it  though. If the bugs were fixed, I'd rate it a 4-star.
The good parts: The  graphics are really terrific, with smooth animation and effects that really  add to the game. Several different unique ships for each race, each with  its own special abilities. The ability to capture enemy ships and  facilities. The campaign scenarios are varied and interesting. The game  interface is simple and user-friendly.
The bad parts: The campaign is  really short, the AI is none too bright and the game has some serious  stability problems (crashed on starting, crashed on saving, crashed on  loading).",3.0

"Video games based off movies are usually not that good.  That, or they don't follow the movies much at all.  The Lost World: Jurassic Park really doesn't follow the movie.  At all.  Really, the game only shares the title of the movie.  Despite that, The Lost World is a solid game.  The only major problem is simple: the game is incredibly difficult.  Easily being one of the hardest Playstation games out there.  The sad part is that the game is hard because of frustration with the gameplay.

The game is comprised of thirty levels and you'll play through them as five different characters.  You'll begin by playing as a Compy.  Then you'll play as a hunter, then a Raptor, then the T-Rex and finally the human prey.  Much of the gameplay is no fun, however.  Throughout the game you'll take unreasonably large amounts of damage from your enemies and health (particularly for humans) is few and far between.  Even though the dinosaurs can restore health through munching on their fallen preys, it's usually not enough.

There are some big differences between playing as humans and playing as dinosaurs.  The most obvious, of course, being that the human characters use guns and dinosaurs don't.  As humans you can pick up many different weapons to use in your fight against the dinosaurs.  As dinosaurs, however, you have an instinct.  The more enemies you kill as a dinosaur, the better you instinct gets.  Instinct causes you to deal more damage as well as take less.  The lower your instincts the more damage you'll take and the less damage you'll deal.  Unfortunately, too many attacks from your adversaries can whittle down your health anyway.  In addition to that, your instinct will drop if you go too long without killing an enemy.  For the humans, you'll find that ammo for your weapons is scarce and the maximum amount is quite low.

The game plays a lot like your basic side scroller as well.  While you can turn and explore some pieces of the level, most levels are actually pretty straightforward.

However, as noted before, the game is too challenging.  The levels don't have checkpoints and they're pretty long.  Just the same, you'll also take damage from falling from too high of a distance.  Easily the worst part about The Lost World is its unforgiving challenge.  To the point that it really hurts the gameplay.

Even though the game is frustrating to play, the graphics are top notch.  Some of the best seen on the Playstation.  There are a few glitches, but nothing too bad.  Even better is the soundtrack to the game, which is one of the first to use an orchestrated soundtrack.  It's a fantastic soundtrack that is used extremely well.  The music can actually keep you going through certain parts of the game.

It's hard to recommend The Lost World.  It's not a bad game, but it's too frustrating to put down the money for.",3.0

The fact that the same theme has to keep popping up whenever the screen switches to the turn/based battle screen is annoying to me.  I HATE that theme song.  You can't avoid it either, unless you turn the volume on the television down.

I also hate the game because of bad memories connected to it.  The game was released during a time I truly didn't care about life.  That memory is still connected to the game, unfortunately.  Don't let MY negativity stop you from buying this supposed classic, though.  It has a friendly Bowser, and no Luigi.  Odd, but true.",3.0

"Saturday, November 27th 1993. I had become bored of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Battle-Fist-of-the-North-Star/dp/B00002SVNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Battle: Fist of the North Star</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-of-the-Beast/dp/B000035XKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow of the Beast</a>. They were poorly-chosen Xmas presents a few months earlier and I wanted to swap them for something more worthy. I only owned said games for 12 weeks though it felt like eternity back then, but something more worthy was about to come.

I traded the games at a trading barrow in Falkirk shopping mall. The games I got in return were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Golden-Axe/dp/B00002SVOJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Golden Axe</a>&nbsp;and Streets of Rage. Upon returning home and jammed in SoR and my mind was blown, first by the funky soundtrack and second by action. Here was a beat-em-up worthy of the arcade that was finally available on home consoles. As a kid, I loved this game. I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. Then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streets-of-Rage-2/dp/B00002SVO9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streets of Rage 2</a>&nbsp;came out, and we quickly forgot that this one even existed.

You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam Hunter or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work through in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun, and the screen progression gives the game panel-to-panel comic book vibe.

Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into oblivion. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X, but never mind.

Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the time. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes. Hell, they are ALL standout tunes and classics in their own right.

I am a proud owner of SoR, but when you also own Sor2 it does sort of render this one obsolete. The graphics are a little choppy too, but it is still one of the finer side-scrolling beat-em-ups ever made.

Pros:

Average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like
panel progression that fits the tone of the game.

Great tunes.

Easy to get into and hard to put down.

Cons:

Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2.

Poor enemy AI. Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in
combat. This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.

Lack of combo moves.

Lack of decent weapons.

Bad guy models are repeated far too often.",3.0

"First off, I managed to read through all 57 reviews of this (as of Oct. 6, 2004... and I realize not many more are likely to be written) and only two gave this game less than 5 stars, most of which raved that this was the best game ever.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved and still do love this game, but to say that it's even the best on the snes is such a stretch that it makes me wince.  The game was very fun and entertaining, but don't expect (if you've ever played any rpg for any amount of time, ever) to get more than about 10 hours or so out of it... unless you want to waste your time finding the crate guy's casino thing, which isn't that hard and pointless at that; it's easier just to look it up.  Also, to those reviewers who think this storyline is the most engrossing thing you've ever seen, please shut it.  Seriously, the idea of Bowser, Peach, and Mario fighting was genious, but about the only plot ""twist"" so to speak comes 3 minutes into the game.  Otherwise, the game is basically a cookie cutter RPG which no really distinctive features.  It's as basic as they come: find seven stars, fight bad guys, level up, defeat the boss, save the world.

Let's get the whole issue of difficulty out of the way.  This game, as it is from nintendo, is targeted at a younger age group.  As such, it isn't that hard.  I read one review/walkthrough type thing of this game that said you shouldn't even attempt to beat the last boss until at least level 20 I think--I did it easily at like level 10.  Furthermore, there's not one challenging boss.  As long as you understand the game, any one boss can be taken out (with the notable exception of culex, who is really easy if you've got the lazy shell) in less than 10, usually 5, minutes.

The graphics were good, even above average for an snes game, but it did come out right at the end of the snes and was a 32-bit game.  The music can barely hold a candle to the likes of chrono trigger or FFVI (or FFIII if you prefer the American release title).  It's fitting, but unfortunately, it's totally mario.  There's no emotion at all in it.

On the issue of emotion, how dare anyone say that this game developed any characters to any depth that would bring about any emotional attachment to this game?  The most developed character was Mallow, and all that was developed about him was the revalation that he wasn't a frog (which was a huge shocker mind you [hint: sarcasm]) and his subsequent finding of his parents in Nimbus land.  Mario, Toadstool, Bowser, and Geno were devoid of all development, although Bowser did show uncharacteristic signs of weakness and humor.

Now that I've gotten to all the points I feel are necessary, let me say that this is a superb game for what it is.  It is, unfortunately, not all that great.  It's fun the first time through, and although I've played it probably 4 or 5 times through, it's really not all that replayable (I'm just a sucker for nostalgia).  The humor is definately my favorite part of the game, as there are no other times when mario is so animated and expressive in any other mario game.  His explanations to people are hilarious, as is his ability to identify himself to anyone by jumping.  The Nimbus adventure and subsequent Axom-Rangers are also worth a bunch of chuckles.

In a nutshell (if that's possible after everything I've just written):  It's a great game if you've never played an rpg, are interested in doing so, and love mario.  If you like mario and aren't hardcore, I'd reccomend going the route of downloading the rom and playing it that way.  With the exception the ease in using the snes controller, there really isn't any need to play it on the console.  So yeah, this is a game worth playing if you fit into the above critera or if you're just bored.  Just make sure you don't expect FFVI/FF(insert # here)/(insert other sweet square game here)/etc...",3.0

"This is another title that came out near the end of the SNES lifespan.  It is kind of a mediocre action side scroller game.  The first mission seemed to take forever because you had to play all 5 characters in a separate level and beat them to advance in the game.  The X Men characters were all pretty decent I usually played as Wolverine or Cyclops.  I think the game had 6 levels total.

Apocalypse wasn't that hard but busting through the gates trying to outrun lava in his stage was pretty difficult.  2 missions are just danger room boss battles that were fairly easy after you have already defeated Apocalypse.  The true boss of the game is Magneto in the mutant space station in outer space.  So the cover of the game is kind of misleading.  The play control in the game is pretty good, the challenge jumps around from easy to very difficult depending on which character you choose to play through the game.  The space station stage seemed to be different for each X-men player so that was a nice touch and added some replay value.  Also it really helped having a password so you didn't have to start the game over from scratch each time.

Overall the game comes off as decent but far from great.  I would rate this game 3 stars for the time period it was released in. There was a very similar game for the SNES system called ""War of the Gems"" which basically copied the whole game design for this game but offered more stages and boss battles.  Just a couple of years later the X-men legend games for the Playstation and Computer far surpassed anything this game had to offer.  This game should be incredible cheap now I wouldn't pay anymore than $5 for this item.  It was a big step up from the god awful NES X-men game but that isn't saying much.

"Thats pretty much the best way 2 describe it. This game isn't horrible but its playable. The levels are short, the bosses are faily easy, but the graphics are good for a 16-bit, and the sounds and music is good 2. Though if you want a really good X-men game try X-men 2 clone wars for Sega Genesis. The Graphics are good, the music is amazing! And the gameplay is very good. This game is good, but just not the best in the X-men universe.",3.0
"This game proved to be pretty challenging from the beginning. I played it enough to make sure the game worked since it was newly purchased from Amazon. I put enough time into it to discover I couldn't get past the first level. I just obviously need to put more time into it. From what I have discovered so far from the game it is good so far. The graphics are pretty good for the time the game was made. This game reminds me of Street Fighter II as far as the gaming style. If you like a challenge and the old Super Nintindo games like I do, this is a good purchase for someone who likes challenging games.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Mutant-Apocalypse/dp/B00002SUCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse</a>",3.0
"I thought I should chime in here after picking up a 3D controller NIB. I was very excited having never used it before and went to replay many of my classic games. This controller is supported (in analog mode) by very few games! It of course makes the biggest difference with Nights into dreams, which feels like a new game compared to using a D-pad.

This controller is NOT supported by Panzer Dragoon and Panzer Dragoon Zwei, I don't understand how the other reviewers could not discover this. If you try to play Panzer Dragoon the controls are very touchy, and worse than this you CANNOT SHOOT INTO THE CORNERS OF THE SCREEN. This makes boss battles nearly impossible when you need to shoot a homing mine coming at you. Yet worse is that in Zwei the bezerk attack goes off randomly when using this controller. This is all because Panzer Dragoon games were designed for the Sega Mission Stick, not the 3D controller! I was expecting to be able to play Virtua Cop with it but no luck there. Same with mass destruction.

Sega Rally Championship doesn't work either, it detects the controller as a steering wheel so technically you can use it to steer, but I was unable to configure a control scheme that was acceptable (you end up needing to use the D-pad to shift which is awkward)

Don't let me put you off of this controller though- it is comfortable and relatively precise. I would say it's not great by modern standards but certainly leaps ahead of the D-pad. It even has analog shoulder buttons. I have bigger hands and find the controller comfortable for using analog, but cramped if I need to use the D-pad on it.

Some games that I tested that seem to work well with the 3D Controller are Manx TT Superbike (supports analog acceleration / braking on the shoulder buttons!) and Sky Target.  I hear Panzer Dragoon Saga and Mechwarrior 2 support it also. There are lists of games that have support for it out there, and I'd suggest you check one before you purchase this controller. Of course it is usable with many games that are unsupported, but be prepared to potentially find flaws (like I mentioned before- games designed for the mission stick or steering wheel).

The bottom line is it is a quite good controller but it's just a shame not more games support it (there are so many games that would hugely benefit from it!). Just wanted to make sure people out there know this before they pick one up!",3.0

"The game came sooner than expected which was great, but it didn't work and when i took it apart to be cleaned one of the screw wells was broken in half. If anyone else encounters this problem with a cartridge game not working, i suggest spending the money and buying the appropriate screwdriver to remove the security bit. then clean off the cartridge with a q-tip, some rubbing alcohol, and water. Just do your best to try and not leave any alcohol left on it. it should work like new. by doing this i was able to get my game to work but it still needs to be blown on to start it up.",3.0

"Super Mario Kart is a good game, the first to use iconic characters. The issue is that the controls and dated 3D make the game kind of hard to operate. It was hard to turn corners with a D-pad, so I used a joystick (on the Wii's classic controller). It was just as hard. The camera stayed right behind the kart and never shifted, making it even harder. The good news is that if you have Mario Kart DS, Wii, or 7 they have updated some of the SNES tracks.",3.0
"F Zero appears to have had one purpose: To demonstrate the Mode 7 graphical capabilities of the Super NES. Great Nintendo, mission accomplished.

They are a total tragedy. Content? You get to choose from 4 cars and like 6 tracks. Not very much, don't you think? What about the level of classic it is? I believe the Super NES had three launch titles, Pilotwings, Mario World, and then this. Mario World obviously stole the show, Pilotwings was a hit, and F Zero... I believe it got little attention outside of the graphics. Seriously, buy it if you like, but you should save your money and get one of the other launch titles.",3.0

"Giants Is an awesome game, when I started out I thought it as designed to be a kids game. Well its not, the story line is slightly vulgar. Only an adult would truly get entertainment from this game. Graphics are excellent, scenes are wonderful and it's down right fun. Problems: You think Kabuto would be the fun one. Well let's just say that I just ran to the objectives from the boredom. Fortunately Kabuto is the last creature you play, the reaver was the most fun for me as she moves very fast. I suggest this game its load of fun for everyone. Good mission play and lots of laughs. Suggest this game for the true gamer as it will provide a new style of play. Not s must have but I you have a few bucks go ahead and get it you will have fun.",3.0

"I bought Giants with gleeful expectations.  In some regards they were met, as a lot about this game is quite fun.  The reviews I'd read online made it out to be utterly amazing.
Unfortunately, it didn't fulfill these expectations.  Yes, it is incredibly witty, everyone will get several laughs out of it.  It is pretty and gameplay is largely interesting.  However, it is not without its drawbacks.  First, it is very buggy and performance is horrible, even on my rather decent system (Athlon 800 w/ geforce256 ddr).  When compared to Sacrifice, which runs beautifully on my box with full detail, it is aparent that the Giants engine wasn't worked on enough.  Patches haven't fixed this.
Also, the plot is very shallow, and the action can get awfully repetitive.  Controls are fairly poor, e.g. Kabuto's minions aren't usable as they were intended because they must be micromanaged.  The game has potential and a few laughs, but is ultimately lacking.",3.0
"F-Zero was the original mode-7 racing game for the Super Nintendo. Scrolling background layers give the illusion of a 3D track, and you pilot one of four vehicles across multiple courses.

The game's lost quite a bit of shine, mostly because Super Mario Kart took everything Nintendo learned from this experience and improved on it, including adding a two-player mode. Pop this cartridge in and it's easy to see how this game was revolutionary back in the day, but now the backgrounds are bland and flat and the races seem rather slow. The trademark F-zero music is still intact, however.

A decent game for collection purposes, but the GBA versions feel superior, not to mention the 3D NIntendo 64 and Gamecube sequels.",3.0
"Well, well... This was the first F-Zero game ever. Unfortunately, I didn't like this one very much, so I didn't play the other ones (F-Zero GX, F-Zero X...). Why didn't I like this game? Well, it's a pretty simple game.
Graphics aren't good, the background is terrible. The race itself it's not funny, so it's not fun like in Super Mario Kart. The game, I believe, was a very fast racing game when it was released. But now, with the release of its sequel F-Zero GX for GCN, it doesn't look like you're riding a fast veichle, but looks like you're riding a turtle, because it gets really slow. There are some cars to choose, some racing circuits... The soundtrack is cool, but I prefer Super Mario Kart's too. Since it has no multiplayer mode, sooner or later you'll get sad of this game. Buy Super Mario Kart instead, if you want a good racing game for your SNES.",3.0

"After starting up Giants I was greated with beautiful graphics (though even on a P2 400 w/ 16MB video RAM I had the detail way down) and a hilarious cutscene.  At first I was entralled by this game.  The whole first campaign (Meccs) was had a nice gradual learning curve, a fun variety of missions, and the funniest cutscenes I've seen in a game in a long time.  My only complaint was the base building that seemed to be added to the game to spruce up multiplayer, but is otherwise sorely lacking compared to other RTS games.  But it's an action game and that can be forgiven.
Then I started the second campaign, the Sea Repaer's Story.  The control was nice and they again started with a nice learning curve.  The first few cutscenes were not as good as the Meccs campaign, but still amusing.  Then suddenly they gave me a base and I had all the ""technology"" (or spells for the Sea Reapers).  Then after destroying an enemy installation to complete a level, no cutscene.  Now I was worried.
Kabuto.  Initially I was thrilled.  Running around stomping buildings, eating people, and just generally causing chaos was great.  Then a little later it was getting tedious.  By the end of the campaign I was just racing through the levels as fast as possible because they were so repetitive.  Unfortunately there weren't even any cutscenes in between missions.  Just one at the start and two at the end so I wasn't even all that motivated to go through those levels.
Is the game fun?  Yes, it is.  However, be warned that playing the single player game may get old eventually.  I honestly haven't really tried the multi player much, perhaps picking up your friends as Kabuto and ripping their heads off could be far more entertaining.  It sure sounds like it :).",3.0
"I like the game alot. Tetris is one of my favorite games, so I decided it was time to buy the original. I booted up the game and everything was fine, until I put in my hi-score and turned off my Game Boy Advance. When I came back, it was gone. So I attached a little peice of paper to the game cartridge and wrote all my scores on it. Everything else is great, though. DISCLAIMER: THERE IS NO HOLD BUTTON WITH THE ORIGINAL 1989 GAME.",3.0
"BOY was Super Mario Kart a popular game back in the day.  ""Mario is now racing!  Along with all his friends!"" was the thing people were saying to each other in my middle school.  Of course the Sega fans weren't saying that- they could care less about the game or anything to do with Nintendo and all of Nintendo's fans!

Let's move forward to the year 2004.  Is it still a good game?  Yes, but in my opinion, ONLY on 2-player mode.  I think the 2-player battle mode (where you defeat your opponent by hitting them with turtle shells) is quite fun and the main reason to own the game.

The thing is, I don't see ANY of my high school friends anymore.  I'm all alone now, so none of those friends come over anymore to play the battle mode with me.  I'm forced to play the game by myself, and as a 1-player game, Super Mario Kart just isn't very good.  Too many awesome racing games have come along since Super Mario Kart, including the newer Super Mario Kart on the Gamecube (which I haven't played, but I can only assume is MUCH better on 1-player mode).  What I'm trying to say is that the 1-player options don't really have anything interesting about them.

However, Super Mario Kart was pretty fun when I was younger.  And, you know, it probably remains a total blast to play on 2-player.  But if you have no one to play the game with... you better not get it.",3.0
"I mean, what Nintendo gamefreak doesn't?!?!? I've grown up with his games and continue to support Nintendo, however, I will start to write this review.

Beware, I will be brutally HONEST about this game. Super Mario Kart, as you should know, is Mario's debut in a racing game. He along with Peach, Luigi, Yoshi, DK Jr., Bowser, Koopa and Toad, will race to the finish line.

This game is very fun if you are playing with another player say for instance, in battle. I honestly found that to be the most fun part of the game. However, being me, (note I don't have the game, I've played it several times though) I usually am stuck playing a game by myself because my little bro doesn't play with me and my older bro usually doesn't have any taste whatsoever in gaming like I do! It [is too bad] but that's life. Sorry about giving you a little TOO much backround but, I indeed had a point. That point is playing alone is fun too, but the CPU AI is quite unbelievable and may leave you trying over and over to beat the Star Cup (if you can even get there), or wanting to break the damn game.

Overall, it's an approachable game, BUT i warn you now, if you are looking for a easier racing game, don't bother with this one!",3.0
"Team up with Billy and Jimmy from the Double Dragon game series and Wartz, Rash and Zitz from the Battle Toads game series for another action packed fighting game. There is a huge contrast of fighting styles, because Double Dragon was a slow thrashing game and Battle Toads was a cartoonish simplistic game. They combine the two to make a show moving and difficult game with really poor game play. The game is very slow and tedious, but at least action is diverse from brawling to riding hover bikes and everything in between. Another downfall is that the graphics are not up to SNES standards, more like NES.",3.0

 The game retains the characters and moves, but the players smaller and moves are choppy. The back grounds are still pretty good looking, but the port lost a few stages. And none where 3D like the arcade. So smaller characters and choppier animation makes the game not seem whole. This being said, they really did everything they could with the system. The arcade KI I would give a 5star, but I can't do that for this port because I liked the arcade version so much. But the arcade version was over four times larger. If you get to an arcade with one, give it a go. I think you'll agree that that was one of the best fighters of the 90s. This is only a port of that, but style a good game.",3.0

"I can't believe Genesis fans used to think Golden Axe was so great.  I had a friend who thought the game was one of the best the system had to offer.  Everyone who owned a Genesis seemed to agree with him.  It's nothing special (then again, most of the games on the Genesis were nothing special).

It's really not much different from the Super NES game, King of Dragons.  King of Dragons is better because it has prettier graphics and colors, more exciting gameplay, and just an overall better game.  Golden Axe feels old and empty in comparison.",3.0
"This is one of the best remembered Genesis games. Tho it's absolutely nothing special. It's almost totally like Streets of Rage with magic spells instead of special kung-fu moves and set in the dark ages.
You can choose the big Conan lookalike Ax Battler, who uses earth magic. Tyris Flare, the She-Ra type amazon woman who uses fire magic or Gilius Thunderhead, the viking dwarf uses lightning magic (and the character who actually uses the Golden Axe) or team up in a two-player (the best way to play the game).
The story is a load of cobblers. Some dude called Death Adder (and his son Death Adder JNR) are up to some amount of evil and you've got to stop him.
So on you go on your journey of hacking and slashing goblins, skeletons and various other guys in armor. It's fun, but not great.
The sound effects are pathetic and do not show off what the Genesis was capable of. David Whittaker's music, while being slightly tuneful and medieval, was pretty bad and wasn't as memorable as Yuzo Koshiro's effort on the Streets of Rage games.

"The following refers to the downloadable version of Tetris available for the 3DS/2DS system.

Entertaining players young and old for more than 29 years, Tetris can be found on virtually any platform.  And yet this iteration holds a special place in the hearts and minds of many, and remains a personal favorite of creator Alexey Pajitnov.  Released with Game Boy in 1989, Tetris challenged public perceptions of gaming by challenging everyone to arrange falling blocks into horizontal lines that disappear.  One could say that this was our first casual video game.

But for the all the history surrounding Tetris (along with its estimated effects on the human brain), nostalgia has its limits.  To its credit, the 2 single-player modes still provide an infuriating challenge, and even reward the player with a cute space shuttle launch (and as with most Virtual Console titles, you have the option to alter the image to resemble Game Boy's green tinted screen).  But without a friend with his/her own copy of Tetris handy, it literally doesn't get any better than that.  Such is especially true since the multiplayer mode is absent on the VC version.  Still, nothing beats racking up a new high score while in line, on the bus, in the elevator, or even in the bathroom.

"Illusion of Gaia made the list of top 100 games in Nintendo Power's Volume 100, and understandably so.  Definitely a decent game, Illusion of Gaia has much to offer, including some very nice environments with crisp graphics, better than the likes of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.  It can be very fun to play, and it is even somewhat educational since many of its dungeons are based on real places.  To speak more about the graphics, the monster design is nearly flawless.  Every dungeon has different monsters with different looks and attacks, and even the residents of each town look completely distinct from those of the previous town or the next town, something that not even the SNES Final Fantasy games managed to do.  These details all add up to a visually pleasing game.  The necessity to kill all the enemies in each area in order to upgrade is also a positive element of the game because it gives a sense of accomplishment in each room.  Though in spite of these positive elements, Illusion of Gaia should not be called a Zelda killer.  It is also very different from Zelda in certain ways and therefore can not be compared in all aspects to Zelda.

Although there is a myriad of items in Illusion of Gaia, their usage demonstrates one of the principle differences between Zelda and Illusion of Gaia.  Most of the items in Illusion of Gaia are keys, puzzle pieces, or other objects that get used once in a specific location and then leave your inventory.  It is not difficult to find where to use acquired items, but a few of them can be difficult to find since they are not all found in treasure chests.  Players should not expect all the different weapons and devices such as those seen in Zelda a Link to the Past.  Will, the game's protagonist, uses a flute for a weapon.  Zelda purists may mock this, but Will's flute is by no means the only weapon in the game.  Will learns interesting techniques and also has the ability to morph into different entities during the quest who also acquire their own techniques.  Illusion of Gaia may not have quite as many puzzles as a Link to the Past, but it certainly has its decent fill, and the whole style of the puzzles is different.  Perhaps the puzzles at the end of the Angel Village come to mind as the most different from anything seen in Zelda.  Nonetheless, the mainstream of the game remains arguably more in fighting than thinking.  Some of the dungeons could have used more puzzles and items, but most are not so lacking that they create any feelings that something is missing.

The main problem with Illusion of Gaia is that it rapidly starts to fall apart in the middle, both in terms of story and game progression.  I pinpoint this turn of events around the Great Wall of China, but by no means say that the story is perfect up to then because it is not.  The difference is that earlier in the game enough goes on to overshadow inconsistencies and holes.  Later in the game, in addition to the story deteriorating, the blandness of the world layout becomes much more noticeable as well, making the travel less interesting.  Aside from the Tower of Babel's circular island in the center of the world, Illusion of Gaia's world map consists mainly of three continents.  Two of them basically fill the southeast and southwest corners of the world, and one long continent north of the Tower of Babel island stretches horizontally across the whole map.  The game starts on one of the bottom continents and gradually progresses to the long northern continent, where the Great Wall of China comes early.  Travel at this point just becomes a bland pattern of the group arriving at a town, Will leaving to go to a dungeon alone, Will returning to the town, and then the group going on to the next town.  It is more varied earlier in the game during which there is usually another thing to do or a person to visit between a town and big dungeon, and these events add flow to the story.  Later in the game some of the group's members start to leave and there is nothing to break up the dull pattern.  Some of the reasons for going to the later dungeons are also extremely vague and not well supported in the overall story.  Example, why exactly does Will go to Mt. Temple and Angkor Wat?  There is no dialogue or story saying that anything specifically needs to be done in these places.  In the other dungeons the story makes it clear if you have to go to a specific dungeon and why, but with later dungeons like Mt. Temple and Angkor Wat, all that happens is that someone will point out or draw a picture of something on Will's map.  What is even more puzzling about these two dungeons is why the game makes you walk all the way back out of them after getting the item at the end.  There was absolutely no reason for this to have happened.  It did not happen with any of the other dungeons, and it should not have happened with these two.  The least they could have done was at the end of Angkor Wat transport you back to the entrance after the white light faded.  It would have made perfect sense, and I can even picture the text box ""When the light was gone I found myself at the temple entrance ..."" Whatever... but another thing to rip regarding these dungeons and this general point in the game is that given the time it supposedly takes for Will to travel to some of these later dungeons, none of the companions ever ask Will where he went or why he left them in the town without saying anything.  Example, as soon as Will arrives at Angkor Wat, a text box says that it took him three days to get there from the Native's Village.  After Will returns to the Native's Village neither Kara nor Erik asks him where he's been for the last week (which is how long we can assume it took for him to get to the temple, explore it, and return) or why he left them in the Native's Village.  This is either a rushed part of the game or lack of thinking on the part of the writers.  Yes the earlier stages of the story have similar issues that are not quite addressed, but again; earlier in the game enough happens to make the players forget or pardon these instances.  Since not much interesting occurs later in the game, the holes in the plot really wear on.

The vagueness surrounding later dungeons is far from the only weakness in the story (specific story spoilers ahead until last paragraph, only warning).  Many fundamental questions are never answered or explained.  Will had lost his father a year prior to the current events and starts the game living with his grandparents.  He, his father, and apparently many others had gone on an expedition to the Tower of Babel and somehow only Will made it back, of course not remembering what happened or how he made it back.  At no point is it ever explained what exactly happened or how Will made it back to South Cape.  Will's father at the end tells him about a ""strange room in the tower where time passes so quickly that people evolve quickly.""  Is this supposed to mean that Will's father went into this room, aged so fast and died instantly?  How exactly did Will get his telekinetic power??  Will's father tells him that he and Kara are evolved humans.  What exactly is that supposed to mean?  How and why are they evolved?  Are they evolved and no one else?  Is it because Will is a descendent of Dark Knights?  How exactly are they different from other humans if they are evolved?  Will's mother also appears in a dream and as a ghost, but it is never explained how she died!!  Was she also on the expedition to the Tower of Babel??  It remains a mystery.  If these fundamental questions had been satisfactorily explained, some of the other problems might have been more pardonable.  If the writers had any idea how to make a decent story, they would have answered these questions and devoted more of the story to the ancients as well.

If I were to ever reward a game for worst ending ever Illusion of Gaia is undoubtedly the recipient.  I absolutely hate the ending to this game.  What started with seemingly endless potential finished going virtually nowhere.  Basically you beat the comet and oh all of the sudden the world changes to present day Earth.  What??  And it finishes in a SCHOOL??  With Will and friends wearing sweatshirts and school backpacks???!!!  Are you kidding me??!  This ending makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER, and is totally PATHETIC!!  Here's a SMALL list of all the things the ending did not answer or settle:

1) Did time just fast forward or something?  It takes a long time for continents to shift and for buildings to get built.  They DON'T JUST APPEAR DURING AN ENDING OF A SUPER NINTENDO GAME!!
2) Do any of the characters remember the journey?  Are they reincarnated?  Are they the same people as they were before?
3) Did non-humans go extinct?  What happened to the Angel Village people?  I also didn't see Lilly in the school shot.  Did Itory Village people just die out?
4) Kara never made up with her parents.  For all we know the teapot on Mt. Temple might have shown them to be spirits too.
5) Did Lance's parents ever get reunited?
6) Did the labor trade ever get stopped?  How did Neil do as company president?
7) Just what exact age was the time during the game supposed to be?  The new world with gray buildings and presumably technology is deemed by Will to be strange in the premonition, but Neil can build an airplane during the game??
8) What ended up happening to Bill and Lola?  Did they die?  Did they just forget about Will?
9) Does Will keep his telekinetic powers?

I cringe when I think of what Illusion of Gaia could have been, and wish I could tell the writers what morons they were when they wrote the story to this game.  It is still a solid game, but if the world design and story had been better, the game would have reached unimaginable heights.  You don't just leave things unsettled, change the world, and think everyone's going to be happy.  For a game of this genre that is not Zelda and is not plagued with Illusion of Gaia's problems, play Crystalis.",3.0
"I realize this game was released in 1994, which happens to be the year I was most interested in video games, and specifically, Super NES games.  I was addicted to the Super NES and probably played the darn thing every single day for the entire year.  I knew at the time that games like Zelda: Link to the Past were considered classics, and most people had that game and enjoyed it (though I can remember a few people who said they hated it, which is their opinion and they're entitled to it).  Back then I also knew that Zelda was not only an improvement over the original Legend of Zelda on the NES, but also an influence on many, many RPGs that the Super NES would soon have plenty of (and eventually be looked upon as the ultimate video game system when it came to RPGs).

Unfortunately, I never gave much notice to many of the RPGs back then, and instead I focused on Mario, Metroid and the Donkey Kong Country series.  For the most part, you can say I was more interested in platform games.  Back then I figured ""I have Zelda, I don't need anymore similar type games"".  Well, I admit I was wrong when I thought Zelda was the only good RPG on the Super NES, but in some cases, such as with Illusion of Gaia, I see that some games were *clearly* inferior to Zelda (despite the fact that popular gaming magazines back in 1994 praised Illusion of Gaia for being just as good as Zelda).  Now, I've only just experienced Illusion of Gaia for the first time a week ago, which would be in the middle of January 2006.  I missed out on this game in 1994.  It was probably best to leave it that way.

Right off the bat I'm bothered by the life bar for your main character.  You have a series of blue dots that serve as your life, and these dots are basically the same thing as your heart life bar from the Zelda series, and your main character goes around smacking enemies with his sword, just like Link.  Okay, it's not a sword, it's a flute.  Same thing, really.  But the game as a whole does leave you wondering if the game company (Enix) was trying to fool gamers into thinking this was something new and refreshing.  Years later, you can tell Illusion of Gaia is NOT so fresh, and in fact, it has a strong, dated feeling attached to it, I think.  People knew Zelda was the better game back then, and they still do to this day.  You can't fool gamers.  Some of the animation in Illusion of Gaia isn't quite up to the standard of other games at the time.  For instance, the way your main character Will runs around flapping his arms, and the way he slides into enemies.  It looks clunky and uninspiring.  The graphics in Illusion of Gaia, while colorful, detailed, and big, doesn't really have that extra something that makes Zelda: Link to the Past look so appealing.  It doesn't have that certain spark; or polished graphics.  Enix probably thought they created something special with this game, but it hasn't really held up over the years (except with a few hardcore gamers).

To switch gears and say something positive about the game, I think people are crazy to say the music in this game is bad.  Sure, it's not music you can instantly sing and dance to, but it's music that will grow on you the more you hear it.  It's really good music.  Just because you can't sing along to music doesn't mean it's not good.  This game is a great example of that.  The music is great, in every area.  To compare the music in this game to that in Actraiser.  I'd say the tunes in Illusion of Gaia overall cannot touch the high points in Actraiser, but they sure beat the low points, easily.  I remember one level theme in Actraiser had me pulling my hair out.  Nothing like that in Illusion of Gaia.

Maybe there's something wrong with my copy, but I've been having strange things happen.  For example, I reached the end of the game with 18 blue dots (let me mention again that these blue dots represent your life bar).  Okay, I shut the game off, go to sleep for 8 hours, wake up, play the game... and now I have 20 blue dots.  How did THAT happen?  Imagine if you were playing Zelda and you didn't collect all your heart containers, and then you wake up to find all the heart pieces right there on your file the next day!  That's what it's like in Illusion of Gaia.  Also, sometimes save points suddenly appear out of nowhere, and you clearly remember the last time you ran by that area a save point wasn't there.  So save points can appear and disappear.  Weird.  I also got stuck in one area of the game because an item that was supposed to be given to me by one of the characters WASN'T given to me, leaving me to forever wander around doing nothing.  I had no choice but to start over completely.  I have no idea what's going on here.  I've never experienced anything like this in ANY video game, and I've played my share of games!  I can only assume either my copy has a defect, or Enix is just a cheap game company (and Actraiser is pretty good, so it must be the former).

I have to take a point off for the constant frustration found in most of the dungeons.  You know how in a Zelda game when you walk into a dungeon and each of the rooms are filled with interesting and creative ideas, making it really fun to play the game over and over (and equally as important, making each room DISTINCT, so you know where you are?)  It's not quite like that here.  The design of the dungeons in Illusion of Gaia is, for the most part, bland and confusing.  You just run around slashing enemies, and there's not much in the way of interesting strategies to make it enjoyable for you to progress to the next room.  This is where you really have to admire the people who work on Zelda games.  They know how to make dungeon mazes interesting.  Zelda: Link to the Past featured ice, desert and water dungeons.  The people who did this game just made it sort of fun, but nothing truly memorable.  And the strategies to progress to the next room in Illusion of Gaia usually require something small and uninteresting (and sometimes obvious) making it feel more like a chore to do it.  And why does the very last dungeon maze in the game have only a few enemies?  We're talking about a BIG area to walk through, encountering the same couple enemies over and over.  Those laser eyeballs are EVERYWHERE and they're SO out of place for a final level in a game, and they're so easy to destroy.  Zelda: Link to the Past features WAY more enemies.  Compare the final level in this game to World 8 in Link to the Past.  Zelda destroys it.

I hate how sometimes in the game you have to backtrack to clear a dungeon, which means going to the end of the dungeon to grab an important item, and then go back to the very beginning to complete it.  Many times, this is easier said than done.  Take that super-irritating vine level for example.  The entire world is covered in vines that serve as a path you walk on, and each vine looks *exactly* the same, so it's possible you can wander around for hours just trying to find your way out of there.  I can't tell you how many times I pressed pause to reach for my magic mirror, only to come to the realization that this isn't Zelda, and so I have nothing to bring me back immediately to the entrance of the dungeon.  But... running around slashing skeleton heads, bats, and other strange-looking creatures is usually a lot of fun (despite the strange animation from Will) but is all this WORTH the frustration you most likely will encounter from the dungeon mazes?  Only when in the right mood.  At the end of other dungeons you fight huge bosses.  There's a total of six of them, and I think this is the games very best feature because these bosses are really fun, and you have to try and discover the best way to defeat them.  I don't think they're difficult to defeat, except for the very last boss.  That one is HARD!

Another bad thing about the game is the incredible amount of text you have to skim through.  The storyline is okay, but sometimes you don't feel like reading it which means you have to sit through a TON of text before the enemy-slashing section of the game comes in.  To start off the game, you have to sit through, even if you skim over it as quickly as possible, 10 MINUTES of text.  10 minutes of your characters talking to each other, and it's not even very interesting.  They say things to each other that typical children would say.  Eventually you will come across a love story between the children!  But hey, I'm no expert on RPGs, so you may very well find the dialogue to be the games strong point.  Given a choice between this and Zelda, make the right choice and go with Zelda.  It's slightly more expensive to buy, but definitely more worth it.  However, Illusion of Gaia is a pretty nice game on its own.  I know it sounds like I'm bashing the game, but I don't mean to.  Just don't go in expecting a classic.",3.0

"Wild Arms is an old game. Obviously, since the last review for it was written in 1999. This was the second RPG I've ever played, and as such, it holds a place in my heart. I have recently replayed it, so I thought I'd write a review since Amazon decided it would be a good recomendation for me.
Obviously, the game looks outdated, and that's because it is. The 2D overworld retains it's charm for me, as I've always enjoyed the artwork that goes into making games, as opposed the the final 3D renderings, especially in this era of 3D graphics. I'll just out and say it, the combat scenes, which are done in 3D, are terrible by todays standards. I mean, awful! LOL. The combat is pretty standard RPG fare, so if you've played Final Fantasy, or any other turn-based RPG, you'll feel right at home here. You start the game with three characters, and don't gain any new party members through your quest. While that's kind of lame, I liked the decision. I didn't have to hem and haw over which characters I wanted in my party just because I liked one more than another. This also allowed them to delve deeper into the character personalities and pasts, another part that I enjoyed of the game. I rooted for Jack and his quest for power, I saw the sadness in Cecelia when she realized that people only treated her nice because they knew she was a princess, I felt for Rudy when people shunned him just because he knew how to use ancient technology that people deemed evil, even when he used it to save their lives. The story is the high point of this game, perhaps even more so today, what with all the 'Green' living that's emphasized today. Since it deals with the death of the planet, the loss of natural rescources and such, it has a very eco-conscious view. The music is very nice, and has a very western feel to it. In fact, it was this meld of Western and Sword and Sorcery that originally attracted me to the game.
Ultimately, play this game for the story. The graphics are old and out-dated, though the 2D segments remain charming and the gameplay is typical RPG fare. If you have a PSP or a PS3, I reccomend that you download it from the playstation store for 5.99. If not, then buy the disc, you won't be dissapointed.",3.0

"When reading the box and manual, they keep pushing the idea of a 3D game. The characters are more or less in 3 dimensions, as well as items in the game. The background moves at a different speed than the pathways adding to the illusion.

The game is fun, challenging, and entertaining. Though there is a lack of points to be earned, killing all the enemies gain you nothing but the pleasure of the ""bong"" sound. Extra lives are in the form of balloons and collecting 100 bananas. The ability to switch between Donky(heavy attacks) and Diddy(high jumps) on the fly adds to level complexity. If you can find them you can ride an ostrich, rhino, or a swordfish that help with their special abilities.",3.0
"What's sad is that this game seemed like a huge achievement back in '94. Maybe I was too young to realize it back then. Maybe it was lack of experience. I thought this game rocked when it first came out, and unfortunately I'm no longer sure why.

To me, it seems this is a fairly average platformer wrapped up in a beautiful package. The graphics were novel and unique at the time, but I guess now I just think they're awkward and weird looking. My main beef with the game is the control and the frustrating level design. The mine cart stages and the ones where you have to fire yourself from barrel to barrel...somehow I beat this when I was 6. I can't fathom how I did that now.

Another minor problem is that the bosses are all pretty easy. Four hits usually does the trick.

The only reason I'm not really crazy about this game is because it is really long.  A friend and I played this game for entire weekend once and we still weren't done with the game.  It's not as long as RAMPAGE UNIVERSAL TOUR but I assure you, it was starting to feel like it after a while.  At least the really cool weapons and other cool items that you could use during the game made up for it.
I'd have to say rent this one first, just to be sure you're going to be feeling it later because like I said, the game is kinda long.  I still think it's fun but for gamers that are just looking for a quick fighting buzz, this might not be for you.",3.0

"Though it's not incredibly unique or impressive, Final Fight 3 does pack a pretty good punch. It pales in comparison to Final Fight 2 and it's not really even as classic as the first one, though the playability is better because the difficulty is more tame. Just like the Streets of Rage series, it seems that this installment was a little rushed. And as long as we're talking beat-em-ups, though it's apples and oranges, I did enjoy SOR3 much better than FF3. The story line of FF3 seems a bit more intriguing than the others, because it's not too far fetched and you're basically taking care of street gangs that are trying to throw riots around the city. Much more believable than traveling around the world beating up stray members of the Mad Gear in back alleys and restaurants, and it doesn't lack updated story progress like the first one.

Improvements I would say are the gameplay, the dash feature is an incredible step up, because you can run at your opponents (haha, payback time Andore) and create any kind of combo (except for Dean, he just slides and trips them...yawn). The damage done with characters like Guy and Haggar with this dashing move are substantial, and sometimes can drain half of your opponent's life bar. Looks like the scales are finally balanced here Capcom, Thank you! You can also hop backwards to avoid fire and opponents' attacks which helps a lot.

I'd say the difficulty is average. A little too easy at first (you'll see what I mean) but as you progress through the game the difficulty redeems itself to classic final fight status.

I'd like it if after every round the storyline updates you on where you're going and why. For instance, first I'm at a Chinese restaurant and now I'm at a welding factory. How did I get there and what am I doing there? It's like they gave up after the first two rounds and only tell you what's going on before the big boss. Who is the big boss? Why is he so angry? (can you feel me?)

The sound also is below par (the hits are almost inaudible) and every time you pause the game you listen to 7 seconds of ""pause"" music before it stops. The grammar is bad in some spots (Congratulations. Now try next level.) The game baddies are a bit boring and some of them don't really do anything ('Joe' kicks you in the back of the head once in awhile, and 'Hunter' will swing his bat if you leave him open for about 4 seconds). As I said though, the difficulty evens itself out. Defeating the end boss was less than rewarding but welcomes you back to play the game again at a harder difficulty.

Overall I thought this game was 'fair'. Not fantastic, not good, not even horrible, but 'fair'.

"Everone knows that Nintendo is not quite known for creating fighting games. The company is known for its signature Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda and Metroid games. However Nintendo teamed up with Rare to create a fighting game which used a technology similar to their hit 1994 game, Donkey Kong Country. The result was the arcade fighter Killer Instinct. The SNES version was releasd in 1995.
The story behind the game, as with most fighting games, is quite lame. An organisation called ""Ultratech"" is pitting various fighters against each other for its own ulterior motives. There are ten fighters which are Thunder, Cinder, Glacius, Fulgore, Jago, Orchid, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal and T.J. Combo. The characters themselves show a fair amount of variation, from the ninja-ish Jago to the robotic Fulgore to the dinosaur Riptor to the red indian Chief Thunder. The boss is Eyedol. The game offers a vast amount of moves for each character, including special moves, secret ""combo-breakers,"" ultra combos, finishing moves, humiliations (a bit like Mortal Kombat's ""friendships""), stage fatalities and more. What Killer Instinct is really known for are the combos. Depending on the number of hits they range from ""triple"" to ""blaster"" to ""monster"" to ""ultra."" Despite all this variation, I only enjoyed a few characters like Jago, Combo, Cinder and Thunder.
Just as in the Donkey Kong Country games, the graphics are amazing. The backgrounds range from medieval castles to rooftops to factories to canyons. The fighters have fluid animation, flashy moves and various coloured outfits to choose from. The sound effects are not bad, but some characters make weird noises, for example, Cinder, Glacius and Riptor. The music is extremely well done. Each background has music which matches its atmosphere. I loved Jago's stage back then (a bit like Ryu's from Street Fighter II). The game controls quite well, but some attacks are unavoidable and quite often you'll get beaten up by some cheap move, despite how strategic you get. The game balance is also a bit off. If you want to win, choose Combo, Jago or Fulgore. If you want to lose, pick Sabrewulf, Riptor or Spinal. Ironically, the computer controlled Spinal provides a good challenge. Eyedol is also a worthy opposition, but like I said above, if you make a single wrong move somewhere, you may end up getting beaten up continuously until you die.
Overall however, for a company that's been making side-scrolling action games and adventure games, Killer Instinct is a surprisingly good effort in the fighting game department. If you want a really solid game for your SNES, with great graphics and music that will provide hours of fun and amusement, Killer Instinct is for you.",3.0

"For its day in age KI was a very fun game but the limited capabilities of the SNES really show through over time.  The arcade game was awesome and probably the most addicting and fun of all the fighting games out at the time.  But this home console version always felt lacking.  Nintendo redid all the endings, many of the fatalities look cheap and nothing like the arcade version.  All the 3D elements are gone this is a straight up 2D fighter.

It kind of reminded me of Virtua Fighter for the Sega Genesis a 3D game that was ported over badly to a 2D console.  Now KI on the SNES is a much better game than VF on the Genesis but both titles never lived up to the pure fun of the arcade versions.  I always disliked seeing the bodies spinning once you knock them off a building or platform and then bounce like a bouncy ball once they hit bottom.  Kind of a cheap stupid effect.

Simple cosmetic details like frost coming off Glacius or flames sparking off of Cinder are not present.  Besides Eyedol's ending most of the games endings seem cheaply done.  You do not get both the Eyedol death scenes like in the arcade game just a simple redone version of him falling to his death.  You can play as Eyedol which is a cool feature and it is similar to the arcade where you can continue as many times as you want, none of this set number of lives BS like in the MK games.  All the characters made it to the home console and are fun to play so the core gameplay experience is still there.  Nintendo did get all the combo moves in the game which was one of the games biggest highlights.

Overall KI has not really aged well on this system.  The true replay value comes into play when you play against your friends head to head.  Beating the computer will get old rather quickly.  I would rate the game 3 1/2 stars.  It is definitely one of the best fighting games on the SNES but I would not rate it higher than SF2, or MK2 which remain more faithful to the arcade console experience.  I bought this when it first came out for $75 at Toys R Us store.  It should be about $10 to $20 definitely not worth more than that there are much better games out there for your money and time or find the original arcade version its great.

"3 stars is pretty good for me as i have yet to give a game 5 stars and i would say max payne is maybe 3 and a half. i won't really go into the plot much of this game as its always the easiest info to come across. i'll just give you my positives and my complaints that lead to my score.

positive:

a good story!,

i find video games woefully deficient in this regard normally and when people talk about good stories at best i think it is relative. i am still waiting for a great story, but found mp to be one of the (few) reasonably solid ones. as a fan of cutscenes i thought i would miss them more than i did (the story is told through quite good graphic novel panels). the ending in particular is notably satisfying, with the gameplay integrating well and interestingly with the action itself to produce an actual, mostly reasonable, closed ending conclusion (shockingly rare in computer games!).

you can save the game anytime.

looks pretty nice for a dated game, not beautiful, but can be stylish.

good gameplay balance and feel, i liked the voice acting and characters, film noir theme worked quite well (i enjoyed the lack of monsters!) interesting progression of improved weapons, gameplay mechanics sound, self adjusting difficulty levels a little bit of an odd concept, but actually worked pretty well (the game adjusts the difficulty level according to how you're doing), i like my games a bit on the easier side of things and the level of challenge here was really pretty good for me. i had really only a couple notably frustrating times (one a run through a burning building), but i've had  worse. also, i LIKED the length of this game! it is a common complaint that it was too short, but i find very few games are actually anywhere good or interesting enough to hold my interest all the way through as they all end up as more of the same after awhile. 12 to 15 hours (a guess, i don't exactly recall) is a very good length for a shooter and seemed just right for max payne.

you might also enjoy that this game should work on even a pretty dated system today (i found the game very stable with its patch), and that you should be able to get it for dirt cheap.

negatives:

the extremely interesting bullet time feature, while cool, actually gives no advantage that i can tell. if anything it was a disadvantage mostly and you're better off just barging through or in (they fix this in max payne 2, but do worse on other accounts).

there are alot of locked doors as in ""hmm this door is locked, i'll try that one, oh, i tried that already.""

the gameplay is not notably diverse, shooting, navigating, a bit of light puzzle solving. the gritty urban world is okay, but not all that interesting to explore or anything.

conclusion: this is a very good meat and potatoes action adventure shooter. it will not blow you away but is pretty fun and as good as pretty much anything else in its genre (taking into account its age which probably means less than most of us ""newest thing"" addicts are inclined to admit). i recommend it.",3.0
"Max Payne has been dubbed as revolutionary and innovative by video game critics and fans alike, but guess what? It's neither. When I first played this game, I was drawn in by the graphics, which is one of the few things I like about this game. The story is pretty confusing and uninteresting, and was illustrated in a hard-on-the-eyes comic-book style, where it was layed out in frames and word bubbles and drawn in an unusual fashion. The main drawback of this game is how repetitive it gets. This is the general flow of this game:

Go into a room. Do some bullet time. Kill some guys. Repeat.

MAYBE a cutscene.

Boring? Yep. Repetitive? Yep. Revolutionary? Nope. I barely got halfway through the game before getting tired of the grind of Max Payne, but I heard jumping off the twin towers and trying to hit parked cars is fun, but I never got that far into the game. If you like first-person shooters, stick with Half-Life or Battlefield 1942, or even Halo. This game is overrated as hell, and bored me to tears. Go home Max Payne.",3.0

"This is not a bad review for Max Payne, because Max Payne is not a bad game. It is, however, incredibly short and it leaves you feeling disappointed. I was excited to get this game, because I had been playing ""Grand Theft Auto 3"", so I was definitely going through my shoot-`em-up phase. However, it didn't take me long to become bored with it. In the end, it maybe took me a week to complete, and I didn't spend hours at a time playing it. When this happens, you don't feel as though you got your money's worth. Sure, Max has some great features, like the very Matrix-y Bullet-Time feature, that slows down time and allows you to dodge bullets. Though very cool-looking, I found this feature very difficult to use, and found myself dodging few, if any, bullets while in this mode. The graphics are great, and the storyline is respectable enough (in the beginning, his wife and baby are murdered - who can't sympathize with that?). But by the time I finished the game, I didn't have that usual feeling of satisfaction. I wasn't sad that it was over. In fact, I was a little relieved. I'm sorry to say it, but I can't say I got my money's worth. I will probably never play it again; it will just sit on my shelf collection dust. But, I'm giving it 3 stars because it is a fairly clever game, it did present me with a few challenges, and it was considered PC game of the year by numerous gaming magazines. I guess I can see why most people like it, I was just expecting more.",3.0
"This games is not as bad as everyone says it is. I will admit I have not played it all the way through, but I have played worse RPGs. The graphics are not great, and the storyline is a little dry and the characters don't really develop. Yes, this game lacks, but its not down right awful. Although with the release of the PS2 and all the new RPGs hitting the market, you can easily find a RPG that would be much more fun!",3.0

"Bought this confusing it with Royal Rumble for Sega. I mostly just collect old games & wanted to have Hogan in it. I don't expect it to be the greatest, but this game truly was leaps behind Rumble. There's no gameplay modes as usually is, just basic 1-on-1, tag & 4-on-4. I'm not sure of finishers, but I doubt there is any. Controls are pretty bad & gameplay is clunky & dated. It's still decent for nostalgia & a little kid may get some fun from it, but this was one of the worst of that class of late 80s/early 90s wrestling games. Get Rumble or even Steel Cage, this gameplay's subpar. OR better yet just listen to the midi themes & NEVER play the game mode lol.",3.0
"i remember getting this for christmas as a kid, at the time this game was very fun, infact it's still one of my guilty pleasures but this game today is severly out dated and people who grew up on sd vs raw and all that would probobly get bored with this very quick, especially since all the wrestlers have the same exact moves and there isn't very many wrestlers to choose from",3.0
"This game was always pretty cool to me when it first came onto the scene. But it has no tornaments or many match options. Every charactor has the exact same moves.

"Wow heres a game I havn't played in like a decade or so. Think this game came out in 1991 or something (I got some free poster with it much like the nes game of wrestle challenge that had more glitches than anything i've ever played). This game wasn't bad except that finishing moves were non existant. what got me more was at the same time wrestlemania for sega genesis came out and they all had finishing moves yet the graphics and sound were lousy compared to the snes (plus had some different guys in it). As I said, this one wasn't bad, but could of been better. Oh for the person who put nasty boys in here, i thought it was legion of doom that ws in here, not nasty boys? I know they were in the sega cd of steel cage challenge yet if i remember right, that had no tag team option in that one (programers with such limited resources to work with). Actually the only reason games are good nowadays is because the wrestlers have more interaction in how the game is and how its set up with them specifically (minus the legends like Andre and others that are either deceased or trademarked by WWE so they do whatever with them). I'm kinda shocked that this game is sold for so much since I see it occasionally in game stores for like less than $5 but if you see it there for that cheap, get it for the heck of it, its hard to say cause most of the guys on there I think are on ""legends of wrestling"" games nowadays. Like I said, ok at the time, by todays standards, a forgetable mistake.",3.0
"This game is a horrible game. The graphics suck, every one of the 8 wrestlers have the exact same moves and the sound is freaky,like a cow throwing up or something.

"This game is not good by any means, but it is a stepping stone to building a better game. There are twelve wrestlers, Hulk Hogan, Jake the Snake, Ted Dibiase, Randy Savage, Sid, the Undertaker, the Nasty Boys and the Natural Disasters. Each of these wrestlers has the exact same moves! There are no special / finnishing manuvers either. The game is nothing like the present wrestling games, such as the fact that there is only one arena and present games have seven or more arenas. There is however several types of matches, such as single, tag team, and Survivor Series matches.",3.0
"If u want a good shooter game, get Red Faction. I have a good pc so i wanted to save 10 bucks buying this game for pc instead of ps2. I thought it would be a good game. NOPE. Since u cant use a controller for this stupid game, i have to use the mouse and keyboard. when some1 attacks u from behind in ps2, u turn aronund and aim with the right analog, which is EXTREMEMLY easy and it always hits the spot. In this version, u turn around with the arrows (which are far away from the action buttons) and u have to aim with the mouse which is extrememly sensitive. I beat the first 3 levels before realizing that i cant do this without a controller. Rockstar could have done better, like they did with gta3, which is the best game.",3.0
"Killer Instinct is a 1 on 1 arcade style fighting game made by one of the best game companies at the time Rare. I always loved the arcade game, but never really got into the Super Nintendo version. It has all the characters from the arcade version (Fulgore, Black Orchid, TJ Combo, Cinder, Glacius, Sabrewolf, Chief Thunder, Spinal and Spinal). Each of the characters have their own special moves and fighting styles. The game features combos that test your skills. The combos really feek like a scoring system and not just a way to damage your opponent. There are fatalities (or finishers) and humiliations that you can pull off at the end of a fight. The game looks good with the digitized 3D graphics, but it feels sub par compared to the arcade.

The music was always a standout for this game for getting you pumped to play or fight. It is so good that I even have the soundtrack to it.

There's nothing wrong with the game, but it feels sub par compared to Mortal Kombat games at the time. Of course this was the first in a franchise while Mortal Kombat was already 3 games in. Killer Instinct just feels like its missing something that Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat had. Its got the great music and great combos. maybe it just came out too little too late.",3.0

"Primal Rage, for what it was worth wasn't that bad of a game. But in the same respect, it wasn't as good either. The graphics were excellent. Not sloppy, very clean, it looked similar to the Arcade hit and all out, they did a good job with how the game looked. If you are a person that needs the visuals of a game to come out, this was for you.
Now for those who didn't enjoy this game on the home version, this might be why, Although stunning in graphics, it lacked the originality in the gameplay. This game followed or should I say, held on by the coat tails of the success of Mortal Kombat. Now, there's nothing wrong with trying to achieve the success that Mortal Kombat had. Heck, at the time when this game came out, Mortal Kombat was one of the platforms for Great Fighting Games.
However this game could not cut it on the home system. Why?
One, the controls. The controls were already confusing in the Arcade. What made it worse for the home system was that to unleash certain combos you either had to be quicker than Billy ""the Kid"" or you had to hold the controller like a geek (left hand the correct way and the right hand off, pressing the buttons with your thumb, index and middle fingers). ... And the fact that if you were holding any of the buttons trying to do a special move, you couldn't do anything but stand still and get hit.
Now what's fun about getting beat down? Nothing.
The other thing that bothered me about this game was that all of the fights were way too predictable. For instance, primate Blizzard, his standard set of offense as the Computer (on any level mind you) was, Freeze (preferrably in the air), unleash 9 - 12 hit combo and repeat. Very boring and once you statred to realize that, the game's replay value went from fair to low. Not good.
This is another classic game that you could leave off your list to collect but at the same time, it's not that bad to have around once you get good at it.",3.0
"Max Payne is like an exaggerated version of a typical no-brains action movie.  On one hand, the heightened action, the thrilling ""bullet-time"" innovation, and arsenal of weapons get your adrenalin pumping; on the other, incredibly bad stylistic choices prevented me from enjoying this game to the max.
First, the plusses.  I am a *big* fan of John Woo's action movies, and Max Payne's action gameplay evokes them very well.  I had been suspicious of the ""bullet-time"" technique before playing the game, but it turned out to be pretty easy to use, and yes, it does look dead gorgeous.  Control of the character is pretty fluid, and your control over your jumps feels quite snug.  Just the look of the surroundings and the characters in-game is great, with beautiful lighting effects, explosions, and good detail.
And now on to the problems...
For a game that champions its stylistic conceits so vocally, Max Payne fails disastrously in the area of aesthetics.  True, the explosions and gunfights look good (though pretty damned violent), but why, oh why did they not bother to cast proper actors to play the characters?  When the characters are just drawn in computer, they look fine.  But whenever they use photo captures, such as during the drop-dead boring ""graphic novel"" sequences, all the characters look like they are either played by people in the development team and their friends, or they had found actors so bad, so thoroughly incapable of dramatic expression, that they look like people in a game development team.  Either way, Max Payne features the worst acting I've ever seen even in video games, and their image is equally atrocious:  ""Mona"" looks like a twentysomething neighbour rather than a mob hitwoman, and Max himself looks so much the dolt that it's a real drag playing as him.  Not to mention the fact that he CAN'T SHUT UP.  The comic-book aspect of the game's style is easily the worst idea they had.  By translating comic-book-style writing into direct voice-over, Max Payne shows just how bad comic-book writing is as a whole.  This stuff was never meant to be said out loud.  Of course, the writers (if you could call them that) were so enamoured with every syllable they had written, they used everything -- serving to bog down the one element of this game that works, which is the action.  And the graphic novel parts look just ridiculous, but take up about 30% of your gametime if you let them play out.  Comic books are very hard to take seriously, and when you try to mix this style with the melodramatic, dead-serious style of the John Woo movies this game emulates, you have an absolute stylistic disaster.  This was why when Max encounters his dead baby and wife, I actually burst out laughing.  The terrible acting and writing, served up in Hong Kong melodrama style, entirely sabotaged any engagement I might have had in Max's situation.
The two ""drug sequences"" were actually a pretty neat idea, but they screwed it up by designing mazes and long, arduous ""puzzles"" that would make your eyes glue up, so unengaging and drawn out are they.  This game is very weak on the puzzle front.  Where games like Syphon Filter and Medal of Honor keep you interested by making sure you always know what your objectives are at any given point, in Max Payne, it's usually a matter of walking through the level and trying to use/shoot everything in sight in a trial-and-error attempt to find what the game developers want you to do next.  Sometimes you can find the right door, but you have to wait for the pesky enemies to open it for you.  And in terms of level design, you end up having to go back to old places so often that it's drop-dead tiresome.
I enjoyed the action portions of this game immensely.  But it seems to me this development team only succeeded in creating half a good game.  If Max Payne were as ""gritty"" as some reviewers called it, and if they had bothered to hire real actors rather than cast everyone they know, and if they had good writers who were dramatists rather than comic-book doodlers, they probably would've had an absolute classic on their hands.  As it is, Max Payne is a technical breakthrough, but its aesthetics are so twisted around that it's impossible not to deride its shortcomings.",3.0
"This is a really fun game, and is one of the better fighting games for the SNES. You play as one of 7 beasty Dinosaurs/prehistoric beasts and battle each one 2 the death on a different continent, when you win you take that land, and when its all complete you gotta work on those tail jabs and kicks, chow down on some half naked worshipers, and sharpen does teeth for the Final battle! And face all of your enemies in one final MEGA round 2 become ruler of the new EARTH! I will say its a good game but it has a lot of cons, but some pros when compared to other ports

For one thing this port has some of the worsed animation I have seen, the Genesis version has superior game speed and higher frame rate for the animation so it looks way better and plays better as well. Some of the backgrounds also look pourly desighned when compared too other ports as well. The music is also kind of weak as well. The one stand out area though for the SNES version of this game is the SOUND! Some of the sounds of the dinos roars to the sound of pounding kicks, flesh ripping bites, and explosions sound like the arcade.

However, I would have too recommend the Genesis version of this game, or the Playstation/Saturn versions also. But this version is ok, its still a pretty fun game overall.",3.0
"I must preface this by saying this game brings back a bit of nostalgia for me.  That said, I enjoy the game probably more than I should.  I used to own the action figures of this game many moons ago.  I would say it plays like a cheap Mortal Kombat.  It's got gore.  It's got fighting.  It has a decent storyline.  I'm not a big fan of Mortal Kombat (because I suck at it and I'm a button masher).  I think that's pretty much the gist of it.  Having said that, it's not a bad game to kill some time and have a little fun.  I would recommend this game more for people that appreciate all games...not people that are looking for an engaging game.",3.0
This was far better than the genisis mess version but the controls are still too complicated and the gameplay sucks.,3.0
"The graphics in this game are very realistic from the people, to the bullet holes in the walls.  The only thing that isn't realisitc is when somebody dies and lays flat over an edge and doesn't conform to the step.  The fire in the game looks very realistic.
The game lacks Multiplayer.  This game would be loads better if it was multiplayer.
Bullet Time slows down time to allow you to kill all enemy's in a room with out getting killed yourself.  Due to the time being slowed down, the graphics FPS will shoot through the roof, unless you have a really ...bad computer.
The game gets very boring after you beat it.  You can get lost in the levels if you stray from the path, it's sort of annoying.  I recommend playing it at a friends house or simply borrow it from a friend and play it, not worth buying.",3.0

"Max Payne is the title of the new third person shooter from Remedy Entertainment, it is also the title of the lead character in this 10-15 hour epic of John Woo proportions. I, like many others, have been following this games development ever since the incredible screenshots first started appearing on the web, a few years ago. Am I disappointed in the results? Well, lets review this bad boy and find out.
Graphics
Remedy has been touting this game as "" Realism to the Max"". Is this a true statement? Yes and No. The graphics in some instances are light years ahead of previous titles, while in others they seem to be on par, or a little behind the competition. Let's take an in-depth look at the graphics in Max Payne, to see just where it stands. One note, I ran the game with all effects set to the Maximum, and I had acceptable frame rates.
Particle System Remedy has done a great job on the particle system. The fire and the snow are two standouts here. I know many games have implemented weather effects in the past, but Remedy seems to be the first to realize, snow rarely falls in a straight path. The snow in Max Payne, just like the Real World?, falls in a angular descent. I know this doesn't sound like much, but it definitely adds to the realism of the snow bound city you will be playing in, for part of the game. Next is the fire. The fire in this game is game is likewise very realistic. The fire definitely has a sense of volume to it (I can't think of any other game that does this convincingly) , and it generally behaves in the way you think it should. Some of the other particle effects, such as the water spray when you splash through sewers, are not quite as impressive, however. The particle system, in some instances seems to be tied to a pretty robust physics engine, which we will cover later in the review. For now, Particle System- Realism to the Max? Yes.
Reflections and Shadows
In a game that touts photorealism, reflections and shadows seem to be conspicuously absent in the game. Max Payne, like other games in the genre, seems to have it's fair share of bathrooms in the game. And just like it's real world counterparts mirrors make up part of their interiors. However, the mirrors in Max Payne reflect nothing, zilch, zero, nada. The shadows in the game, are of the blob type, similar to Tomb Raider and it's ilk. No projected shadows here. Many other games have incorporated projected shadows of late, and I'll be honest, I was kind of disappointed they weren't included in this game. Reflections and Shadows- Realism to the Max? No.
Textures
Reportedly, Remedy used a digital camera to capture all the textures in the game. Does it show? Yes, my friend it does. The texture work in this game is the biggest leap the genre has taken in approaching photorealism by far. The title character seem to benefit the most from this technique, but the levels and weapons seem to agree with this treatment as well. Are you going to mistake the game characters and settings for the real thing ? No, but it does do an incredible job of immersing you in the game. The shaders on the guns also have a nice chrome effect, but they are kind of tiny and it really isn't that noticeable. Textures- Realism to the Max? Yes.
Physics
I included the physics engine in the graphics portion of the review, because it effects the aesthetics of the game more than the game play itself. Like I noted previously in the review, the particles system is tied to the physics engine. How does this impact the realism in the game you ask? (well maybe you didn't ask, but I'll tell you anyway) First, When you fire a weapon shell casings realistically eject, fall, and bounce around just like you would expect. Just don't stick around to watch them disappear, as this kinda ruins the moment. Take that same gun and fire a couple of rounds into any object in the game, and the object will likewise be destroyed in an equally convincing manner. For instance, glass shatters; wine barrels ( or grape juice barrels if you prefer) start sporting a leak; tiles shatter (ala the Matrix); money flies around; dry wall will now show a hole with plaster pouring out, you get the picture. It was so cool to watch the physics in the game, I would run around shooting anything and everything, just to see what would happen next. Physics- Realism to the Max? Yes.
Animation and Models
Lets tackle the animation first. The walk and run cycles seem to be a little unnatural. The knees and lower legs of the enemies seem to bend at odd angles and they look a little stiff to boot. Another sore spot in the animation is Max's standard jump, pitiful is a word that comes to mind. There is no anticipation of the jump or follow through in the jump cycle. It's a straight up and down jump, and very unnatural. Facial animation is rather nonexistent in the game, Max seems to sport that same squinty eyed Clint Eastwood expression throughout the whole game. I do give Remedy a hand, they don't show the faces of the characters very often as they talk. This kind of hides the fact that their lips aren't moving. On the other end of the spectrum, the slow-motion dive and roll is definitely a winner. It's very well done and convincing.
The modeling of the characters is pretty well done. They aren't exactly the most detailed models in the world, but the texture work seems to put the details in anyway. The rest of the modeling seems to be adequate as well, though the vehicles are rather blocky and unconvincing. Animation and Models- Realism to the Max? Some parts yes, but as whole no.
Architecture and Level Design.
The team at Remedy earned their paycheck in this department. The levels sport a very realistic look to them, in every sense of the word. The office building in particular had me feeling like I was viewing an architectural walkthrough. The city streets are populated with shops and homes that looks like they were ripped straight out of a NYC tourism pamphlet. And the interiors of these buildings are packed full of attention to detail on a scale I've yet to see in a video game, bar none. This is another area where the texture work paid big dividends. Architecture and Level Design- Realism to the Max? Yes.
Lighting
Remedy ads also say this game is the first to have real time radiosity lighting. What is radiosity? Radiosity is basically (very basic mind you) a physically accurate method of calculating light, whereby objects pick up some of the color from surrounding objects . Sounds pretty radical, huh? Well the results aren't that radical. The only time I really noticed it is around the barrels of fire on the city street, they cast a noticeable orange glow on the bricks of the building. I suppose the whole goal of radiosity lighting is so you don't notice it though. There are no garish weird color lights, like Unreal ( purple?). There is also a rather well done glow around neon lights. And as a whole the lighting is rather well done. The whole thing kind of screams subtlety (screams subtlety?). One other thing, the lights do not seem to cast any shadows that move as you move. So uncheck real-time shadows. Lighting- Realism to the Max? A subtle yes, with a shadowy no.
Graphics conclusion
As a gamer, I was pretty pleased at the graphics in this game. They do a convincing job of portraying a real world NYC. As someone who was expecting the new paradigm in 3d graphics, I was a little disappointed in the lack of convincing shadows and reflections, but impressed by the physics based particle system and photo-realistic textures. If I was to give them a letter grade, I would give them an A-.
Gameplay
Basics
OK, so now we know this is a purty game, but how does it play? Well think John Woo meets the Matrix meets Charles Bronson, and you won't be far off. The game is played from a third person perspective like Tomb Raider, rather than the first person perspective of your typical shooter (e.g. Quake, Unreal, etc..). The camera and targeting problems, normally associated with the third person perspective, seem to be nonexistent. The game also has a pretty liberal save game feature, allowing you to save the game at any time. The load times for each level are pretty average for a typical shooter ( 30 seconds or so), but the subsequent reload from a quick save is instantaneous. Story
The games starts off with your character ( Max Payne) at the top of a skyscraper, surrounded by the NYC police department. He then goes on to explain, how he ended up in this rather precarious predicament. So you flash back to a few years earlier, when you, as a NYC detective, come home to find your family brutally murdered by some drug crazed maniacs. You then flash forward to a few days ago, where you are working undercover in the DEA to infiltrate the mob family behind the hit on your family. What follows is a series of double crosses and shootouts, until the end of the game, where you end up right where the whole thing started. Each part of the story progresses through a series of comic book style cut scenes. The story and some of the dialogue are chock full of clich&eacute;'s. But as a whole, the story is rather w",3.0
"It's not often that one comes across a game like Donkey Kong Land 2, a game where the inefficiencies within are so obviously apparent that it simply boggles the mind. Of course, before I get into what's really wrong with Donkey Kong Land 2 I should probably admit that I played through the GameBoy trilogy in a rather strange order (III, original and then 2) but in hindsight I can't help but think this is part of the reason I was able to see through Donkey Kong Land 2's false facade and see it for the flawed creation that it is.

So what's wrong with Donkey Kong Land 2? Well, it actually quite simple. Unlike the original Donkey Kong Land which featured new, original levels, Land 2 tries to emulate the SNES original as closely as possible. The levels aren't dead-on recreations but they are close, so close that this game doesn't really have an identity. Now I know some people will find such a statement ironic given that the gameplay makes the experience here far from original but with Land 2 trying it's hardest to emulate Donkey Kong Country 2 you can't help but reflect on that game when playing this one and, well, you have to admit that Diddy's Kong Quest is 1) a great game and 2) vastly superior to this game when it comes to its non-superficial aspects. That's pretty damning on its own, but once you throw in the slightly squirrely controls and the lackluster sound programming (seriously, the fact that certain pieces of music fail to play in the appropriate levels is strangely off-putting) the experience just starts to cave in on itself.

Of course this doesn't mean you can't enjoy Donkey Kong Land 2 but as a game it left a lot less of an impact on me than Land III or the original. It is a real shame that such a low point falls in the middle of the trilogy and not at the beginning or end as most people will probably agree it's easier to justify a weak start or finish. However, I guess I can't criticize the game too much as I can think of a small handful of great trilogies that were somewhat tainted by an under-performing game. Ninja Gaiden III on the Nintendo, Xenosaga II on the PlayStation 2... the list goes on. Still, when it comes to the Donkey Kong Land series I don't have a doubt that Donkey Kong Land 2 is the odd man out.",3.0
Arrived on time.  Classic version as expected.  works ok.  I remembered it as more fun than it now is. Thanks for the memories,3.0
"There's something in particular about Donkey Kong Land 2 that REALLY bugs me.  It honestly bugs me to the point that I have to take off 2 whole stars from the overall rating.

Despite the fact that the gameplay is *extremely* fun, it doesn't change the fact that, despite some really small changes here and there, DKL2 is basically the same exact game as Donkey Kong Country 2 for the Super NES.  It's true.

For those of you who are quite experienced with DKC2, just look at the map when the game begins, and explore some of the levels.  You're actually playing the same game as DKC2.  You'll realize this very quickly.

This is a problem to me.  Oh sure, if you love Donkey Kong Country 2 and would like to play the same game while traveling somewhere with your Game Boy, this game will do the job just fine.

Hey, this *is* still a really fun platform game in every single aspect.  No one can deny that.  It's just that you absolutely do NOT need this game if you own and enjoy Donkey Kong Country 2.  It's not necessary at *all* to own this game.

This is the biggest difference of all compared to the *first* Donkey Kong Land game.  When THAT game was being made, the developers took the successful formula of Donkey Kong Country and actually took the time to develop completely different levels for the Game Boy incarnation, so the whole game felt like you were playing a bunch of additional levels that could have very well fit into the first Donkey Kong Country game.  90% of the levels felt completely different from anything in DKC.

DKL2 however, is clearly ripping off the *same exact levels* as the ones from Donkey Kong Country 2, so while it's not a horrible game by any means, it's just a completely pointless one unless of course -like I said above- you are going on a long car ride somewhere and really feel the need to play the same game in handheld form.

Oh, and on a side note, there's also another problem with DKL2.  Lack of detail.  No, I'm not talking about the background environments.  Those are just fine.  I'm talking about an overall lack of detail concerning the variety of bananas, coins and enemies that you collect in each and every level.  Too much pointless running forward with not enough enemy pouncing or item collecting makes a good portion of this game a chore to go through.

Still, I don't hate this game or anything.  It's just a pointless game to me.  Pick up the first Donkey Kong Land instead.",3.0

"I remember in middle school when this game came out, my friends would talk about it all the time and often compare it to Illusion of Gaia.  I couldn't contribute to the discussion since back then I wasn't familiar with either game but now, since I'm familiar with both, I think Illusion of Gaia is a superior game, if only slightly.  I believe comparisons to Secret of Mana would have been more appropriate, though.

While I admire an action-oriented RPG approach instead of the turn based style (that I never understood the appeal of by the way- why am I *forced* to take damage if I don't want to?) Secret of Evermore surely feels more appropriate for the turn based audience despite the action.  Perhaps this is due to the way the game feels- it feels strongly like it wants to be Chrono Trigger since Square's design in gaming, while fantastic, is a pretty predictable formula.  I mean Chrono Trigger is turn based and Secret of Evermore doesn't feel significantly different than that game despite using two different combat styles.  While playing Secret of Evermore, you realize that Square's specialty is turn based RPG's and they should leave any weapon-swinging action to Nintendo due to the tacky and unnatural way you swing your weapon, as well as the odd-looking animations afterwards when an enemy has been defeated.  It makes me think Square was probably one step away from making Secret of Evermore a tun based RPG.  Of course the characters, forest and castle backgrounds and overall set-up of both Chrono Trigger and Secret of Evermore resemble each other as well, but I don't really mind that.

Anyway, Secret of Evermore is about a boy and his dog who go an adventure retrieving diamonds, stopping the world from falling into a deep freeze, or whatever else the townspeople ask or discuss from our brave hero.  Probably the most interesting feature of the game is that your dog can actually attack enemies by biting them, and sometimes he packs a mean bite and is quite the helpful little companion.  The storyline is relatively simple.  At least, in comparison to the elabrate Chrono Trigger storyline.  This is due to such a small number of characters overall and the small number of actual dilemmas occurring throughout the quest.  Chrono Trigger's land was so diverse and populated that it was enough to make me confused on several occasions so I welcome the change.

Overall the world feels alarmingly small and you often have to walk through the same areas you've just completed to retrieve, purchase or progress somewhere else.  You also have to defeat several enemies in order to level up and advance.  Not a bad concept, though occasionally repetitive.  Some of the weapons are horrible.  The bone weapon in the beginning with its limited range is quite pathetic though I guess understandable since it's your very first weapon after all, but the spear that you will soon get is a MAJOR improvement.  You can also create attacks depending on your level and the one where a giant fist comes down and pounds enemies is a nifty way of damaging and eliminating any danger standing in your way.  In fact the fist pound is highly reliable in boss fights and makes short work of them.  Casting powerful attack spells is another trademark of turn based RPG's so it's a bit weird having them in a game like this but it's a pretty cool concept regardless.  Some of the areas are fairly boring.  Actually when you arrive to the desert, that's when the game gets sort of boring.  You have to swirl around through quicksand for a few minutes to obtain hidden items on one occasion, talk to townspeople, purchase or trade items, and take a hilarious tour boat ride on another.  This stuff takes a long time with little excitement in between.

Speaking of the boss fights, they're alright, though the one snake fight from the swamp area is entirely too long.  Others are sometimes annoying due to shaking the floors and stunning our hero or darting off screen and coming back with a cheap attack, but otherwise they're fine.  Filling your health whenever it's low is similar to Chrono Trigger which is weird in a more action-like game, but that's how it is.  Enemies can be a bit repetitive at times.  How many times did I have to battle those miniature frog creatures?  Or the boney snakes that resemble the ones from Super Castlevania IV?  Or those flopping slime balls?  Too many times.  The music is quite the surprise though.  Quite often it's extraordinary and always fits the mood perfectly but more importantly, the notes themselves are memorable and enhance the fairy tale vibes of the fictional story quite often.

Overall, well it's a pretty good game.  My 3-star rating is probably due to the fact I've played several Super NES games that entertained me more.  It *is* a classic video game system after all.  Still, Secret of Evermore is a nice change when I desire to take a break from the classics.",3.0
"This game is a regular shooter with one great twist. The ""bullet-time"" innovation is a great addition to the Third-person-shooter genre. It allows your character to overcome odds that are stacked against you without body armor or superhuman powers. You take out bad guys in slow motion with your uzis or twin berettas, watching bullets whiz past you while your shots find their home.  The shots that miss hit the wall, producing splinters, or they hit bottles or mirrors, shattering them to pieces.  Bullet time is the highlight of the game.  It never gets old.
But that's where the ""greatness"" ends.  The storyline is mediocre.  You just mow down the bosses lackeys, moving progressively on up the food chain until you kill the ""big boss"" at the end.  The game has good action but it has nothing besides that. There is only one way to solve every problem and most rooms have only one exit.  Go to room A, clear out the bad guys.  Go to room B, clear out the bad guys, etc, etc, etc.  There is no stealth whatsoever in this game.  The enemy AI has one setting -- ""always aware"".

Worst of all, this is one of the shortest games that I have ever played - 12 hours, tops.  Replayability is almost nonexistent.  Each time that you replay the game, every item and enemy is in the same place.  (Too bad that this game is making all of the ""game of the year"" lists.  That means that all you have to do from now on is churn out 12-hour games with nice graphics and you have a blockbuster on your hands)
My recommendation?  Wait until this one comes out in a jewel case.",3.0
It has a bold look to it but I thought the characters where not very interesting and had to force myself to finish the game.,3.0

"I liked this game--until it started skipping on me after 15 mins or so.  I have a fairly decent computer (800 Mhz, Nvidia GeForce 2 card) and for some reason, I can not play this game for too long before it starts skipping.  I also don't like how the game has to load the MAIN MENU!! and when I want to exit, it has to load to get out of the program.
If you are planning on buying the game, make sure you have a fast processor and a lot of RAM.",3.0
"If you are a PC gamer that does not enjoy linear games I would not recommend this title.  In other words, this is a game that involves little decision making and depends on a storyline to keep you hooked from chapter to chapter.  The storyline is a comic book tale about a cop become a vigilante to combat the evil drug dealers.  The in-between segments are even displayed as comic book panels and the main character, Max Payne, has a load of corny metaphors to go with every chapter.
Some of the creative features put into this game stand out at first.  Perhaps the most impressive feature is the bullet time option that allows you to slow down time and gun down your enemies in a dramatic fashion.  If you've seen ""The Matrix,"" bullet time is the exact same thing in that movie.  It's new and interesting at first but not entertaining enough to keep you captivated throughout the game.
No problem solving is required in this game.  The chapters are shoot 'em up segments from one to the next.  Even extra ammunition and health capsules are easy to find as you only need to open up a cabinet, shelf, etc. to find them.  The game allows you to interact with your environment by turning on faucets, blowing up television screens and other aspects that are entertaining at first but really have no point other than to ""oooh and awe"" you.
If you shy away from violence or have kids to watch out for this game is not recommended.  The beginning sequence of the game shows Max Payne examining his murdered infant which I have to say was one of the few moments I thought a PC game overdid the violence in a game.  Some of the sub-bosses are slowed down and zoomed into as they are killed and falling to the ground.  I think critics of media violence often miss the point and are hypocritical but I have to say that this is one game that I could see justifiable reaction to the violence portrayed.
An added bonus to this game is an online community that has created mods, skins and other programs to enhance your gaming experience with Max Payne. (Mods are alterations to the game that add extra levels, villains, etc.) I've seen stand-alone games with much more to offer in the mod department but the game does support it.  There is an online demo available that allows you to play the first part of the game.  Keep in mind that most of the game follows the same format as the demo which will allow you to decide if you'd like to purchase the game.  In my opinion, it's a game that is fun for younger players but is boring for the older PC gaming audience.  There are some unique gameplay aspects in Max Payne but not enough to make it worthwhile until the price drops.",3.0
"I'm also a hardcore Squaresoft fan--ever since King's Knight and Rad Racer. This is a VERY different Squaresoft game, which is why some people didn't like it. Instead of Nobuo Uematsu music, you get ambient sounds instead. I didn't care for the ambient sounds. The graphics are better than average for SNES, but not as good as Chrono Trigger or Seiken Densetsu 3(Secret of Mana 2). The battle system is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the battles ARE NOT turn-based. But on the other hand, you have to level up weapons by fighting LOTS of enemies and getting LOTS of alchemy ingredients. The alchemy aspect reminds me of Drawing spells from FF8. The storyline is okay, but nothing really fantastic. Humor? Well, that's a different story. There are some REALLY funny parts in this game--SOE got recognition in Nintendo Power for it. The market place about midway through the game is interesting, but frustrating at times. There are many different worlds you'll be going to in this game, the most interesting of which are Gothica and one or two others adjacent to it. I played all the way to the ending boss--and stopped. In my final analysis, I give this game 3.5 stars. If you insist on playing it, get it on emulator first.",3.0
"I was watching Toy Story, on ABC, last night, and thought of this game. Since the day I got my Sega Genesis, back in the 90's, I have had this game. Because I was younger, back then, it was more fun. This game has become less challenging, through the years. I would recommend this game for children, ages 8 through 11/12. There are some hard levels, such as when you must use the RC car, to race through the level. But, I feel with practice any determined child can complete it. Toy Story is one player.",3.0
"Toy Story was one of my favorite games for the Sega Genesis. It had some of the best graphics I had ever seen at the time, way better than a lot of other Genesis titles.

I added a review when I first got this game... and as a previous gamer mentioned and I think he was right.. I gave this game 5 stars but I was still in my 10 hour honeymoon with the game.  Its a great game don't get me wrong... just once you finish it it doesn't have that much replayability to it.  You will probably end up putting it aside once you finish it .. which only takes several hours.  I suggest you should wait till it hits the bargain bin .. like the previous gamer mentioned in his review... and get a good online game.. they are the best! I recommend .. operation flashpoint if you like stategic warefare games... WW2 online will be a great game as soon as they get the bugs all out.. i would wait on that one for at least 6 months.. cause they charge ya 10 bucks now to play.  Fighter ace 2 at the gaming zone is a great fighter pilot game... with a big online community as well.. for also 10 bucks a month... but worth the $$.  I would keep an eye out for return to wolfienstien and Alien vs . predator 2 and medal of honor 2 - allied assault.  Game on !!,3.0
"I had fun with this game and if that's all that matters then I would have given it a 5 star. Unfortunately, the game got old really fast for me. The locations are really contrived.

Still, everyone should check out the demo at least.",3.0
"Beavis and Butthead was fair. Not even O.k. because the game itself was way too easy and I thought that it was going to be funny and it really wasn't. Sure I laughed a few times, but when it all came down to it, the 2 dumbest teens in the world were about as funny as a rock.
That and this game was way too easy. There was no true challenge (with the exception of the hospital board) but other than that, very simple game and for a lot of the more advanced gamers, this wasn't even a walk in the park. It was more like taking a nap on a Sunday afternoon.
The last thing that bothered me about this game is that the ending was better if you lost on the last board (the GWAR concert) because if you lost, it was more like the real Beavis and Butthead. You know, a couple of morons who lost their objective.
This is a renter first. It's entertaining while it lasts, but unfortunately, the feeling doesn't last very long.",3.0
"Originally, I felt reluctant to compare Max Payne to Deus Ex, as the latter is such a superlative game as to make the comparison somewhat unfair. ... I offer this observation: Max Payne suffers greatly in comparison to Deus Ex, which is very much the better game.
In fact, I'm surprised at the predominance of very positive reviews for Max Payne. I offer here a brief list of the games primary shortcommings.
First of all, the interactivity of the game is virtually nonexistant.  Whereas the environments in Deus Ex were absorbing and interesting environments to examine and explore, the environments in Max Payne are just backgrounds, offering little more than wrapping for a simple, fixed game path.  See those boxes over there?  That desk?  Forget about them. There's nothing in them. Keep moving along and stop wasting time.  (Actually sometimes a certain type of wooden crate will have an item in it. Yay.)
 Where are the choices in Max Payne? The answer is that there simply are none. Deus Ex gives one so many choices that one gets lost playing with the game, seeing what is possible. Exploring the game becomes more important than the game itself. In Max Payne there might as well be a bright yellow line on the floor, because that's where you're going, like it or not.
Even within the limited scope of the game, play becomes quickly repetitive. One quickly catches on to how things will go down around this corner, and the next, and the next, and so on.
The A.I. sucks even more fun out of the game.  The characters go from completely clueless to completely omniscient the moment you cross the boundary into their space.  One second they are oblivious to your presence, but as soon as that hand grenade leaves your grasp, its ""Hey it's Max Payne! Get him.""
The software itself is fairly flakey, which gave a bad impression almost immediately. Installation became entirely about what *I* had to do to get the game to run correctly.  I don't like jumping through hoops to get a $.. game to run.  Even after I satisfied all the requirements, stopping the game from crashing on exit still requires a ""workaround"" involving turning of the voice modem.
I'll stop beating the dead horse and mention some positives now. There are several interesting things about the game, among which is the bullet time feature you have no doubt heard of.  It's a great idea. (Back to negatives: it never feels like you're able to fully integrate it into your game play.)  There are also some very interesting levels involving dream sequences, hullucinations and the like.  The graphic novel aspect was also interesting. Finally, the graphics were very nice, and the slo-mo cut sequences at the end of the battles were pretty cool as well. (Although they added to the predictability of the game.)
Overall, the game did NOT live up to my expectations, but it was good enough to keep me punching in to see what the ending was like. (It was like the beginning and the middle.)  In hindsight, I should have played Deus Ex a third time instead of buying Max Payne.",3.0
Its just okay; my preference is to use the Sega Saturn hand controller when playing Street Fighter.  Its hard to find a way to anchor this joy stick and it keeps moving away from me.,3.0
"They suck.  Plain and simple.  Anyone trying to tell you that these are quality arcade sticks is crazy.  However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider a purchase. Where this stick shines is in terms of value.  For less than 20 bucks you can get a brand new ""arcade"" stick, or should I say arcade-like stick for your old Saturn.  Completely inadequate for fighters but handles surprisingly well on all my beloved shmups.

If you're a Saturn fan and want to preserve your legendary official controllers or your Japanese version of the Virtua Stick, pick one of these up.  They stink, but at the price point you can't go wrong.",3.0
"With this game I find it important to mention what system and settings are being used:
Computer:  PCV-RX370DS Processor:  P4 1.3Ghz RAM:  512MB 800Mhz Rambus Monitor Resolution:  1024 X 768
First off, the game has incredible graphics.  It appears more like a DVD than a video game.  No complaints whatsoever on a graphics stand point.  The game moves very fluidly (yes, the P4 and the 512MB of RAM are probably the main contributors to the fluid movement).  Also note that I set every setting within Max Payne to the highest possible setting to get the most out of the game.
However, I have not played more than 3 minutes of the game because of its LACK OF JOYSTICK support.  I can not come to grasps with the idea that it took years for this game to be released and then when it does, it doesn't even support a joystick!!  Ridiculous!!  I would have been disappointed if the game wouldn't have supported force feedback, but to not support a joystick at all!?  What where the developers thinking?
Anyway, if you are the type of gamer that still uses the keyboard for game play (I know plenty of people that still do), you don't get disturbed by the scene settings (keep in mind that the opening scene shows your dead infant and dead wife in gruesome detail), and you want to see what all the hype is about regarding this game, snag it.  But as for me, it will sit on my hard drive unused until someone develops a patch that allows for joystick support (force feedback support would make it that much better).",3.0
"I couldn't in good conscience give Max Payne anything above 3 stars. While very fun in its own right, it doesn't even come close to validating the ... price tag (which can be painful for those of us on a tight budget). While the playtime is increased somewhat if the auto-aim feature is disabled, the game is still much too short unfortunately. However, the game still does provide at least 10-15 hours of great mindless entertainment (depending on how much of a perfectionist you are with the autosaving) and shows great promise for future expansions, hopefully priced much, much lower.
The potential for the Max Payne franchise is sizable to say the least, and I only hope that G.O.D. Games can combine the pure fun and excitement of the many firefights with some strategy (beyond just ducking behind boxes). For example, it would be nice if it were possible to have multiple possible routes through an area instead of the often times linear feel of the game. All in all, Max Payne is enjoyable, yes, but not worth the ... price tag unless you've got money to burn. Wait for the demo if you're in doubt, or play it at a friend's house. You'll probly be able to beat it while you're there.",3.0
"Okay....the bullet-time stuff is awesome, but it can get old after a while.  With all of the realism in this game, you think they would have made the bullet hits more real.  Shoot someone in the back of the head with a shotgun....sure there's some blood, but the head is still intact.  I guess I was expecting to see a little more of ""soldier of fortune taken to the next level"" type of action.  I'm also bothered by the third person perspective, which is really required for the bullet-time feature, but it would have been nice to have a first person option (a la Hitman).  When I aim at a bad guy, the site line is blocked by Max.  Just very difficult to move around and avoid the bad guys.....other than that, the weapons, the sound and the scenery is great.  The story's okay...just a little to linear for me.",3.0
"3D Realms is one of my favorite companies because of Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior, so when I saw that they made Max Payne, I immediatly drove to the store and picked up a copy.
When I started Max Payne, truth be told, I was amazed at how SLOW the thing ran.  I used to think that my Pentium 700 was a good computer, now in order to get the most out of Max Payne, I need a gigahertz computer.  Sheesh!  Anyways, after turning down some details, I got the game running pretty smoothly.
The details on the game are very polished, and the locales in New York City are represented very realistically, from the run-down slums to mob boss mansions.  The storyline, which is about a renegade cop whose entire family was murdered, is represented by what looks like water-colored comic strip panels, and it adds a nice touch to the game.  The storyline is also one of the best I've seen in a shooter game next to Half-Life.  The ""dream"" levels, which occur when Max Payne is knocked unconscious by whatever, are also quite disturbing!  The innovative feature that will probably be the best in the game though, is something called ""Bullet time.""  In bullet time, everything is slowed down, but you can aim the gun in real-time, very much like the popular movie, ""The Matrix.""  This is a VERY cool feature.  Sometimes when you blast away the last person in the room, it will zoom to him and show him falling slowly to the ground.  And of course, when you use the sniper rifle, it zooms to the bullet's point of view.  VERY cool.
Unfortunately, now we get to the negative parts of the game.  First of all, as I said before, you need a machine with some SERIOUS horsepower to get the most out of Max Payne.  Don't even bother with this game unless you have at least a Pentium 3 processor with a 32MB video card and 128MB RAM.  The second thing that considerably dampened my experience was sound issues.  I have a SBLive! Value sound card, and for some reason, the sound was very faint, unless I turned my back to the source of the sound, then the sounds came in clear.  Wierd, and very annoying when the shotgun goes *piff!*
The third and most annoying thing about Max Payne was the difficulty level.  The game sports a features that makes it so the difficulty changes according to your skill.  For instance, when you first start the game, it takes a few hits from the handgun to kill anything, and if they hit you, you take a little bit of damage.  That's okay, but Max Payne's idea of changing difficulty is making it so the enemies take more hits to kill, and you take less hits to kill, so by the time you reach the end of the first act, it takes two, maybe even THREE direct shotgun blasts to kill anything, and all they need is to get two, maybe even one good shot off of you to kill you (and head-shots don't count, by the way.  It still took me two shotgun blasts to do the job!).  Didn't this crap go out with Goldeneye for the N64?  It is flat-out REDICULOUS in crowded enclosed rooms, especially  one at the end of act one, with enemies continually pouring out of alcoves in the wall.  And the end boss of the act took about FIVE shotgun blasts, and he STILL managed to kill me!  Bullet-time became useless because the enemies still hit me even in the middle of a sideways leap.  Even after all of the dying on act one, the game did not let up on the difficulty.  I got so frustrated at the game I nearly threw it out the window.  The only other software that did that was Messiah, and guess what?  They ALSO had an innovative feature, just like Max Payne did!  And if you beat the game, it opens up even HARDER features?  My god!
Overall, I found Max Payne to be graphically superior to many other games, and the Bullet-Time feature is excellent, along with the storyline.  But unfortunately, the overwhelming difficulty level and the really high system requirements only earns it three stars in my book.",3.0

"The first time I read about Max Payne was something about 3 years ago on a very old edition of PCGAMER. After reading about it, and looking at in-game shots, one could say I was one, very exciting small kid. Ok, enough of that nostalgy, the game is out, let's see how it really is. GRAPHICS - There's no doubt that Remedy have given us one of the best visually games available on the PC market. The textures are sharp and clean, the facial animation is also superb, all in all, T&L in all its glory. I have to mention to Bullet Time effect which is great, special, Kudos REMEDY! Audio - Once again, as the graphics in this game, the music is also excellent, really immersive and on straight line with the plot. The speech is also really cool, altough Max talks familiar (Mr. Nukem anyone?). Gameplay - Ok, the gameplay is good, but I see it as the downfall of this game. What this game lacks is a variety of movements. I truly believe a slow walking, belly walking, etc, would have made wonders to the somewhat shallow gameplay.  The lack of tactical aspect is a shame too. A more complex gaming, other than just walk here - kill that guy - walk there - kill this guy is really imoportant our days. The story is great, but the gameplay, compared to it, is simple and nothing special. Another downfall in this area is the length of this game. The game is very short, and the end-user would probably finish it by a weekend or so - so don't expect a long gaming experince. Now don't get me wrong, Max Payne is a fantastic 3rd person action game, even one of the best currently offered on the PC, but after 4 years in the making, and so much hype around it, I really expected a revolution, something new, better and fresh, and Max Payne is not all that.

"When you think of the arcade, what's one game that can possibly come to mind? Frogger, right? Remember its addicting traffic-dodging gameplay? Its memorable tunes? It's retro graphics? How about its charm in general? Well, this Super Nintendo version has only half of what I asked to remember.

It has the same addicting traffic-dodging gameplay that put Konami/Sega (Though Konami won in a legal battle) on the map and, while it doesn't have the same graphics as the original, it provides its own colorful graphics. You would think that it would probably be better than the original, but no.

What sucks about this version is that it doesn't have the catchy music from the original. In fact, it doesn't have ANY music. Just wonky sound effects. Also, since the game has been revamped with updated graphics, the wonky sound effects, and no music, it just loses the charm that struck me as I played the arcade game.",3.0
classic game!,3.0
I'm a collector of SNES games and had to own this one. It's a fun game. I think some parts are hard for kids like the second level when you have to roar at the monkees and grab on the hippos tail and swing. The hardest part of the game is the jump and double jump in the middle and the end of the second level. The game is fun and you get bigger and your roar builds as well. You need patience with this game. I totally recommend it.,3.0
"I am surprised there are so little reviews of this game here, and being that it received 4 and 5 stars, I felt compelled to write this review and emphasize something about the title that completely ruins it. One reviewer mentioned it, but he didn't really explain how horrible of a thing it is. To start, Super R-Type is a SNES exclusive that is sort of a worked over port of R-Type II. I actually believe its an improvement over the original R-Type II, featuring more levels, some enhanced graphics and other goodies. What brings this game down (heavily for me) are the complete lack of checkpoints throughout. All R-Type games have ""checkpoints"" during the stage, so that if you die, you can go back and start from near that place within the stage. Some idiot at Irem thought it was a good idea to remove these altogether so if you die just once, even at the end boss, you go ALL of the way back to the beginning, every time. This is ridiculous and completely ruins what would otherwise be a fun and great shooter. Anyone who knows the R-Type series knows that these games are difficult enough to begin with. I cannot believe someone thought it a good idea to remove the checkpoints, as it does nothing but make the game endlessly frustrating, sucking virtually all of the fun out of it. There's nothing like working through a rough stage to a boss, dying once and starting all over again.

In conclusion, this is a great game that was ruined by a dumb decision by some goofball during development. Get it if you're a huge R-Type fan, or skip if if you want to keep your hair from turning grey while playing. There are better R-Type games available that give you the benefit of checkpoints, like R-Type III (also on the SNES) for example.",3.0

"This is a pretty good wormlight. It does a very good job of lighting up the screen in even the darkest room, and allowed me to see...or it would have, but the light is actually OVER the screen, blocking your vision of whatever you're playing. Another thing that is convinient yet annoying is that you plug the wormlight right into the side of the Game Boy. This is good because you don't need any batteries. This is bad because it drains energy from the Game Boy. I also read in an earlier review that you can't link up in a dark room with this item which is a very good point.

"All told, the original Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers game for the SNES is not as good as some, better than others.  Bandai released four Power Rangers titles for the system, and of those four, the best has to be Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie, followed by Power Rangers Zeo: Battle Racers (known on Amazon.com as merely Power Ranger Racers).  The original MMPR title, the one you're reading about here, falls below the level of those two, but still manages to stand above the fourth game, Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition.
This is basically your standard side-scrolling beat-em-up, only without the ability to move ""up and down"" on the screen as you could in games like Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time or Batman Returns.  Your character, one of the original five rangers (Jason, Kimberly, Zach, Billy and Trini) runs to the right, punching and kicking putties until he/she encounters the boss of the level.  At that point, you morph into a Power Ranger and the boss vanishes from sight (without so much as a fight) and you continue to work your way through the next two-thirds of the level, this time armed with your specific power ranger weapon.
Sometimes you'll encounter a unique situation; level three places you in the sewers and storm drains of Angel Grove, forcing you to swim and crawl your way out.  The second level drops you in a factory and makes you contend with machines and debris as you climb up a series of girders.  But for the most part, you're just going to be running to the right and beating the heck out of putties.
Control is tight, the graphics are nice, and the music is... adequate.  At least the sound effects are good.  The only problem is that it's just not as fun as it should be - it's kind of repetitive.  Okay, it's very repetitive.  A greater variety of attacks would be nice, but you can only jump and attack, duck and attack, or stand and attack.  Yes, you can throw your enemies, but that's as close as you get to anything different than just hitting the Y button hard and fast.  A two-player option would've been a godsend... unfortunately, this is a one-player game, so you're going to have to go it alone.  For the sake of some variety, at least you get to choose a new ranger for each level and partake of two Megazord fights towards the end of the game.
Ultimately, it's too repetitive and a little too easy to be great, especially with the password system allowing you continue from the level where you left off at any time.  But serious fans of the original team will probably find a lot to like, because it's still an above-average action side-scroller.  If you own an SNES and you love the Rangers, though, you could certainly do better; why not pick up Battle Racers or, better yet, The Movie instead?",3.0
"so apparently I ordered the german version, which I guess I could live with if it were just a language issue but the cartridge doesn't even fit with my SNES.

It'll cost me more to ship it back than I paid for it, so I guess I'll just hold on to it.",3.0
It was definitely a strange Mario game.  It is the prelude to all Mario games where Mario is a baby and you play yoshi.  You don't really die (normally) but you lose a life if baby Mario falls off your back (if you get hit by an enemy) and the timer gets down to zero.  It was ok but weird.  Still nice to have in my collection.,3.0
"Not a huge fan of this game.  Too hard for the children to enjoy, and I got bored quickly.  If you get hit, baby Mario gets knocked off your back and you have limited time to recover him or you die.",3.0

"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers by Bandai is an action/stage 2D fighting game.  On each level, there are five Rangers to choose from:  Jason/Red, Billy/Blue, Zach/Black, Kimberly/Pink, and Trini/Yellow.  True to the form of the older version of the TV show, the game is too predictable, which makes boredom set in quickly plus it is an easy game to beat.  However, if you crave about an hour's worth of punching and kicking, then this game is at least worth a look.  One other good feature is that a player can play as the Megazord for three battles.  Mediocre at best, overall, though.",3.0
"This Nyko Worm light is to bright for eyes. I have very sensetive eyes. Also, i found that i didn't use it much, because in the day you don't need  it because of the sunlight, and if you do have it on then it gives off a  little bit of glare. It's good if you go on a lot of road trips or live  where it's not very well lit.",3.0
"It's a clever little thing, to be sure - with no extra batteries, it just plugs into the Game Boy. On the other hand, the Game Boy screen is designed  to be highly reflective (in order to bounce as much light as possible back  into your eyes), and holding a light above it results in the light being  reflected into your face. This is why laptops and so forth are lit from  behind the screen. There isn't much you can do about glare - if you hold  the light at an angle, or far enough away for the reflection to be diffuse,  it doesn't illuminate the screen properly. On the good side, you can  eventually get used to it, and it is eventually possible to arrange the  stalk so that it works well, and if you have to use the Game Boy in  low-light conditions there isn't really any alternative. It's also  amazingly cheap - perhaps if they had placed a filter of some kind over the  light, it would be better.",3.0
"This worm light helps as far as visibility goes, but I am not completely satisfied due to the bright blue reflection it projects onto the screen. The little annoying reflection gets in the way of my gameplay. If I had known there was a light and magnifier with a dimmer switch (...) I would have never wasted my money on this worm light.",3.0
"For the experienced or non-experienced battletoad gamer, most will find this version of battletoads to be quite challenging. This game is interesting non the less and will keep some players coming back for more even after continuous ""game-overs"".
The graphics are nicely done and the control quality is not great but decent. I only give Battletoads 3 out of 5 stars due to the frustration of trying to conquer the game. If you are someone who hates challenging games, you will most likely do one of three things to battletoads: #1- sell this game after failed attempts to conquer it, #2- slam it against the wall in anger, or #3- throw it in the trash and pity yourself for wasting money on it. As for me, this is one battletoad game that I have to use with the game genie in order to beat it.",3.0
"Gameboy Color is fun.  But,let's face it.  You need to buy a separate  light attachment to see the screen.  (You'll probably want the speaker  attachment, too).  There is at least one other option to this worm light.  The alternative is an attachment that fits over the screen and requires  batteries, but does magnify the screen.  The worm light requires no  batteries because it attaches to a port on the Gameboy Color.  It comes in  matching colors, if that's important to you.  The worm light does a great  job of lighting a decent portion of the screen.  Depending on where you  point the light, objects at the edge of the light beam will tend to  disappear.  By slightly moving the game itself you can compensate for that.  Also, the light is maybe a little too bright and creates a glare in the  form of an annoying reflection of the light on the screen.  You can adjust  how you hold the game to minimize the annoyance of this but it is always  there.  This light is not expensive and neither is the alternative.  I plan  to try both and see which is better.  But, I've had satisfactory game play  using this light in all lighting conditions.  You need a light and this is  a good compromise in less than full sunlight conditions.",3.0
"I was making a collection of gameboy items. While browsing, I saw this. I thought it would work well and I could play in the dark. Nevertheless, it did work quite well in pitch dark if u only want to see part of the screen. If there's light nearby,there's also a terrible glare. But it was better than no light at all, so I credit them for that. It's better than other lights out there.",3.0
"Playing Myst reminded me of the episode in

"Capcom was one of the NES's biggest supporters and at the time, they had a lot of success with their Mega Man franchise. After releasing three games for the NES, they decided to release Mega Man games on the Game Boy. Their first one, Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, was released in 1991 to critical acclaim and success. Finally, the Blue Bomber made his debut on Nintendo's portable system and while it blended elements from the NES games, it had its share of flaws that kept it from being as good as it could have been.

Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge takes elements from Mega Man and Mega Man 2 while adding new music, alternate stage layouts, a new enemy robot and featuring Dr. Wily. Once again, Mega Man must stop Dr. Wily from taking over the world. You choose any one from the four stages available and each one has a Robot Master at the end waiting to take you out (from the NES Mega Man game.) Shoot all the enemies, avoid the traps and defeat each Robot Master to acquire their special weapons. Once you complete all four stages, you must complete two more: one of them features a new Robot Master to defeat while the other had you face off against four more Robot Masters (from the NES Mega Man 2 game.) Only after beating all of these robots that you must defeat Dr. Wily. The game offers a password after you beat the four stages in the beginning so you can continue from where you left off later on.

The PROS: The game plays like the NES versions so anyone who is familiar with those games will feel right at home here. The graphics were good for its time, controls are good and the music were different versions that you heard from the NES Mega Man game. The game featured robots from Mega Man and Mega Man 2 but had different attack patterns so you had to adjust your shooting skills accordingly. This game was also very hard so it will challenge anyone looking to play the game.

The CONS: The game was hard but not only because the difficulty level was set high. The stage layouts didn't offer a lot of room for mistakes and they demanded precise jumping and accurate shooting. Avoiding enemies and bullets was next to near impossible so it was a matter of in depth memorization and some luck if you made it through. I died a lot of times and most other players had done the same. It's also very short as the entire game had 6 stages compared to 10 stages for Mega Man and 14 stages for Mega Man 2.

Future Game Boy renditions fared out better than Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge but as the first Game Boy title, it did a decent job. It provided a portable Mega Man game, featured elements from the NES versions while offering different stage layouts, alternate music tracks and a new Robot Master exclusive to the Game Boy game. It was terribly hard not because it was really difficult but because you had to have perfect platform and shooting skills. If you're looking to play this game, be warned of the flaws and if you can get past them, then you might just enjoy it. It was just recently released on the Nintendo e-Shop for the 3DS as a virtual console title so that's the best way to experience this game immediately.",3.0
"Love it or hate it, Mega Man games grow like leaves on trees. Given the vast amount of success Mega Man enjoyed during the early years of the NES, it was only natural that some version of the game would end up on Nintendo's portable, gray brick. Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge (known as Rockman World in Japan) would mark the beginning of yet another series of titles for the blue bomber, one of the first Capcom would outsource rather than develop internally.

Given that this title is often referred to as ""Mega Man"" given the lack of subtitle on the title screen, the first thing most people do is compare this to the 1987 original. This makes since the game borrows from that game, presenting four of its six robot masters. While Cut Man, Elec Man, Ice Man and Fire Man reappear in all their glory, everything else is new, or rather a mix of things from Mega Man and Mega Man II. For example, while Elec Man's level will remind one of the area they played through on the NES, it's crossed with elements that were used Air Man's level in Mega Man II. It's an interesting hybrid to be sure, but the allure can be cut short facing your first robot master without the aid of the correct weapon.

Annoying as that is, things get back on track pretty quickly. The damage incurred from robot master weapons and enemies is much more balanced in this rendition, so you won't get blown away as quickly. Unfortunately, trouble again rears its ugly head during the game's concluding levels. While the first Wily level can be tough with its five concluding battles, nothing compares to the last. I love a challenge as much as the next guy but the final level is too big for it britches and throws everything it can at the player. As one can imagine, this puts quite the damper on the proceedings but there are other areas of the game that help make up for it like the excellent soundtrack. Seriously, I can't be the only one who blares Cut Man and Fire Man's theme from the back of my car, can I?

Regardless of my weakness for delectable 8-bit chiptunes, Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge stands as a solid, portable take of the Mega Man we all know and love. I wish the concluding levels of the game were a little more forgiving than they currently are but I can think of games that are guilty of far more. Still, take the above a grain of salt, because the game is definitely capable of making one grind their teeth no matter how one sugarcoats it.",3.0

"Rrecently, i perchased this game through another vendor. Like many, i bought fft because i wanted to remember what my childhood was like with a psx, you remember that right? Before the psx turned into a labtop. When i was younger i played this and it left such an impression on me that years later i bought it once again thinking it would be just as great. At this point, i must say that im not a fanboy towards any game series and or conpany. After a few mins of playing this game, i realized that it was actually a painfully easy game to play and subsequently beat. Fft is a simple premise. A romeo and juliet type story, which dosent end the way that u think it dose.

U start off as a simple squire, the starting point for all other physicals, knights, theives,monks, ect. With a small team of other units that overtime develop and change jobs, each has its own ability tree that can be unlocked. With every successful action ur unit does, cast spells, attack, and ability enhanced walk, they gain job points, the stuff needed to buy abilites from unit skill trees. Chemist, the starting point for all magical jobs, are the game medics so ull want to have one around. This is a turn based isometic game.

Isometric games are games like diablo 1 and 2. Where ur looking down from a belcony type perspective. We should all know what turn based games are. Fft also intros a sort of what i would call a open battlefield. Unlike ff7, where ur always 5 ft away from the enemy jiving and shaking like ur having a in place seizure or something, u start off in a field. Ur on one side of the map enemies are on the other. Walk to them and do ur thing, this was a bit irritating because the battles can last a painfilly long time if ur not strong enough to 1 shot enemies.

Some of the things i liked about fft are the ability to change jobs on the fly. I like experimenting with different jobs and mixing abilities within my units jobs to see what happends.  Job and class mixing is what, in my opinion, kills the replayability for fft. Why should i replay a new game when i can load a saved gave where i have all the jobs unlocked and experiment to my hearts content? It dosent matter if u mix jobs, the game dosent have much replayability. Once u get to a certain level most of the monsters won't be a problem to one shot. The bosses use only 3 status effects mainly and the final boss takes a painfully long time to act. Which means by the time the final boss acts my time has already knocked 1500 hp, most of his life, before he even dose anything. Ive refrained from talking about the story, most of the game machanics,sound track, ect cause i want people to try fft for themselves and decide. Im not a fanboy. Im not going to sit here and say oh man this game is the best thing since the invention of bacon. I don't know jack about squarsoft and frankly i don't give a damn about squarsoft, lol, just saying. For $79 this game is horriblly over priced. I paid 20 for mine, in like new condition, manual and jewelcase included. Try ebay. Dont spend such a large sum of money on a game like this unless ur seriously that despreate to put this on an altar and worship it.",3.0

"To find a successor to Final Fantasy 7 must have been no easy task, and its difficulties have, no doubt, been increased by the circumstance that the resumption of joint work by the team who made the company what it is has been of only too short duration. FF Tactics is a sorry mixup of a story that is too long in the telling. From the outset of it, one can see nothing but extreme misfortune for the characters from beginning to end.

The animation is rather sloppy at times, and the music always reminding me of something else. The most unforgiveable part of the game is the lack of proofreading in the text. In many of the scenes, things are misspelled or ungrammatical. In several descriptions of things, there is gibberish where a description ought to be.

As for the story, the plot is rather twisted. Something about a war without a clear goal and nonsense about zodiac stones, characters that come and go without a ""will yer leave"" or ""by your leave"", and a myriad of battles in a well-designed battlefield. By the end, there are no characters to really admire except Ramza, whose fate isn't entirely clear either. Most of the other characters are dead by the end anyway, so it's not like it matters.

The final product looks really rushed to get to the stores and it's a shame that Square wasn't more careful with what Video Game Spot called ""a masterpiece"".",3.0
"Okay, when I first got this game I was so excited to get a Final Fantasy game (I am a BIG fan of the series). However, I did not know what a tactics game was. I am an RPGer. If I loved tactics games I am sure I would like this game a lot better. However, after trying to like it, I just decided tactics are not for me.",3.0
"Final Fantasy Tactics was a game that I enjoyed playing when I first tried it, something like six years ago. My opinion on the game has since changed. Keep in mind this isn't simply a question of the game ""not aging well"", as by PlayStation standards much of the game's graphics are gorgeous, effects are pretty, not to mention that almost all of my favorite games fall into the 32-bit or below eras. It is not simply a matter of there being more, newer games that exist which are better than Final Fantasy Tactics: It's a matter of Final Fantasy Tactics, quite simply, not being a very good example of the tactical strategy genre.

My first experience with Final Fantasy Tactics was prior to having played, or even known of the existence, of either Fire Emblem or Tactics Ogre. Because of this, the idea behind the gameplay was fresh and new, and the fact is that any way you look at it, there IS some fun to be found in the character customization and battle style of the game.

But it's that very same customization that proves to be, in my mind, the game's largest downfall:  There's such a thing as too much customizability, and it is this, primarily, that leads to Tactics Ogre being the overall better game. Not counting character-specific cases, there are a total of twenty Jobs available to human characters, and any given character can become any of nineteen of them (As men cannot become Dancers nor can women become Bards). Within these nineteen Jobs are a varying number of skills which can be mixed and matched on a single character any number of ways. In writing, this sounds nice, and many will vouch that it is, but when there are so many available combinations, a significant number of potential matchups are utterly worthless, and conversely, a significant number of them are so game-breakingly strong that they make other combinations seem practically meaningless.

The same applies for many skills. Yes, there are hundreds of them available, but when all is said and done, fewer than half of them are of any real use in practical situations, as the greater majority of status-effecting skills have such a low hit rate that they're practically worthless and most of the incredibly powerful magic (Or especially the Archer's Charge skill at higher levels) takes so long to actually do anything that by the time its effect is unleashed, most any other ""better"" class could and may well HAVE already wiped out most of what you were targeting.

Add to this the fact that there are somewhere around 12 special characters, all of whom are largely best off in their unique ""starting"" class, on top of the fact that your battallion is limited to sixteen characters and it's almost as though the game rather intentionally tries to encroach upon your ability to experiment with characters and class combinations that aren't as blatantly fantastic as others. This is especially true of Monsters, which you can capture, though it seems as though this is an entirely moot point, as nearly every monster is grossly inferior to a reasonably strong human, as well as the fact that they're constantly laying eggs, which leads to more monsters of questionable strength constantly being created to take up room in your already very limited party.

Furthermore, parts of the translation are just absolutely horrifically bad. ""This guy are sick"" from Final Fantasy VII was an excusable error. Even the shoddy dialogue from the original NES Metal Gear (""I FEEL ASLEEP"") was comical and fairly understandable. Final Fantasy Tactics, though, has points of perfectly comprehensible and fluent-sounding dialogue, punctuated by strings of text that are so blatheringly incoherent that its meaning cannot be made heads or tails of. ""Select the job that bundles up Action Ability by the Job in the unit's sub-command"" is the sort of sentence which is meant to help in understanding how to play the game. ""Deathspell 2"" is a recovery spell. In effect, a lot of the translation is muddled to the point of incoherence.

Final Fantasy Tactics is not awful. But it is not a fantastic ""tactical"" RPG, simply because most every ""tactical"" method you could use to go about fighting a battle is so obviously and completely overshadowed by other ""Tactics"" such as ""Make a Lancer"", or ""Use Cidolfas"".",3.0

No real puzzles except for turning on generators or shooting crates to reveal passageways. Arsenal is well chosen. Pretty fun but don't expect anything too challenging aside from people shooting at you. This game is for fans of testosterony action movies.

"Pokemon Snap lets you take photos of wild Pokemon. The Pokemon are cute and it can be a fun challenge to get them to do something entertaining... but after a while the game gets kind of boring. I went through the river course 5 times and still have not unlocked anything. The game is set up like one of those arcade rides. You ride in a car on a preset path through the Pokemon's world. I was a little upset that the ride went so slow, but I guess it was like that so that it would be easier to take photos. The Pokemon did interesting things. I fed one too many apples and it exploded (it was an electric pokemon). I shot an apple that hit a lizard Pokemon on the head and caused him to fall in the lava. After the ride Professor Oak judges the photos. He is kind of annoying and has an awful voice. Almost every one of my Pokemon photos were rejected by him because they were not big enough and in the middle of the frame. After half an hour I wanted to throw my controller at him and tell him to shut up. Overall, this is game is not half bad. Taking and saving photos of cute Pokemon is somewhat addicting, even with some minor flaws.

Graphics- C+: This is the Nintendo 64. The pokemon are accurate enough, but a game over a decade old is not going to look very good.

Sound- D: The sound is rather dorky, but again, this is the Nintendo 64.

Replay Value- B: I come back to courses to get a good photo. Photos are savable and sharable on the Wii, so I like sending them to friends.",3.0

Good game for kids under 7 or so, and good for beginners into the Pokemon world.",3.0

"Considering this game is used and cheap now for a retired system, I'd recommend a purchase just to see a type of gameplay that Nintendo never tried again. You are a photographer, and have been hired by Professor Oak to document Pokemon living in the wild. You ride through levels on a fixed track, snapping photos. You have a few items at your disposal to help spur the Pokemon into different actions, which racks up better photos and more points. The graphics are somewhat average, but the Pokemon animate well. Controls are easy to master.

So yeah it's very different and very fun, but in the end much too short. You have six levels and a bonus seventh level (that really isn't much of a level), but you see less than half of the original 151 Pokemon. Getting better photos gives the game some replay value, but you can basically see everything in a weekend. But like I mentioned above, it's cheap now, and the novelty makes it worth a buy for fans and non-fans alike.",3.0
"When a phenomenon as big as Pokemon was, you'll always find the companies trying to cash in as quick as they can and get the most money. So many Pokemon-related stuff coming out: cereal, plush toys, band-aids, and games of course. Here we have a different approach to the Catch-em-All tagline: you take their picture. It's fun, neat and short.

Story: You don't play Pokemon games for their story but essentially Pokemon professor and researcher Oak wants pictures taken of the Pokemon so you hop in his vehicle and travel different areas to do it. Pretty simple, no?

Graphics: This is in the N64 days so it's not incredibly detailed but it does its job well although you might find like the Simpsons, Pokemon look odd in 3D.

Sound/Music: Unlike the Gameboy games, the characters actually say their name for once which is a good plus. Music was ok but nothing hummable, like most Pokemon music.

Gameplay: The pictures you take are ranked in basic areas: how close they are to camera and not extreme close-up or faraway either; whether they're in the middle of the frame, if they're doing a special pose and if there's more of them in frame. To get the poses you have 3 basic moves: using your Poke-flute which could make them dance or maybe fall asleep, bait to get them closer to camera or a ball which basically gets them mad. Some also can net you a great photo such as one level, if you knock Pikachu off a balloon and you do something else you can get Pikachu to ride Articuno for extra bonus.

One complaint is the fact that you'll often re-try levels cause your machine is just too damn fast. Trying to take a picture of a creature when you need so much prep time isn't the best thing. You'd have to have incredibly good aim for many things too. Another complaint is that there's only around 60-65 Pokemon....out of 151?(This is pre Gold-Silver games). Some of my favorites from the games are not even in here like I don't think I saw one Eevee or its evolutions in the game.

Having an interest in photography I can appreciate a game like this but photography in a lot of cases is about patience. Waiting for that perfect moment before you click and riding that machine just quite frankly sucks but if you're into Pokemon, try it out(if you can find it still).",3.0

"My kids are huge Pokemon fans. This was the first Nintendo game I ever bought them, when I got the system. Of the several they have, they play this the least (at this time).
The game is interesting, and challenging,  but not as much fun as it could be. The Pokemon are sometimes hard to get  in focus, and the frustration level can get high for younger children. On  the other hand, older kids seem to breeze through it, and then are done  with it. It does not lend itself to lots of repeated play.
I wish that  more than one player could save their data on the cartridge, that is a  drawback. And it would have been nice to have more diverse kinds of  Pokemon. However the graphics are great, the premise is good (I really like  the lack of violence) and the different environments are fun to explore.  Bottom line, buy this game if your kids are Pokemaniacs, but don't expect  them to spend hundreds of hours playing it.",3.0

"For those of you looking for a great, realistic and HARD game here it is.  You are selected by Rome to run a series of cities, each one with problems and needs different than the last.  You will have to develop farms, dig clay pits, fill warehouses, design road systems, supply people with food and goods, build houses, set up markets, workhouses and make sure everybody has clean water.  THAN you also have to deal with trade, enemy armies, the Gods and Caesar's own demands for supplies and legions!  People will want doctors on call, schools for their kids and theaters for their free time.  Businesses will need labor living near them, easy to access docks, roads, warehouses and don't forget lots of enginers to keep things in repair!
Oh, and don't forget the walls, towers and gatehouses!
And lots of roads, gardens, roads, plazas and more roads.
Don't worry, there is a easy setting. And you can turn off the Gods too.  Try to take it slow and easy.",3.0
"Caesar III is, in a word, mediocre.  When I bought the game I was expecting a graphically rich and advanced game ala ""Pharaoh,"" ""Zeus,"" or even ""Caesar II.""  What I got was what looked like a glorified demo of a really really good game.  The designers of Caesar III started out with a great thought and made some thoughtful improvments to Caesar II such as the addition of a senate house for each town and a governor's house, palace, and villa for residing in.  They also added 5 separate gods you must appease and keep happy (that's the hard part, don't neglect them).  I think the best improvement they made over its predecessor was that there is no separate ""city"" and ""province"" map (Caesar II owners will know what I mean and share in my frustration over this) that made the game almost impossible to win (I never won one, I always went broke.)
So Caesar III's designers made some improvements, but they also did a few things I'm not happy with.  The game has a dark and despressing ambience that can only keep me playing for about an hour (which translates to about 10 minutes, city-building time, lol).  It's also difficult to make money which has made me become dependant on the money cheat (go to impressionsgames.com for details).  It's difficult to keep your people fed even when you make the best use out of the usually limited farming area.  My last gripe is that you have to keep building prafectures and those architects post all the time that cost money and manpower.  It's a good game, don't get me wrong, it could just be a little better, no wait, A LOT better.  I didn't get what I was expecting, I didn't even get an instruction book.  My suggestion: buy Caesar II if they still make it and enjoy that.",3.0
"I love studying the Romans and when I heard of this game I bought it. When I played it, it was great! but then it got boring and way to repetitive.

The graphics are okay at times. But even on a 500mhz computer it can run slow. I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you have at LEAST a 300mhz. There are many levels to choose from. The game can get a little  frustrating. It's hard. I'd recommend half life if you like shooting  though. But besides slow play it's an alright game.,3.0

"The Twisted Metal series first arrived a few months after the PlayStation's US debut. It was in the forefront of games that really showed off the difference between 32-Bit CD-based systems and the 16-Bit cart platforms that came before. While driving and shooting games had previously existed, Twisted Metal was responsible in part for defining the car-combat genre by putting over-the-top characters into vehicles with arsenals of weapons and special moves and letting them battle it out until only one remained. The second game in the line, Twisted Metal II: World Tour, was a longer, improved version of the original, and it is generally thought of as one of the best games ever released for the PlayStation. But by the time the third title came along, the series' developer, SingleTrac Studios, had been sold to GT Interactive, and publisher 989 Studios opted to bring the line in-house. While the game had new weapons, contestants, and multiplayer options, its levels lacked the originality of the earlier titles, and its new physics engine was more of a frustration than an improvement. Though it sold very well, Twisted Metal III was a huge disappointment, making the question of how Twisted Metal 4 has turned out all the more important for its fans. Rest assured; it's much, much better than its predecessor. To begin with, the level design in Twisted Metal 4 is a big improvement over Twisted Metal III's. There are more hidden areas than in the previous games, and you'll likely play a level more than a dozen times before finding everything. Standout levels include Amazonia 3000 BC, which has quite a few different tiers to sneak off to, and The Oil Rig, which has lots of satisfying places to set traps. Each stage also has a secret weapon that you can use on your enemies until someone comes and knocks you off the weapon's controls. For instance, in the first level you use a large magnet, which sucks your opponents high up into the sky, preparing them for a big drop. The levels aren't quite as epic as those in Twisted Metal II: World Tour, but they get the job done well. The only one that's kind of dull is the first - a construction yard with a lot of topographically flat spaces. The control and physics are also better than in TMIII, but they remain a little too touchy and unforgiving. It's still a little too easy to flip over, or miss a ramp, or go skidding off and get momentarily stuck on a ledge, but it doesn't happen nearly as often as in the previous game. Though prettier than those in TMIII, the graphics in TM4 aren't nearly as sharp as the graphics in its current main competitor - Activision's Vigilante 8: Second Offense - and while the game music fits well enough, it doesn't really draw you in. Each level has its own extended, looped version of songs by bands like Cypress Hill, Cirrus, and Skold; the best among them being remixes of the Rob Zombie tracks that appeared in Twisted Metal III.Several new weapons in the series will become quick favorites, such as the M.I.R.V., the freeze remote (a remote bomb that freezes everyone in the area), and the proximity mines (which work well when you leave them in teleport areas or drop them as you're being chased). Other welcome additions to the line are the new tournament contestants, which include the exterminator truck-driving Goggle Eyes and Rob Zombie, whose Dragula possesses a special weapon that grabs any vehicle in the area and holds it for a moment, while he shoots at it until it explodes. The new create-a-car option offers you three choices for size, style, and paint; four choices of special weapons; spoilers; and more than a dozen taunts. While this is a decent start and better than nothing, doubling the numbers would have really given you the ability to customize a ride just the way you like it. As it stands, you'll likely just use one of the vehicles already provided for you.
Another change is that instead of just having a mid-boss and an end boss, Twisted Metal 4 features bosses at the end of every level who are made up of one or two ""super"" versions of missing contestants (such as Axel and Thumper). It may sound like a good idea, but it ultimately ends up taking away from the feeling of dread you used to feel when a boss emerged in the past. (Remember when the words ""Prepare for Minion"" appeared in Twisted Metal and Twisted Metal II: World Tour?) At least that's the case for all the sub-bosses. When Sweet Tooth finally comes out in the end, you'll run like hell. The two-player multiplayer modes - co-op and deathmatch - still let you configure the split screen by horizontal or vertical cut as well as variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info. (The four-way split modes are the best, since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen.) The problem is that the frame rate in the multiplayer modes isn't nearly as fast as in the single-player levels. If you play as one of the larger, slower vehicles, you'll end up using the turbo quite a bit out of frustration. (Luckily, the framerate's not noticeably lower in four-player thanit is in two-player.) Even with this working against it, the multiplayer mode offers tons of replay value, whether in a deathmatch or a co-op tournament with a friend. And adding to the single-player side is the option to use a CPU ally to help you in the fight. While all these options were also present in Twisted Metal III, they're better realized here because TM4 is a game you'd actually want to play. In the end, Twisted Metal 4 is as huge a leap ahead of Twisted Metal III as the second was to the original. While the series hasn't quite reclaimed its former glory, it at least seems to be on the right track.",3.0
"Well, the game was pretty decent.  The gameplay itself was outstanding, but there's a reason I gave this game only 3 stars.  The graphics [stunk], and plus there were some major glitches in the system that you couldn't ignore.  For example:  One of the cars that I had chose to do combat with had literally gone through a wall.  It wasn't supposed to be part of the gameplay, of course, but it was a major glitch.  And let me say that your car isn't gonna go flying through walls just once, it's also gonna ruin the gameplay for you because it could screw up your tactics.  The game was ok, but like I said, the graphics were awful.  Playstation can do better with graphics.  These graphics look like a glitchy japanese anime wanna be which was created on Super Nintendo, and for a playstation game, that's just sad.
  Also, no storyline.  It was just a senseless blow 'em and shoot 'em up.  Not that I don't like that, but I want a reason for all that.  Even if the plot was shallow, I still would've accepted it, because atleast it would've had a story and a plot.  Anyways, I don't think this game is really worth the money.

"I am surprised that people who have played all the TMs from 1-3 still find enough interesting to play this game.
I realized finally after playing TM4 and TM-Black (on PSX2) recently why Carmageddon was so much better. Basically the excitement from these games come from being able to drive way too fast and barely undercontrol while inflicting cool damage at the same time. In fact in Carmageddon you can drive so fast that you literally launch airborne- which really gives you that rollercoaster-like oh sh....t feeling. Furthermore Carmageddon gives you a through-the-cockit view so it really feels like you are in a car that's just launched off a building and is about to ram into the side of another.
You cannot do that with a game like TM4 because it takes too much precision to hit a target with a missile. To get precision you have to slow down.
In Carmageddon there are no weapons except your car itself. Amazing, the game is fun even without all the superduper missile firing weapons! In Carmageddon you inflict damage solely by collision. The faster you go the harder you hit your opponent, so automatically the game forces you drive fast and fast is what generates that adrenaline rush. Read the reviews for Road Rash Jailbreak and you'll see what I mean. The reviewers reported the lack of ""the high speed rush.""
The most disappointing and fatal thing about TM4 is the physics. Carmageddon had wonderful car deformations and physics. Ie very close to the way you expect cars to fly through the air- like in the movies. In TM4 you can drive to the edge of a vertical cliff and then your car crawls down the side! What is with that?!?! Then if you apply gas backwards you can crawl back up the cliff! I can't believe the implementers of this game didn't simply turn on friction when the vehicle is traversing a surface whose angle is too steep.
Looks like Carmageddon 2 is on sale cheap on (  ), so snag it before its gone. I wish Carmageddon 1 were still available for PSX.",3.0

"This game has a few interesting features, such as the dual scenario, specially that mysterious bald man haunting you, and the two secret mini games.
  But the fatal mistake this game commits, is the most ignored by most people, and unfortunately, RE3 follows the same path. (I can't comment over Code Veronica for I haven't played it) The linear plotline follows the following structure: Guy arrives to some place and discovers myriads of creatures, guy locks himself somewhere, guy discovers there is traitor among the survivors,(Irons) guy discovers a secret lab under (or within) the main structure (in this case, the RPD), guy makes it through and discovers unthinkable truths, guy fights big monster while the clock is ticking, guy needs to run and save his life before the whole place goes *BANG!* It drives me sick.
  I'm sorry RE fans, but it's the truth.(or my opinion, whatever that you wish) Flashy graphics and awesome features do not sum up a great game.  Play it for the fun-of-the-first-play factor alone and move over to something better, because this game has nothing of scary.",3.0

"As an avid Castlevania collector and consummate fan I purchased this game in April and finally beat it last night.  That is to say even for an experienced Castlevaniac used to a challenge this one was exceptionally difficult.  Probably within the top two most difficult Vanias I've played, and the only thing keeping me from saying it's the most difficult is the fact that there are only four medium sized levels in the game.
The game is set a century before the original NES version and features Christopher Belmont as it's whip slinging, candle smashing protagonist.  Apparently the resurrection of Dracula was extremely poorly timed for poor Christopher, as he seems to be still recovering from knee replacements in both legs.  His movement speed is so slow, Simon seems like a long distance sprinter in comparison.
One annoying thing about this Gameboy Castlevania is that the developers often came very close, but ultimately refused to give in to a lot of classic Castlevania elements that make other entries in the series so familiar and comforting.  There are no sub-weapons hidden in the game's candles, instead only whip power-ups, chrystals giving you 50 lousy points a piece, hearts which recover health rather than supplement sub-weapons, and occasionally extra lives placed only in secret or hard to reach areas.  The enemies are similar in their lack of familiarity: the game has zombies, but they appear to be made out of mud or slime and are nothing like traditional ones, bats are present but behave much different then in traditional castlevanias, bone pillars have been replaced by stationary monster heads who shoot fireballs that bounce around the screen, and axe knights have been substituted by lightly armored freaks that throw actual boomerangs, rather than axes that move like boomerangs.  The bosses are equally generic and unfamiliar.
Despite the horrendously slow pace, this game is a show-piece title for early game boy games in terms of graphics.  The monsters all possess multiple frames of animation, and the backgrounds are detailed and distinguishable, with nice shading.  Dracula actually looks a bit cooler than he does in the NES Castlevania.  The game is a difficult but fundamentally sound platformer.  Timing on jumps takes a bit of practice, but the only real complaint is the lack of depth as far as weapons.  The first three bosses are all absurdly easy, with Dracula absurdly difficult, although very beatable once a good technique is developed.  Getting enough shots at him in order to develop such a technique is the most tedious part.
All-in-all, even in '89, Adventure could have been a lot more compelling, but it is still an absolute must for collectors of the series such as myself.  Just don't plan on beating it overnight.",3.0
"Those that got into this series during the 'Metroidvania' phase obviously won't like this game because of the pacing and difficulty, however fans of the original format may find a decent amount of things they will like on this adventure.

Fans of open-ended exploration will want to adventure elsewhere, but fans of the linear games will be somewhat interested in this game.  People that like the 'Metroidvania' games that want one for their gameboy should check out Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3:  Radical Rescue though.",3.0

One of the things I didn't like was how slow Batman moved while everyone else gained the advantage on me with higher speed. It's a hassle to come up with a strategy to defeat enemies because they manage to damage you no matter how hard you try and dodge their attacks. You MUST pick up items that lay around the levels to help you for boss battles and other foes. Overall, it's fun but I feel the SNES version to this game was way better.",3.0
"Batman Returns for the Sega Genesis is a pretty good game. It's got really good graphics,decent gameplay,and I really love the music. I think the music is one of the best things that this game has to offer.

Batman Returns is ALOT better than the disaster that was Batman Forever...or as I call it ""Fatman Forever"".Read my review for that Genesis game and you will see why I give it that title. Only problem with Returns is it's VERY HARD.There are a ton of cheap hits that you will take in this game. Getting to the next Act is quite a chore. You'll die alot. I promise you that. What makes it even harder,is there is no way to change the difficulty level in the options menu.

"Kirby's Dream Land is Kirby's first game. It was released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1992. Its been over 22 years since then. Is Kirby's Dream Land still an excellent game? Lets see......

Kirby is different in this game. He is described as a ''Roly-Poly Hero''. He is also not a Kirby. Instead, he is a Boy.

Nintendo of America was confused about Kirby's color, so they made white instead of pink( though in Japan he was still pink ).

The plot isn't bad. I won't spoil anything though.

There are 5 Levels:
Green Greens: The first level. Simple and fun.
Castle Lololo: A castle. It has a lot of secret areas to find and explore in. This is what makes this area the best.
Float Islands: A level with a Pirate Ship and a Cave.
Bubbly Clouds: A maze area.
Mt. Dedede: Where the Final Boss lives.

You can unlock some Modes. I won't spoil anything.

For those new to Kirby:
Kirby's Dream Land is a game for those new to platformers. Super Mario Bros. too hard? Try this.

"I'm having great trouble recommending Grandia because of its tendency to become extremely boring. This happens for several reasons: first off, the game offers nil challenge - and I do mean none whatsoever. Secondly, the ""real"" story hardly unfolds until the latter part of the second disk. Meanwhile, the player is occupied with the various and sundry sidequests, like saving villages and defeating evil monsters - things that don't have any bearing at all to the central story.
The story itself, involving a lad named Justin who hopes to become a famous adventurer, relies heavily on the backstory, which in turn is very vague and muddled. The tale of the ancient empire of Angelou and its eventual fall due to the corruption of its people is hardly inspired. What keeps Grandia together, however, is the excellent characterization: the people of Grandia are convincingly human, if a bit mellow, though the awful voice acting spoils the effect of some of the key scenes.
Gameplay-wise, Grandia has some interesting ideas, but it executes them so they contribute to the tedium. For example, magic and special moves aren't gained when the character levels up: instead, each character can increase his proficiency with the various elements (fire, water, wind, and earth) and weapon types (swords, daggers, whips, projectiles, etc.), thus gaining attribute boosts and special moves. However, this interesting arrangement ultimately makes even the most routine battles longer since the characters are forced to cast magic as often as possible to increase their abilities.
The ability to see enemies in the dungeons (like in Chrono Cross) is also welcome, though enemies move extremely quickly and there is a whole lot of them, so you can expect to fight just as often as in any other RPG.
However, the actual battle system is very nicely done and becomes very intuitive with practice. In addition to the usual variables, the player must also take into account his distance to the target and its ""openness"", since the characters actually move around the battle field. Also, Grandia has a visual aid to help you figure out whose turn is next - the ""IP Gauge."" Being able to stun enemies and knock them back on this gauge - and get knocked back yourself - adds an element of strategy to every battle, which would be very nice if the game offered any challenge. As things are, the battle system goes to waste.
Graphically, Grandia is clean and bright, with colorful sprites on fully polygonal backgrounds. Unfortunately, some of the enemy sprites are less than pretty, and some magic spells are downright embarassing. There are some short bits of FMV, but the single anime sequence is repeated far too often.
Grandia might possibly be suited for young players who could appreciate the low challenge, whacky voice-overs, and charming story. Older gamers who are looking for a more purposeful adventure should look elsewhere.",3.0
"As said above, I think this is the best Sonic title of the Genesis four (1, 2, 3 & S&K).  In this game we see Sonic going up against Robotnick and a hoard of new mechanical enemies. After Sonic knocked Robotnicks evil Death Egg machine out of the sky in Sonic 3, it landed on the Floating Island. Now stuck in the biggest volcano on the island, Robotnick needs the master Chaos Emerald to get it out. But guess who lives on Floating Island? Knuckles the Echidna, the guardian of the Chaos emerald, who has a problem of his own...an evil robot who is terrorizing the island. In this game we get to play either Sonic or Knuckles, the latter having cooler moves like flying and climbing. However, Sonic's main advantage is that he has four or five more levels to his game. The two have the same levels, they're altered sometimes to suit the story of each. Although Sonic 2 was the longer game, Sonic & Knuckles is cooler because of the richer graphics and more detailed levels. You're character gets to swing from ropes, tests his arm strength on lifting machines, climb rungs over nothingness, bungee down steep cliffs, and ride a dizzying laser transport. The levels display their own little characteristics. Walk through the Mushroom Hill Zone and watch pollen fly up behind you. See the heat your character must be feeling as heatwaves rise from golden sands in the Sandopolis Zone. Fight an evil boss at the end of almost every level. Enjoy the electrifying excitement as the final showdown with Sonic and the evil Dr. Robotnic ensues. Gather all the chaos emeralds and enter a secret end level where you chase Robotnick through space as... buy the game and find out. Plus with the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge you can hook Sonic 2 to the top to play Knuckles in the that game. Put Sonic 3 on top and play all of the levels in that game combined with the ones in S & K. Put another game on top and play endless special levels. If you're looking for a good game on the Genesis console, this is it. It is hard to find, but its worth it if you're into Sonic games or adventure games. Whew!",3.0

"It works fine with my Sonic 3 cartridge, with some issues. I have to blow in it every now and then.

I'm over 20 hours into the game now and not once have any of the boss battles ever been a problem.  I've only had 2 of my characters die at any given time throughout the game thus far.  This game is definitely a great game for beginners, but those who are looking for more of a challenge, you will not find it here.",3.0
"Well, after a couple of months, I have finally beaten Grandia. All in all, the action of the game was good, the growth system fantastic, although the combat-laden progression of the story got tedious at times. In general, I would have beaten such a game in a couple of weeks, and it would have received 4 (maybe 4 and a half) stars.
HOWEVER...
This game took me a couple of months because I could not STAND the glitches. Ever so often, the game would freeze up on me, which caused me endless frustration. Were it not for the fact that I could save so often (which in general makes a game very easy), I would have returned the game long ago. However, I stayed the course, and the game itself was pretty good. I have to drop a star off of its rating, however.",3.0

"This would be an okay game to get,if you just wanted a Ninja Turtles game for your Sega Genesis. It's just your basic fighting game,but with Ninja Turtles characters. I've heard the SNES version is a bit better,because that version has Shredder. Unfortunatly..the Genesis version does not. Which I found to be a major drag. The graphics in this game are really good. The controls are kind of a letdown. One button for taunt and the other two for attacks. Maybe It's better with a six button controller. I don't know. I have a three button pad. The game modes are pretty weak too. Just fighting the CPU and having two player matches. Practice mode really sucks. It's also VERY HARD! I had a hell of a time trying to get past the first fight. Overall,I think this game could have had alot more depth to it. Including better characters for one thing. Which I would say the lack of cooler characters,is this game's biggest downfall,but it's still pretty fun(if you love a good challenge)...but If your gonna buy this...dont pay too much for it.",3.0
"Having played my way through the Master System AND the Mega Drive versions of this game back in the day (both were rather different) I can confirm that the 8-Bit Master System incarnation is somehow better than its 16-Bit sibling.

Both feature Mickey venturing into said castle to rescue Minnie from the evil with Mizrabel and similarly-themed levels, but virtually everything beyond that point is different. The MS version actually feels like you're exploring a castle while the MD version feels more disconnected.

"This is an awesome game from a great series.  Phantasy Star was kinda like the ""Final Fantasy"" of Sega, with some profound differences in style and setting.
The graphics on this game, though they are 16-bit, are actually quite good, drawn in stylish anime.  The music is great, easily reflecting the technological setting of the series.
The gameplay is pretty good, although newer RPG gamers might be discouraged from playing this... it's most definitely ""old school,"" which means typical, turn-based, random battles and dungeons that are long, maze-like, and very complicated to get through.  I've been playing RPGs since Dragon Warrior, and even I can't really stand to go through these dungeons.  Being ""old school"" also means that you'll have to spend some time just going out and fighting monsters in order to level up for the next coming areas.
Now, this game is quite good, but unfortunately, the tedium of level-building and the excessively long dungeons take a little bit away from the rating.  Overall though, this game is pretty good, if you can still find it.",3.0

"This game is the weirdest computer game I have ever seen. It orignally was released when Michael Jackson WAS a bigshot, but it oddly foreshadows today.

The whole objective of this game is to have Michael Jackson rescure adoring little boys (unfortunately, I am serious)who squeal ""Michael...Michael"" as if being with him IS the lottery. The graphics are okay considering it is the 1980's, but the connotations of the plot are unbelievable. We are SUPPOSED to pair Michael Jackson up with little boys.

"Contact is an interesting DS game. Interesting, interesting...

I don't read many gaming magazines, because unless I found an online offer for a free year's subscription, I don't think I would ever pay for one. I generally don't read online previews to games either, so I have very little idea about games that are about to be released.

Compared to many other DS games, Contact did have slightly more exposure than other games that were being released around the same time. October of 2006 was a hectic month, with Touch Detective an all these other interesting looking game covers splattered all over GameCrazys, GameStops, EB Games etc. all over.

So I bought Contact the day it came out, and I passed up on Point Blank DS, a game I picked up later anyway. Contact lends itself to be an interesting RPG, like none other I had played before. Of course, be not being a console gamer, I have no idea if there's other games like this one, but I'm sure there are.

Contact is very nitpicky on the gameplay. You have to wear certain outfits to perform certain tasks. This can get tedious, as you need to go all the way back to your base (some floating ship or UFO, I forget) to equip a Chef's outfit (to cook), a Fisherman's outfit (to fly... just kidding), etc. Your inventory slots also have an allotted amount of spaces, which allows the player to know exactly how many items can be obtained in the course of the game, much unlike the Final Fantasy series, which you need a guide to figure out the master item/weapon list.

The story is thick, unique. Once again, you have to associate ""DS + Atlus = Unique"". It's a very interesting, (somewhat unsuccessful in my opinion) implementation of the user (you) in the game.

I won't be a spoiler, so let's get to the point. Contact is tedious, and can get very very redundant. But let's be honest here .. aren't RPG's supposed to be redundant? Aren't you supposed to fight monsters to gain EXP and MONEY to buy things and buff your characte up so you can go on to do much more of the same throughout the later stages of the game?

So it is with Contact. It is an active fighting RPG, so there's no magic moves or special abilities (save a few), much like Zelda. I think most users will agree that that's what makes the game eventually boring

It's a DS, users can't complain about not getting the full RPG experience as was readily available in PS2-like RPGs. DS RPGs will stick to the redundant nature of the SNES RPG that we all once loved so much a long time ago. Gamers have been spoiled by newer, flashier RPGs and expect too much from the DS. Even Final Fantasy III fell short of my expectations, but I quickly came to realize it would be this way with DS RPGs for a while. (Etrian Odyssey is a nice, fresh RPG that's actually fun. Thanks Atlus)

Still, it's not the greatest game in the world, but a decent pickup, as are most DS titles. Contact was $29.99 retail when first released, and I don't think it's strayed too far from the original price, although used it can be picked up for a good price. Contact is a very time consuming game, and if the value of the game is determined by the length of it, then you got yourself a gold mine here.",3.0
"This game is great for the RPG gamer who enjoys all aspects of life. Reminds me a lot of a mix between earth bound and animal crossing.

The only thing I hate is that it is very hard to do multi player (which is required to fully complete the game.) The other person has to have the game cartridge and have to both be able to connect to Wi Fi.

A piece of advice to those planning to share this game with family or friends: Get a separate game for each of you, otherwise you may never get to play again. It is quite addicting.",3.0
"Contact for the DS is a weird little RPG that had some hype surrounding it, but disregard anything good you might have heard.  Looking like a bastard offspring of Earthbound for the Super Nintendo, Contact offers some nice dungeon type areas, quirky characters, and nice side quests, but the rest of it feels as if we've seen all this before, and seen it done better to boot.  What really hurts Contact is the incredibly boring and repetitive combat, in which each side trades hits until one goes down.  The combat alone makes Contact suffer, not to mention the bland graphics, tacked on touch screen controls and features, and a surprisingly short main quest for an RPG.  There's some Wi-Fi capabilities as well, allowing you to obtain some special items via trades with other players, and that's about all that Contact has to offer.  The game has a unique charm to it, and it's not necessarily a hard game to get into, but there's nothing here that brings it to the level of say, Final Fantasy III.  All in all, Contact isn't a bad game one bit, but it's far from being anything spectacular.",3.0
"A man known as Professor has crash landed on an island and he needs help to fix his space ship so he can return to his home planet. That is where you and Terry come in. Terry, the young boy whom the Professor recruits, is not exactly experienced in saving the world - that is where you come in. As an experienced gamer surely you've saved the world a couple dozen times or so.

You take the role of the unheard, unseen force that guides Terry on his quest while communicating with the Professor. Its different but is it better? This seems to kind of take you out of the game because this is Terry's adventure you're just the puppet master who pulls his strings. This might not be what you were expecting out of a game marketed as an RPG , if you can get over that and see this game for what it really is you will be in for a pleasant surprise. This game is unique balance of an RPG and RTS that I've never seen before.

Terry's movements are controlled with either stylus or d-pad but the fighting is completely automated. When Terry goes into battle mode, and he will instantly start attacking the closest enemy (or the one of your choice, if the stylus is used). Aside from throwing in a couple special attacks from time to time all you pretty much have to do is point out a target and watch Terry go.

Seems rather mundane for you as the gamer to just watch Terry beat enemies down with a stick. What are you supposed to do?! This is where the RTS part of the game comes in, you not only have to manageTerry's special attacks and items, you get to mess around with the sticker system that allows you to modify the battlefield. So while you may not be attacking the enemies directly, your involvement is essential to help the Professor return to his home planet.

The graphical presentation implemented here is very fitting for this game. The top screen displays the inside of the Professor's space ship has a very Earthbound look to it while the bottom screen has a more realistic look to it. This serves as a constant reminder that the Professor is not of Terry's world.

If you are into customization then this is the game for you. Terry has dozens of stats thats can be modified based on this action. Is Terry constantly beating on enemies? If so, his attack level will go up. Or is Terry getting abused out in the battlefield? Well, expect him to be able to tolerate even more severe ass kickings. Everything can be modified: defense, magic ability, vocational skills, etc. Not only that, but each category has sub-skills that can be tweaked as well. Want more? How about customs that let Terry gain new abilities and skills like cooking; it is very similar to Final Fantasy's job system.

Overall

The game tries to be different and while it succeeds in that regard perhaps it should have spent more time trying to be enjoyable. At first glance you would think that this game is an RPG but it's not, it just has some RPG elements. It's an odd mix of RPG, RTS and action/adventure that in the end does not work out. The story is forgettable and while the ending is ""interesting"" it falls short, just like this game.

"After years of Nintendo making very crappy Marvel comic licensed titles, ""Sega Genesis does NOT!!"" It finally makes a good Marvel Comics game (Spider Man for Sega Genesis which I find ok) and its X-Men.  Although it wasn't the best, Sega tried its best to fit the best graphics and gameplay possible for a 16-bit system (it was a good game for its time).  In this game, there are only four characters to choose from which are Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Gambit and you fight your way through six intense levels of which strategy is required.  Nightcrawler simply is the best (and sometimes the only useful character) to choose because of his extensive, yet deadly teleportation and superior speed. The scene where you fight Apocalypse is where Nightcrawler is mandatory so save his strength for that level.  Its a great game to add to your collection, but allow me to highlight the hits and misses this game has to offer.  Don't let a few misses prevent you from getting the game, because a difficult game doesn't always make it less fun.

GAME HITS:
Graphics were impressive for its time, using the same (almost life like) animation as the Spider Man game for Sega plus the same sound effects.  The controls were reponsive and attack/jump buttons were at the right place.  Like the first ninja turtles game for NES, you get to switch characters during the game. You also get to choose several X-Men for assistance such as Archangel, Storm, and Rouge (offense helpers when things get really rough) plus Iceman and Jean Grey (when you need to get to ""out of reach"" areas).  Enemy selection from the comics were decent (Sabretooth, Death Bird, Juggernaut, Zaladane, Sentinals, Apocalypse, Ahab, Mojo, and Magneto) and there were a variety of weaker enemies.

GAME MISSES
It's bad enough that your mutant powers are limited to a mutant powerbar, but I find it ridiculous that releasing Wolverine's deadly claws are part of his powers (and depletes much of his energy bar even when he is standing still).  When the power bar goes down he'll either retract his claws or he'll start uncontrollably slash allover the place while your life bar depletes.  After fighting Mojo, you have to press the reset button right to stop the speading computer virus and move on to Astroid M.  If you press it wrong, you start all over (now thats retarted).  Its a very big deal because you work hard to pass through these first 5 intense levels.  For that reason alone, do not get the game for the Wii console because I hear that the reset button on that console makes it impossible to get it right.  The characters you control  move much too slow (except for Nightcrawler) and their regular attacks are a bit delayed.  At least most of the enemies attack at the same speed so thats a little fair, but for a side-scrolling game, thats a disappointment.",3.0

"Well, for starters, this game isn't the awesome game from the arcade. While that X-Men game was based off of the failed X-Men pilot Pryde of the X-Men and featured Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Dazzler, and Nightcrawler, this game features Wolverine, Cyclops, Gambit, and Nightcrawler with the ability to call on help from Storm, Rogue, Archangel, and Iceman.

You know how half the episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation feature the holodeck going haywire and trying to take over the ship and kill the crew? Well, X-Men face a similar plot when the danger room malfunctions and you are forced to survive dangerous simulation after dangerous simulation. I'll be blunt as far as which characters are good: all of them except Gambit. Nightcrawler is clearly the best because of his jump kick and teleport ability, Cyclops has a good projectible mutant power as well as a high jump, Wolverine heals (at the snail's pace of just a fraction of his health every 3 minutes or so) and his claws augment his attacks, but Gambit's mutant power (throwing a charged playing card) isn't useful. The flight pattern is a wavy back and forth, plus it doesn't appear to do much damage. On top of that, if you duck to avoid getting shot, you will still get hit. In short, Gambit sucks in this game.

Another big disappointment is the sound. While the music to the second level (the space station) is incredible, especially considering the Sega Genesis standards, the rest of the music in the game is lousy. The savage land doesn't even really have music at all, Mojo's level is obnoxious sounding, and the lighthouse level sounds terrible as well. Were they only capable of producing one good level of music?

Another low-point in the game is the bosses. Xandra, Lady Deathstrike, Ahab (really? Ahab? C'mon), a dumbed-down version of Apocolypse, and big fat Mojo topped off with classic Magneto. It would have been cooler to see villains like The Blob, Pyro, Omega Red, or Mr. Sinister. I don't even know who Xandra is.

They also screwed up with mid-stage bosses. At least they actually had Juggernaut and Sabretooth in the game, but I've always seen those two personified as being much larger than the X-Men. In the game, they are the same size as everyone else.

The game is more of an action platformer than a ""side scroller beat em up"", and is overall very lacking in gameplay. I liked it enough as a kid, but considering that Genesis supported something as fantastic as a port of the arcade game The Punisher and did it well, I fail to see why this X-Men game is just so paltry and bare-bones.

My favorite complaint about this game is the conclusion of Mojo's level. After defeating Mojo, you continue on until you get to the point where you destroy a computer. You are then instructed by Professor X to ""reset the computer"". Well, unless you knew the solution ahead of time, this could be problematic and baffling. It turns out Professor X wants you to actually reset your Sega Genesis. Doing so continues the game and takes you to the final level, Asteroid M. A friend had to tell me that when I was a kid, not sure if I ever would have figured that one out on my own.

My last complaint is the ending. After defeating Magneto, you are treated/punished with a really dull debate in text between Professor X and Magneto where they argue about the X-Men being water and sunlight and evaporation and bringing life and flowers...I'm totally serious, it's ridiculous. Magneto even says to Professor X ""Kill me"" during the conversation. But of course Professor X lets Magneto go, as usual, and nothing is actually resolved. What a boring waste.

Graphics are decent, but the gameplay is just too mediocre. To be fair though, the mistakes from this game were not repeated in the sequel. Boring.",3.0

It isn't too hard to go through the tower, but the you get to the Earth cave and BANG, you take three or so hits from a zombie and its all over.  Actually get to the Scion at the end of the cave and you'll be gone in less that that.  I like the fact that in other RPGs you can actually level up to get stronger than a boss, but in this game, the bosses get harder, so you have to use ""strategy"" (aka luck) to beat certain bosses.  It could have been so good if it were balanced, like Final Fantasy games, which, in the old days, actually did require strategy.",3.0
The system works really well but the stick was cheap and broke. I am not able to play it until I get a new stick.,3.0
"Yeah, the first thing I think when someone mentions this game is all the reviews I've seen online that mention the extreme challenge.  I've heard, many many times, that the difficulty is the biggest reason this game is inferior to the first installment.  Yeah, that might be true (ok, I won't deny it- it's COMPLETELY true!) but there are some nice things about it.

One, it's all about the action.  The action levels in the previous ActRaiser were fantastic, and the ones in this game are nearly as good, probably.  But then you quickly find out the difficulty has been turned up a few notches, and you wanna run away.  I honestly haven't played this game that much.  My dad's ex-girlfriend bought a Super NES one time, so me and her could go back and forth exchanging games, but the relationship between her and my dad was always kind of rocky, so not much exchanging occurred after all.

Anyway, she bought ActRaiser II as her first purchase, unaware that the challenge of the game was set on extremely hard (even on easy) and it would STAY that way throughout the game, making you want to go crazy (giving you a feeling of NOT feeling good at ALL about yourself after completing a level, because you'd know the next level would be JUST as hard, or even HARDER!)  People who are able to go through this game without cheating, and defeat the final boss- you're the best!  Actually, maybe if you practice one level over and over and finally beat it, you WOULD feel good about it.  But then the next level comes along and SMACK, back down to getting your butt kicked again!

Hey,  I wasn't aware of the challenge either, until I got the internet.  HARD game here folks.  HARD!  Definitely not a good game to recommend to someone just learning to play video games!  Also not a good game for someone who gives up easily (like me!)

I remember a certain theme song in this game that was incredibly warped the way it had a delicate and DARK, quiet melody.  I think it was the main map screen (if there even is one- I can't remember the game very well).  That was some damn intense music there, now.  I also remember the backgrounds of the levels had a very pretty appearance, and the detail was wonderful, which is what we've come to expect from a system as fantastic as the Super NES.

As for the decision on the part of the game makers to remove the simulation part of the game: I don't have a problem with it.  It's not that big of a deal, if you ask me.  What drags the game down for me lies straight in the difficulty, and nothing else.  A good challenge is a nice way to start the day, but darn, not THIS kind of challenge!

Well, the final verdict- if you want this game, go ahead and get it.  I won't stop you.  But remember: those reviewers on the internet speak the truth- this game is oh so -OH SO- challenging!",3.0
It works but it is finicky sometimes. Not bad for being vintage though. Overall I am satisfied with the system.,3.0

"I think this system is pretty solid system. There were some good games for it and a lot of them. For me, I didn't play this system very much growing up so there is not as much of a nostalgic feeling for me. The particular system I purchased was in a little rough shape as the power button sticks and sometimes does not work. Besides that though, it's worth owning then again, I own about every system! I'm biased!",3.0
"Castlevania fans must appreciate a solid challenge because, to me, Super Castlevania IV is a *really* hard game.  There's nothing like dying a million times to make myself feel really dumb, only to come online to see many people actually think the game is simple!  I can't believe people think this game is easy.

I can't even beat the game with a Game Genie infinite life cheat code!  I can only assume people who think this game is easy are comparing the difficulty to the more challenging Castlevania games on the NES or something.  If that's the case, you're right.  Those old NES Castlevania games truly test your patience!  At least in Super Castlevania IV I can manage to survive halfway through.

Comparing Super Castlevania IV to other games on the Super NES like Zelda: Link to the Past or Mega Man X2, it's a really tough game.  Despite that, it's a pretty fun game and has a really good soundtrack.  You'll be humming along to the theme in the opening level, just you wait!  Just beware of the severe difficulty in the later levels.",3.0

"I bought the Sega because I still have a ton of games for it and my original system had died years ago.
Ideally, I would give 0 stars for the product I received but 5 for the system in general.

I was very dissapointed to find upon arrival that the machine I received was absolutely filthy, like some slob had been eating over it and scratching it while playing it for quite some time. I understand it is used, but seriously, they couldn't even wipe it off?
The second thing I noticed was that it did not come with 2 or even one controller, even though they are pictured for the item.
Lastly, I purchased this  because it said it had the composite (yellow, red & white) cables instead of a coaxial hookup, this was also false.

I realize these problems are all the fault of the seller and not of the system, but make sure you look into the seller first, mine was 1UP Video Games.",3.0

"Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest was one of those random games that somene picked me up for a birthday for VERY cheap at Target back in the day. There was a reason for it. :)

I do not want to be instantly harsh on it, because the reality, I had a good time with it. For those that do not know...Americans made this Final Fantasy. I could stop there. That is not to bash my country but back then, we were not known for our strong game development skills when it came to RPGs, especially with a strong pedogree like the Japanese studio Square was known for. (Namesake only for this one)

With JRPG's being all the rage back then, it was a shock that this game was even developed to begin with. It was simply not needed, but before I continue to bash it, lets talk about what it did good.

I really liked the idea of seeing where enemies were. For us Final Fantasy lovers, the random encounter system of getting into a fight is annoying and frustrating. You hope that you have just 3-4 squares left to get to the next story part and BOOM a fight. Usually just power mashing 1 button to spam the ""attack"" command and you were done. The reality, lets be real, that was a lot of our RPG experience on Super Nintendo, but we loved it. Anyway, that was a nice addition. The fights were the same old over and over, but showing us enemy encounter locations was nice. There was also no over map. There was but not one that you have full control over navigation. It basically brings you from 1 place to another and its not free running around like we were accustomed too in Final Fantasy 2.

It was crazy easy to get into because of its really simple design, which was nice, and the graphics were not TERRIBLE....though, surely not Final Fantasy 2 (US) level (which came out before this). The game also was not hard at all. I rarely recall ever dying unless I really was not paying attention.

The story was your standard bad guys doing bad things as always, so there was not much depth to this almost arcade feeling RPG, but in the end, I complete the game and was happy to say I did.
However, this is not a game that holds up well today at all and frankly, ill probably never play it again.",3.0
"THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS REAL GOOD.THERE IS A LOT OF ALIENS IN THIS GAME BIG,LITTLE AND EGGS TOO.",3.0
"This game is VERY difficult, not only because you get one life, and have to fight thousands of aliens, but each of the five levels you must go through takes an hour to three hours to complete. It is an intensely tedious game, but there are some nice animations. You play Lt. Ripley and must complete six tasks for each level to complete it. These tasks can be to save prisoners from the alien captures, fry some alien eggs, seal doors and fix piping or any other amount of tasks. There are only three weapons (flamethrower, machine gun and grenade launcher), so not much gameplay there. Bottom line is there are 10 types of aliens and 5000 of them each.",3.0
"Game is not of the actual Final Fantasy genre. It is like an encountering slow lvling adventure where the encounters are engaged by the player and are not random. It is fun, but is not like many of the Final Fantasy games.",3.0
"I played this when I was 12 and loved it; in fact, I once played this for 5 hours straight and didn't know it.  But when I played it again as an adult, it was way too easy.  So if you're a kid and you need to learn more about RPG's(and you actually still have a SNES), you might like to play this one.  Otherwise, move onto a numbered FF game like Final Fantasy 6 or 9.

I will say the music isn't half bad though :)",3.0
"this game has several things going for it, especially the real time world map on which you play. Also, character creation is good, and you have a decent amount of quests at any given time to keep you busy. However, that's where the problems start. It's so easy to get lost traveling any decent distance is laughable, and the monsters are way buff for your level 1 party. On top of that, if you're out at night a giant space serpent or some other such godawfully powerful monster will come down and strafe your party.

Usually, i do decently for a while, but then i can't find any frickin heals and so my party dies off one by one. Also, you can never tell when you've gone the wrong way long enough til you get to the border, at which point a muppet-looking dude tells you you'll die if you leave this land, then disappears again, accompanied by a strange, loud droning sound. As said though, the castles are cool, providing enemies to fight, switches to hit, puzzles to solve and items to loot. Strange things happened even in the first castle, however, as to get to the prince of earth to receive my first quest i apparently had to cross restricted areas, and was attacked by his guards! That said, if you have the large amount of patience to figure it out, it is fun. IF so, i would recommend rerolling your characters several times at start to get optimum stats, as you will need it.",3.0
"I remember reading about the Ameiga version of this game back in 1989 in the Questbusters Magazine.(I'm old and proud of it!)  I couldn't buy it because my Apple IIGS wouldn't play it but I did get my hands on the SNES version.  I must say, that even in 1992 when I bought the SNES version I didn't like it and had to return it to the store.  It was hollow, and monotonous and very tedious at times.  However their was one thing that I did like, the castles.  They were rendered very well for the times and set the mood perfectly.  The castle music, especially Prince Haaggkkhen's castle was very appropriate for the mood of a dark and mysterious castle.  Princesse Naaktkha's castle music was sinister as well.
The reason I can spell thier names is because I just solved Drakkhen(kh pronounced by opening your throat) this morning.  I had rebought a used copy of the game.
The outdoor music is sometimes depressing but the quality is there.  If you are looking for an 80's RPG, look elsewhere, they're are a lot of good ones in the auctions and e-bay, as well as second hand stores.  I solved it once and it is farily entertaining at times, but I will not play it again.  It's too tedious.",3.0
"That should be the real title....I played this game about 10 years ago...I liked it then, but I haven't played it since I finished it 10 years ago. there is no real story, the charachters are lifeless and boring, and the graphics were not too hot. I don't remember muich about the plot though, so I cant really talk about it...I just know it's basicly a dummied down FF game.

"Final Fantasy, Mystic Quest, is in my opinion, the best possible way to gain access to the unholy glory of FF7:Mystic Quest. Mystic Quest allows you but a glimpse of the history and magic which dwells within the sacred world of Final Fantasy, but it is a glimpse that will leave you salivating for more.  Mystic Quest is the best way to begin your training in the art of FF combat.  You will by no means be able to obtain the godly mastery of Cloud with just this game, but it will open up your eyes to a whole new world of mystery and wonder.

  I suggest that you purchase FF7:Mystic Quest at the same time that you buy this, because after your done with Mystic Quest, if you don't immedietly have some more Final Fantasy to play, you will probably become possessed with a murderous rage, and you will not be sane enough to make it to the store to buy FF7.  In fact, you should probably leave FF7 in a powered up Playstation at all times, because that is the only way to prevent yourself from commiting a murder-suicide during the load screen.  Even me, the greatest FF fan in the world, has had some problems with that.

Buy Mystic Quest, the prequel to the greatest game of all time, FF7:Mystic Quest, and be prepared to enter upon a majestic adventure from which you will never return.",3.0
"Two ways that are comparable in principle to this game and FF7. Both are easy games to complete and feature nice lengthy quests (well, this is decent for its time -- 15-25 hours), but it's the maturity level that makes them different.
Being a college film student who isn't one trying to get into film to make more ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" type movies, I'm one for the cinematic and dramatic flairs. FF7 is a great game to introduce people into the world of RPG's with, but like the ESRB knew, it isn't a game to play when young. It's heartbreaking, and full of killing; both good and bad. This game here is more of the innocent story with very simplistic locations, interface, story and dialogue.
However, if you're a seasoned RPG veteran who's used to FFX and such, don't expect much from this game. It'll just be a shallow set of battles and treasure chests where you'll gain little more than just saying that you beat another RPG in the world. The graphics were no better than FF4 in most respects, the battle system and interfaces as simplistic as one can comprehend (apart from the jumping, which helps you with some really complex mazes), and there is vurtiously no character development.
However, keeping with the Final Fantasy tradition (until FFIX, or maybe VIII), the music is phenomenal in almost every way, which is something that to me alone adds tons of replay. Play 15 hours of monster-killing with a cool soundtrack every year or two; sounds cool, huh? Also, if you're interested in every buying RPG Maker or one of those professional RPG makers, this is a good style of game to make as a first entry.
This game has charm as it's more simplistic than even the most imaginative person can imagine. Weak entry to the series? You'd better believe it!! However, my rating more reflects when this was one of the only games I had to play, and with it being so, I came to appreciate it. -- Besides, it has a plot at all, unlike some of Square's slightly more recent titles like Legend of Mana and Chrono Cross; just don't expect anything remotely that of Kingdom Hearts, Front Mission 3 or the more professionally made Final Fantasy's.",3.0
"This was Super Nintendo's cross between a Final Fantasy RPG game and a Zelda type RPG game. To start with the graphics are very basic, it looks more like it could be a Nintendo game (not SNES), and the plotline is simplistic going to different areas to defeat a big boss and get an item that lets you go to the next area. Simple isn't it? But then the real worthwhile part about this game is its originality, you can jump in the game, you can cut down trees with your axe, blow up walls with your bombs and climb walls with your claws. Another interesting part is that you can see the enemies as characters on the overhead map! So you can run into them and fight them, but then rather than fighting them like Zelda, it takes you to a battle screen like a true RPG. Something else is that rather than a real overhead map of the world where you explore, you start at an area which gives you four choices of where to go, up down left and right. You select the path and the hero will take that path automatically, no monsters or anything! The monsters are all inside of the areas, towns, caves and caverns.",3.0

The platforming is solid if uninspired the bosses are epic and require some amount of puzzle-solving to beat, they don't just have flashing weak points.",3.0
"As you probably know already, this review is for one of the many installments of the Shinobi series called Shadow Dancer. The story for this game is straight-forward enough. Some evil guy has taken control of the city and claimed a bunch of hostages. Shinobi and his faithful dog have to come in and save the day. What could go wrong? Well plenty can go wrong when they turn Shinobi into the worst example of a ninja ever! You would think he would stick to the shadows or something since they made him into such a pushover! When you play this game, everything seems to be going fine and it's enjoyable enough.......until you realize you get hit once and you're dead. You just get to walk around and fight all these armed guards and other ninjas while you can't take a single hit. It's stories like these that just come across as being totally unbelievable. What about Ryu from Ninja Gaiden? He was a great ninja. You know why? Because he could actually take quite a few hits before he went down. Ryu was tough and he had the health bar to prove it! But not Ryu, he's just some pansy with ninja stars and a sword, but if he takes a single hit from anything, he dies. I've heard of games being hardcore but this is just stupid. Shinobi is supposed to be a legendary ninja who defends the world from the powers of darkness. Apparently this is the only game they made where you don't get a health bar and good riddance! It was a terrible idea and makes the game much harder than it needs to be.",3.0
"Shadow Dancer is the story of Joe Mushashi and his faithful dog Yamoto. Together they go out and beat up the ruthless thugs of the Neo Zeed Corporation and it's boss the Union Lizard. It's a load of confusing nonsense and in the journey from Arcade to Genesis the plot seems to have been erased and events taking place in the game just seem like gobbledegook. All you really do in this game is jump around taking strange-looking villains out with Surikens.

To be honest, the arcade version of Shadow Dancer was much better. The graphics were far superior, the levels were cooler (levels such as the airport and junkyard are missing in this version) and the bad guys less weird.

Plus it's very, very short with only 5 levels all over in a few minutes. As it was such a cool arcade game it's shocking that a game so easy and tepid could end up on the Genesis. It was capable of much more than this and Shadow Dancer is really only a game for Shinobi completists.",3.0

"I've never been able to enjoy the Final Fantasy series as much as most people.  The storyline is quite big and the turn based action is decent, but it just leaves me underwhelmed when the game is finally over.  In Final Fantasy II, the graphics aren't that great.  Even when the game was popular the graphics never looked that great, in my opinion.  I don't know, everyone loves Final Fantasy and I guess I have no choice but to recommend it to any fan of RPGs.  Just remember that better graphics have come along since the early 90's, and featuring better-looking graphics is the best direction an RPG game can take.",3.0

"Considering the high price of the game (and having never played a Final Fantasy game), I decided to download this on Wii. Up until the issue started, I loved the beautiful game. The storyline was plain beautiful. It was all about magic and technology colliding, rebels trying to squash the evil empire, and a helpless girl who was enslaved. The graphics, while appearing to be basic, became quite advanced after a while. The music was triumphant and bold, fitting the game perfectly. However, Nintendo or Square altered the VC port. The save feature was completely removed, and I could not save at all. What was their excuse? It was ""You can now use the software suspension feature"", which basically means you can exit the game and it will pause until you come back. However, if for some reason the game is cut off without suspending (either by upset brothers or power surges) you get to start the RPG all over. On the final boss when the power goes out? Back to being enslaved in the beginning. Also, the game is difficult. I don't mind the difficulty level at all, but if I get a single Game Over it goes right back to the opening credits. How does Nintendo expect me to beat a long, challenging, and very complicated RPG without dying? Now I have three options:
1. I will have to buy the original copy for $40 to $1000 dollars (most likely)
2. I will have to play the updated ""3D"" port on DS (somewhat likely)
3. I will have to download the same ""3D"" remake now overpriced and on a touchscreen tablet. (unlikely)

"Secret of Mana is one of the most popular RPG's ever sold for the SNES. It's popularity is well-earned. It has an intriguing plot, enjoyable characters and dialogues, and fun boss battles. So why give this game a 3 star rating? I'll tell you why. You collect elementals as you go through the game and the only way to level up their powers from 0 to 8 is to continuously use their powers over and over again. Sometimes you have to use a spell 30 times before it goes up in level. And you're putting yourself at a big disadvantage if you don't level up your elementals as you go through the game. This takes hours away from moving through the stages and storyline and has been a HUGE source of aggravation for me. But maybe I shouldn't be so hard, the bosses are fun to fight. Except at the beginning, when they heal all the damage you dealt to them every 2 minutes! Don't get me wrong: this game is a lot of fun. It just has some rough edges that need to be smoothed out. The game is pretty long and your attacks get pretty powerful and the magic attacks are a lot of fun to watch. I just look back and think about how this could have been one of the best RPG's ever, but because of a few critical mistakes, this game just falls short of greatness. It just ends up being average instead......",3.0
"For brainiacs and people that love puzzles, this is a five star game, for those who love action and shooting games, you will get bored after the first few levels. You are Krusty the Klown and your funhouse has been overrun by rats! So you must go on five levels and around 40 stages killing them all in fun ways. Not killing them by shoting them, killing them by setting paths from the mice to where they go into a rat trap. Putting down blocks to make stairs so they go up to a trap or putting them in jars and releasing them near a trap. But there are other hazards along the way to stop Krusty, like giant snakes and birds and you must kill them with either cream pies or super bouncy balls.",3.0
"My first impression of Secret of Mana was that it was a intriguing game. It was fun to switch between the three characters on the battle field to attack different enemies. I also found the idea of leveling up your weapon and magic skills a great way to spend my time. The game had a wide variety of bad guys with different kinds of short and long range attacks. I was very excited about what was going to run into next. And of course, the music was great even to the end.

Unfortunately, I kept running into the same things. The same enemies and bosses were used over and over again, but they were just a different color. The little bad guys had some extra moves which made it okay. The bosses, though, lacked any extra moves, but just had a higher defense and evade rate. I have to make a list of how many times I've seen major dungeon bosses be used over again:

bug boss - 2
manator boss - 3
two-headed dragon - 2
Amphibious boss - 3
Bike Rider boss - 3
Robot Boss - 2
Snake Boss - 3
Troll Boss - 3
Dragon Boss -3

These are the ones I can remember off the top of my head, but there are probably more.

Another problem with the game is leveling up your elemental magic does not give you any new spells. The power-up moves you get when leveling up your weapon skill become worthless as enemies become ridiculously evasive. The last third of the game, I was spending most of my time hacking away at a single little bad guys for minutes because they somehow avoided my attacks by standing still. To me, the game became irritating.

Do not let the first half of this game fool you. It is one of those type of games that you wouldn't want to play again since there are no new spells, bosses, hidden items or moves I haven't seen already.

But I'll end on a good note. The sequel to this game, which is called Seiken Densetsu III is one of my favorite games. It has great graphics, a good plot, and several problems from the prequel have been fixed. Power-up moves can be used anytime once the specialty bar is full. Your allies are actually intelligent this time around and can be left alone in a fight unless you need a special spell. Fighting is smoother since you don't have to wait for your weapon to charge up. The best thing about the game, though, is its replay value. There are a total of five different character stories you can play. I have played through them all over and over again. I highly suggest this game to everyone since I think it is better than the Legend of Zelda.",3.0
"Trying to convince Sunset Rider fans that the Genesis version is superior is very difficult since the Super NES version is able to replicate the actual arcade version, but the thing is the Genesis version has smoother animations, bigger sprites, better graphics overall and is more fun to play despite being a little bit shorter.  This is a short game overall however.  Less than 30-40 minutes regardless which version you play.  I really think the Genesis pulled off the impossible and actually made a game that surpasses not just the Super NES version, but the arcade one as well.

As for the game itself, well it's a Contra-style shoot 'em up type of game where you scroll forward shooting enemies on screen.  The difference is that Sunset Riders takes place in the Wild West so expect to see all the familiar places you're accustomed to seeing in a western setting such as the towns, horses, cowboys, wild ladies, etc.  I think the Super NES has one REALLY strong aspect going for it however- the music is absolutely *incredible*.  I love singing along to the music.  It takes western/Spanish themes and combines them with upbeat rhythms you can dance to, and the notes themselves are REALLY catchy!  You can play as different characters but I'm unable to see a major difference between them, or if there even are any differences.

The challenge is OUT OF THIS WORLD hard!  You die in one hit!  You can come back again in the same place you died a few more times, but it's not like it matters since you're still always being surrounded by danger around every corner.  It seems like the Genesis version tones down the craziness of bullets flying everywhere and makes the game more manageable, but either way whichever version you pick up you're going to be in for a rough -but fun- time due to the high challenge level that never gets any easier.

In fact by the end of the game it just gets too crazy to even tolerate!  I don't even know if someone can improve their skills with a game like this- it's more like if you're focused enough to dodge several bullets you'll succeed (but even that's questionable given the high challenge) but if say, you happen to have a rough night of sleeping and wake up feeling tired and you're NOT on top of your game?  Forget about it!  Don't even play this game under these conditions, haha!  Just expect a tough game overall.",3.0
"Anyone who has ever played ""Zelda III: A Link to the Past"" on the SNES knows what an excellent action/RPG game is supposed be. Secret of Mana is not quite as good as Zelda III, but it is a lot of fun to play. Personally, I enjoy this game! But I will say right not that this is not a particularly hard game to play, but it is interesting and will keep you entertained.

I do not want to go into much detail about the story, but I will say this much. It is an action/RPG about a teenage boy who accidentally finds a magical, powerful sword embedded in a rock outside of his village. Suprisingly, the sword calls out to him and he ends up removing the sword. Little does he know that by doing that, he destroyed the protective seal around his village and monsters and other baddies move in and cause fear and chaos. When the villagers discover that he is responsible for the attack on their village, they banish the boy from his home, and he is forced to set out into the world to restore the peace and order.

Anyone who has ever played SoM can tell you that its best and most memorable quality by far is its music.  SoM's music composer Hiroki Kikuta displays his extraordinary talent in this game.  Almost every song is beautifully arranged and has an original and interesting composition.  Most people who play SoM has his or her own special favourites, and they are so good that you may even find yourself humming them without even realizing it.  Secret of Mana has one of the best sountracks of any RPG game (or any game for that matter).  Even if the game itself does not satisfy your hunger just listening to its amazing songs will make the playing experience worth while.

Despite the fact that Secret of Mana is over 10 years old, and the graphics are outdated compared to today's polished, beautiful computer generated graphics, it can still hold its own compared to other games made back then. Everything is bright, colourful and detailed (except for the characters who are not as detailed). The most impressive designs are those of the palaces. Each palace is created with such beautiful and intricate detail, that you will forget that the game was made over 10 years ago.

The magic system is pretty simple. You have two magic users in the game, the girl and the sprite. The girl uses magic that has healing or enhancement properties, and the sprite uses destructive/attack magic. Each spell comes from a different elemental creature, and there are 8 elements altogether: Fire, water, earth, air, moon, shade, light and mana. Throughout the game you will meet each elemental creature and he or she will bestow their powers upon you, giving you the ability to use their spells in battle. The more you use a spell the more powerful it becomes. You can track a spell's progress on the Weapon/Magic Level screen in the menu. It will gain levels by decreasing increments (eg. To Level 1 - Increases by 0.1 each use, To Level 2 - Increases by 0.09 each use, to Level 3 - Increases 0.08 each use, etc.) This makes it more difficult to achieve more powerful spells causing you to use spells even when you don't need to in order to reach a higher level. In the end, all the trouble is well worth it when you acheive more powerful spells.

There is not much to the storyline of this game.  And it is certainly not as deep and exciting as Zelda III or other RPG's for that matter.  There is almost no character development here so if you prefer action over story, then this is the game for you.  It is basically a ""go-out-and-save-the-world-and-kill-as-many-monsters-as-you-can"" type of game so there will be a lack of challenge for seasoned pros.  And unfortunately, the dialouge is not too good either.  The three heroes hardly say anything at all, except maybe for the boy who does a bit of talking.  And what they do say is more at a child's level of understanding and entertainment.  Chrono Trigger was made for people of all ages too, but even its dialouge and story were far above that of Secret of Mana in terms of quality, interest and challenge.

A feauture of this game that is unique is that you can play with up to two other people if you have the adapter. That feature alone makes the game a lot more enjoyable. There is a glitch in the game however. If any of the characters are controlled by the computer they will sometimes become stuck behind objects and you may have to restart the game.

Secret of Mana may not be the most difficult RPG to play, especially for seasoned RPGamers, but for anyone who owns it my advice is to hang on to it and treasure it. Don't do what I did and sell it for some money. It may not have much in terms of character-driven stories, or an intricate, sophisticated plot, but it is a great game to play when you get the urge to kick some butt without losing the RPG theme.",3.0
I love the game but when contacting the seller it took awhile for a response. Got the game in the mail and had writing on it with some scratches. Not what it said in discription.,3.0
"Having played this game in the arcade, I went out and got it for my N64. I wasn't very surprised at how the game ran, because I had played it before, but I was a bit disappointed in the graphics. I was using an Expansion Pak and I thought they could still be better. Althought the boats and courses are very interesting, most of your time is spent trying to beat them. The easy levels are far too easy, and then the medium levels get dramatically hard. The hard levels are basically impossible except for New York Disaster. Although I do like all the boats you can get, my personal favorites are Razorback, Rad Hazard, and Tidal Blade. What is also good is that you can adjust the camera angle any way you want to, so once you find the right view for you, you won't be bothered by the game. The courses are well designed with lots of shortcuts, but it gets very annoying trying to beat them. I really like the way the police that chase you in the Far East, The Greek Isles, and Venice Canals all speak in a different language, so it makes them sound funny. There are also major drops like the ones in Lake Powell that are extremely fun to manuver. The point is, the game is fun, but it could have been better.
PS: You will need a Memory Card to save your data.",3.0

"Mega man X3 is an, how can i say it?  an ok game.  It's fun but the part with the chip that you can only put in one of mega man's armor parts is really annoying?  Why can't you upgrade all of mega man's stuff.  Kind of boring but its mega man so its not all that bad.",3.0
"I remember playing this extemely difficult game in the 1990s and it was great for its time (I borrowed it from a friend).  I like the game's concept and objective as well as the superior graphics and nice color scheme (a dramatic opposite from previous Spider-Man titles).  Spider-Man needs to disarm a nuclear bomb that the Kingpin has not only framed Spider-Man for stealing but plans to detonate within twenty-four hours.  With the game's objective and short amount of time to complete it, the player is under extreme pressure of warding off several foes that stand in his way (like Sandman, The Lizard, Hobgoblin, Dr. Octopus, and a obscure creatures like a freaking escaped Gorilla), taking random photos to earn money to buy web-fluid, and defeating Venom at the end of each round before reaching the main boss (adding on to the ultra-hard challenge).  This game doesn't mess around so you have to be focused at all times.  I advise first timers to use the practice level before playing the actual game.  Once I get a new Sega Genesis (my old one stopped working), this will be one of the first games I'll pick up and practice at it until my fingers bleed (unfortunatley, I never got to beat this extremely difficult game).  Its not the best Spider-Man game, but its still a fun game to play so why not pick it up for myself.",3.0
"Honestly I got this game because #1 I am a fan of Spidey, #2 I loved this game as a child. many kids today might not like it because of its' outdated graphics. I will say that this is still a fun game and very challenging!",3.0
"And not much in the way of playability. I liked the feature of taking pictures and selling them the Daily Bugle but there's not much else going on. There are only 6 levels and some of them, like the power station, are REALLY short. I liked this game when I was younger but I was used to more simpler games then. But it doesn't really even push the limited (then wonderful) capabilities of the Genesis. The graphics are very basic and Spider-man doesn't get much of a workout other than some unspectacular swinging around. There's also a very pointless 'go home for a while' feature that has no use whatsoever.

Don't get me wrong, it's miles better than that awful Spiderman/X-Men game but still not too Amazing. Pick it up cheap, finish it then trade it.

Hint: You MUST play the game on Nightmare mode to finish it otherwise you'll only get a couple of levels.",3.0
"This game is fairly entertaining, with each level being different and bosses like the Sandman, Lizard, HobGoblin, Venem, & ultimately the Kingpin.  Swinging around on webs is pretty fun, and you can make a web shield and if your energy is low you can go home and rest for a bit.  The game is timed, so you don't have a certain amount of lives.  Where it went wrong, for me at least, is in the end where you essentially have to disable a bomb by entering different keys when their corresponding color flashes.  It's pretty frustrating when you mess up and the timer starts running faster and then the bomb goes off and you have to start back at the beginning.  If you do disable the bomb, which I have only accomplished 2 or 3 times, then you get your butt kicked by the Kingpin.",3.0
"It's too bad Konami never released an arcade-perfect version of the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game on the SNES. Actually this one isn't a perfect translation either, as it's missing some digitized voices. A playable April wouldn't have hurt either, but at least she doesn't get kidnapped.
Anywho, although the title may be (sic) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time, that's only because there were three TMNT games previously released on the original Nintendo Entertainment System (not counting Tournament Fighters). This is actually the second game released in the arcades.
Now for the actual review. The game takes you through, uh, I dunno, 15-or-so levels of repetitive non-stop action (double entendre? you decide). As usual, you get to choose between Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (sorry, Venus, you weren't here yet). The subtitle, Turtles in Time, comes into play when you almost defeat Shredder and then are hurled back through time to 100,000,000,000,000-or-so B.C., then forward to 15??, 18??, 20??, 2???, then back to 1993 where you fight Shredder for supposedly the last time. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!",3.0
"The game continues the wonderful X formula and adds a few things, but it misses more things than it lands.  The big four poos about the game are:

(1) Most of the  music sounds awful -- so bad that Capcom rearranged the music for their Mega Man X Collection.  (Yeah, even they know it sucks.)  I see a lot of people are praising the music, which I can't understand.  It's all pretty monotonous and often owes what little it has to brainless heavy guitar rhythms (which, by the way, are crappy synth).  I love heavy guitar rhythms in Mega Man games, but these (like I said) are brainless.

(2) There is almost no enemy diversity.  You fight the SAME enemies over and over endlessly -- really boring!

(3) The bosses' behaviors are pretty dopey, often doing the same stupid moves over and over.  Volt Catfish is a fine example.  Perhaps the same could be said of all the X titles, but I was never annoyed by it in the other titles.

(4) The upgraded buster is a burden rather than a killing machine.  Two blasts merge for a spreading shot -- sounds good but it's not ultimately effective.  The two have to connect, which results in a delay.  On top of that the broad spray of the shot just isn't practical.  There are times when it's handy, but most of the time the slowness of the combo can get you in a crunch. I'm torn each time I play, because I DON'T want the upgraded buster, but I can't get the ultimate armor without it...  Sucks.

The game's good, but it should NEVER be considered the best!  The game's old, so this review probably won't make much of a difference, but I'm astounded when I see people praising this game so highly!  I suspect a few of the reviewers are giving it 5 stars based upon childhood sentiment rather than game quality.",3.0

"I was no fan at all of space side view shooter games, but this one caught my interest. You start the game by selecting all of your weapons, then you are sent out on your mission to fly through scores of enemy space fleets, destroying them to collect powerups and at the end of each level destroy bad bosses. The bad part about the game is that when you die you lose all of your powerups, and start from scratch making it very difficult to get more powerups later in the game because of the difficulty. Another huge downfall is that the sixth level is virtually impossible without having super sharp reflexes. Its a classic that might not be for everyone.",3.0
"I got Super Ghosts and Ghouls at the recommendation of a friend and was initially very impressed with this game. The music is near-perfect, the level design is very colorful and well-done, and the enemies look really good. So why give this game a 3-star rating? What could have gone wrong? Two big things. First of all, once your character jumps, you have completely lost control of him until he lands. If you make a wrong jump, tough luck you have to see it through. In a game that involves lots of jumping and jumping over level hazards, this was just a bad idea. Secondly, if you get hit once, you lose your armor and are in your underwear. You get hit again and you're dead. There are no checkpoints in the levels and it's near impossible to get your armor back. These levels just have death written all over them. To top it all off, you're supposed to be Arthur. You know, the Arthur from myth and legend. The one who assembled the Knights of the Round Table. The holder of Excaliber? Why on earth is this guy such a wimp? On the bright side, you can get lots of cool power-ups for both your weapons and armor, but even with upgrades, if you get hit twice, you're dead. Why does this game even have death-traps and lethal stage hazards?? It's like death-insurance! Did they think there wasn't enough stuff in the levels to kill you as it is?!? Don't get me wrong, this game does have some redeeming qualities, but bottom line, this is one of the most ridiculously hard games I've ever played. It causes me more frustration than anything else. If you want to try this game out, go right ahead, but it would probably be easier to fight real ghouls and ghosts than try and play through this game!",3.0
"Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts is impossible.  Nah it's not.  It's possible.  It's possible to beat this game.  I know because I've watched people do it before.  But your patience level needs to be at its absolute highest in order to get *anywhere* in this game.  With a game so tough it's no wonder most people back in the day only played it a couple times, realized how hard it was and put it away for years until they eventually sold it.  I know I would've done the same thing had I not had prior knowledge of this games incredible difficulty.

Not getting through level 1 was a bad enough experience for me, but I already knew what to expect going into the game so I didn't mind the loss.  I didn't take losing personally.  No, not when you're playing a game with a reputation for being extremely hard.  You learn to KNOW better!  Some people just didn't know what they were getting into when they played this for the first time (and probably now with a whole new generation of gamers, you could pull a really dirty trick on them and say ""Hey!  Check out THIS game!  I know you'll love it!"" and see what their reaction is like, lol).  Probably a face-ripping reaction... that being your face.

What makes the game so tough is a combination of 3 things- 1 is the play control.  Growing up with the NES generation I never minded awkward moving and jumping if the surrounding danger was kept to a minimum. Unfortunately the surrounding danger in this game is *constant* with many precious deadly surprises around every corner, and enemies are located in places *just* off-screen and appearing magically when you move over one notch.  Just enough for you to take an unavoidable hit in the cheapest way ever.  Throw in water stages and platform logs you have to ride across, and how about a level that moves up and down while riding a platform all the while avoiding surrounding dangerous enemies and their attacks, and that's the kind of nightmare-ish encounters you can expect in Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts.  The game *wants* you, BEGS you, to take a walk into dangerous territory just so you can take a hit.

The 2nd reason for this games high challenge and for me clearly the biggest reason, is the fact that you can only get once or twice and then you die.  If at least 5 different enemies and attack are occurring all around you giving you little time to react, the generous and actually *right* gameplay method is to allow the player to take at least more than 1 or 2 hits.  Even Castlevania with its amazingly high challenge is courteous enough to allow the player to take at least 3-4 hits.  Imagine if you couldn't even wear protective gear while roaming through the levels of Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts?  Then it simply becomes ""1 hit you're dead"".  At least Contra allows the player to reappear in the same spot after a death.  No, in this game you either have to start back at the beginning of the stage or the nearest checkpoint.  The gameplay is already sluggish enough- it's not worth the aggravation believe me.

And the 3rd reason is one I already mentioned- enemies being cheap.  Too many enemies on screen?  Yes.  Enemies with unpredictable movements with no clear pattern to retaliate?  Oh yeah (those DARN bird creatures have no pattern and you have to deal with more than 1 on screen occasionally!) Oddly the boss fights are relatively easy compared to the regular enemies that often swarm the stages.  Too much commotion taking place to properly focus on enemy elimination is an unforgiveable issue.  I guess the good news is that at least the levels aren't boring.

To Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts credit a massively challenging game does sometimes have its moments of fun... when you're partying with friends and falling down drunk.  Or when a cat is taking its claws and scratching your face to shreds.  Or when you're so cold your feet feel like swollen icicles.  Or when the Dallas Cowboys are winning.  Under these conditions the game is probably fun, but not when you have a nice library of more sensible and enjoyable games sitting just a few feet from where you stand.  Oh and... before I forget!  If you're somehow able to make it to level 7, you HAVE to use the right weapon to eliminate the boss here otherwise the game will actually kick you back to level 1 preventing you from entering level 8.  That's silly, annoying, ridiculous, pathetic and horrible all wrapped in a nice package for grandma.

Otherwise this game has really memorable music, fantastic Super NES graphics/superbly detailed backgrounds, and only a little bit of replay value obviously due to the high challenge level but also the fact that the game is short at just over 40 minutes (if you're an amazing enough gamer to blast through these tough stages that is- for the rest of us Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts takes hours to finish).  I recommend skipping this one.  Contra III: The Alien Wars is the other ridiculously hard Super NES game but at least it's fairer.",3.0
"I remember Sears selling it for $70...highway robbery. It came with a poster, though. I was exposed to CT by Blockbuster. Some guy renamed Magus to Doom. That guy thought he was cool. The first night I owned the game, I played it past my bedtime. I had my dad print off a long guide from work. He even put it in a binder for me. I took it to school and read it whenever I got the chance.

The question is whether this game is a meme.

I don't like JRPGs. They stop you from exercising creativity over the development of your characters. There are few chances for role-playing. This game blindsides you with 2 major decisions. They're impactful parts because the game tells a competent story, and your decisions affect characters whose drama you're invested in.

CT allows you to examine your party's stats, change equipment, decide what accessories to use. ""Tabs"" are a cool idea considering there's a new game plus option, so you can give the main character all the Power Tabs in your first run, then give them to someone else your second time. Accessories are interesting because you never sell them, and they impact how your characters work. There's one that puts a character into an incurable berserk state. You won't be able to use their ""techs"" but they hit harder than before, and their turn comes more frequently.

You end up with a variety of characters to put in a party of 3. Some are magic-intensive, others melee-intensive. Some can heal, some can't. Despite your chances to switch out members, you have no idea what's going on in a dungeon beforehand. You have to go inside and see.

The bosses make sense. None of them are beyond your comprehension within a few tries. Some have special weaknesses, should you experiment. Gimmick is a dirty word, but I wish more bosses were puzzles. The final boss isn't complex, it just hits harder and more HP.

The game's presentation makes it pleasing to go through. Maybe even comfy. It's a neat little story that carries its theme in places you wouldn't expect. Every character has a thing in common. Can you guess?

CT was an accident I'm happy I had. If I had a list of games I played every year, this would be on it.",3.0
"This game was recomended to me by several people and I went to the store the next day to get it.  They didn;t have it so I bought Test Drive Le Mans.  Then I went to ""Best Buy"" and they obviuosly had MSR so I purchased that as well.  So here I was heading home with two new racing titles, anxious to try them out.  MSR paled in comparisson to Test Drive Le Mans.  TDLM is by far and away the best game for DC (Go read my review for it) and sadly, MSR had some smewhat major frustrations.  I will start with the good points:  A lot of people complaimed or praised the music in the game.  I will give a hearty thumbs up.  It varies from country, which I hate, to almost techno/acid jazz european beats.  The only people I think who wouldn;t like the music are Alternative or punk fans.  Secondly, the cars look very real.  Extremly smooth and easy to drive.  The cities are very detailed and the ever-changing environmental effects are gorgeous.
Now the bad:  First of all there is a sysytem of ""Kudos"" used.  In other words when racing, if you do power slides and keep ot real clean then you are given kudos.  They are a lot like money because you need a certain amount to advance in the game.  When you begin a race you also have to decide how many kudo points you would like to gamble.  I think this aspect is not only tremendously confusing, but distracts from the playability.  The tracks are also way too small and there are only three cities to race in.  And again, the whole system of kudos really ruined the game for me.  I am a huge racing game fan so I will definetly keep it and tackle it later, but as we speak Test Drive Le Mans sits in my Dreamcast, as it has since I purchased it, just begging me to play again, again, and again.  If you need a new racer for your DC, buy TDLM.  If you already have TDLM, then this might be a good purchase.  If you don;t have either, make sure you buy TDLM before MSR.",3.0
"This game is pretty cool, but the realism I was looking for was not there. Most of the tracks are dimly lit, so its hard to see where you are going. This game is freeking hard too man! You get penalties for crashing into walls, and you're even penalized for side-swiping other cars to get ahead of them. Why? It's a racing game, the idea it to get ahead. In short, the penalties are deducted from your points, and unless you gain enough points, you cant advance in the game. I purchased this game since Grand Tourismo 3 for PS2 was delayed. If you own a Dreamcast and a PS2 like me, wait for GT3.",3.0
"...even though this is a remake of a game that, at the time, was already seven years old. Even so, Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout was brand new to me until this past week when I first bought it. I had never really been a big DB fan before, even though I had heard of the anime series. Still, the game looked interesting from the screenshots I saw on the back of the case, so I figured, ""Why not?""

Indeed, it was a wise choice on my behalf, for though DBGT: FB uses the traditional 2-D fighting format that started the whole fighting game craze back in the early-to-mid 1990s, it nevertheless puts its own unique twist on that format by allowing every character to throw at least four types of energy projectiles: one standard shot, one multi-shot burst, and two super-powerful beam blasts. I also thought the idea of having a limited amount of projectile energy that could be recharged in mid-battle and each character's ability to fly to a different part of the screen were both pretty innovative. Then again, so was the Build-Up mode, which allows the gamer to take his or her favorite DB character and upgrade his or her fighting style to coincide with the player's own fighting method. The Meteor Combo and Demo Projectile Combat systems were also quite fresh, and the graphics, music, and sound effects--""dated"" as they may be--fit the overall mood of the game very well. Oh, and how can a game go wrong with at least six to seven different modes of play?

Of course, this title does have its flaws. For instance, a much as I like the characters in DB GT: FB (Cell, Piccolo, Freiza, and Mujin Buu are especially appealing to the imagination.), I must say that the creators could have varied their line-up a bit by including other DB characters (e.g., Krillin and Android 18). After all, how many versions of Goku and/or Trunks does one possibly need--especially since such variations are strictly graphical and not audial or technique-oriented? Additionally, the animation can be a bit choppy at times, and the control takes some getting used to at first--most notably when one wishes to retreat from or rush one's adversary; in this particular case, one must press and hold the L1 or R1 button while moving away from or toward the opponent rather than press away or toward twice on the D-Pad. Also, I know Super Baby, the final boss, is several stories tall, but that still doesn't fully justify the lack of a grappling system for battles between the rest of the fighters, even though the Meteor Combo system may serve as a replacement to such a system. Finally, it would be nice to save any and all unlocked fighters to a memory card, as is the case with most fighting games for the PSX. Unfortunately, one must input a secret code at the title screen every time one plays this game to uncover its hidden fighters (It's a good thing that the code's an easy one, too.).

All in all, Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout isn't a bad title at all, even though it could have been better in some respects, I whole-heartedly advise PSX owners who love fighting games to give this one a try, regardless of whether they have ever heard of the Dragon Ball animated series. Chances are they might learn to appreciate it.",3.0

"If Chrono Trigger is widely considered the best turn based RPG ever, I guess there's no argument to say otherwise.  Certainly no argument from me given the limited amount of experience I have with these type of games, but keep in mind I hate turn based RPGs.  I avoided them like the plague during my Super NES obsession 20 years ago.  I think the combat stinks because you have to take hits to actually *deliver* hits during combat (hence the ""turn based"" part of the genre) and the storyline is usually overlong, elaborate and exceptionally grand and elegant in a phony/uninteresting kind of way.  The presentation is the same unbearably pretentious way.  If this were a movie I'd get completely lost or uninterested in a matter of minutes and would shut it off, but for the sake of a video game with a reputation as being the best ever and a can't miss title, I decided to keep going.

Chrono Trigger's storyline is enticing and lures me in during the first half but then other characters get thrown into the story such as Schala, Melchior, Janus and Prophet and it turns extremely confusing in a hurry.  The game should have continued the pace it had in the first half with the robot (really incredible that I actually feel sympathy for a robot in a video game of all places, but the game manages to make me feel bad for him), and even though I hate that a frog is part of the characters since it just seems totally silly to take an amphibian seriously, he's at least sometimes memorable.  Ayla's indiscernible english is a chore to read for the player (added worse by her frequent appearances throughout the quest, ugh).  Marle is confusing in the beginning which probably should have been taken as an indication that this game was going to be difficult to follow from a storyline perspective.  I guess she's a princess?  And she's several other people too?  Who really knows.

Magus is supposed to be the bad guy but then a character named Lavos comes out of nowhere and I get lost.  Right when Glenn and Cyrus appear that's when the confusion escalates and loses me to the point that I was never able to recover.  The truth is, a video game storyline needs to be kept short and simple for me to understand.  Chrono Trigger is the exact opposite of that.  It's cool if you guys like it though.  I won't knock the game and give it a low rating just because I have trouble understanding sophisticated storylines in video games.  This is a fault of mine- not the game.  But perhaps the worst aspect is all the time travelling.  NOW I'm totally lost.  I can't keep track of all the past, present and future events that take place.  Knowing exactly what to do with a mess of timeline portals has to result in me using a FAQ to figure out.

Do they still create turn based RPGs these days?  I can't bother to keep up with video games like I did when I was a kid.  I like the magic spells with the lightning, fireballs, icecube attacks, etc.  These are fun to watch and were really impressive back in the mid 90's.  Anyway a 3-star rating is fair.  This has to be the best turn based RPG I've ever played given it's only the second one I've ever played (Super Mario RPG being the other).  Take that for what it's worth.",3.0
"Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout for the PlayStation (before Dragon Ball Z: Boudaki for PS2) is quite enjoyable.  There's 18 Characters all together.  The characters that you can play with at first is:
*these characters are based on the DBGT TV show*
1. Little Goku
2. Pan
3. Trunks
4. (Adult) Goku
*these characters are based on the Dragon Ball Z TV show*
5. Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta (you can tell that Vegeta is at this level when you play the game with him)
6. Gohan
7. Cell
8. Majin Buu
9. Frieza
10. Piccolo
You go through the game fighting various characters (ex: Little S.S. Goku, S.S. Vegetto, etc.)  And when you defeat these characters that wasn't on the select screen at first, you'll be able to use them afterwards (without the code).  All the characters that you (should) come across are:
11. Super Saiyan Trunks (DBZ)
12. (Little) Super Saiyan Goku (DBGT)
13. Super Saiyan Vegetto (DBZ)
14. Super Saiyan Trunks (DBGT)
15. Super Saiyan Goku (DBZ)
16. Super Saiyan Goku (DBGT)
Once you defeat enough characters, you'll fight the biggest character and the first boss of the game: Super Baby (for the people who don't know about much DBGT, try to go around on the 'net and find out about the first boss of the Dragon Ball Grand Tour TV show, Baby).  If you can get past him without losing hardly any energy, you can play the true final boss of the game - Super Saiyan 4 Goku (18th character in the game, and the 17th playable character of the game).  When I first played this game back in 1998, I didn't know NOTHING about a Dragon Ball or what the concept of this game was even based on; but because of this game, I learned all I could about the world of Dragon Ball and found it to be quite interesting.
The graphics were nice (back in the day before PS2), and once you play it enough times you get used to the movements of the characters and the backgrounds created for this game.  For today's standards, I recommend this game for a younger fan of Dragon Ball before playing Dragon Ball Z: Boudaki for PS2.  For the older fans who like to collect Dragon Ball memorabilia, I say get this for your collection.  In all honesty, that was the true reason I got this game, since this is quite a rare game in the United States and could be worth quite a lot to certain people.  I rate it 3 stars (basically for not beyond fun, and not beyond boring - just in the middle).",3.0

"Crunching an over-the-top arcade rocket-boat simulator onto a PSX disc can't be easy -- look how badly ""San Francisco Rush"" missed the mark -- so it's a pleasant surprise to find Hydro Thunder so true to the  arcade original.
Tweaking the arcade game slightly to squeeze out some  more replay value, you begin the game with your choice of three easy boats  and three easy tracks.  Finishing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (in a field of 16) on  these tracks opens up the medium set, where you need to be second or better  to move onto the hard tracks.
The graphics are a wildly mixed bag -- some  races have patches of incomprehensible blur and pixelation (most notably  the first portion of the ""Arctic Circle"" track), while at times  you'll be stunned by surprisingly good reflection and other water  effects.
The developers also did a great job of keeping in all the  ""look ma!"" cutesies of the arcade game, such as police boats and  tour guides chasing you down the river (sample audio: ""the tracks in  Hydro Thunder were constructed from thousands of tiny triangles...  oooh!"")
The knock against this game is the agonizing difficulty  level.  You won't win a race without finding significant shortcuts and  getting most, if not all, of the ""boosts"", which often require a  special ""hydro jump"" technique to blast out of the water and into  the air.  I'm all for getting more than five hours of playability out of a  disc, but in HT, it seems you have to run the same track 30 or more times  to get the perfect run that places you high enough to move on.  It's  grueling, and when all's said and done, I think the shortcut-crazed  novelty-racer might do better to play ""Sled Storm"" instead.
But  if you absolutely loved the arcade game, the PSX version is a worthy  adaptation.",3.0

"Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released for the SNES in 1994, is the sequel to SF II Turbo: Hyper Fighting. After the success of the previous SF2 games, Capcom wasn't about to release Street Fighter III yet. Instead it tweaked the cast of the previous games a bit, gave them a variety of new coloured outfits and introduced four new fighters: Cammy (a British intelligence officer), T. Hawk (a massive red Indian), Fei Long (a Bruce Lee look and act-alike, probably the answer to Mortal Kombat's Liu Kang...) and Dee Jay (a crazy jamaican full-contact fighter). Considering all this, the game has to be even better than SF2 Turbo, right? That's not quite the case though...
I understand that the arcade game changed the way it sounds from its predecessors by using new ""Q sound"" technology. Probably due to this, the sound effects and music quality in the SNES conversion is quite poor. I never realised that audio actually plays an important part in fighting games till I played this...especially since I played SF2 Turbo before. The energetic, deep voice of the announcer of Turbo is gone. It is replaced by a boring and clumsy-sounding voice. It is great that the characters sound different from each other this time around, but some character voices are pretty lame, especially the K.O. sounds made by M.Bison (Vega in Japan) and Guile. And don't even get me started on the ""Sonic Boom"" voice of Guile or the ""Tiger Uppercut"" voice of Sagat or the ""Hadoken"" voice of Ken. Very lame, indeed. The background music is okay, but lacks the quality of Turbo by a wide margin.
Then to the graphics. Again, must be the fact that the ""Ryu Intro"" took up too much memory. The visuals are dull and are almost Sega Genesis quality. However the new backgrounds are pretty decent to look at. Moving onto the gameplay. The ability to play in turbo speed is gone. It's back to three-star speed again. Playing it in anything less than that is a horrible experience. The original cast have their moves either improved or weakened or new moves gained. For example, Ken has gained a flaming dragon punch, whereas Ryu's hurricane kick is severely weakened. Guile has lost the ability to connect twice with his flash kick, as has Sagat with his close-up fierce kick. Among the new characters, Fei Long and Cammy are interesting, Dee Jay is awkward but powerful and T. Hawk is a clumsy, Zangief-ish wrestler with some style. To freshen things up there are various modes in the game, including super battle, versus battle, group battle, tournament and time challenge, plus new endings for some of the original cast.
Overall it seems Super SF2 is quite a solid game which will satisfy Street Fighter fans without a doubt, and is more enjoyable than many of the other SNES fighting games, but lacks the long-lasting appeal of its predecessors due to the average visual and audio quality.",3.0
The controller works fine and its original. My complaint is how dirty it was. I literally  spent a hour cleaning all the grime and dead skin off and out of the controller (had to open it).

When i first try it it didn't work but i tried it again in the next few hours then it started working. But when i tried the next day it didn't work again from there i thought i'll try it again later.

"Plain and simple. This controller is not made by Nintendo. It was merely approved by Nintendo considering the seal is on the box.

These controllers were made in China. The buttons are the wrong size, the cord is 1/2 the length it's supposed to be, the sticker around the buttons are tan instead of gray, the front logo is wrong, and the buttons don't feel right. All traditional Super Nintendo controllers are made Nintendo in Japan, not China.

I will say just stick with getting an interACT controller with the multicolored buttons similar to a Super Famicom controller. If you have played Donkey Kong Country 3 and go into the banana bird caves, look at the crystal colors. That is what the multicolored controller should look like. I only had to replace my controller because UP was giving me some problems by having most games zig zag instead of going straight.

Unfortunately, since Nintendo no longer makes Super Nintendo controllers, you are stuck with these crappy ones. But, at least these are somewhat usable unlike some that I have tried.",3.0
The pricing is good on this item until you add in shipping and once you get the controller you find out that the cable is a little over half the length of the original SNES controller.

"Careful. Even though it shows the official 2nd generation controller from Nintendo what you get can be closely described as a cheap knockoff. Not even good for replacement parts what you get is a controller with thin plastic hinges on the shoulder buttons, a feel of thin and light plastic and a casing that is quite obviously cast from the original. The main body, if you have access to a websafe color picker, is a color close to the color D4CBD4. The decal around the BAYX buttons is CDD6B4. All the buttons are plastic instead of the Start and Select buttons being rubber like the original. The cord is short. Too short. About 4.5 feet (54"", 137.16cm). Buttons feel clicky but solid. Taking apart the controller you are presented with a generic and obviously unpolished PCB. Wires from the cord are directly soldered to the board instead of plugged in by way of a micro-connector like in the original. Plastic tags (the things that are usually the result of poor plastic casting) are everywhere on seams.

But for only a pittance, I don't offer my criticism with any weight. You get what you pay for and in this case it's not very much. It works for what it's intended to do, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a significant amount of defective products.

My advice would be to keep searching the second hand shops and horde and preserve the working controllers. I have a couple that need new R buttons as years of use have broken the sturdy plastic hinges. Hinges that have metal pegs in the originals. The Nintendo logo is wrong (a good sign it's not an original). However, if this is your only recourse, you could do worse. This is basically a replica. And a good one at that.

[UPDATE: I've been informed that what I got quite possibly is an original controller with just a replacement YXBA decal. Even though I think the seller said up front it was a replica.]",3.0
"Back in the day, I use to play this game a lot.  and I mean a LOT!  In it's time, it had great graphics, great options, and was the type of wrestling game you could really let your mind run wild with, which is what I look for in wrestling games.  Every year, 1 wrestling game catches my eye and I'll play it all year till the next great game comes out.  When RAW came out for the Super NES, it is the game I played all that year.
For the above reason alone, I would have given this game 5 stars.  However, I took off 2 stars for Amazon's price.  (...) $25 would be expensive for a game that old.  Heck, even the NEW WWF RAW for X-Box is [less].  So, I would shop around before buying this game here.",3.0
"I bought a Super Nintendo especially just for this game when it came out back in around 1993. It was the coolest game at the arcades at the time and just about every young boy to teenagers wanted a home port of this game. Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat changed video game fighting games forever, introducing standards for special moves, combinations, graphics and even the way it sounds overall. In it's day, this game and Mortal Kombat 1 where the #1 games on any boys xmas list.

It did soon change as Street Fighter II champion Edition, Hyper Edition came to the arcades. So Sega consoles got champion edition, and it revved up the whole Nintendo vs Sega debates, but then Snes got Turbo edition, which was both Champion Edition and Hyper edition in one. No one really played Champion edition, they stuck to hyper, especially with a cheat to enter the Capcom Code and play it at 10 star speeds. Pretty much like what happened to this game, it was good in it's day, but fell victim to upgrades. If it's not for collectors purposes I can't see what anyone would buy this original version over it's later updates... unless it's to see just a couple of moves that where not transported over the next versions... which is mostly just a few light moves on some chars that you never used, and a couple of Zangief's holds that you never even noticed where taken out of champion edition and so forth.

I really got out of the whole Street Fighter thing around the time of Super SFII Turbo. I have had very little interest in the Anime styles it's gone towards since in Alpha versions. Plus I cant keep up with them, there must be a million different versions of SF games by now. But, this is where it all started. And this is the true SF game that is responsible for all those clones of this game. But nothing compares to SSFII. It has since breathed new life again on the Game-boy advance. I cant remember what it's called, but it's pretty much the same with some new extras included, and Akuma. But Super SFII was a remake and redesign of this game, so if you want original looking graphics, or to see what it was like when it all began, then check this game out.
It was the Snes versions that dominated the market in SFII sales for home consoles. Pretty much all due to Sega's crappy controller layouts.

I have not played it yet, but there is a game on PS2 called Hyper Street Fighter II Anniversary Edition or something like that. Apparently you can choose between original, champion, and Super Street Fighter II games... a couple of reviews say the coding isn't quite right, but I hope to bring you a review about that game soon.",3.0

"Got what I expected, works but not exactly the best way. The random game was super lame and the AC adapter works but it isn't Nintendo branded. Meh.",3.0
"Works fine, wires are much thinner than original wires. Cheaply made but it does work.",3.0
"The snes is a great system to have but the controller that it came with was broken and when I asked to be shipped out a new one I got a 3rd party controller that looked like soda has been spilled all over it FANTASTIC!
Other than that the Super Nintendo came In amazing shape and was still white and not yellow!",3.0
cause it wasn't in the condition I thought it would be 4 the price I paid. it had a very big hole on the side of the game. I should of receive a more better condition game 4 the price and shipping cost.,3.0
Received Super Nintendo but missing the cable that allows it to power on.  So not even sure if the merchandise works yet.  Thanks for your time.,3.0
Works like it's said but the wiring just off the game system end was somewhat frayed on arrival. We'll see if the cable lasts.,3.0
It came about a week after the expected date. The game and system works good but one of the controllers do not work. All together it's okay.,3.0
"While I did receive the product it was posted used in good condition. My definition of good must differ from the sellers, because the console arrived dirty as if packaged straight from someones garage. This left me with doubts as to if the console had been infact tested. How the product could be labeled as good with the possiblity of being untested leaves me mildly disappointed. On a positive note the console did come with original ac adapter.",3.0
"Great product. Came with the console and two controllers. No AV jacks or power cables so I had to go buy them separately, but the system itself plays very well. No problems here.",3.0
"The cord is a genius idea, now someone just needs to improve the technology.  The only flaw I saw was my SNES graphics went down considerably, which was a true bummer.",3.0
i gave it a 3 star cuz its not an original item it works good the the plastic is cheap plastic but if you want it to just play and not colect its a good item,3.0
"When I got it it would not stay on, bought a new AC Adapter works better now lines in the games but I think its my big TV. IT WAS Very fast shipping!",3.0
"Shipping was fast, no complaints there. The SNES has some difficulty getting games to play. It's like the original NES where you have to eject the games and try multiple times to get them to work. Not a huge deal, but I've never seen that in an SNES before. Age is age. There is some discoloration on the bottom half and one controller which is fine, but it leads me to believe that it's a cannibalized system. Again, no big deal. I'm happy with the purchase, just not overjoyed.",3.0
Cable is not Nintendo brand but it works. I have used this for a year now and the gray connector part is now detached from the wire. Not sure how much longer it will last.,3.0
I also buy This For Cousin  He Had to Replace Gamecube  Av Cable used it  everyday an enjoyed uesd it,3.0
"The system was as described. it was in good condition and working well. The  games was excited but the problem is that the adapter is not working well because of the vollt difference.
Thank you",3.0
When I got the cables I plugged them directly into the back of my DLP television. I tried a couple different SNES games and they all had a screen shaking/glitching problem which hurt my eyes. Eventually I plugged them into the back of my surround sound receiver and this got rid of the screen shaking issue. So far so good but I can only give them a 3 star rating.,3.0
"There is a ""glitch"" in the game at level 3, part 2. The grass, water, and rocks do not appear. And the level seem shorter then it orignally did when I played it years ago on my ""lost"" game. The seller did not mention this in his write-up",3.0
It worked for three days and then it just died. It was made in the 80's so I guess I can't be too upset. BUT I was hoping to get a little more play out of it since I did pay like 20 bucks for it. Ehh live and learn..,3.0
"I received my Super Nintendo in about a week and a half. It turned on but on the screen it only showed a black screen with 2 horizontal white lines and a small buzzing sound. I messed with it for about 2 days and finally one night it came on and worked for the rest of the night. It worked the next day for about 4 hours and then since then it has not worked again. It shows the black screen with lines. I have cleaned it multiple times and tried different cables in the back and have tried just about everything but still get the same screen. It's been about 2 or 3 weeks now and still does that.
I'm not sure if the game system is just busted, or if it's a small problem I can fix that's right in front of me.
I've tried cleaning it, blowing into it, every game I have.
Nothing works.

"This is same type of AV cable that came bundled with the SNES, N64, and Nintendo Gamecube. The build quality is of course the best you'll probably find if it's an official Nintendo product, however I would highly recommend buying the S-Video version of this cable. Even if you can only find 3rd party cables, you won't regret purchasing one, as the video signal will drastically increase compared to composite. Two leads on the S-Video cable carry analog color and contrast information to your display, while composite video does this on one lead. The result is a much sharper image (just look on youtube for comparisons. S-Video has very little pixel bleeding, while composite video blends the colors together, producing a very poor image).",3.0
"its a cheap knock off of the nintendo brand but it does what you want it too, picture is Not what it is scam.",3.0
"I specifically ordered this item from this seller because the listing title gave the impression it was a ""Nintendo"" brand original cable, It was not. Does the cable work? Yes. Is this cable poor quality? No, but it's not as good as the original. Then what are you complaining about? The principle. If I wanted an off brand av cable, I could have bought one from Ebay for a dollar. The listing should be properly titled. I want what I ordered, and at the three dollars I paid for this it's not even worth my time returning.",3.0
"I have been using this cable to play my old Nintendo 64 games for about 4 months now.  It works just fine, although I have noticed that the wires are a bit loose and the cable itself could be longer.  But it's a good product overall, and sold at a reasonable price.",3.0
"The product came when expected. The product was in good condition, it was lose from the end that connects to the snes. The wires are visible but works perfect.",3.0
"I bought a console (labelled Like New) for Christmas. I also bought this cable in case the previous one didn't work. The console doesn't work, and I'm pretty sure it's the console that's the problem, not the cable. Ah, well.",3.0
"I must confess that I do not actually have the game system because it was a gift for my older sister. However, I asked her to let me know how it was so I could write a review. She told me that you could tell it was used because of a crack and that it was really dirty! But it still works, which is the most important part.",3.0
Good,3.0
"TLDR: This is an upgraded version of Street Fighter II, faster gameplay, no lagging, 4 extra characters.

This is the third of four street fighter games on the SNES. The only reason I got it was because I have the other three. As a complete game I would say it is my third favorite, but this is a personal preference. I have seen a lot of people say that this was their favorite of the four. Although the graphics are pretty much the same as Street Fighter II for the SNES, The gameplay is exceedingly better than the original. Mainly because it is faster, and more responsive, not to mention the addition of 4 extra characters not found in the original. So if you want to only buy one street fighter cartridge for the super nintendo, and you want the full experience of how Street Fighter II was intended to be played, this is your game. The only reason I like Super street fighter, and Super street fighter alpha 2 better is they offer more characters. But both of those games are very different to Street Fighter II in every way, the move sets are different, the graphics are different, the game plays at a different speed.",3.0
"I waited two and a half weeks to get my order, And, It barely works, you have to turn it on and off a few times for it to come on, but then it freezes. Faster shipping would have been better.. Horrible.",3.0

"Pilotwings was one of the first releases for the Super NES, so you can't expect much from the 3-Dish graphics.
But this game is so much fun!!!! It takes alot of skill to land vehicles, and I think the hardest level(s) is the skydiving one.
Occaisionally you'll mess up, and it's entertaining!!! If you do not open your parachute on cue in the skydiving levels, you crash through the ground. Or if you don't set the guy with the jetpack down slowly an explosion occurs. Land on the white bumps and you go ""boing""
I agree, the music is so funny to listen to, especially on the jetpack level, where you here the ""famous"" horrible singer.
It took me forever to make it to the first helicopter level, because on the 4th series of levels.... well it's almost impossible to beat.
Landing the airplane is also hard, mess one thing up you end up crashing.
I'm going to keep this game because it's sooooooooooooooooo funny!!",3.0
"It was an alright game. I bought to play with my son, but it was too hard for him and he wasn't very interested.",3.0
Great game reminds .mw of childhood,3.0
"I used to have Gran Tourismo for the Playstation 1 and I'm pretty sure that the graphics were way better than Road Rash Jailbreak. Playing this game is constant eye-strain, because the graphics are so blocky and smudgy. The crash intelligence is seemingly random. Sometimes when you intentionally get close but not too close to an object, you crash anyway. Other times you're sure that you've hit it, but the game seems to arbitrarily decide that you haven't and does wierd things to let you off without a crash. I hit a tree at triple digits and seemed to bounce backward 100 yards and landed perfectly intact, right-side-up in front of another tree, then as soon as I hit the throttle and hit the tree, I go flying off my bike and skid down the road 50 miles. It just don't make no sense half the time.",3.0
"I remember playing this way back when it came out, but just barely. I do remember it was fun though. Then years later, I decided to play it again for nostalgic reasons. It was ok, but just like with a lot of other ps1 games, the graphics are a little too pixelated. Also it's hard to move on to the next levels. It was a great experience to play an old ps1 game, but I wouldn't pick this one to re-visit.",3.0
This game is tooo easy and short I beat it in 5 minutes simutultaneosly . If your a final Fantasy Fan get this game but if your not Rent it becuase Its toooooo easy and the extras are well.... lets just say not very complicated and theres an RPG its ok but RENT IT INSTAED!!,3.0
This game was for it's time very enjoyable. Presently it was alright it's story mode in my opinion is so boring I could only put in 30mins in it before going to the fighting mode. the Fighting mode will give you 2hrs max of enjoyment for most of the characters are very similar except for a couple moves. Get this game but don't expect to much.,3.0

"R.P.G.+Survival Horror = parasite eve, this game has the most amazing concept I have ever heard of. It's a shame that it's flaws hold it back from being so much more than it is. First of all running (if you can even call it that) around this g game is a pain i swear to god you go so slow It's ridiculous. I really hated the random encounters in the game at first they were fun then it just pissed me the hell off. The story is very engaging and very exciting. The music is agrevating as hell at the fast travel OH MY GOD IT'S SO ANNOYING! Overall I would say it's great for the price i got it dor on psn $6.99$",3.0
I remember this game being much more fun when I played it thirteen years ago on the PlayStation. The beginning is still sort of fun but the graphics are extremely terrible compared to the extremely amazing graphics of today so she more or less looks like a white blob with a black smudge on it although the lighting was so terrible that she always appeared to be in the dark and it was a wonder that I could see her at all. Still a great buy for reminisce sake.,3.0

this game was fun to play. it was for my boyfriend's birthday and he was shocked i had found it. thanks,3.0
"This could have been a great game.  The hand drawn scenes are really unique and a pleasure after the polygon hash of many games.  Sadly, the story is a bit bland, as with many recent RPGs. The non-linear story gets a little annoying after a bit and did not really get me to ""role play"" and feel any great excitment or interest towards the characters.  But relative too much of the trash in my favorite genre, this isn't horrid.  Give it a try if you've played Dragoon and Chrono Cross already",3.0
"Nothing  much  ,but  I expected  more  from  squaresoft. It  is  a  really  boring  game  thats  all.",3.0
"Don't get me wrong this game is great. But I think Squaresoft should have spent a little more time on certain elements of the game. But first I will tell you about the good points of the game. The graphics are the best I have ever seen. The story line is great. And the battle system is very well invented. Now the bad points. The music [is not good], the length of the game is ridiculous, and the last boss is two easy. But if you are a person that is just starting out in the RPG genre, then this is the game for you.....",3.0
"Before you fanatics about this game send me hate mail like you might for all those who give this game lower than three stars, hear me out.
I found many downers in this game, but to soften the blow, I will elaborate on the plusses first.
Okay, you want the ultimate drawing board idea for a battle sequence?  Well, here you go; the whole blueprint for the interface is brilliant.  Also, I will agree that all those that say the plot is either lacking or just plain awful are wrong!  I thought that the plot was exellent, esspecailly considering the size of the game.  I also liked the movie like music, and the graphics, esspecially the cinemas, are superb.
However, I think that the gameplay was butchered, even worse than that of Shadow Madness.  Also, the navigation is hard with the background camera angles, the walking and running are slow, and the bosses are too hard unless you've mastered the ability of the tool (I have not).  Lastly, I will also state that after liking the music, I got the soundtrack, and found it to be hightly lacking in overall originality in composistion.  While highly movie like, it had almost no purely listening only qualities.
Let's just finish off by saying that this game should have become one of the movies that Square Pictures is going to make (after the FF movie), but as a game on top of the extrordinatry cinematic aspects, I found it missing some.",3.0
"It wasn't as detailed it being perminant marker, the name being written on it",3.0
"Starfox is an mediocre space shooter. It is not bad or anything, but it has become rather dated. The graphics were a revolution for the Super NES, as Starfox was one of the first 3D games and the first to use the Super FX chip, which boosted the processor of the Super NES and somehow upgraded the graphics to what looks like (although I am not certain) 32-bit. But in the middle of 2012 with the brand new HD Wii-u launching and jawdropping Playstation games coming out, the graphics are pretty poor. Not that I expected a game from 1993 to look good, I am just pointing that out. The actual gameplay is to pilot the Arwing around and shoot everything in your path. It is, by far, epic, but that is about all there is to the game. The plot is shallow and the game is rather short. So overall, even with epic music and shooting, Starfox did not live up to what I thought it would be. It is a rather interesting piece to my Super NES collection because of the FX chip and 3D visuals, but the actual game is kind of weak.",3.0
"This is the first star fox game and its not like the others. It was fun back then but now its bad. The graphics r horrible even for the snes, the sound is messed up, it does not have a good story, its VERY HARD, and the controls r hard to use. Yes its the one of the first game on the snes but its not very good. Its still kind of fun to play when u have nothing else to do.",3.0
"I got this game thinking it would be the coolest, and it turned out to be alright, but not suberb. The game itself is fun, graphics(which I make a big deal out of) were like the beginning of ""3-D"", since it does have polygon graphics.. The ground is not detailed, just green with wierd dots on it. In space though, you have the choice to be in your cocpit or viewing the backside of the ship. Your buddies, Toad, Falcon, and Rabbit say the same things over and over again.
Overall this game is pretty exciting, but you may wanna think it over.",3.0
"Can spend hours playing! Graphics are pixilated due to being ps1 graphics, however after a few minutes you adjust. Need ps1 memory card even if you are using ps2 counsel.",3.0
"SIMCITY 2000 was the 2nd game release in the Sim series of games.  My roommate had a version of the game when we were in college that he played endlessly.  For students raised on the unbelievable graphics and intricate gameplay of video games that are now available, SIMCITY 2000 will probably seem boring.  However, the game can be quite fun to play and can even be educational (due to the problem solving nature of certain aspects of the game).

In the game, you can either choose to build and run a city from scratch or choose one of the preplanned cities based upon cities in the real world, called scenarios, and choose to run one of those.  There really is no end to the game because you can keep building or destroying the cities as long as you want to. However, if you build enough Launch Arcologies and enough time has passed, an ""exodus"" will begin to occur and the Launch Arcologies will actually launch into outerspace, taking all their citizens with them, but leaving behind lots of money in the treasury. Well, at least that's what I'm told, I built my city from scratch starting in 1900 and had about 300 Launch Arcologies by the year 5000 and I still didn't see one launch.

Overall, SIMCITY 2000 might seem tame by many gamers raised on Xbox 360s and Playstation 3s.  However, if you enjoy have patience; enjoy trying to creating a world from scratch, but don't want to deal with too many minute details; and don't mind an old-school type video game, you might enjoy creating a city and trying to make it succeed in SIMCITY 2000.",3.0
"I understand why most people gave this game a good review, it deserves it, but perhaps the wrong words were used to make this game sound great. I think you should buy it if you own an N64 knowing this first.

First off where way beyond that generation of video games so no graphic delights.

Secondly althought the gameplay and optional strategy take makes for many ways to complete each level, the game is short. 12 missions in 1-3 days depending on how much you play (thats on level Hard)

Thirdly there are alot of other games that you should consider first, like Turok 2 or Golden Eye, (which Rainbow Six does rank lower than)

Fourthly the replay value is not as bad as others would say but its nothing you'll find yourself wanting to redo over and over again. Turok 2 is one of those games.

But don't be shy of this game, one hit kills (for you that is) makes this a realistic game in most parts. If you have an N64 and don't want to spend 50 dollars on the new and hot games, try this one out it is worth the shot.",3.0

The game has stuff rattling around inside it and the chip sticking out of the game is very worn down. Not to happy with it because the description said like new and it doesn't look or sound like new when I received it.,3.0
"Ok, so the graphics look like they were made with crayons, and the a.i. is pretty bland and has really bad aim. That's the only problems I have with this game. I'm not saying it's spectacular, but it's definitely not the worst game ever.

Lots of people griping about the controls. I only have one problem with them--the look-around is somewhat sluggish and seems to move on a wide grid rather than a completely free range. So if you're looking over the terrorist's right shoulder, it might take a bit of adjusting to center on him. It's not TOO bad though, because you can usually adjust before the guy shoots you since the a.i. has bad aim. So the flaws even themselves out in this case.

Rescue hostages, disarm bombs. There's not much variety to your objectives, but the locales change a lot. The graphics may be bad, but you still get a feel for the different places you go to, and that's pretty fun.

If you're looking for a game with a storyline, this one isnt' for you. It's just a string of missions, really. The entire storyline is this: ""A top secret counterterrorist squad codenamed Rainbow thwarts terrorist attacks around the globe."" And there's nothing else to it.

It's not a great game, but if you're looking for something cheap to kill some time with, this could be the thing for you.

If you're looking for amazing a.i. and decent or good graphics, though, this is definitely not for you.",3.0
"I have never played any of the Rainbow Six games before, I've never read any of the books with that title.  I picked this game up at an exchange place. I traded 2 other PS1 games I never played for it.  It sounds interesting, playing counterterrorism experts, going in and taking out the bad guys, doing all sorts of missions...plus, it's a really nice look at the various ways they do missions, work together as a team, and you get to check out all the different weapons they use.
That's all fine and dandy, but the gameplay is too difficult.  The game uses all the buttons, PLUS the buttons on the analog controllers too.  It's very awkward overall.  To run, you have to hold in the left controls while pushing forward or backward or whatever.  To aim the gun, you have to use your right hand for both aiming and shooting (I usually throw my left thumb on the control to aim, because doing it with your right feels so odd, and it's nearly impossible to land on anyone.)  Easy mode comes into play here, because I think it aims for you a bit.  Either way, aiming is too hard to make it a great game.  Even walking is a challenge sometimes, because you have so many different controls and buttons you have to use.
The missions I have played so far are fairly easy in the lowest setting (easy mode), and you get all 3 guys to play with, but like other reviews have mentioned, the buildings are boring.  There is barely any furniture in any of them, and they all look fairly the same.
On the issue of the interaction with others in the game...it's rather odd.  The ambassador in the first mission is standing in the middle of a room, but the terrorists couldn't find him?  Also, the terrorists are very bad aims (again, in easy mode)...they'll take 10 shots before they even hit you, and it might take you ten shots just to aim the controls without going past them and actually take them down.  Maybe I haven't had enough experience with the controls and it gets easier, but I doubt it gets easy enough where it feels normal.
Not bashing the game, because so far, I like it. It's enjoyable, and it's nice that you can select a difficulty level, and it's an interesting concept overall.  With better controls and more depth and work done on each environment, this game could have been a lot better.  I like it enough tho, and I'll keep playing till I beat it or get tired of it.",3.0

"On pc quake 2 is one of id's software's greatest creations, with great level design and solid gameplay, the n64 version of this game is different from the pc and playstation versions. The pc version is easily the best, the playstation version has similar levels that had been modified to run better on the playstation, missing secrets some areas cut out (still a very good game, just not as interesting if you already played it in windows) N64 version has levels that were created specifically created for the console making the game feel more like an expansion to quake2 than quake2 itself. has splitscreen deathmatch no coop no botmatch. quake2 would be the best console version to play if you already beat the windows version.

"Better than TR2 for sure. It has some brain taxing levels filled with puzzles, secrets and some enemies. I'm glad to see they have cut back on the enemies and focused on the puzzles and scenery. They have definatly picked some good locations for the game, with brilliant details that are authentic in style. Unfortunatly that is where the authenticity ends.
  The level makers should have done some research on these locations and made them more like they are in real life. OK, I know it's an adventure game that is meant to be fantasy, but I do feel they could have checked things out first.
  Examples; India dosn't have pyrannas(Brazil does), the Ganges dosn't end in a pond, St. Pauls Cathedral looks nothing like that(that must be the worst rendition of it yet), the British Museum is not next to the Lloyds building, and Area 51 is more spacious than that(I saw it on a TV programme, I swear). I won't judge the Pacific levels though, I don't know enough about them. They realy do need to watch their locations more.
Enjoyable game though.",4.0
"Yes, I did find this a bit cumbersome. I wanted a more puzzle oridented game. I kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walk-through forum to make progress. One of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level, if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance. Lara is a great character. But in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossible-to-discover secrets to make the game truly enjoyable.",4.0
"When I got this game, I was amazed at the graphics value.  The FMV sequences are really good, and the high-resolution movies involve speech and lip movement, a step up from TR2.  The weapons are great, the sound is great, the AI is great, and the bosses are hard.  However, I panicked after a while and purchased the Game Informer TR3 Strategy Guide.  It is a great book.  It helped me through those tough spots.  I recommend this to all die-hard Tomb Raider fans.  I can't wait to get The Last Revelation.",4.0

"EIDOS Interactive's latest installment in the much-vaunted Tombraider series sprawls itself across the screen in bold strokes. The Vengeful Animated Avatar of Adventure, Lara Croft, even more improbably rendered  than before, is once again pitted against the forces of interstellar chaos,  vying for possession of (you guessed it) mystic relics of arcane power that  lie hidden at the four corners of the globe. Forced to repeatedly save the  known universe dressed in skin tight clothing (Sisyphus at least gets to  wear a robe), she's understandably angry and uncomfortable, well, downright  ornery, and there's nothing she won't drive, swim, leap, or gun down in  order to get it all over with.  Astonishingly vivid graphics employ  chiaroscuro-like refinements in lighting and shadow, bringing the  two-dimensional rendering to life with subtle shifts of the effect that  correspond to every movement. Aural verisimilitude--jungle noises, bird  calls, water sounds-- is augmented by an ethereal score that floats  enchantingly in and out of awareness. New abilities, such as crawling and  speed dash, are welcome additions, and indeed prove vital when faced with  the yeoman's work tirelessly undertaken by Ms. Croft.  Patience, if not  already an attribute strong in the gamer, will be learned swiftly when  delving into the challenging game play. The decision to change the nature  in which one is able to save one's progress (a rare and blessed event)  means an almost Zen-like tolerance for repetition of tiny muscle movements  is required. At times it feels as if a small demonstration of the sturdy,  impact-resistant controller is in order after the fifteenth time a  twisting-reverse-back-flip-grab-hang attempt ends in gruesome immolation.  Thankfully, the gifted people at EIDOS have crafted an environment that  is richly rewarding in its discovery, replete with soft rainfall and  rushing torrents, dizzying dives and panoramic vistas, and occasional  heart-pounding combat sequences, all urging the gamer ever onward.  Tomb  Raider 3 is ideally suited for those who have completed its precursors in  the series, as neophytes will likely become frustrated within an hour given  the immediate high-difficulty level. Allowing this game to entertain one  for months seems to be the most satisfying way to play, flailing in short  sorties, carefully observing every angle and exploring everything from  treetop to snakepit. Or just go buy the ""strategy guide"" and RUIN  EVERYTHING.",4.0
"When I initially got the game, it did not work and my N64 turned on and the screen remained blank. After about 5 minutes of worrying, the seller was quick to respond to my email and gave me some advice on how to clean my Super Mario cartridge, which I had not thought to do. Less than 5 minutes after that, I am running around the castle and enjoying my adventure on a classic piece of video game history. WORTH. IT.",4.0
"I really enjoy this game because it allows you to freely venture about the castle and enter several different worlds. In these worlds, you complete a checklist of tasks to collect stars and these stars are used to access new worlds. However, the controls for this game are very frustrating, as Mario tends to not like to come to a complete stop after you release the control stick....this often results in many untimely deaths as you fall off of platforms and cliffs. The game's soundtrack is a bit limited, but nonetheless suits the game very well, and I myself don't mind at all if the music for one world is the same as another. The graphics are not perfect, as you would expect from a nintendo 64 game, but this is a very fun game, with many places to explore and is very challenging at some points of the game.",4.0
"I love this game. I have overall, like I said, 4 out of 5, highly recommend it to anyone who loves great games and platformers.",4.0
"One of the best mario games ever made, it was such a huge jump from the previous consoles looked and played amazingly, hours of entertainment for anyone that enjoys adventure type games.",4.0
"For anyone who was a fan of video games, they remember the year of 1996:

The Playstation made waves and drew many Nintendo fans away with its 32-bit graphics and CD based games. For the first time, Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own. After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest, they went to work and released the Nintendo 64 to the public. The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from, early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings 64 (a good game) or Super Mario 64. This game was the reason Nintendo's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to 3D and it was fun doing so.

I'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario 64. It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peach's castle. The storyline is pretty typical by now: King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her. The graphics are colorful, bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time. The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to. It's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again. So why did I give it 4.5 stars? The camera is not perfect but back then, getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program. It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners. It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it.

What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal. Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication. Those who say didn't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly. While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996, this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play. And now, you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS. So if you haven't played this, take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game. I highly recommend it.",4.0
"I'm not very good at video games, so this game is pretty tough for me.  I only have about 20 stars right now and I've had it about a year!  However, other than the not-so-great 3D graphics and the silly camera angles, it is a fun though challanging game.  I look forward to someday getting all 120 starts!!!  haha",4.0
Little corrosion on inside of game.  Scraped it off and it worked fine after that.  In decent condition and plays well.  Satisfied.,4.0
"This is a great game. I played it all the time at my friend's house when I was younger, but I never owned it because they were right down the street. I've always loved Mario. This game is different from the gameboy game because it has more controls, more of a 3-d quality to it, better colors, and more/cooler levels.",4.0
"i remember when i was in high school and this game was brand new and just came out. I played this sooooo much, i got an ache in my hand. I've only beaten it once, but i'll tell you what, in that one time, it took me 3 to 4 months to beat it.",4.0
"Super Mario 64 remains to this day a truly incredible video game that I absolutely love to play through every now and again. The reason that I still love to play from start to finish a game that I have beaten several times since I received it as a Christmas gift from 1996 is because for one, the controls are very responsive and tight, so when I am running across green fields or swimming underwater or jumping from pole to pole, I have complete and total control over Mario. My skill is what determines success or failure, not loose controls! Another reason is the level objectives offer a good variety of boss battles, races, coin collecting, exploration for hidden stars and so very much more. I do not feel that I am always doing the same tasks over and over, and this, in part, is also a result of the level variety. There is a snowy and slippery mountain, a treacherous underground cave maze that partially contains poisonous gas, a large and foggy lagoon that offers up a pirate ship as well as a cave, a level comprised of giant clock components and parts that move at different speeds or not at all based on the clock time and many more. The levels are not hard on the eyes at all and the music tracks, while recycled a bit much, is generally appropriate and enjoyable. There are secrets that await both inside the castle paintings, where the levels reside, and out the paintings, in Princess Peach's Castle, like hidden slides and power-up switches and blocks. The slides feature tricky turns and the power-up blocks enable the powers of flight, invisibility and metal form. Plus, Mario has never boasted more standard moves, even compared with later Mario games, so Mario really does seem super in this game. He has to, too, because the game offers up a moderate challenge that requires good timing and accuracy, as well as some quick puzzle solving skills.

The game, however, is not perfect. There are some flaws that hinder my enjoyment of the game. One flaw rests with the boss battles. The boss battles in this game are really too easy to overcome. If if it is your first time playing, you likely will not lose a life on a majority of the boss battles, except for perhaps the Bowser encounters, but even Bowser is relatively easily trounced once you develop good aim and timing when it comes to dodging his attacks. Also, two levels actually share the same boss. The same boss that you encounter about halfway through the game you will find yourself fighting later. His attack patterns and means of beating him are identical, although he is a different color. That seemed lazy to me. Another flaw I feel this game exhibits is the fact that there is very little interaction with other characters in the game, aside from Koopa the Quick, the Toads, and MIPS. The castle and the levels feel a little lonely. In one level, there is actually a secluded town with homes, trees, walkways and more. Yet there are no townspeople. I would have liked there to have been more characters to talk with, interact with, do things for, rescue and so on. Regardless of these flaws and a few other minor ones, this game remains one of my favorite video games thanks to the cleverly designed and entertaining levels, the pleasant music that makes for an atmosphere that is just fun to explore and hang around in and moderate challenges that reside in the rich and imaginative world of Super Mario.",4.0
"i found this game to be a challenge at first, used to the old side-scrolling games of mario it took some time to get used to the fact its now in 3D.

if you like mario you will love thi 3D game.",4.0
"I would highly recommend this game to any N64-er. It's challenging enough to keep you from getting bored, and it's also very entertaining. Granted, it does get a little too challenging at times. It may prove difficult to achieve all 120(?) stars. But a little hint from any free online guide will quickly solve any snags you run into. I do not advice purchasing this item from this venue; it's a tad bit expensive. You can go to any game exchange store, and buy almost any N64 game for usually $10 or less. But I do recommend this game!",4.0
"What can I say? This game is fun and funny at the same time. From mario flying around with the magic caps to Mario burning his [...] cheeks on the hot lava, this game is great! My only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles!!! AHHHHH sometimes I feel like I could just kick the Lakitu that controls the thing! Angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctly..or so you won't go flying down to your death. Other than that I give it a 4. Would be 5 if the camera was better.",4.0
"What a great game, I like it alot. The only problems I found were:
1: It gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a boss(EXAMPLE: On the first time you fight Bowser, he says ""Can you get behind me and grab my tail? I think not!""

2: Moving around is kinda stupid because Mario can't move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves.

Other than these flaws, this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collection.",4.0
"first and best game i got 4 n64 (other then donkey kong64 wich is a really good game to)its really long and challanging and thats wut i like about it cuz its not one of those games that u beat in a hour like luigis mansion for gamecube, in all there are 120 stars but i only got 70 cuz thats all u need toface the last bowser wich is rainbow bowser and u have to throw him into 3 bombs to kill him but after u beat him the games not over cuz u have t get all 120 stars so the cannon in the front yard opensand i shots u to the roof and yoshis there and gives u 100 lifes ,dont think im jokin i know wut ur gonna say how do u know that if u only have 70 stars?its called i went over my friends house and he had 120 stars .so wut im saying is this game is a MUST have",4.0

"This game is so much fun.  I've always been a big fan of Mario since the beginning.  The graphics are great and the sound is pretty good too.  There are many different goals to reach in each level.  Whether you have to collect coins or stars to open new levels, I know you'll love this game.",4.0
"Surprisingly, when Nintendo created the N64 game system, they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be. The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time.
Nintendo's Super Mario 64, remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date. The graphics are just completely amazing, and so strong from one angle to another. In Super MArio 64, you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner. The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game. Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach, whom is still known as Princess Toadstool, from the vile Bowser. Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom, from Sea, to the firey sky, and even in a spooky ghost-filled house. The load up time for this, and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC, and the other CD-Rom console games.
It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this, and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory, with the Gamecube. Nevertheless, Super Mario 64 is still the most superior game of the 20th century, and that is not even a pizza-faced lie.",4.0
"This is a great classic game that basically revolutionized Nintendo 64 but there is only one problem. It is WAY too easy to beat. But I guess since it's an old game I can see why.
Basically the ""mission"" is to recover all the 120 stars and save the Princess from the evil ""Bowser."" It's really easy and you can beat the game in about a month. Even though I have plenty of Nintendo games, I still go back to this game once in awhile because it's a classic favorite. Many current Nintendo games can't compete against it. If only this game was a bit more challenging!! I think all new Nintendo 64 buyers should get this as there first game because you can explore alot with controls and skills that'll help you out in more challenging games.
Any fans of Mario, or Nintendo genre would like this game. As far as kids, there isn't much violence in this game. No blood, or gorey actions. The price is pretty ok, and the game's plot is pretty ok. There are many courses and places to explore so if you are a slow player it'll take some time. After you complete the game, you'll still be going back to it. Seeing that my brothers and I already beat it over 10 times, we're finally getting tired of it!",4.0
"I could knock a few stars off by going on and on about what they SHOULD have put into this game -a playable Princess, animal costumes, Fire Flowers, etc.- but such negativity could foolishly ruin such a great game. Super Mario 64 isn't perfect but it has the best damn gameplay of any action title. The worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors, whacky enemies, catchy music, and most importantly, gameplay.

The only downsides to this game are Mario's horribly annoying voice, an occasionally fussy camera, and the possibility of graining your N64 control stick when you fight Bowser. These minor neusances are mild though and they don't really hinder the gameplay. All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves: Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series. I also don't like the changes made to Princess Toadstool. Instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series, she seems more like a ""dumb blonde"" with a weird voice.

Yes, this game is old but, like fine wine, games can get better with age.",4.0
"This game has great graphics and is fun too play, but it is very challenging.  My seven-year-old has a hard time completing the levels and on some levels has not gotten any stars.",4.0
"One of the launch titles for the N64 back in '96 Super Mario 64 had only a small band of rivals at the time. The most prominent being Star Wars Shadows of the Empire and Star Fox 64. The game has stood the test of time in several factors. One you can still find it brand new. Two the previous games mentioned are almost impossible to find unused! Three for a launch game the graphics were great, but they are not as good as late comer Banjo-Kazooie. The story line is interesting and the levels are big, but not as large as Banjo-Kazooie. You have to find 100 Power Stars that Bowser stole from Princess Peaches's castle, and if you get all 100 you can go to a cannon near the castle, hop inside, shoot onto the roof of the castle, meet Yoshi (Mario's dinosaur friend) who will give a super new jump and 100 lives! The games levels are challenging espicially the last few levels and the levels where you fave Bowser (you have to beat him three times) are DANGEROUS especially the last one. From the sea to land to desert to snow covered mountain and to the desert and beyond Mario must battle enemies in 3-d and collect six stars on every level. Five stars are attainable by completing tasks while the sixth is attainable when you collect 100 coins on a level. The music is hummable and the characters are nice and mean. This is still Marios biggest adventure and with the coming of the Gamecube and the fall in price for the Nintendo 64 and its games, Super Mario 64 is a must have. I've had my 64 since Christmas '97 and also received Super Mario 64 which is still a GREAT game!",4.0

"I bought this game in 1997, over a year after it was released. The first few weeks i played it, i was amazed at the beautiful 3D graphics. Honestly,  i had never seen 3D graphics before this game, so it was awesome and  inspiring.
I love this game, so i'm writing this review. There are some  memorable moments from this game (like when Mario ventures into the haunted  mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skies)
All in all, it  showcases the N64 incredible 3D graphics and the sound isn't half  bad.
The levels are interesting and sparse ( i beat this game with the  Nintendo Power guidebook) and should take some time to crack the puzzles.  Basically, the game is quite easy and not surprisingly, it has enough  mini-quests and puzzles to keep you occupied. As for level designs, i think  it's excusable considering it's first generation stuff but still deep  enough to immerse you (again) after a long absence...
My gripe is while  this game is really good (i mean i'm a big-time Mario fan from the first  mario game), it's only as good as it lasts. I found it hard to go back to  this game after a while- cause it was like having discovered everything and  it made it hard to play through the whole thing again.
My advice: play  selectively. You need to get into the mood. While i say that, it's without  doubt that i have never regretted buying this game.
Even if i never play  this game again and leave it to collect dust (not likely)-i'll always  remember this game as one of the finest moments of the N64 lifetime (that  is 1996-2001).
Anyway, every Super Mario game is groundbreaking (SMB1  created the side-scroller, SMB2 was queer and fun, SMB3 is the greatest  platform game ever, SMB4 was one of the most replayed game i ever played  and this game is mario in 3D without luigi,which is sad)
But cheer up  people- the next generation is almost upon us. But i know that when we look  at 3D graphics today, we will know that this game had a part to play in  making this our reality today.",4.0
"This game will test your ability to lead, to design, and depending on the speed you play your patience lol, its a well done game and its not like a game that once you've beat it or solved it you stop playing it, it will always be different according to how you design your city, and even then once you have a city you get the pleasure of sending disasters at it to see how well it survives and recoups.

an all around enjoyable game",4.0

"It makes you think. I agree that few new surprises are discovered after the first bit fo time, but I find I can keep playing it whenever I need just a little tedious activity to occupy me. (Personally, I like to listen to books on tape while I play--but that's just me).

My suggestion? Buy it, it's worth it.",4.0
"As the Mayor of your SimCity, you are tasked with building a city from scratch.  Your primary objective is to make your Sims happy and increase the size and population of your city.  SimCity 3000 is another in a long line of games from this genre.
SimCity 3000 is a very good game overall.  Good graphics, good sound, well designed interface.  The game has a very short learning curve -- anyone can become an expert in 15 minutes.  This is not at all to say that the game isn't complicated -- building a good city is a different matter.
When you begin the game, your first task is to get your budget out of the red.  THIS IS HARD.  Many of my friends have been turned off of the game just after the first 30 minutes of play.  But believe me, it's possible.  After this step, the game becomes just plain fun.  SimCity 3000 is challenging and funny.
The only real flaw in the game is that it is possible to get bored with it.  Once your city is built, you have nothing to do but create a disaster (fire, tornado, earthquake, UFO invasion, etc.) and try to rebuild.  This takes a long time to happen, however.  This game is good for a solid 3 months of entertainment minimum, and is well worth the price.  Even a young child will enjoy this game.
Highly Recommended.",4.0
"Making a City, it's a change for once. I like this game because it gives easy control, and it's fun to play. There are some down-sides to it too, like it takes too long to make a big city, and Sims complain tooooo much, but it's all good other then that. My favorite thing to do is save the city, then rip it down by disteasters. The good thing is you don't have to save it after you destory it. This game can be easy or hard, like if you want to make a big city, it takes time, and it's hard, but if you use codes like:I am weak, Call coison Vinnie, I love Red Tape, Power to the masses, Water in the desert, Garage in garage out, and nardz rool(actually spelling) it's eazy (...). Graphics, well it isn't that good on making small sims, but good on everything else, 9/10 Fun, a very fun game, isn't has fun as some games, but it's cool,7/10 Gameplay, well, if you like making cities, then it has long gameplay, 8.5/10 Sound, I really like the sound because it makes me think more,9.5/10 Overall, you would love this game, but it's fun isn't like some games 8.5/10 which is Great/Awesome and 4 stars for Sim City 3000!",4.0
"I enjoy playing this game for the most part. I have spent hours glued to the computer watching my cities grow. Unfortunately as the cities increase in population, so does the chances of the computer crashing - a very annoying problem. Also the parades last too long, the seaports are difficult to develop, the terrain for some cities, such as St. Louis, are unusually hilly, and the buildings look alike. The game is not that challenging. But overall a recommended game.",4.0
"SimCity 3000 forces the player to become attached to his or her city.  You will find yourself during dinner or what have you, wondering if the free way system you installed will take to the simcitizens.
However, with all the time this game consumes, once your city hits a certain point, you must move onto another city, otherwise you get bored, and shelf the game.  I suggest you skip this edition, drop the extra money, and go straight for the Unlimited Edition.  It will be much more rewarding, and worth the cash.",4.0
"A great game that could be ""excellent"" if there where some things fix. It's hard to reach wealth finances, the simcitizens always complain about one thing or another, the factory areas must be not so far the residential area (to be easy to the simcitizens to get to work), but neither so close (to avoid pollution), the people never sleep...? because there is no night in the game, but still a great game, great detailled graphics, great sounds, lot of landmarks, you can see people walking, cars getting on and off the highways, it enables you to create the kind of city you liked to live in like ""save the planet"" city or  i don't mind pollution city, it's up to you. Overall a wonderfull game to play.",4.0
"this is a great game from maxis, who is one of the best computer game  simulation companies(the sims, sim city, sim theme park).  the graphics are  great and don't get choppy even on a low video card, like i have.  my only  problem is that there could be more buildings, but overall a great game.  BUY IT!",4.0
"This is a challenging game as you have to manage your city very well to  win the support of the Sims.  Having enough funds for city improvement and  expansion is another thing to achieve.
At first, you'll be awed by the  beautiful graphics, but as you play for a while more, the game will become  boring.  It dffers not much from Sim City 2000 with only a few additions  here and there.  You can see tiny people walking on the streets in this  version.",4.0
"Personally I did not try any of the other SimCity games before this one and I am notably impressed. I am impressed with the grapics, the level of detail and control over the enviroment and of the overall difficulty of the  game itself. I have no frame of refrence to critize the game as do others  because of my lack of knowledge of how they have improved the game. However  if you are considering this game to be entertaining then buy this game  because in my opinion this game is very entertaining. The only reason I  gave this game four stars was its somewhat awkward interface with the user,  it is powerful but at the expense of simplicity. Overall good game!",4.0
"First off, let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazon.com:
*Realistic 3-D environment
Wrong. The game is 2D, it merely looks 3D. It IS realistic, however. There is far more detail in  2D than could ever have been done in 3D and still hae it run on everyone's  machine.
*View cities from up to 50,000 feet
I guess...you have 5 zoom  levels. The above implies that you can zoom to any level.
*Detailed  control over businesses and other facilities
None whatsoever other than  being able to zone blocks of residential, commercial, and industrial areas,  along with other specialized zones. You can't micromanage any individual  businesses.
*Everything and everyone moves
Cars and SimCitizens move,  so do some animated buildings, but certainly not EVERYTHING.
*Optional  load-in sets for customization and enhancements
That's handled much  better in SC3K Unlimited.
SimCity 3000 is a mixed bag for me. I love  being able to play a fully updated version of 2000, but whether it should  be called 3000 or 2100 is something of a dilemma.
Graphics-wise, 3000 is  beautiful! No two ways about it. A lot of hype has gone into the fact that  you can now zoom in and see little sims walking, driving around in  individual cars, and so on. The building images are now fully 4-sided  entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each  feature. Five zoom levels let you choose the size you're comfortable with  to build on. Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated  at the highest zoom. I don't have that problem, but they are definitely not  the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are. They are merely enlargements  of the 4th zoom. Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any  zoom.
Gameplay: here's the sticking point for me. If you've continued to  play SimCity 2000 until you're red-eyed and guaranteed to be late for  work/school, you'll probably do the same with 3000. Given all the new bells  and whistles, it'll take some time to try them all and see how this affects  that. From this point, however, two camps emerge. One camp will continue  playing the game for years and loving every minute of it, relishing the  freedom to create anything they want. I fall into this category. The other  camp, once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will,  are going to wonder what's the fun anymore. So depending on your  expectations for the game it'll be either a gift from heaven or something  you may well have wished didn't cost 40 to 50 bucks.
As for difficulty,  it's no harder really than 2000. Some of the new features like garbage  disposal, ordinances, and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy  without making the game unduly complex. Maxis should be commended for  that.
Overall? It's good. In fact it's very good. They put a lot of work  into it making sure everything balances more or less. Is it worth the  money? Not now with SC3K Unlimited out. Get it instead, as it's much more  refined. If you haven't played a SimCity game before or if you're a diehard  2000 fan, absolutely. If you just sorta liked 2000 and quit playing it  after a little bit, you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rack.",4.0
"When SC3K first came out, it seemed as if many people were disappointed because it did not look much different from SC2K.  It certainly is not the technological leap that we saw from the original to SC2K.  However this is  NOT merely an expansion of SC2K.  I'm not sure exactly how, but the game  feels, at once, familiar yet different.
This game is truly fun to play;  much more so than SC2K.  Simply the amount of information given to you and  the things that you can do, increase the enjoyment of this game.  The  changes from SC2K are subtle, but have huge consequences the further you  build a city.  SC3K may not look that different from its predecessor but  Maxis has actually gotten much closer to what the actual experience of city  planning and building must be like. I'm curious what Maxis will throw at us  in the next installment.",4.0
"Perhaps SC3K's main problem is that it is far too detailed. Even on a speedy top-end machine the screen will fill with portions of white if you try to scroll at one of higher resolutions. Perhaps this is also SC3K's  main virtue - the fact that you can see down to the last person in your  metropolis. Whatever you say, despite the game's vast graphical and  not-so-vast strategic advances, it failed to do what the fans of the series  held closest to their hearts - personalization. The city develops  completely at random within your zonal confines - you cannot make a  candleshop district, a Downtown, or anything of the sort. You cannot name  streets, despite the fact that you place them yourself. The papers mention  you rarely and glancingly, at best, preferring to metion senseless rock  bands (whose names you cannot supply either) or some other uneventful  thing. The advisors are as helpful as ever - specifically, useless. They  either take no notice of the trouble befalling your city, or they take  notice of something very minor and blow it up to the size of a scandal. THE  1% COMMERCIAL TAX IS KILLING THE CITY!  REMOVE THE PARKING FINES!  All  the while industry fails to develop and a major power outage goes  unnoticed.
This game is a cleaner, crisper version of SimCity 2000,  perhaps an update, but in no way a new game in the series.",4.0
"The next SimCity game was long awaited by Mac users, but I'm glad that it finally came.  However, It's makes me wonder why it took so long considering the draw backs of the game.  The graphics are EXCELLENT and the  actual game itself is impressive.  On the other hand, my first impression,  Software MacKiev (the company that made the Mac version) let alot of things  that make the interface feel like a PC stay in the game.  The system  requirements are VERY steep.  I have a 266 Mhz iMac with 160 MB built in  (normal 32 plus 128) and 160 MB virtual memory, and it still is very  slugish in loading.
  I would DEFINATELY buy this game, IF you have a  good system:  A higher end iMac or a newer PowerMac G3 or G4.",4.0
"The best part of this game is the zoom feature.  If you're like me, you'll spend most of your time building your city about two levels up from the strongest possible magnification.  At this level, you can see enough of the  surrounding neighborhood, while not straining your eyes to see each  particular parcel of land.  However, the real joy comes in zooming in and  out on what you have created.  When you're up close, you see your people --  the citizens of your city -- going about their business.  You'll hear the  ambient noise of your city -- the sirens, buses, electricity and voices.  You have to admire the quality of the programming.
Then, you zoom out  and -- at your farthest point -- you're a mile up, and all you see are your  biggest buildings and you hear nothing but wind.  You look back to admire  your entire city -- your creation -- and you're moved by the beauty of the  thing you have made.
I really enjoy this game.  I will play it for many  days to come.  However, I reserve my 5 Star rating for Caesar III, which  not only matches SimCity 3000 in detail, but also provides an opportunity  for battle that SimCity 3000 does not.",4.0
"I bought Sim City 3000 a while ago and I play the game a lot.  I also have Sim City, and Sim City 2000.  The game is a lot of fun, detail is a lot better than 2000, and there is more to do with this game.  BUT even though  it is a great game, it is almost the same as 2000.  My sugestion is that if  you have Sim City 2000 and want beter game play I wouldn't buy this, but if  you don't have Sim City 2000 and are trying to decide whether to buy 2000  or 3000, I would definately buy 3000, even if it cost a little more.",4.0

"This is a one player, 1st person shooter. The goal is to finish each level by finding keys, weapons and health kits all the while killing as many commies that look like monsters as possible, and trust me there are lots of  commies. There are hidden secrets throughout the game and any number of  sites on the net to tell you where those secrets are. The villians get  smarter and tougher as you progress through the game, the 1st opponents are  just some slow moving, shotgun toting targets, later levels have half  ram-half man beasts that are almost invincible shooting rockets at you!  Good thing you can get a double barrel shotgun, a minigun anti aircraft  type weapon, brass knuckles, a rocket launcher, a plasma gun, a pistol and  even a chainsaw for those up and close encounters. Ever wonder what it  would be like to walk into a building and just start shooting everyone in  sight? If so there are two things you need 1) Profesional help 2) This  game. Good deal at this price.",4.0
"I used to own this game, and while it is not the game I miss most, I still do think about it from time to time. The visuals are very good for the N64's graphics engine, and the voice acting, though there isn't a whole lot, is pretty good. The control is a bit of a problem, as is the camera. However, this is not a big surprise, for it is the first time the series of Castlevania has been moved to the third dimension. Then again, other series didn't really have that much trouble in the third dimension (Zelda, Mario, Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire, etc.), but you can't always win, can you? The music is awesome (naturally-it's Castlevania!) The sound effects are also good. The boss design is highly unique as well, and most importantly, IT'S FUN! I bought it for a mere $20, and it was actually worth it. Though I have sold it, I might try and purchase a friend's copy. If you are looking for a game that is a bit more simplistic in design than the classic Castlevania titles, then this is your ticket for sure.",4.0
"Extremely difficult to play - unless you're an expert. Have to admit - great graphics. Main problem with this particular game is that after maybe (say, an hour or so) it tends to get a bit old. Many - and I do mean many levels to conquer. I would only recommended this game to patrons who have plenty of patience. You know - the kind of -patience- that is required while you're on Ebay - trying to wait until the bid's end to an item that you want [so very bad] only to have one of those pesky last-minute snipers to come by and out-bid you within the very last ten seconds. That kind of patience. I much prefer the Atari 5200 version of this video game.",4.0
"Castlevania is a very cool game which pretty much involves wiping the un-dead with a whip.  You can choose between two characters each with slightly different abilities, either way, they do the same amount of damage.  Although it is slightly frighning at first (only if you get scared really easily) you get used to  enimies poping out and the creepy environment, which really loses its effect if you have played games on the GCN or PS2, because the graphics on this game are really bad compared to the more advanced systems.  Anyhoo, the game is really fun, but the layout pretty much stays the same, as well the puzzles.  Sometimes it can be a little frusturatuing at times, but all in all it is a very fun game.  If your looking for something to do, or just a simple little challenge, pick this one up.  I don't reccomend it for kids under ten, cuz it is based on dracula after all, and it does have little evil minions of hell as enimies, but thats just my opinion, thatnks for listing!

"""Castlevania 64"" offers you the experience of seeing a Castlevania adventure in a free-roaming, 3-D realm. I have played every Castlevania game right back to the NES days, and this is a good addition to a fine series. This is a great game, but not as good as ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"" for Playstation.
To start on a positive note, there is a lot of depth added thanks to the 3-D graphics. You can roam freely, battle monsters face-to-face, and search for hidden items without the constraints of side-scrolling. The control is responsive, and the buttons are easy to figure out, which is good considering the pace of the game. The 3-D worlds are huge, and are fun to explore. The sound is also excellent. You can hear the clatter of bones, the snapping of jaws, and the cracking of whips clearly, without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments.
The cons of this game are mostly technical, nothing to do with the graphics or storyline. First of all, the camera can be a servere pain sometimes. It often lingers when you don't want it to, and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad.
The control is good, but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements. I remember the first level when I kept falling into the water and dying when I tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch. Also, a map would be helpful. Certain areas look the same as others, and sometimes, I cannot tell where I have been and where I am going. But as I said, these are more technical flaws. They don't exactly ruin the game.
Overall, this game is fun, and gives a whole new depth to the long-running series. But as good as this is, ""Castlevania: SOTN"" for Playstation is much better.",4.0

"This game shows its age in a few ways, but is still a great game in many respects. The skill level required is high and the game provides hours of gameplay because of this. The realistic physics also make this game very worthwhile. A nostalgic favorite for me that I had great fun replaying.",4.0
"I had this version in the 90's and played it while a teenager.  I now repurchased it and am playing it in 2008 as a 28 year old.  It is STILL visceral, brooding and epic in its dark atmosphere.  In some ways, the minimalist ""3D"" of the original DOOM (particularly in this port) lends itself well to the overall gloomy atmosphere.  It creates a certain... menacing bleakness in the landscape.

One thing that REALLY makes this a DOOM to remember is the TOTALLY BENT, EPIC DRONECORE DARK AMBIENT SOUNDTRACK.  Playing DOOM on my modern computer, despite the incredible graphics, just isn't quite the same without that HAUNTING soundtrack.  Seriously, the soundtrack to this particular version of DOOM is so totally harrowing and visceral as to be nearly a moving life experience.  You will never quite forget it after hearing it.  The soundtrack is certainly one of the best of all time (for a video game).  It is profoundly moody, unrelentingly heavy and completely out there.  It sounds like something Steve Roach might create after surviving a journey through Hell and then having Trent Reznor as the music producer.

Overall, this is quite a good port over to the original Playstation.  Original DOOM is an all time classic with brilliant level design and awesome action that set the standard for years.  Pick up this version used and fade away into that crazy soundtrack from another level of existence...",4.0
"Doom for PS1 is a great game. Almost every level from Ultimate Doom & Doom II is here, plus some new levels never before seen on the PC. This game is dark, scary as hell, and can really get in your head. The soundtrack is totally different from the PC, and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do. The controls are easy to learn, that's a good thing. However, the only reason why I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the graphics. Yes, as you may have already read, the graphics are a bit sluggish, especially when compared to the PC version. In my opinion, the best version of Doom is the PC version, period. Doom, Doom 2, and Final Doom are the best video games ever, in MY opinion.",4.0

Old game but fun and best time in wrestling..Pretty easy to play. Game play is cool and If never played start game level on easy and get moves down or u will get frustated with computer stomping ur butt.,4.0
"I know this will sound crazy, but the main reason I finally broke down and purchased a Playstation several years ago was because I wanted to play some of the wrestling games available for this particular console.  For whatever reason, no one has ever come close to producing a decent wrestling game for the PC.  At the time, I was a serious wrestling fan, having been drawn back to the fold by the brilliant internal division in WCW between the good guys and the evil NOW.  WCW Thunder came out while the WCW was at its peak of popularity, and I just had to have it.  While the game has naturally lost some of its luster as time has passed and gaming hardware improved, it had all sorts of enticing features then and remains a fun diversion even now.
WCW Thunder had a lot to offer fans when it was released.  For starters, you had some 60 superstars to choose from, including the biggest names around such as Goldberg and Hogan; all kinds of other hidden wrestlers also lay buried inside the game, waiting for you to win with certain characters (or use the handy dandy cheat codes) to unlock them-everything from made-up goofy characters to the wrestlers who got beat up for a living every week to announcers to members of the Nitro Girls (including the luscious Kimberly).  While certain basic moves worked for all wrestlers, each individual wrestler, including the hidden ones, had their own signature moves.  Thus, you could have Goldberg take his opponent out with the Spear followed by the Jack Hammer, or have Lex Luger turn a man into a little baby while hoisted up in the Torture Rack.  Each wrestler came with his own theme music and personal allegiance, but you had the option of changing a guy's alliance.  This could become important in terms of one of my favorite features of the game, the ability to have an ally come to the ring to help you avoid a loss or just to help you beat the heck out of your opponent.
The game offers a number of game types for one or two players.  You can fight an exhibition match or go for the TV Title, US Heavyweight Title or walk that aisle in pursuit of the World Heavyweight belt.  If you get tired of one-on-one action, you can choose tag-team play or battle it out with 29 other wrestlers in a Battle Royal.  You can even get down to brass tacks and battle it out in a cage match.  The only bad thing about a cage match is the fact that it does not allow you access to any weapons.  In normal game play, there are a number of weapons outside the ring (you control how many) that you can pick up and use to beat the fool out of everybody that gets in your way; you can even just keep wailing on your opponent after he hits the ground.
WCW Thunder is and never was perfect, though.  For one thing, the game quickly becomes rather easy.  You can just pile drive your opponent over and over again into oblivion if you like or take a stop sign upside a guy's head a dozen or more times and pin him easily.  The clumsy combination moves actually become a good thing here because it is sometimes a challenge to perform that special killer move your wrestler is famous for and end the match in style.  The graphics are decent but not great, and my Playstation seems to have a few hitches in its gitty-up when it tries to render large numbers of wrestlers all at once in Battle Royal mode.  I still enjoy playing WCW Thunder, though.  It looks a lot like the earlier WCW Nitro game, but it plays a lot better in my opinion.  There are better games available now, even for the Playstation, but I have a feeling that I'll be enjoying this game on and off for many years to come.",4.0
"Haven't had a chance to extensively play it yet, but it arrived quickly and works well!",4.0
I had no idea what to expect with this game seeing that I had never played it before but I am truly happy with it. It isn't the best game ever for the Nintendo 64 but its sure one of my favorites.

"This game is a flash back to when games were simply fun! There aren't a bunch of menus that you have to keep flipping to in order to keep your game going, keep yourself armed, battle, etc.",4.0
This is truly a funny game. It captures the feel of South Park with it's cartoony style. The weapons are funny like snowballs (2nd fire- yellow snowballs) to plungers. The voices from the show are funny. I recomend this game to any South Park fan out there.,4.0
"Perhaps games on N64 were different for me because I played them all through Virtual Reality headsets (made by Philips and i-glasses).  I absolutely loved getting inside the game, especially with the first person shooters on N64.  And South Park was interesting.  The virtual world of South Park is a bit without detail, but that's not to say that where you go in this game is not filled with lovely scenery.  But what appeals most about this game is it satisfies the need to shoot down everything in sight.  There are four parts to this game and each part goes on for quite a while.  A UFO has made its way to South Park, CO and some very ""crazy spooky stuff"" happens.  You deal out against hoards of killer Turkeys, evil clones of South Park characters, gigantic mother ships, aliens, killer cows, robots, and the list goes on.  Basically hoards of small enemies generate in this game, and come from huger enemies which need to be destroyed, and in each section of this game, all the enemies you kill lead to a huge boss.  A classic video game recipe!

What vexes this game is how difficult it is.  Particularly the fourth section of this game.  You have to precisely aim, which is often crucial, and aiming with the N64 thumbstick is very hard to do.  And the final boss is obscenely difficult.  Even with the cheat code, it took every ounce of eye hand coordination I could muster to defeat him.

Still, for those into virtual reality helmets, I would recommend this game.  And oldie and goodie.  Particularly if you like South Park.  It has plenty of cute and funny moments.",4.0
"Sure, this game's been out for alomost four years now, but it's time I reviewed it. The exceptionally popular foul-mouth TV shows based on the fictional, yet epic adventures of Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and (the now removed) Kenny, four innocent little third graders (now fourth) in the snowy, mountain town of Colorado. It's a wonderful life; you have a gay teacher, a pimp-daddy chef, a best friend who dies more than 10 times a week, and all the Cheesy Poofs you could ever want. At least, until, killer turkeys, aliens, clones, and toys invade your town and try to take it over. YOU and YOU alon must prevent these attacks (or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt, but then the game's no fun).
Like all shooter's, I only enjoy this game with cheats. The master cheat for this game is ""BOBBYBIRD"", or, if you break it down, ""BOBBY BIRD"". It unlocks every weapon, level, and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this game.
In single-player, you assume the role of either Stan, Cartman, Kenny, or who I always pick, Kyle. Each comes with their own insults and comments. As you progress, you find Kenny, Cartman, and Stan, and they come with you, but you can't play as or with them. They just allow you to hold more weapons and item (I guess that's because it's four pairs of hands). Your first mission is to destroy the turkeys; and ultimatly, the gigantic, robo-turkey. Without cheats, you start with a snowball, or you can advance it, and make it a ""yellow snowball"" (and if you've seen Jackass, you know what that is). The other weapons are a cow launcher, a toy-machine gun, and more. Sooooo much more.
This game is a good game, but only if you're a fan of the TV show. Even though it would be fun if some people weren't, they'd still annoy everyone, complaining of ""bad language"" and ""foul humor"". Ignore them. If you're a fan, get this, or at least rent it. Later.",4.0

"South Park the video game is all right. I don't think it's smash worthy but I really don't think it's flush worthy either because it did probably one of the smarter things and totally copied 007 GoldenEye and gave it a total South Park twist.
As usual, weird stuff is happening around South Park like mad, killer turkeys are attacking the city, strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest 8 year olds on the planet Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman on this strange, vulger and very gratuitous journey.
I gotta say it, the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through, especially if you ran across the Terrance and Phillip bombs! Other than that, I really didn't feel there was much else besides all the cool codes (like all the weapons codes and stuff) and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like Officer Barbrady, Mr. Mackey (M'kay), Terrance and Phillip and if you really wanted to, Starvin' Marvin.
The story is really silly but then again, when is there an episode of South Park that isn't just plain out ridiculous? Exactly. The controls are pretty easy too. You can set it to GoldenEye style of control or for you advanced users, you can use a Turok type of control.
I still gotta say that I wouldn't play it for it's story mode. Personally, I'd play it for it's multiplayer mode because that's what the game is really good at! That and I personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modes.
For you parents, most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few ""choice"" phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids. For those of you that don't have to worry about that, order a pizza, call over a few friends and throw on some South Park multiplayer. Have fun!",4.0
"The game is great, especially the multiplayer game, on a larger TV.  The weapons and characters are hilarious.  The game has a lot of fun levels,  and it's hard to control your laughter at the sound effects, or the crazy  weapons that you have available.  Impressive the way the game ties in the  different South Park story lines.  The one player game does get a little  monotonous, but can be a lot of fun - after each level you get to add a new  character to the multiplayer game.",4.0
"Just as a little history lesson JetMoto is made by the same people who made the first two Twisted Metal games and Twisted Metal Black.  If that is not reason enough to get this game I will give you some more.  For anti-gravity racing fans out there buying JetMoto is an easy decision to make, but for all you other gamers JetMoto is a very challenging game to play, it will definitely test you to your limits.  Like Wipout, JetMoto is a futuristic racing game but with a twist.  The twist is, what makes it different from Wipeout, it is a mix between anti-gravity racing and MotoCross.  The graphics, soundtrack, animations, and soundeffects pull you into the game and never let go.

The graphics in this game are very good for the PS1.  The texture maps, water splashes, sand effects, and the waves add to the experience.  If you have a PS2 you can smooth the graphics out and make them look even better.

Soundtrack: Now this soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard, right up there with Wipeout's.  The music is exciting and beautifully reflects the environments of each course.

Animations: As you race through each track taking tight turns, you can feel the weight of the craft as your rider pulls on it to just make that turn.  And when you get some big air it feels like the rider is actually flying through the air.

Soundeffects: The soundeffects are equally superb.  The sound of the jetmoto makes you believe that your really racing on a anti-gravity bike.  The water slashes, solid landing sound, turbo boosts are all done extremly well.

Now for the one thing I did not mention above, the controls.  If you have played Wipout then you are ready to play JetMoto.  If you have never played Wipeout JetMoto's controls are overall good, become difficult in the tight courses.

I'll give you some advise, MASTER THE GRAPPLING HOOK!  Some of the tracks are frustratingly hard and if it becomes a little too much to bare go to this web site for cheat codes.([...]) Despite its few short comings JetMoto is one of the best anti-gravity racing games I have ever played and definetely worth the your money.",4.0

"I picked this up the other day. It only took a few hours to finish the 1-player mode, but I suppose the fact that I'd previously played BattleTanx: Global Assault on PS1 helped me out a little.

Story: Some virus gets out of control and eliminates 99.9% of the females on planet earth. This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl, and then the government comes and takes her away. Meanwhile, gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world. Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs.

Gameplay: You play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock Abrams tank, blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing (or kidnapping???) women. Your tribal army needs women to stay in existence. Different gangs have different types of tanks. There are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles, guided missiles, lasers, and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas. Most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of ""Capture the Flag"" from any number of FPS games. BattleTanx's single-player is unique in that regard.

Controls: They work pretty good. No complaints.

Multiplayer: There's no co-op campaign. BOO! :P You can play through various types of matches (most of which resemble the single-player levels) against friends or the AI. You can use the tanks of enemy games in the multi-player. That's all good and well, I guess, but I know I can blow my friends to kingdom come. What I really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on 2 players.

Graphics: They're early N64, but they look alright. I don't like the fact that your main tank in single-player looks so cartoony. The comic-style storytelling is unique, and I think they're way better than PS1 Global Assault's campy voice-acting.

If you're a fan of the BattleTanx series, I suppose owning (what I assume is) the first entry is important. However, if I had to choose between this game and its sequel, I would choose the latter due to its better single-player campaign.",4.0

"Upon first viewing this game, I didn't feel as though I'd struck a jackpot. But after playing it for several times, its amazing features became obvious to me and should to any gamer. Compared to Tekken 2, for instance, the game is much better structured. A limited number of characters enables us to get extremely acquainted with the numerous possibilities that they offer. My personal favorites are Voldo (the gatekeeper to hell that uses shifty blocks and quick parries with knives in the place of hands), Souledge (a fiery pirate-skeleton with an amazing skill in sword handling), and Taki (a mysterious but reliable woman warrior). The controls are extremely responsive, and the special moves of the characters are models of creativity for other games to follow. The graphics are truly very good, but not perfect.

"****1/2
Resident Evil is one of those games that needs to be rated, not on the game itself, but what it did for the video gaming world. RE was the first video game to actually put the gamer into a real life horror movie and then say, ""survive this!"" So, RE, along with other games, became known as the ""survival horror"" games. While RE, on terms of gameplay, might not be the greatest game ever made, it's still fun. Of course though, that's not what the game focuses on anyway. This game focuses on trying to scare the dickens out of every gamer who picks it up, at least, the first time they play it. Scenes like where you head out of the dining room and into the long corridor. You look right; nothing but doors. You look left; a corner that you can't see around, so you head to the left and turn the corner and your first taste of a true horror game/movie starts. The cut scene reveals the back head of your first encounter with a zombie, one that happens to be munching on one of your comrades. As he turns around to look at you, you see that pale, ugly face of the undead that you'll see all throughout the game. After you dispose of the creature you finally realize just what you're in for. The second scene that had everyone talking is your first trip down the carpeted, ""L"" shaped hallway with all the windows. As you enter there aren't any zombies so you think, ""Oh, good, no creatures to kill me..."" or so you think. As you're making your way down the hall, your first encounter with a Cerberos (zombie dog) occurs. The glass breaks and you jump out of your seat as the dog heads toward you. Everyone out there might as well admit that the first time you ran into that dog you were frozen with fright just long enough for him to take a bite out of you. Then you snapped back into action and squeezed off 3-5 shots and killed that doggy dead. Things like this is what made this game so great. Although the gameplay of: raise gun, and then shoot monster until he dies isn't exactly cutting edge, it serves its purpose. The game is split between killing monsters and solving puzzles that are anywhere from easy to very difficult. The puzzle part gives you the ""game"" feeling and everything else; the killing monsters, cheesy plot, horrible dialogue, and creepy music gives you the scary movie feeling. The plot is mainly about a group of scientists that were working on a virus that turns living things into mad, blood thirsty creatures of the undead. Several murders start occuring in the small town of Raccoon City with the victums being eaten. The STARS (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad) are sent to investigate. They disappear and another STARS group is sent to find them. What they find is their downed helicopter and strange, growling creatures lurking in the woods. The creatures start chasing them and the STARS members start running. What they run into is the mansion where the experiments started in the first place. Half of their group, by now, is either missing or dead. Here, in the main hallway of the mansion, is where you start your adventure. Later in the adventure you uncover Umbrella's (the evil corperation) secret and the conspiracy within your own group. One thing that made RE was the creepy music. While very simple, it still gave you the feeling of a classic horror movie. The greatest part of the game was the brilliant camera angles that were given to you in each area. From the first moment you walk into the dining room you know that Capcom knew what they were doing. The view shows your character at the end of the room and the camera angle is at the end of the long dining table. The graphics in the game are very good as well. What stands out though is Capcom's attention to every detail when it came to the mansion's design. If you stop and really look at the place, you'll notice that it really is a beautiful place. (if it wasn't crawling with zombies that is). In the game your ammo and weopons are extremely limited. Throughout the entire game all you get is a knife, 9mm handgun, shotgun, and a flamethrower or bazooka (depending on which character you pick). Also, the ammo through the game is extremely limited, I mean to the point where you almost have to try and avoid every fight you possibly can. This becomes very mind numbing and repetitive. So, the bad parts in the game: dialogue, lack of weopons and ammo, simple gameplay, very hard puzzles, and running around the mansion all the time. The good parts: graphics, mansion's detail, creepy music, outstanding camera angles, and the best translation of a horror movie into a game of it's time. RE has spawned several sequels, and several RE clones such as Silent Hill and House of the Dead. However, there will never be another game that will give you the feeling the first RE did. Resident Evil is a classic in the way that it created a whole new genre of games, and how many games can claim they did that!",4.0
"Resident Evil is a creative and ambitious adventure/horror game that requires equal measures of patience, puzzle-solving ability, and lust for wreaking slash-and-burn mayhem. As a member of an elite S.T.A.R.S unit, your character is investigating a number of grisly murders and subsequent sightings of a variety of hideous, mutated creatures in the ""Raccoon Mountains."" One of the creatures chases you to an ominous-looking mansion, and this is where the game is played out.
This game is not for the very young or the very squeamish. There are a number of rather graphic interludes; early on, for example, you encounter a quite-realistic close-up of a ""zombie"" munching on the severed head of one of your unfortunate teammates, complete with soggy chewing noises. Overall, however, the game effects tend to seem more humorous than horrorific; e.g., animal-lover though I may be, I got quite a laugh out of the rabid wolves, which yelp and flip upside down when shot.
Resident Evil involves quite a bit of action early on. Once you locate the proper weaponry, however, the focus begins to shift. The undead are no match for a shotgun or bazooka, and before long you are free to search the mansion and surrounding real estate for clues. At this point, the game becomes equal parts strategic puzzle, riddle, and treasure hunt. You can only carry a limited number of items, and you can only leave items or save the game in one of the storerooms, which are scattered at random around the grounds. It can be maddening to realize that you need some key, tool, or formula, only to discover that you abandoned it some distance away.
Some of this game's greatest strengths are also its biggest weaknesses. Clearly meant to look like a movie, you view your character from constantly shifting, third-person viewpoints, and the graphics are often spectacular. However, controlling the character can be frustrating, especially when the view shifts dramatically as you are battling a mutant, and these shifts make it easy to get disoriented as you travel the maze-like hallways.
Resident Evil includes a number of somewhat-challenging puzzles and these were often the facets that brought me back to play again and again. On several occasions, though, I was irritated to discover that the game was overly picky about positioning and that I had failed to solve a puzzle because my character was a quarter-step out of place when I asked it to search for a clue or use a tool.
Finally, because the story unfolds as you go, your objectives are often unclear. For me, this only added to the mystery and helped hold my curiosity. Eventually, though, I began to wish for some direction. My brother-in-law and I probably put in about 60 hours of actually playing time on this game over Thanksgiving and Christmas, and after about 12 hours of wandering empty hallways and poking through rooms we had already searched a dozen times, the tedium got to us and we abandoned it. There were a number of points in the game where we were given choices, such as ""Will you follow the team leader?"" or ""Will you pull the lever?"" and we had no way of knowing whether we had chosen incorrectly or were, in fact, following a dead end.
I don't know how much of the game I actually completed, and someone with more time and patience and, perhaps, greater puzzle-solving abilities might find that I only scratched the surface. This really wouldn't surprise me, as the detail and scope that I encountered were truly impressive. I would certainly recommend Resident Evil to anyone who enjoys adventure and puzzles with a dark edge.

"This is the very first twisted metal game to come out and i loved it. It is different than the rest of them but it is still fun to play. It has the original people and tracks to go to so if u have played any of the other twisted metal games u will reconize most of these people. It is very hard to beat because it is the first game and it took a long time to get used to. The graphics well this is the first one, its on the ps1, and it is a very old game so yes they r not very good. It is all blocky and the cars move in weird directions. This is a great game on multiplayer though, there r many different things to do unstead of just battleing each other. After u beat the game a couple of times it is easy to play and beat ur friends at it. This is a very fun but challenging game.",4.0

"When this game came out it was the greatest wrestling game for Playstation. People complaining about the game are people who did not play it when it came out and got spoiled by graphics later down the road. Alof of people refer to the Attitude era wrestlers and wonder why their not in the game? well its because the Attitude era did not kick off until 97', thus the game came out in 96' and was actually developed in 95'. Wrestling was the greatest thing before the attitude era, and this game shows what it was all about. Great gameplay, old wrestlers who do not wrestle anymore,GREAT commentary which was actually was my personal favorite feature of the game in 96' and still is. I would NOT recommend this game to kids who grew up wathcing wrestling the past 12-15 years because they will not know who 99% of the wrestlers are. Old school wrestling fans like myself consider this game a gem and any wrestling fan from the early 90's can tell you it still is a great game.",4.0
"I din't get this game until almost a year ago, but I still find it to be pretty fun. It has a tiny roster (with only ten guys) that is EXTREMELY outdated, but I recognized most of the guys, several of them being among my favorite wrestlers. (The only one who was completely unfamiliar to me was Ahmed Johnson.) I think the graphics are really good although the wrestlers aren't very large on the screen, and the gameplay is done pretty well. No, the game isn't very realistic, but I think that just adds to the fun! Some people seem to have issues with the load times, but I don't really think the load times are bad at all. I've played games that have much longer load times! I think this game is much better than WCW Vs. The World (which is one of the only two other wrestling games I have for PS1), even though that game has many more guys on it!",4.0
"WWF In Your House, while graphically WORSE than WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, should *not* be ignored if you like that Wrestlemania game because In Your House features the *exact* same arcade wrestling action.  The wrestlers have been updated too.

Yes, WWF In Your House is an old game with noticeably average graphics and not-so smooth animations.  It came out in 1996, I believe.  The graphics simply aren't as good as Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  BUT if you're a fan of Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, I see no reason why you wouldn't like In Your House.

Some reviewers claim this game is hard.  It's really not that hard once you remember the most effective and damaging moves. It's easier than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  In fact, if you consider yourself a fast gamer, you won't have ANY trouble with In Your House.  There's an option to put the game on easy, so if you must, put the game on easy.  Also turning blocking off helps make the game much easier.  Using the run button that's located at the top of the Playstation controller (I believe it's either L2 or R2, or maybe both) is a MUCH better idea than using the OTHER way of running (hitting two buttons at once- ugh!)

The loading time is somewhat worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, but only somewhat.  In Your House takes maybe 3 or 4 seconds longer to load a match, if that.  Unfortunately, the way Vince McMahon introduces the wrestlers is pretty bland and uninteresting compared to Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game where you actually saw the wrestlers running forward, towards their opponents, featuring their own distinct animations (such as Shawn Michaels posing and Doink ""the clown"" squirting water).  In this game, Vince just SAYS who you're facing while a boring picture appears on screen showing the wrestlers.  It's not as good.

You get to play as 10 wrestlers, and each wrestler has his own set of unique moves.  It's better to try finishing off your opponent using the moves that drain the most energy.  That's the number one rule to winning.

Going through a World Title tournament in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game takes about 10 minutes.  Here it takes about 20 minutes, because you have to compete in more matches.  It's not a problem at all, though.  If anything, it's better this way, because it's *so* much fun going through all the rounds and whipping out one devastating move after another.  Some of these moves are realistic, while other moves are too extreme for wrestlers to be able to perform in reality.  For example, the Ultimate Warrior shooting lightning and the Undertaker shooting some kind of demonic spirits at you.  It doesn't happen in real life.

You get to play as Shawn Michaels, Vader, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith, The Undertaker, Goldust, The Ultimate Warrior, and Hunter Hearst Helmsley.  People may complain that this is a really small list of wrestlers to choose from, but it's actually better than the more updated wrestling games on the market today that feature WAY too many wrestlers that have no reason to exist.  At least with a small selection, you will be able to remember all your opponents main power moves.  Plus, giving you a small list of selectable wrestlers makes it feel more like a short and intense arcade game, which is the point.

It's probably the hardest going through the tournaments (all three of them) with Goldust because his energy seems to drain very quickly, and it's probably the easiest to complete these tournaments with Shawn Michaels or the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith because they have MANY power moves that finish your opponent off very quickly.

But as I said above, this game is worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game because the graphics and animations aren't in the same league.  But see, the thing is, In Your House and Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game are the ONLY arcade wrestling games with the WWE logo on them.  This means we only have TWO games like this that exist in the entire world.  Sure beats having a million slow-moving big and bulky 3D WWE games out there that have no major innovations implemented whatsoever to separate themselves, right?

I have a lot of fun with these arcade style wrestling games, so realism doesn't matter to me at all.  I will take this game over any and all of the best-looking WWE wrestling games that are so popular today.  I prefer wrestling games that are FAST, and that's what In Your House is all about.  It's fast, exciting, unique and with practice, not very difficult to complete.  Who cares about graphics?

So, in short, I don't CARE that In Your House is sort of a low-budget looking WWE game.  This and Wrestlemania are the only games like it.

Also, the commentators, Vince McMahon and Mr. Perfect, have a LOT more things to say in In Your House compared to Vince and Jerry Lawler in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  Also worth mentioning: each wrestler has their own special thing to say at the beginning and end of a match.  Okay, so they don't say things ALL the time, but many times they do.

Both the Playstation and Saturn versions are great.  The Playstation version has shorter loading times, and plus I think the Playstation controller is better for delivering moves because of the simple button layout.  Also, there's a Sound Test option only in the Playstation version where you can hear all the sound effects and theme songs in the game.  I mean EVERY SINGLE THING you hear in the game can be found in the sound menu!  It's pretty awesome.

The Saturn version has a couple things that the Playstation version doesn't have, so don't worry Saturn fans!  Exclusive to the Saturn version includes an extra move for the Undertaker (in this version, you can deliver multiple chokeslams to your opponent - you can't do this on the Playstation version) and plus the Saturn version was created so you can perform finishing moves whenever you want, whereas in the Playstation version they can only be delivered during one-on-one matches.  It doesn't matter how many people you are facing on the Saturn version, you can deliver finishing moves at the end of every match, if you'd like.

Either version is great though.",4.0
"You wouldnt expect it, but this game is good for all the wrong reasons. If you were to buy this, you wouldnt think the best wrestlers would be the the guys you never heard of right? By far the best finishing move in the game is called ""The Alcapulco"" by some guy whos name I cant remember. Its the most devastating move ive ever seen in wrestling, if he does this in real life to other people, I would suspect these people often become paralyzed.
I will attempt to describe the move, it starts off as a regular suplex, but once he has the guy verticle in the air, he releases him and comes down into a piledriver. So basicaly your being dropped directly on your head from 6+ ft in the air. A regular piledriver is like 2 ft and you have almost no momentum. Same with a tombstone piledriver. This tops both by alot.
Besides this one move, the game is average overall, not great, not bad. But this one thing made it better than average for me, worth a look in my opinion.",4.0

"My cousin downloaded this during a recent visit to his house (PS3 online), and I had forgotten how awesome it was. It took us 3 playthroughs and 6 hours to beat it again, but keep in mind we're nerds, and used to do it practically blindfolded. We did not even get up to go to the bathroom this whole time. Crazy, right? That's how much fun this game is. Bought it on here as soon as I got home.

There have been future installments in this franchise. They have had better graphics with more maps and more cars. But there's just something that this one has the other games are lacking. The sheer insanity, the built in unfairness, perhaps. I mean, the computer controlled cars have this strange ability to never run out of weapons, even on the easiest difficulty level. It is just absolute fun, whatever it is. What other game can you blow up both the eiffel tower AND the hollywood sign? Don't look to be blown away in graphics, or in pretty much other category. It is a PSOne game, after all. But you'll be hard pressed to find games that can offer this much mindless destruction and enjoyment.",4.0

"This games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun. Tenchu had competant graphics for the time, though ugly by 2012 standards. The controls definately had issues but lets face it, this is the best Tenchu game to date. Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments. Years later, the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certain games you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back. This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread. The first one is the best in the series, in my opinion. Priority was never graphics or packaging. It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack.",4.0
"This is a great stealth game and one of the first I ever played (besides Metal Gear Solid). I spent many hours on this just being sneaky. The main thing I liked about this is that it's not your typical run around hack and slash game. You actually had to think about what you're doing and what the outcome would be. The voice acting wasn't that great but it was at the time when this came out.

"I have been playing video games since pong (the 70's) and I have change with the time (bought a new system every year they come out)and love some of the new play station games but it's good to have some old favorites!!

Funny thing is when I was 8yrs old I could never get past the 2nd screen in Galaxian Now 22 years later of playing video games, I still can't get past the 2nd screen even though I master Sypro (a 2000 game) in 2 days.
I have to admit druaga & phozon were never favorites when I was kid but there hoot to play now just seeing those out of date graphics, yep the graphic may be pathetic & game idea may seem simple but they are still challenging and a good reminder of what the good old days of video games were like.",4.0
"Namco Volume 3 is a well rounded collection of classic arcade favorites. It features Ms. Pacman, DigDug, Galaxian (which became addictive very fast after a few plays.), also..features Pole Position II, Phozen (which I had never heard of till this collection. It's not for everyone.), and last but not least we have..The Tower of Druaga. Obviously the best games are Ms. Pacman, Galaxian, and DigDug which each of these games are worth having individually, so having them all on one disc it's hard to go wrong. But wait there is one slight problem. When you go to the screen that allows you to change the dip switches..when they pop up they cover the menu and you don't know what your changing until you get back to the game, only to realize you have unknowingly changed your amount of lives to 1 and set your bonus on 10000000 or something to that effect. Maybe it's just me but I would have preferred a modern menu instead of the switches. Never~the~less 4 STARS.",4.0
"Maximum vintage gameage!  This game is packed with the best (and worst?) of the arcade days.  First, there's Ms. Pac-Man...though this might be the Japanese version; the Midway one played differently.  Galaxian is the precursor to Galaga; maybe it should've been on Volume 1 instead?  Phozon is based on the atom principle--you collect the various atoms (with your X-shaped thingy) to form various shapes matching the one(s) in the background.  Dig Dug, also back, features that guy in a suit digging in the underground, collecting fruits/vegetables, and dropping rocks on (or blowing up) Pookas [little bouncing orange creatures with big eyes] and Fygars [basically small dragons].  Pole Position II is the sequel to Pole Position; this time you have your choice of 4 tracks to race on.  I didn't play Tower of Druaga much as I don't care for that game.  Don't forget, you can also check out knowledge/history of the games in the various Museum virtual rooms; there's even a stack of NG magazine covers in the Library!  If you were addicted in the early 1980s, get addicted again...only this time you don't need quarters to play!",4.0
"Namco Museum 3 (third in a series of five collections of old arcade hits) hits some high and low spots, but is well worth the purchase price for three games.  The best of the lot is the translation of Ms Pac-Man - very faithful to the original.  Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original.  Most people don't give Dig-Dug the credit it's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults.  I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades, and this is a good rendition.  On the other hand, ""Phozon"" and ""Tower of Druga"" are very forgettable, ""Tower"" the most worthless of the lot.  Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac Man.",4.0

And after I tried the demo of ""Ninja: Shadow of Darkness"" that was in my game ""Fighting Force"", I realized I was lucky that I didn't waste my money on it.
I would never trade this game in for that other stupid one. This game is incredible. Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front. Not only that, but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome: samurai, ninjas, bears, wolves, dogs, and all kinds of demons. This game is totally awesome, if a bit slow though. It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in ""Devil May Cry"", it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime. Oh well, it was still a good game. If you're a true ninja fan, you must have this game... you won't regret it.",4.0
"Unlike the Corny ninja titles of years past like ""Ninja Gaiden,"" ""Ninja,"" and others of that manner.  Tenchu finally takes the  Ninja game to the next level.  Not just a run around and throw stars at  senseless, weak enemies, this game forces you to learn and master stealth  and the art of sneak attack.  The different weapons available keep the  onslaught more versatile, and the different sword attacks seem to stun the  viewer with there harsh and brutal images.  A great game , a great story  line, but still a few small problems.  even though you have a large variety  of weapons they are very limited.  some of the game may be confusing, and  not very straight forward as to what you are supposed to do, and you tend  to run into some very annoying camera views that seem to definately take  away from the game play.  But overall it's a very entertaining game which  i recommend to any action fan.",4.0

"This is perhaps my favorite arcade collection of all time. The PS1 Namco Museum series is a very interesting twist on the arcade compilation formula. The innovative things about these games is that you have the option of walking around in a literal Namco Museum, and there are doors which represent each game, whats awesome about walking around in the museum is that each door for each game you go into has excellent build-up and atmosphere to get you pumped to play the game, and since it is a museum, each game's room has a plethera of interesting history of Namco, for example, in the Dig Dug room, you can click on these action figures that are on display and they represent real toys that Namco actually produced. There are also these sort of tips and tricks scattered on the walls of each room, as well as more history other than merchandise. Its a brilliant idea, and luckily, this game has an amazing roster of games. It has Ms. Pacman, Dig Dug which is my favorite arcade game of all time, Galaxian, Pole Position 2, Tower of Druaga, and Phozon which is a really strange sort of puzzle game. Lastly, because of personal bias, this game means a lot to me. It introduced me to Namco and some arcade classics, and some of the museum locations invoked wonder and curiosity in me and they make me happy whenever I see them.

"There are 2 versions of RE Director's Cut... the original version (pictured), and the Dual Shock version.  The latter has a zombie on the front cover instead of Chris Redfield.

"To be brief, the first resident evil had it all: a haunted mansion turned major pharmaceutical conspiracy, a great soundtrack, shocking moments, brain-teasing puzzles, classic monsters and bosses, and cheesy dialogue.  The original game, and the original director's cut editions, are five-star games that still hold up (minus the graphics, which really don't matter).  The reason for my review is to warn prospective buyers about a major discrepancy in the different editions of the ""Director's Cut.""

Version 1 has a picture of a guy holding a gun on the front.  It contains the original game, original music, as well as the advanced mode, which has all the fun director's cut extras (silver Beretta with random headshot capabilities, zombie version of the Forest character, more enemies, new costumes, more sensible camera angles, swapped puzzles, etc.).  Basically, the same great stuff from the original, plus fun extras.

Version 2 has a picture of a zombie on the front.  This is the DUAL SHOCK edition, and the version that is the most common in current circulation.  While you gain the benefits of a vibrating controller during scary moments, there is a major loss: the classic soundtrack from the original game is GONE.  The original music, with full orchestra support, was outstanding, and the Gamecube REmake tried its best to copy/cover it note for note.  The DUAL SHOCK edition has removed this original soundtrack entirely, on all versions of the game, and replaced it with what can only be described as a monstrosity: a laughable, tension-disabling mix of Super Mario 3 bleeps and boops, 1980s synthesizer support, and the occasional twinkle of an infant's 2-note music box.  This is not an exaggeration--the music in the DUAL SHOCK edition is awful, and absolutely has the ability to significantly diminish the game.

My advice--Do not get the DUAL SHOCK edition, period.  For fans of the series and people looking for the superior game, this is very important.  Music is so key to the creepy, foreboding atmosphere in these games that I am sure you will be bothered by the change in soundtrack, as I was.  Look on Amazon or Ebay and if a picture of the front cover (guy with gun=good) is not provided, remember to check for DUAL SHOCK (which is bad).

The other sign is if a Resident Evil 2 demo disc is mentioned.  If it is, this means it is the original, good version of the Director's Cut.  Buy it.",4.0

"The Original Resident Evil brings back memories, which is why I bought it.  It was more fun in those days though I guess.  I forgot what the graphics were like; They were a little choppy. The video is downright cheesy, which is great.  I get ideas for roleplaying from this game.  All-around I'd say it was a good buy, and a good collectors item.",4.0
works perfectly no issues at all. my only gripe is that the casing didn't come with any of the graphics/booklets so the case just had the cd.,4.0
"I had this game given to me for free years ago on the PC format. I liked it, but for some reason it crashed on me one day and I mustve done something to the disc, 'cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after that.

All these years later I've just picked it up, second hand, for the N64. And I must say there is not really any difference between the PC version and the 64 version, which is a good thing!

The only difference is in the movies. The PC and I 'spose gaystation version had the movies & ending in video form, where as the 64 replicates them the same way using the polygons of the 3d characters themselves. I have no complaint about it, I like it wether it's video form, or 3D poly form. They both still tell the same story. Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal.. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal, he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask!!!! shame thats not in it.

All the codes and moves where the same, and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves, fatalitys and weapens etc... tho, i'm really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts, which makes it great to just go into the options, highlight ""continues #"" and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff.

The only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included. It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK: TRILOGY (All platforms EXCEPT the N64 version) where each button freformed a diffrent fatality (2 fats, freindship, babality etc..) that about it.

This game is one of the best head to head fighter games. Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system... talk about over kill... but they didn't wanna make one for the 64, so thats there loss, which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me.

This game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that, which makes it better then the arcade. Like the fact you can play as Goro & Noobsaibot, and a skinless character named Meat (go to GameFaq,com for the codes)

MK is the best head to head fighter on the N64 in this realm.",4.0
"I started my Playstation One video game playing with Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare.  After this, so many people have recommended Resident Evil to me, I can not remember all that was said and read.  So I moved on to Resident Evil: Director's Cut (Dual Shock).  Basically, this has only two characters, male and female, to play with.  Three levels to try per character: Beginner, Original and Arrange.  You are in a mansion, so many rooms to go into, you are looking for any items, some items you pick up fit somewhere else.  You are fighting biohazard zombies. The dog through the window bit happened so suddenly my heart jumped (I think I leaked some water too). You fight more bloody dogs, spiders (bigger than New York) and snakes.  What I dislike is having to go back and forth.  You have to go back into the mansion and go in some of the rooms again. It gets boring after a while.  Through the Mansion, into the garden, empty the water, into a lab, into an underground house, back to the mansion again, enter room with a snake in the fireplace, jump down to rock tunnels with emergency balls (fun like Indiana Jones), up to a fountain that opens up, down into a compound of labs and emergency rooms.  Using the Umbrella computer to open up level B2 and B3 was really cool.  The bathrooms were cool, but you can't use the toilet  (bummer).  That would have been funny if a character did use the toilet.  Would that be an ""A"" rating for a game?
  I could not buy a strategy guide (which I highly recommend for any adventure game), but thanks to all those hints, clues and walkthroughs printed on the web, I got through the game finally!  I also highly recommend ""Codebreaker"" from Pelican Accessories which will help you pre-set your game playing to pre-set cheats with a memory card.  You can also type in your own cheat codes found on [...] to use on your Codebreaker.
  Resident Evil: Director's Cut (Dual Shock) only has two stories, but three different ways to play.  So six games in all, plus one ""secret"" Arrange game when you hold ""down"" button for three seconds.  ""Arrange"" turns green for easiest mode.  ""Dual Shock"" versions require a special Dual Shock Analog Controller.  ""Dual Shock"" makes your Analog Controller vibrate and shake in your hands when you encounter a monster or danger is just around the corner.  Sometimes it will vibrate just for the fun of it.  ""Dual Shock"" sure does enhance a game and makes your hands feel good after long playing.

  The film ""Resident Evil"" contains the train used in the ""Resident Evil 2"" video game.

"The flagship game of Playstation. This is what introduced millions of future gamers and PS-loyalists that Playstation wasn't messing around when it came to the seriousness that was their gaming system.

The gameplay is pretty straight forward. You run around 3D designed levels, breaking objects and defeating enemies all the while trying to progress to your arch-nemsis - Dr. Cortex - with the hope of saving your friend.

The game was met with great success and spouted off several sequels, but for some reason it doesn't really have a presence beyond PS2. There were hopes, and rumors, that Crash was once again going to be the flagship game for PS4, but that wasn't the case.

The game, although pretty average today, set the tone for future launch titles. I definitely suggest it if you are a PS historian or enthusiast.",4.0
"Capcom's legendary Resident Evil series and I have never really seen eye to eye. Though I own nearly every non-GameCube title in the undead thriller's history, I'd never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it, right up until this past week. I'd always found the series to be misleading, disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times. Time after time, I'd sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games, and time after time I'd get bored, stuck or distracted, leaving the game behind. I grabbed Resident Evil 3 when it was relatively new, and the title has sat, unplayed, on my shelf for years. That was, as I said, until this past week, when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series, even if it drove me to madness.
I'll make it really blunt; the story is absolutely terrible. The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world, occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through. Nagging issues, such as why somebody would lock their home's single shotgun away in a room that's only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles, aren't even touched upon. What if somebody breaks in, in the middle of the night? Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed, run downstairs, jog to one side of the house, move around a couple statues, grab a key, run to another corner of the house, open a door, grab a fake shotgun, return to the original side of the house, unlock the doors and replace the ""real"" shotgun with the fake? I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things, but they'll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play.
The graphics of the first Resident Evil really haven't aged well. Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically, each one looking almost identical to the others. Polygon models are simple and blocky. Textures are pixelated and undetailed, looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title. The series' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places, forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room. Merging still images with live polygons, Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics ""Myst"" and ""Alone in the Dark.""
The bread and butter of any console title, its gameplay, is the one area where you'll really learn to love or hate this series. Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments, Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens, occasionally containing interactive elements of their own. You'll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles, never in control of the camera itself. They'll enter a screen on the left side, mosey around a little bit, kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side, immediately entering the next screen from another direction. Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release, this scheme brought with it numerous problems, the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen. It's not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen, only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next. It's a really cheap way to take a hit, and can mean a speedy, frustrating death in later stages.
Looking back, the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary. Rather than applying a more traditional platformer's control layout, Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration. Left and right don't serve to strafe, they stop the character's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place. Up moves you forward, and down moves backwards. Pressing R1 draws your weapon, and pressing X at the same time fires. It's a scheme that's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that's defined the action portions of this series since day one.
Many of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion aren't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters. You'll realize what needs to be done within moments, but chances are good you won't have the piece needed to do so on your person. It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris, cautiously walking around, learning the position of the zombies, figuring out the puzzles, groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest, fifteen minutes away, and repeating that process. The second time through, playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where, I finished in three hours and twenty minutes. That's one heck of a variation.
The soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something that's difficult to categorize. Imagine, if you can, a blend of symphonic suspense, the song that plays when you push ""demo"" on a keyboard, and elevator music. That's Resident Evil's melody. The composer tried to capitalize on the few ""jump out of your seat"" moments the storyline provided, but surrounded by cheesy samples, monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the N64 than the PSX, there was only so much that could be done.
On the large, this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time, something fresh. It wasn't a blockbuster, oh-my-god-get-me-the-sequel-now, mind numbing experience. I can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel, but even today I couldn't have predicted the amount of games it would spawn.",4.0
"When it comes to Crash Bandicoot I'll be the first to admit playing the three main games on the PS1 in reverse order was probably a bad idea. The thing is Warped was the only one I had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck, and well, it completely spoiled me. I'm sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but Warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that I honestly wouldn't hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or review.

The problem with Cortex Strikes Back is it isn't as polished as you'd expect. I don't mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity (which is superb for when it was released) but a ""streamline all the cheap-shots out of the experience"" way. The level of cheapness ingrained in Crash 2's gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places. Things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when that's the exact opposite of what they should be. Worse yet are the game's hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player. The kicker to is just when you think you're done and your guard is down - that's when they throw the kitchen sink at you.

The above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it Cortex Strikes Back is a beautiful game. The level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which I feel even give Nintendo 64 games a run for their money. But every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the game's stubbornness start to fade something (again, there is always something) shows up and makes it take center stage once again. Compounding the situation is the fact there really isn't enough variety in the levels. Seriously, if I see another level with the words ""Crash"" or ""Bear"" in it I am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levels.

Annoyances aside, if your a fan of the PlayStation having the three main Naughty Dog-developed Crash titles in your library is a no-brainer. If you haven't played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so you'll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it. Unlike some franchises the first three Crash games get better and bolder with each step. As for the game being discussed here, Crash 2 leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then I can't really say I dislike it either. I do wish it was a little better (polished) than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why Warped is so good. So while I would definitely warn others of game's cheaper side I'd still recommend it to anyone with an interest in platformers.",4.0
"Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is the second in a long line of Crash Bandicoot's. This Game is almost totally flawless (but hey, every game can't be perfect but this game comes damn close.)

Plot: Crash is back kidnapped to help Cortex collect crystals. 9/10

Gameplay: The Gameplay is what you'd expect in a platformer. There are five warp rooms with twenty-five levels. You have to finish each level by collecting all three crystals for that level. If you run out of lives you lose and can return to the last level played. 8/10

Sound: The sound is very good and has a nice soundtrack. 8/10

Graphics: The graphics were high quality back in 1997. They still are surprising for today's standards, They work and are eye appealing. 7/10

Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is one of the best Naughty Dog PlayStation 1 game. Easily put, Crash Bandicoot 2 is WAY better than the first.

"This Director's Cut is the only version of this game you should own, simply because it supports the Analogue joysticks on the Playstation controller. The control in the other versions is impossible at times, and a bugger to learn if you are a first time player.
The game by itself is excellent. Lot's of puzzles, and lots of Zombies to shoot down. There are times (many of them, actually) where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot, because you can run low on bullets very quickly. The story is standard for any Survival Horror game: A group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies. An evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies, and the fallout turns the WHOLE TOWN into zombies. To survive, you must make your way through the mansion, and solve all the puzzles. This is definitely a challenge, and one that can be frustrating at times, but rewarding once completed.
Here are the pros. The graphics are superb. The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread, and yes, the blood flow is well detailed, it sprays when you are wounded. The music is ominous and ambient, giving just the right mood to the situations you come across. The story is also well put together, even though anyone who has seen George Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy (and what horror fan hasn't?) can get a sense of deja vu. All these elements make this a game well worth getting.
Now for the cons. This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation, but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck. Sometimes, a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to back-track just to see if you missed anything. This adds much more time to the game, but not in a good way. There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you. Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off, but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve. Also, the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical, and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies.
Overall, this is a great game with a few shortcomings. But then again, nothing is perfect. If the Survival Horror concept sounds appealing, then you should check this one out. The ""Resident Evil"" series has become the benchmark of Survival Horror much like ""Final Fantasy"" has for the RPG genre.",4.0
"This is where the epic Resident Evil series began. The first adventure see's you tackle zombies, snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion, which is very atmospheric. Don't be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes, bear in mind that this was made in 1995/1996 and so for the times it's pretty good. This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series' of games on the Playstation. The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star game is the slighty disapointing ending. But this is only a minor flaw, and this is still one of the best games on the Playstation.",4.0
"Since last night I've been waiting to do this review, because I've been studying the exact differences from RE2 and RE Directors Cut. This review will really help for someone who has played RE2 but is wondering what RE DC is about. Well, you've came to the right place.  First of all, here are the facts:
1. Each zombie takes 5 shots NO MATTER WHAT. (with the Beretta)
2. Jill is a blonde all though she doesn't look like it (a very dumb blonde)
3. BARRY HAS A MAGNUM AND HES PROUD!!!
4. You have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down. (that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the room...the just pop up!)
5. This game has hilarious dialogue!
  Well, speaking of dialogue, the grammar is also very bad...and I mean VERY bad. Examples are: (when you pick up the 1st floor map)  ""You got the 1st floor map""  RE2 says ""you've taken the 1st floor map"" that makes more sense.  ""You got the acid rounds""...funny sometimes. Also, what I found is that Jill doesn't know what blood is. Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor. Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask ""What is it?"" and she stays there and studies it...??? Barry replies with ""I THINK it is blood. I hope this is not Chris's blood!""  And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times. But when there is a big monster coming they just talk ""wow. its a monster. what do we do?""  and when there is like a door that doesnt open (during movie scenes) they say ""THIS DOOR WONT OPEN!! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO??"" Also, a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself, and Barry replies ""No that's okay...I have THIS!!!"" And holds up his Magnum...I laughed my head off...he sounded so stupid! No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny!
  Another fact is that the camera angles are bad, but the puzzles are harder. Hmmm? Resident Evil is a very very very good game...but it is just the dialogue and camera angles...ive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting, despite it's happy mediums.
So theres a few final things I have to say here:
1. Barry has a magnum 2. Wesker has shades 3. And the three zombies at the top of the stairs above the M Storeroom 1F sound like cows.

"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump, crawl, slide, ride on a jetboat, and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh, and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game, then you won't need it, but... it's recommended. In conclusion, this is a fantastic game, and if you love this, make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!",4.0
This game is much better than the 1st sure it may be a little on the easy side but thats better than being frusterating like the 1st crash bandicoot. This game has greatly improved the bosses are funner and you can now save right after a level. The gameplay has less of a jungle feel than the 1st which is a good thing because it makes it less repettive. Also the story telling has greatly improved and thier isn't so much trial and error like in the 1st game. Another big pro is the graphics are amazing for the ps1 the 1st crash also had great graphics but this one has even better such as charater models and texturs the only bad thing about the graphics is that the shadowing has been dumed down but everthing else has been improved. Now with all the praise why 4 stars instead of 5 well that is because the gameplay can get repettive thier were times when i was bored because of the repettive gameplay of just grabbing the crystal and going to piont b but it is still a great game if you have a playstation and like platformers then get now!,4.0

This game was outstanding. For its time naughty dog with only a team of six people revolutionized the original playstation with arguably its best series. I remember playing this game for the first time blown away by the gameplay.

Other than that if you have not played it yet pick it up for the original ps1 or the PS3 as it is a classic worth revisiting.,4.0

"Crash Bandicoot 2 is a great game. This was one of the first games I ever got for my Playstation, and it still is one of the greatest games I've ever played. I feel that Crash Bandicoot has become the ""Mario"" of Playstation, having trumped all of the other competition in the adventure category.

The game is relatively simple. Just go through the levels gathering crystals. You gain a purple crystal for beating the level, and a diamond crystal for gathering all of the boxes. Eventually, after the 5th ""Warp Room"" (A room filled with levels), you will use the crystals to defeat Neo Cortex, the game's villain. But wait! there's more! After each warp room, you must defeat a boss, including a huge Crash-like beast called ""Tiny"", and a crazed scientist guy named ""N-gine"", I believe.

The only flaw I would have with the game is the basic lay-out of the levels. You can really only go forward. And especially with the bonus levels, the game has a feeling of being very ""2-D"", which I hate saying because it has stellar graphics. All in all, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a classic game. And despite a few drawbacks for me personally, it remains one of my all-time favorite games. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a great game.",4.0
"When the first Crash Bandicoot came out in 1996 I was amazed on an old game and game system could have great 3-D graphics and such great game play but it was kind hard.

"Lets go back in time to one of my favorite PlayStation icons: Crash Bandicoot. For those who don't know, Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans. Crash would appear in many games, but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. With that said, lets take a look at the first one in the series.

The first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in 1996 with Naughty Dog developing the game, Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors. It was a PlayStation exclusive, but would eventually get re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation 3. The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages, Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas. The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio. Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains. Whats weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in, I don't know why though, its definitely unusual. But nonetheless, lets continue with the game.

The first thing that stands out are the graphics, the graphics for 1996 looked fantastic, they were even better than Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 which was released a month later. It definitely gets an A+ for presentation. The game was a huge hit and was the first non-Japanese game to achieve commercial success in the country. Now, lets discuss the actual gameplay.

The game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend. The game is split into levels with one basic goal: get to the end without dying. You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit. Yeah, its weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived. Why is it that these characters who are very athletic cant figure out how to swim? I hate games that do this because when you see water, you're never sure if the game will allow you to swim. Its stupid and whats weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear. So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself.

You can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting 100 apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros, but the apples are everywhere in this game so its really easy to get a one up, you could literally get at least three lives per level. Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies off-screen, I like that, even if its a rip-off of Super Mario World. You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey, if you find it, it gives you an extra hit point, but you don't actually wear the mask it just follows you. If you get three masks without losing one, you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starmans in Super Mario Bros.

The boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes. But not all boxes are the same, there are boxes without question marks, arrow boxes that propel you in the air, boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere, checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them, whatever you do, don't spin attack them because they will immediately explode.

A strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups. Whats weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesnt let you rescue her for some odd reason, but whats even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password. I don't understand why early PlayStation games didn't allow you to save anytime you want. Every video game that can support a memory card should do that, I hate writing down passwords so I can continue. But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so its at least not a long and annoying password.

If you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes, youll get rewarded with a gem, this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates. Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach, much like the vine in Super Mario Bros.

Now while this game has some flaws, its still a good game overall, its not as good as the second and third game, but its definitely fun and enjoyable. The creativity is good, has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic. If you have a PlayStation Network account, give this game a chance, its only $6 on the PlayStation Store so its not expensive or anything. Its definitely a classic.

FINAL RATING:  8 out of 10",4.0
"The game plays great and my grandchild loves it. I have been playing with him, as I did my son. We love the game!!!",4.0
"This is one of my favorite games from the playstation series. When it first came out in 1996, needless to say I was blown away by the 3D directional jumping. It was my first playstation game. Of course there were some issues that I had with the game but it was the first of its kind and it paved the way for improvements. Some reviews have said how the game is hard. I agree to a point. I started playing it when I was in 5th grade and I still have a copy today but at that time it was a new concept to grasp playing a game with 3D controls versus simpler 2D controls from the Nintendo or Sega. But after a while and many Bandicoots being eaten, crushed, boiled in acid, drowning, or falling into dark abysses I came out on top. There are some levels that are still difficult for me (Lights Out for example) but I relish in the challenge it brings.

Too hard for young kids some people say? So was the original Mario Bros from 1985 at one point. Ignoring secret jumping techniques with turtle shells, lives were hard to come by and you definitely needed them for the later worlds. In Crash Bandicoot they practically give lives away because the levels are fairly challenging throughout the game. For example, Boulder Dash wiped out the 50 some lives I had accumulated the first time got to that level.

I agree with other people about the way that you save in that it is kind of annoying but we take that for granted today anyway. In prior games, like Mario 1985, if you got a game over it was back to the beginning of the world you died in. In this game, it's back to the last level you were at before you saved. Maybe the creators were trying to make it a challenging game by doing it that way. In that I say they succeeded.

For a platform gamer, this game has a nice blend of 3D motion with 2D side scrolling in a colorful environment that was pretty good visually for the graphics at the time. It definitely took you to a different world. The music for the various levels was appropriate and entertaining. Come on, remember Hog Wild? Good times riding that boar! It had a very linear type of progression but it was not too unlike Super Mario World with the coin shaped levels on the overworld map. The bonus rounds were indeed difficult but you could always replay them, minus the saving bonuses once you saved, and never lose lives in the bonus rounds. Aku aku was there in my time of need, especially when toxic barrels were bouncing my way. He is a different but unique take on the power ring or mushroom, flower, star buffs from the other iconic heroes. I am not saying Crash Bandicoot is better than other platform games before him, but he is unique and has his own style that improved in the titles that came after. I give this game a 9 out of 10 or 4.5 stars.",4.0
"Crash's 1st game (as I reviewed) is my favortie debut game, but his sequel blows me away.  There's one reviewer who says this is an improvement on the original with some sassy style.  They're %100 correct.  The game's best improvements and worst flaws are all I will list, because you already know where I stand if you've read my review on the 1st game (and go check it out if you haven't).

Best Improvement: Saving System.  This allows you to save at anytime, so you're not going to have to get off (becuase your parents said so, of course) without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over again.

2nd Best Improvement: You have 5 levels to choose from at anytime.  You don't have to go in order.

3rd Best Improvement: More moves.  Crash is looking good with all his new stunts.

4th Best Improvement: Vehicles.  Crash gets to drive some neato vehicles, including my favorite, the jet pack.

5th Best Improvement: Greater and better bosses, (including N. Gin).

6th Best Improvement: Bigger, Better, and More secret levels.

7th Best: New characters.  I'm lovin' the new addition of characters, including Coco Bandicoot, Crash's sister (whom I think should've been in the 1st game).

8th Best Improvement: It's easier to collect gems, and there's a new addition, crystals.

Worst Flaw: Well, it would be nice if Tawna hadn't suddenly disappeared.  I think she should've been crucial to the entrtie series, not just the 1st game.

2nd Worst Flaw: You can't revisit bosses without a secret code.  You should be able to revisit bosses without having to have to look for secret codes to do so.

So, those are all the improvements and flaws.  As you can see, better the the 1st game, by far.",4.0
"I am a Crash Bandicoot veteran. I've beaten every crash game out there, and I like the ones made by Naughty Dog. Anyway, I think Crash Bandicoot 2 is the best of all of the crash bandicoot adventure games I have played. The third one was good, but it was extremely difficult to beat some of the levels in the time trial tests. I'm looking at one and I say to myself:

2 minutes?! You've gotta be &!@$#*! me! ANYWAY, not to be sidetracked again, Crash Bandicoot 2 has some really good graphics for the playstation, and it really isn't that hard.

The only majorly difficult thing about it is, beating the game fully means getting all the gems, wich is really difficult. Some of the gems require smashing all of the crates in one level, and sometimes, some of the crates ends up being in a death gem part of the level. The one most difficult part of the game is, when you confront Cortex. Chasing somebody with jetpacs

in a tube in space sounds like an easy challenge, but, how about dodging explosives, and asteroids that slow you down a ton along the way? not to mention, you have to hit the big headed clown 3 times in a row before he gets to the end of the tunnel, or else you fail. But, beating all of these Crash games inspired me to go to the official Crash Bandicoot website, where the crazy people who made the crash games talk about it.

Here's  a funny Crash Bandicoot secret they do before every game is made, and I'm going to say it the exact way they did:

When the Naughty Dog team helps us with our Crash Bandicoot games, they have been seen walking out of their work rooms taking too many breaks. So we decided to lock them up in their room until they finish making the models in the game. Eating time has also been arranged accordingly so that they won't stay out of their room after they eat, so they go on what we like to call the flat diet. That means any food that can be shoved under a door. that's right. That includes pancakes, waffles, Hamburgers, (one layer at a time) and yes, chicken. But it tastes horrible after all of the pushing and shoving. They say they're really thirsty too. And that's all they said. My review rates Crash Bandicoot 2 a really good game,and I'm just now giving this review to prove that old games still can be good.",4.0
"This game is an improvemnet on the original, but Tawna should still be there, there should be a 2-player mode, and there should be a way to re-fight bosses, like a door that opens up when you get 5 crystals.  But the game's levels are better, the bosses are better, there's a secret world, and there's a much better save sytem with out any passwords at all, which is what I'm talkin' about when it comes to games!  The crystal improvement is good too.  I like this game better then the original, except for the problems above.",4.0
"not as good as Crash Bandicoot 2, but I'm still getting use to this one.

"This game is really fun. I love everything about it besides having to search the worlds sometimes to find all the levels, but it's part of the game and it does help add to when you defeat it.

"This game has everything the first part lacked. It has even better graphics. This was the first one of the crash series I tried, and it was fun. Before that, I was hooked on fighting games, like street fighters, and tekken, but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so. In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.
It is, more or less, like the first part. There is aku-aku, boxes to crash, gems (more difficult), new bosses after each floor. And by the by, this game is divided into 5 floors, each floor with 5 doors, each door with a different adventure. You can finish the game, like I did the first time, without collecting gems, but it is not that fun. Hint: If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem. There are hidden levels for some gems, you would have to consult the internet for it. Good luck in that.
In this part you can save after each level, it is easier in that respect. I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game. The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.
The story line is change a little bit. Instead of the ""Pamela Anderson"" of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky ""Meg Ryan"" of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.
There is also a sixth hidden floor. You would have to reach it by a trick, and again check the net for that.
The game was the best I have ever tried. It makes my life harder, since I cannot find better games to play anymore. It will make you look for other adventures of Crash.",4.0

Also the warp rooms are themed such as space,jungle,railroad, and more. Plus there are bosses,most of them from the first game. The only thing I didn't like was that the end where you have to fight Cortex, that was the easiest battle I ever did, all the other bosses were harder then that. over all I say Crash Bandicoot 2:The Wrath Of Cortex is a must buy for new to old gamers!",4.0

"""Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back"" was a large step up from the first part. This game's graphics, music, gameplay, and even story were much better than in the first. But it's kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot doesn't end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister, Coco Bandicoot. Well, at least Coco has the ability to speak, unlike her big brother. The voice acting changed dramatically as well, and for the better(Dr. Neo Cortex's new voice was much cooler and evil-sounding). If you liked the first Crash game, get this one. Although it's more difficult(especially in gathering Crystals and Gems), it's really fun!",4.0

"I remember when I first got this game with a Playstation console in early 1998. It was a great phenomenon then, because the Crash Bandicoot series was able to bring some new life to the platforming genre of gaming with its 2D and 3D interchangeable levels.

Crash must go through 25 levels and 6 bosses in this game, but unlike the later games in the series, Crash must tackle the levels chronologically by progressively going through 3 islands.

While the gameplay is fun and interesting, the game has its flaws as well. First off, you can only save when you either complete a bonus round (which can only be access one time in each level) or when you collect a gem for destroying every crate in the level. This gets frustrating, because in order to get each gem, you must complete the level and break the boxes without losing a life, plus the fact that colored gems are required to complete certain levels. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about the box gems just yet and just try to find the bonus in the newer level you are at if you want to call it a day. You may have to do the newer level again, which tends to be a flaw.

Despite this, I highly recommend this for fans of previous platforming games like Donkey Kong Country and Sonic the Hedgehog. While the series would improve, this is not a bad start.",4.0
"My brother loves Crash Bandicoot so much that he insisted that I borrow it and play it.  I somehow lost the game.  As I said, he absolutely loves the games so I had to find it and replace it.  He said that Bandicoot II is not as much fun.  Thanks to Amazon, I was able to find this game - that my brother so adores!",4.0
"This is a classic game that I come back to every now and again. The graphics are great and the content is really satisfying. But I do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the game.

1st island - The easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems. The hardest level here is Native Fortress.

2nd island - Slightly harder but still fun. The hardest level here is Sunset Vista.

3rd island - The most frustrating. I spent half an hour to beat Generator Room with Perfect and another half an hour with Toxic Waste. The hardest level here is Slippery Climb.

I don't get why a kid's game can get difficult to beat. I mean, I own mature games like Jak 2 and Oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison. If you are looking for a challenging game, this is your cup of tea. But if you want a kid's game that you can just glide through, I recommend Spyro.",4.0

"This  game disc was supposed to be an original, but the graphic is a grey picture on the silver disc. The original Spyro game had a colored disc. The game itself is operational. Only a few light scratches. No glitches have popped up. Have had it for few weeks.  It's not a bad game for kids because it doesn't have  the gruesome scary stuff a lot of games have.  It has challenging aspects to it.  You will probably want to tell your kids to close their eyes when the dragon statues change, because the flash of light is extremely bright & may not be good for eyes. Personally, I preferred the next Spyro games ""Ripto's Rage"" and ""Year of the Dragon"", which run smoother and you don't have to deal with huge light flashes. All the Sptro games after these start getting really dark and spooky/creepy.",4.0
"Crash Bandicoot's my favorite video game character and all his work is genius.  I'm looking forward to his latest video game installment, Crash Tag Team Racing.  The game's graphics are good, the gameplay itself sounds amuzing, and the trailer (on GameSpot) prove how visually stunning it's going to be too.  But, Crash's humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonic's were.  It was much better, more creative, and bigger.

Mario's was just an arcade game.  It was hard, but it didn't take to long to master it, and I don't even know if there was a boss.  Sonic's debut was better then Mario's.  A game you could play without spending money, good levels, challenging, better bosses, and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary.  But, these debuts lacked what Crash's had.  Most challenging, best bosses, better secret ending, and most of all, a 3-D world to play in.

Crash's world is not fully 3-D in this game (in fact up till Crash Twinsanity, none of them have been), but it is very good as far as it goes.  The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world.  That's one of the game's strongest points.  The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands.  This spoiled me.  I'd play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response.  I became versatile after a while though.  Crash lacks moves in this game, but he has more then Sonic and/or Mario had in their debut games.  Crash has 3, Mario and Soinc only had 1.  Crash's moves are running, jumping, and spinning.  The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing.  To make up for Sonic's spin, Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns.  Crash's spin is much easier to control and is much more effective.  It also doesn't threaten you in a strange, almost indescribable way.  Sonic's spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning.  Sega called this the spin dash.  This could throw you to your death.  Not Crash's.  Crash could move or stay still when spinning.  Note: Soinc didn't have the spin dash in his debut game.  Mario and Sonic's jumping, I'll admit, was better.  They were tighter then Crash.  Their direction could be changed much, much easier then Crash when jumping.  Crash jumps higher though.  Crash runs kind of slow, especially when you need to get something done. But he's slower in Crash Twinsanity.  Crash's camera control is hardly ever a problem.  Every once in a while you'll have to strain your eye a little, but it's still a better camera then Soinc's.  Mario's is best out of all, though, 'cause you could see the entire level all at once.

As for the other features of the game, they're pretty outstanding.  The levels are big and challenging.  There's also secret levels in Crash.  I've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, have you?  No, I didn't think so.  Crash's biggest flaw is the saving system.  In the game, you must collect 3 tokens of Crash's girfriend's head (hidden in the level) to get to a bonus area.  You must get to the end of the Tawna (Crash's girlfriend's name is Tawna) Bonus Round, touch Tawna (who's just standing there), and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save.  If you don't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save, you don't get to save. Not fair at all.  But, it's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, 'cause you can't save at all in those games.  There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game, The Cortex (main bad guy of the game) Bonus Rounds and the Brio (Cortex's right-hand man) Bonus Rounds.  You can't save in these bonus rounds, even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms.  Oh and get this, there aren't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels, so you don't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you're in a level like Hog Wild where there's no bonus rounds.  Big flaw.  The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems.  In the game you must collect 32 (I think; don't quote me on that number, because I'm not sure) gems in order to see the secret ending.  However, it's a little too hard to collect them all.  I understand most people think the game's not hard enough, but I think it's a little too hard.  To collect a gem, you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life.  I'm all for destroying every crate, but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem.  It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes.

So, if you're wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash, I'd say Crash all the way.  And, as you can see, if you're reading this, Crash's 1st game was much better then Mario and Sonic's.  I say Crash is best, no matter what anyone else tells me.",4.0
"I love Crash Bandicoot!  I favor him over Sonic the Hedgehog, and even Mario!  I think the Sonic games are fun, but they're also a little to mysterious and fast.  Mario's fun, but his games are too confusing and slightly boring, not to mention frustrating.  Crash Bandicoot's games are perfect.  There's only one or 2 problems with them.  I'll be writting a review on all the games to day, so I'll be listing the problems with these games.  For this one, the saving sucks and getting a gem is rediculous.  Now don't get me wrong, I love Crash Bandicoot games, but the saving needs improvement.  It's better then not being able to save at all, though, or forcing you to use passwords like SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom on GBA.  That was me who wrote that review on Battle for Bikini Bottom on GBA with all those ""ever""s.  You also shouldn't have to get through a levle without dying ot get a gem.  If you bust all the crates and you die on your way to the end, you should get the gem.  But, other then that, these games are my favorite.",4.0
"Alright, so I just used naughty for the play on the company name, but it got your attention, aparently, so...

This is the oldest Naughty Dog title I've played (as far as I know), however it has a lot of the issues which I've noticed from their games in the past.  Nasty difficulty spikes (the eight or so level should be closer to the end) and the 'one path to the end of a platformer' standard which Super Mario World truely broke when it came out take the one star out of this otherwise superb game.

While the graphics are fantastic for PS1, and moderate at worst for PS2, sometimes I find it hard to tell where, exactly, Crash is going to land.  Also this very much 3D platformer has 'side scrolling' sections where I become convinced that pressing down will make crash duck, not fall into a bottomless pit, water, or whatever else is in the foreground.  Saving can sometimes prove difficult, although, if you look in the right places, you can find a way to save after every significant area.  Also, often after completing certain difficult areas, you'll be able to do them again at any point you desire, good for getting the games bonuses.

I haven't finished the game yet (I'm only half way through), so anything in this review could change, although it's unlikely.  Most Naughty Dog games are consistantly good or bad in every way.

Anyway, the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening EVERY box in the level without losing a single life.  Others are given through bonus levels, etc.

A very great game for a great price.",4.0
"I tried the Crash 2 PlayStation game about 1998 and it was delightful. It was, in fact, so delightful that I looked around for the first part to start from the proper point.
When I started playing the first part, I was disappointed by the difference of the story, but, still, It was a nice game.
The graphics are excellent. The story is original. It speaks about a genetically engineered dog, named Crash, that resembles human beings. This genetic procedure was done by Dr Cortex (or more precisely by his degraded assistant). Then Dr Cortex goes on the produce a new female version of this Crash. Of course crash falls in love with her. Dr Cortex, being a wicked soul, parts between the two and then Crash needs to go through so many obstacles to reach his lover.
So many levels are divided into islands, and each set of levels is followed by a bad boss. Some are hard and some are easy. It depends in your skill in such games. The story is concluded by a battle between this Crash and Dr Cortex. If you win then you got it.
And to complicate life even more, the designers introduced the concept of gaining gems. If you get all the gems you can continue the game in a new fashion. I aint saying it 'cause I don't want to spoil things for you. To attain these gems is a difficult task. As for me, I got them but after being kicked in the teeth for it. You should not even dream of getting the gems in order of levels. No, mon ami, some times you have to go to a certain advanced level to get a ""green gem,"" for instance, to get the gem in the, say, fourth level. You would have to check the net for the tricks, dirty if I may, and the hidden places. Good luck in that.
There is ""aku-aku,"" which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies. Take 3 aku-akus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touch.
Of course, there are saving stations. You do not get to save after every level. This is a drawback. Saving stations are also level you have to jump, crush, step on dynamite, and so on. If you fall down, you cannot save, you have to go to the next saving station. It is hare, I am telling you.
The game is great, and if you win with a 100 per-cent then you are the man!

"This is definitely one of the best games you can find. Crash, a bandicoot as his name applies, is out to rescue his girlfriend Tawna from his arch nemesis, the evil Dr. Cortex. There are about 30 levels in the whole game to go through, in which range from extremely easy to almost impossible. The game is probably the hardest of all the Crash games, so anybody who wants a challenge is in for a treat. The graphics range. In some, the graphics will have you staring, and in some, you just plain will not be impressed, but I'm not saying anything about that. This game has a high amount of replay value as well, and for some levels you will need strategy. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the horrible save system.

"I got a great deal on this used PS1 game. My girlfriend plays this classic game and enjoys it a lot. She's not much of a gamer. The disc seems to be in great condition with no scratches and plays perfectly. There's a few tiny ""cracks"" within the inner ring of the disc, but this is common and DOES NOT affect the actual disc itself. It seems like an alright game to me, just not my style, which is why I gave it a 4/5. But a lot of people seem to like this game. It's a great kids game as well.",4.0

"Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system, the Playstation. Still, I have never grown tired of playing levels, which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack, the jungle is incredibly lush, and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder.",4.0
"This used to be my favorite game as a child, and one of my very first. I was so ecstatic to have it back in my collection after all these years. The shipping was incredibly fast; I got it within the week. As well, the quality of the CD is tiptop shape. There were small problems with the gameplay like sometimes the music would freeze, not play, or something else weird. However, I can't blame this on the seller. It's an old game, and I'm sure it's chocked up to early software game glitches.

Fabulous otherwise!",4.0

"This was a fun 3D platform adventure game.  Croc may look cute and easy to play but It was definitely challenging even for veteran video game players.  The game is very bright with colorful backgrounds, with lots of stomping and jumping on crates and boxes.  The boss fights were very well done and exciting.  The controls took a little bit of getting used to but the gameplay overall was responsive and fun.  The game is appropriate for all ages, and the bonus levels are fun and interesting.

The game does take some strategy and you have to be very quick in several parts of the game.  It is in the same spirit of the Mario 64 game but not as polished or well refined.  The camera angles do make it hard to maneuver Croc in some parts of the game which add to the challenge.  The replay value is pretty high.  I spent a lot of time playing this game trying to get the 100 percent to make it to the true boss of the game.  It provided hours of fun as well as a lot of frustration but overall it was a very rewarding experience.  The game should be fairly cheap now, the game had a battery pack save feature which saved your progress on the memory card.  If your looking for something a little bit different than Mario this is a nice game to try out.

Overall I would rate it a solid 4 stars its not a perfect platformer, but the game was made with a lot of care, the developers did a really good job.  Collecting all the Gobbos is fun but some of the stages will drive you nuts.",4.0
"This game has very good graphics and music, but it has some mistakes. Naughty Dog really goofed up on this game, like when you can only save on the Tawna Bonus Rounds-(how many times does that come up?!) You cant move very fast, and you aren't able to jump that far either. Finishing the hard levels can take a while, like Toxic Waste with bouncing barrels that you can't beat. It can be frusterating. It's fun, but it doesn't have as many powers as Crash Bandicoot 2 or Warped. They don't give you a lot of Wumpa Fruits in the hardest levels when you need them most to earn a life. You really have to work at this game, you just don't finish it in 2 days-(Unless you know secrets about the game or you put in the secret password.) All in all this is a cool game.",4.0
"Graphics: 8/10 - These are often stunning but at times a bit murky. Mostly they are really fabulous to look at, though, in every scene the makers of Crash have put in a lot of effort.
Sound: 7/10 - The animals could've made some more sounds but the creatures that talk do it clearly and well. Mostly the score is playing in the background so there isn't much sound to be heard.
Value: 9/10 - Value for money indeed! Once you've finished, you'll want to start all over again!
Overall: 8/10 - Great game with an excellent reputation. Crash 2 and 3 surpass it slightly, but this is still an easy-on-the-brain, fun and original idea.",4.0

"I love this game. Back when I was eight years old I got this on PC and played this game until it became muscle memory. Playing this on PS1 is even more fun thanks to the benefit of a controller.

I looked up reviews for this game and I was surprised to see it blasted by many reviewers. They claimed it was too easy or too hard and painfully awkward to control. That is not the case. It is actually a very smart game that teaches you how to play in the first level without a single word of dialog or a single segment of text.

My four year old cousin can pick this up and play it easily thanks to the intuitive design. The music is fun. The controls are smooth. And the game is just simply fun.

There is little completion bonus with only challenge maps and an extra boss as a reward. But the levels are fun an memorable. The volcanic levels, snow levels, desert levels, and castle levels are extremely fun and exciting.

Get this for young gamers or people who like playing platformer games.",4.0

Whatever happened to the days when games were made to be fun?  Whatever happened to the days where replay value was through the roof and graphics were not as heavily emphasized? This game is well over 10 years old now and it is still fun to play.  Even in this day and age I see kids enjoying it.  This should be one of those games that developers look back upon and say what made that game so much fun?  What can we learn from this aside from improving upon the old school 3D graphics?  Spyro may not be the best game of all time but it certainly is a fun one for me that I have had a lot of fond memories playing.,4.0

"I played Croc 2 more often, but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun, as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff, but this did release in 1997, so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple, but the game is fun nonetheless, and for me it's a pretty timeless classic, that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money.",4.0
"I'll recommend Spyro to anyone, fun enemies and worlds, and awesome concepts. Graphics aren't the best of course, but the gameplay is so addicting, collecting gems and freeing your fellow dragons. Must-have for a Playstation 1 collection.",4.0
"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She used to play this game all the time when she was a kid, so I figured I'd get her a new copy. She loved it. Now, I'm not so keen on platforming but I promised her I'd give it a shot. It's not terrible but the controls are poorly designed. The most fun I had was using the side step buttons to make Croc dance, which is freaking adorable and hilarious. Side step animation is perhaps the single best reason to play it, unless you're into kinda bad, old platformers. As I said, I'm not a platformer guy. She loved it though, so if platformers are your thing and you don't mind super retro design, give it a shot.",4.0
"Never having played a spyro game before, I figured I'd start with the first one which I downloaded off the Playstation Network on PS3.  At first I was turned off by the camera control and graphics, but once I realized how fun the game was, it was no longer a problem.  I did everything in the game for 120% in a matter of days, as I found it to be very addicting.

The gameplay consists of exploring a few hub worlds which are connected to various levels where you must free dragons, collect diamonds and defeat the bad guys.  Some levels include full flight, which adds some much needed variety to the core gameplay.  The boss battles were the weakest part, as they didn't really stand out and were pretty tame.  Games nowadays are so complex that it was a pleasure to play something so simple.  Running around colorful worlds, collecting multi-colored diamonds and discovering secret areas are always a good time, and Spyro is the purest form of these ideas.

The simplicity of the gameplay combined with the variety in worlds/levels ensured it never got boring.  Just pure light hearted fun!",4.0

"The game is very entertaining and fun to play. Unfortunately it froze after I reached a certain level. Even after I started a new game, when I came back to that same level, it froze again. I am in the middle of a complaint with the shipper. Hopefully it can be solved amicably.",4.0
"I missed the old 90's platformers so I got this used for $5.00. No complaints as far as the game's entertainment value or condition. However I have gotten rather spoiled from today's platformers like the LBP series. Man I started playing and got instantly pissed off at having to turn Croc in the direction he was going before moving him forward. As mentioned in previous comments the most annoying part is having to dodge enemies  or having to time your jumps almost perfectly in a few of the mini games with these old digital controls. You better practice shifting from left to right in mid-air if you want to find all those gobbos.

To be a bit more specific about the controls you can move the camera using the R2 and L2 buttons. You can't see all around you but it helps a lot sometimes when you need a better view of what's ahead. If you want to make a perfect 180 degree turn just hit the circle button. Use L1 and R1 for small side steps left and right.

 (SPOILER BELOW)
Lol I guess you can say I cheated a bit. One reviewer mentioned the wac-a-sheep challenge being annoying. Well annoying it may be but it's nothing compared to the cauldron challenge in the ""Dungeon of Defright"" level. Ugh just thinking of that level makes me want to throw that black pot in a pit of lava. Basically it's a lot like the sheep challenge only jewels are falling from the sky and you need to catch them in the cauldron. You have to catch a total of 38 items including 2 hearts and a gobbo. If you miss even one you have to move on to the next part of the dungeon without rescuing the gobbo. I had succeeded in this once and only ONCE, only for me to fail the wac-a-reaper challenge (which I could pass easily) and still be stuck with only 5 mf gobbos. Can you say Irony? Well I don't have the kind of time I did as a kid. Fortunately I accidently found a way around this.

The first challenge in the level is one where you have three boxes and you have to guess which box the gobbo is under after they get switched around. Here's what you do: be sure to have stocked up on lives before starting the level. Guess the correct box, grab the gobbo, and let the dantini kill you. When you reaper the lil fuzzball will be right in front of you, box free. Grab it again and keep letting the dantini kill you until you're sure you'll have at least six by the end of the level. Complete the level and viola, you can save as many gobbos as you want and you'll be allowed to get the jigsaw piece from the first secret level of Dante's castle.
 Overall I enjoyed the game a lot. I never finished it as a kid so 12 years later here I am. It felt good to finally rescue all the lonely gobbos and finally give poor cute lil Croc a breather. Getting to 100 percent wasn't terribly difficult, and the bosses were RIDICULOUSLY easy. I guess that was they're way of making up for the annoying controls.  Don't worry though. If we could do this when we were kids we can do it 2 diplomas and several much more difficult games later.",4.0

Its easy to go thru the menues but difficult to master the systems. This game is only for strategy freak like me who love a challenge if your looking for action, graphics, or storyline don't bother. The price is right though, but Romance of the three kingdoms, nectaris, or command @ conquer, or even panzer or allied general have a little more to offer.",4.0
"A fairly faithful adaptation of the classic computer game.  Players start the game as one of a number of civilizations and attempt to grow and survive until they have wiped out the other civilizations or colonized another planet.
Players build new settlements and then build different buildings and military units to help their civilization grow.  Combat, diplomacy, and civil engineering all combine for fascinating gameplay.
My only real problem with the console conversion is that the main graphics are rather clumsy looking while most of the incidental graphics are taken straight from the original game.  The game controls are also clumsier than they need to be.  Obviously a game controller is more limited than a full keyboard, but I don't think the controller is used to full advantage.  The controls mean that the length of a game is longer than in the PC version.
Although a little slower and clumsier than the original version, this is still an enthralling game with a very high level of replayability.",4.0

"Spyro the Dragon: the game that SHOULD have been Sony's mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot.

The original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platform/adventure game you can find for the Playstation.  I can't give Spyro's first adventure a 5-star rating, though.  Let's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro (and believe me, there's a LOT of good things about this game).

People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else.  Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games.  In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game.  Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me.  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning.  I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.

Spyro's debut does have a few problems, though.  Seeing as how this is Spyro's very first adventure I won't be TOO harsh.  Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better?  It's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro.  Well, to be honest, I DID have trouble controlling him at first.  Spyro doesn't QUITE take off when you hit up, down, left or right on the directional pad.  There's a split second delay before moving forward.  Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since, after all, you're moving a DRAGON.  A BIG creature like a dragon won't move forward right away.  Then again, Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue.

Controlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first.  For example, attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task.  I kept sliding off.  By the way, I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller.  Master the controller before exploring the world.  This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future.

I have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles.  Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games, you have to admit it isn't flawless either.  If you hit Pause and go to the options, you will see an option for a second camera view called ""active"".  This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times.  The other (default) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you're moving, and you can't get a good view of what lies ahead.  You may want to change it to ""active"" if the other camera view is difficult for you.  Thank goodness for this option!

Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge.  While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump.  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it.  Many times you will fall to your death.  Be patient, though.  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps.  Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it.  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family.  Good work.

The biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss.  He's really easy to beat, however, GETTING to him is a whole other story.  You see, right at the very end before you face him, you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall (and you WILL fall the first few times because it's hard) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again.  Not that the stage is really that long anyway, but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game.  The other 99% of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there.

With that said, don't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One.  It DOES get harder.  You see, many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head, or shooting fire at them.  You won't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment.  You also have to dodge fireballs, sword-swipes, dogs jumping at you, and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them.  So it's not pathetically easy after all.

A minor complaint is that sometimes while you're walking or running, the path will suddenly end, and you'll fall to your death.  Doesn't happen often, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.

I hate the way Spyro talks.  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice.  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like.  Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to.  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them!  For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide.  Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide!  So I didn't NEED his help!  This happens a few times during the game.  You just want to scream ""Thanks for nothing, bonehead!""

The music was done by a member of the rock band the Police, Stewart Copeland.  People may not realize it, but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band.  Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police, specifically the songs ""walking on the moon"" and ""message in a bottle"".  You'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs.  The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you're in.  No complaints.  The music is fantastic.

I think the creators made a mistake.  When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise, and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise.  It should be the other way around.  Another thing that needs reversed: the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages.  When you press up, you fly down.  When you press down, you fly up!  Strange mistake.  This makes it harder to complete the flying stages, however, you don't have to finish them.

In fact, despite what people may tell you, you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons.  Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game.  The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi's Island- you don't have to find everything, but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score.  The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons, increasing the challenge.  More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it.  It's fun to run around and think about how to reach it.  Some of them are cleverly located.  One word to describe it- *awesome*

Anyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on.  Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game, and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today.",4.0

"The is the first Spyro game and it paved the road for all the other Spyro games. The story: When the evil Nasty Norc turns all of the dragons into statues, it's up to Spyro, a small purple dragon, to set them free and defeat Nasty Norc. You travel with Sparx, your dragonfly companion and also your health gage, as you collect gems and go through six gigantic worlds with over 25 levels in all. This game is great, although it's not very challenging, it offers hour of entertainment. My favorite world is the Beast Makers world. It's a creepy place and almost all the levels in it take place at nighttime, which to me is the best type of level in Spyro. My favorite is Tree Tops because it is a gigantic level that gives you that creepy feeling, even the music is creepy in it's own way. Another minor flaw in this game is that it has no mini-games in it. Those always provide extracurricular fun, but I'm happy to say that they are introduced in a later Spyro release. I'd recommend this game today if you don't already have it. If you not into Spyro, this is the place to start at.",4.0
"That said, the game is really fun. Not too hard that you rent it and after a while throw the controller down in frusteration-not too easy that you breeze through it.

"I love this game.  The characters are cute, they make great noises, and there are lots of worlds to explore.  It's really hard to die too, so you could concievably play without a memory card.  What I don't like about it is that Spyro is a little hard to control compared to today's games, and a lot of parts are highly frustrating.  Thieves have stolen a bunch of dragon eggs and you have to chase them down and get the eggs back, but this is MUCH easier said than done.  I have spent hours chasing these guys on some levels.  I mean, I wouldn't want the game to be too easy, but this is borderline ridiculous.  But it's still a really great game and I absolutely fell in love with it.  I'd recomend it to people who love cute things and have infinite patience.",4.0

"I own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made. I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges. Some good things about it is that this is the only Spyro game where you free the dragons. In the rest of the games, you help other people... It is funny and very interesting. ( Sorry, but I won't give the funny parts away. )
The disadvanges is that you can't swim. In the other to games you can but in this game, if you touch the water you will die!!
Another bad thing is that they don't have the cute characters like the other two games. I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1. I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line. I even think Spyro has a better voice. If you like all three Spyro's, try buying the Spyro pack. It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly. Then you can decide which one is better!!",4.0
"Spyro the Dragon is a pretty fun game but it's really hard. You have to beat a number of different enemies, including these guys who strike you with lightning if you get too close to them and these fat ladies who stand by these big pots and whip you if you get too close to them.  You have to find about a million gems that are hidden in all different kinds of containers, which take a few minutes to figure out how to open. Plus, each world has a bonus world and you have to beat the boss of the world, fighting more enemies that have never been seen before, and you have to get even more gems. Also, there are a whole bunch of secret codes that you have to get in order to progress in the game. The worlds are very small and hard to figure out if you haven't played the game before, and it gets really frustrating, especially for younger children. If you are considering buying a Spyro game, I would recommend buying Spyro: Year of the Dragon, because it is much more fun....",4.0

Sure, the graphics are a bit outdated (or a lot outdated), but the gameplay is still classic and I highly recommend it.

If you just played Resident Evil 5 (which as of this post is the newest resident evil) I would caution you that it plays extremely differently.  The game is viewed from a third person perspective, the controls aren't even close to being as fluid (though they are a step up from the original Resident Evil), and it has a much larger emphasis on survival horror, where as RE5 to me plays out more like an action movie than a survival horror (or even zombie, for that matter) movie.  Not to be hating on RE5, its an entertaining game (even my wife enjoys playing it with me), but RE2 is much different.

Darker corners, scarier enemies, and more complicated puzzles are just the beggining of what you can expect.  With huge replayability value (given 6 different games!) this will certaintly keep you entertained for longer than your average PS3 or XBOX360 game would.  Players can choose between Leon or Claire.  Both have slightly different perspectives as to the events in Racoon City, and after completing the game with one I loved playing through as the other character, seeing where there paths cross.  After completing the game with both characters you can play the Second Scenario for both characters, adding even more hours of scares and thrills to your experience.  Finally, under certain conditions, you can unlock two bonus games.  While i won't go into detail about them, i'll just say that one features Hunk and the other Tofu.  If you've played this game before and are going back to it again, you may know what i'm refering to.

At the time this was absolutely groundbreaking.  The character voice acting is a little weak, as other reviews have stated, but the plot twists and turns and makes up for whatever other flaws you may encounter.

STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!!",4.0
"This is a worthy sequel to the classic horror game Resident Evil. With improved gameplay mechanics,an improved graphics engine,a plethora of locales to explore(as oposed to RE1's single location), and most of all the A&B scenario that depicts the games events from both characters perspectives. Put all this together and that makes RE2 technically superior to it's predecessor. This game has it all but it is more action oriented than the first RE which also makes it less scary. Sorry RE2 you'll always be second to your big brother. Anyone wanna pick it up and prove me wrong?It'll be worth every penny!",4.0
"My first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code: Veronica X.  I was severely disappointed overall with it, and from what I've read, the whole series is the same, so I had little to no faith in it.  I didn't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games, and openly spoke out against the series, even though I only played one game.  But, after playing Resident Evil 4, I got intrigued by the story, so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3.  I thought, ""There's no way they can be worse than Code: Veronica, so why not?""  And good god... was I right.

Although the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke (thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code: Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance), that wasn't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture, the second iteration really blew me away.  Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I don't care at all about graphics in a videogame, so I'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant (which is why I'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan).  The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving, adventure, exploration, and combat to keep the interest level up.  That's what I like about survival horror: it's not just about fighting to stay alive, but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances.  And, while Resident Evil 2 isn't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series, it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre, and I highly recommend it.  The first one you can play on your own; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him, and vice versa.  The reason the title of my review is ""I was wrong..."" is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone's time.  So, I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk.

But, there is one issue I just can't stop from addressing: the controversy over the control scheme.  Now, I won't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody, but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view.  The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way.  This is a genre for puzzle solving, plotlines, exploration, and thought, not just about shooting things.  They made the controls this way to render it, in a way, a sort of ""anti-action"" type of game genre.  Still, though, once you get used to the controls, like me, you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough.

Another thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their... ""creative"" death sequences (okay, so maybe they die a second time, but this time for good).  Naturally, you can blow their heads off, but even more possibilities await your execution.  Sometimes, you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets, or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half, the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you.  When you upgrade your shotgun later on, you can actually blow their chest in half!  And, with a rocket launcher, if you fire at them square in their torso, their arms, head, and a good portion of their upper body will be gone.  If you hit them to the right side, most of said side will be gone, as will their head and respective arm, yet their left arm will still be attached.  Pretty cool, huh?  Code: Veronica X didn't have anything like that, which is rather too bad.

The only problem I had with this game, and it really isn't a problem with the game itself, is that it really made me shake my head at Code: Veronica X.  It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities.  Heck, even the first Resident Evil is better than REC:VX.  For example, in the first one, the hunters had narrow, sharp, reptilian eyes, rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths, and they looked pretty scary, but in Code: Veronica, they didn't have such teeth (it almost looked like they didn't have any at all), and they also had small, beady eyes, making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy.

Yet another good part about this game is the Titan.  I must say, he is really one heck of a bad guy.  But, of course, he's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head.  But he's cool nonetheless.

So, in conclusion, if you like survival horror games, then I suggest you try this one out.  But don't expect it to be better than Silent Hill, if you're a fan of that series (just as a side note).",4.0
"Resident Evil 2 - Circa 1998

GOOD:

- An upgrade over the original, which was considered a great game

- Considered classic to many gamers

- Good story, with twists and turns

BAD:

- Graphics look very dated

- Voice acting is not that great

- Controls feel dated

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- Slow moving ""survival horror"" game, which is more about moving boxes, managing items, and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life

- A Sc-Fi horror game set in a city over run with zombies, huge snakes, and all types of creatures

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Dino Crisis

- Silent Hill

- Alone in the dark

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is a remake of this game for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Game Cube both of which don't really upgrade anything

- The male playable character (Leon) is also the star of Resident Evil 4

- Beating the game in a certain way can unlock two new characters ""Hunk"" and ""Tofu""

- There was a rumor that you could unlock Akuma from Street Fighter Alpha as a playable character, but that is not true

- In Japan Resident Evil 2 is called Biohazard 2",4.0
"Resident Evil 2 was one of the best Psx games back in the mid 90's as it had exclusive rights to Sony.  The game was the sequal to one of the best Survival Horror game ever.  Does this do better then its prediseccor?...YES.  OH HELL YES.  The game is a solid good game.  The story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story.  I won't spoil the story for you but the game is 2 discs and you control 2 characters(serpartly) in the game.  One is a cop named Leon Kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother Chris(who was in RE1)and the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure out..

I really enjoyed this game, it was fantastic.  I loved the graphics for this game it was just ""wow"".  The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as.  They both have 2 parts(kina).  Once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character.  The game is fairly lenghy if you play the WHOLE game.  The game has some great twists that'll keep you up all night.  Lemmi make it easier for you...Resident Evil 2 was one of the coolest Playstation games ever.  It had an awesome story line, sweet graphics and decent dialoug.  It is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game.  In other words the game is awesome and scary.

The graphics for that time were just great and comparable to Metal Gear Solid.  The character model for Leon and Clair was amazing and the zombies looked even more creepy then before, not to mention the bloody gore in this game....jeez.  Capcom did a great job making the graphics.  kudose..

The gameplay is what really made me love this game.  Gun n' down zombies and solving puzzle...my type of game baby.  The Puzzle are not that hard but they are pretty cool.  The gameplay never gets boring and the boss fights are really cool.  The gameplay may turn some off in the beggining.  Mainly cause it's just runing away from zombies but later on that will change...trust me..

The sound is incredible!  The zombies sound so realistic and the music for the boss fights are magnifecent(my spelling sucks I know).  The sound it self deserves a one star...

What turned me off was the ""kina cheezy sci fi"" story.  It didn't have the same spooky feeling Resident Evil 1 had in story...which causes me to take off one star...Well yeah it was a stupid move just for that but hey that's my opinion...

The games has amazing graphics, great sound, lots of awesome gameplay and is one of my favorite video game series.  Not only that it may possibly be the best in the series if not then It's 3.

This game deserves a

4.8 out 5....

Resident Evil series is a superb series and anyone who loves survival horror will love it.  I personaly think it's one of the best gaming series out but I don't have ALL the resident Evil games.. The only ones I have are the one that go with the story like the ones I have are

And for any newbie out there who is trying to get into the series, if you have a gamecube and get the remake of the original and start with that...then 2, 3 then Resident Evil zero which is a really enjoyable Resident Evil game...Well

Lates..",4.0
"I don't recommend this game to young children. First, the motion of enemy creatures such as zombies is so realistic that children can't enjoy them. Second, solving tasks is often difficult. Children can't find the key to solve it. Finally, the story is very confusing with respect to human relationships and time-line. Children can't follow them. Therefore, this game is too hard for young children to play alone.",4.0
"I rented this game when it first game out, I was scared out of my mind. Everything made me jump, now I have sort of gotten over that, I am 15 and although the music and sound(zombie moaning and feet stepping) creates this scary atmosphere, it is not THAT scary. Most of you can handle it.
Anyways, I needed a strategy guide for some of it. It just, it just is unrealistic. Yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin? Why was the crank removed in the first place. ""We need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort, this hose we have hooked up, will release some water."" Yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling, so just incase a helicopter crashed under it, or there was a mass fire under it, the hose would put it out. Yea right. Ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies won't attack you? If the police were fighting, they should of closed these shutters beforehand, so less zombies came in. Instead, they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away. Wanna get into that room? You need the crest and key and plugs buddy! How did the police actually get around this police station.
Moving off of that, the game is alright. You have alot of ammo on easy, although I fear I will run out alot of the time, I usually find a pack or 2 to keep me going. The zombies themselves can take quite alot, like 5 hits to kill them. However once you get the pistol modification for Leon, they become a whole lot easier. The story is nice. 2 people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such. Theres alot of other characters though, you aren't the last 2 humans alive in the city. The game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits, finishes great. It starts randomly, but then ends where it should. It succeeds in making a good game. Good story, some action, you get to kill some of those evil zombies, and good package.",4.0
"It's quite a shame if you still have not picked up this amazing game. It delivers what gaming is ultimatley about, Pure Joy. I can still remember walking into the interrogation room, not knowing what would come next, and seeing my little sister laughing at me because I had just screamed like her. Wow. Memories. Anyway this game delivers action, suspense and an intriguing story.
  If you are used to Resident Evils sluggish and akward control scheme than you should be fine, but for you new guys/girls (don't worry we all were once), this is probably going to be a little annoying. If you can look past these controls (It might take a while) than what are you waiting for. Drop it into the Cart and Order. This will soon be a very
hard-to-find classic. Jump on the opprotunity.",4.0
"I played this before I played the original Resident Evil. I had just barely gotten the Playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff. Originally I hated this game because I couldn't figure out how to play it. I had been a Nintendan with occasional defects to Sega (I own a Genisis) so I was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for Playstation games. I didn't understand the pivoting, nor did I grasp the concept of holding R-1 to aim and X to shoot. I got frusterated and set it aside. However, my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen. (Yes I got killed right away.) I watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first Licker. He begged me to buy it. So I did. After a while I decided to give it another try, and once I got used to the control style I beat it. I have played this this Resident Evil, and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version. I have also bought this one the most times trying to get the ""ultimate edition"" and eventually got tired of it and bought the Dual Shock Greatest Hits version after the N64 version's FMV sequences were so terrible. Although I will not buy the forthcomming GameCube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original, I still recomend RE 2 as the most fun of the series. If for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up. GameCube owners, I recomend waiting for the GCN version as it is supposed to have all of the various enhancements that all of the various versions of this game had, including the much desired analog control the N64 version featured.",4.0
"My experience with RE2 was not as great as with RE and RE3.  It is still a fun game and if you're a big Resident Evil fan I would buy it.  If you're just getting into the series I would reccomend trying RE or Nemesis.  I thought there was alot of slow time in the game and not enough shooting! But when there is shooting, your guns are rather weak on the zombies.  All in all its a good game but I liked the other two better.",4.0

"*The title is a quote from the final boss, Andross*

A more accurate rating for this game, overall, is really 4.5 stars; but, of course, Amazon won't let you grade in ""half stars.""  A true masterpiece, Starfox 64 stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the Nintendo 64, and perhaps even all time.  I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title; and, though I'm normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this, this game succeeded in impressing!  Analyzing its features step by step, it's pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldn't be loved:

Storyline 10/10: The story is absolutely captivating!  Though it starts out pretty simple and generic (the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom, someone save us, etc.) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed, the intro is epic, and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing!  Actually, YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree: you can pretty much decide, through skill and/or choice, whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team, a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate.  You control Fox McCloud, and only Fox McCloud, but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy, Slippy, and Falco; why, just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes!  This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what's happening.

Characters 9/10: I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters: they make the game!  Even on your own crew, each one is distinctive: Falco, for example, plays along the lines of ""the tough guy with a secretly caring heart.""  Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type, and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy.  Finally, Fox, the same character you control, often takes on a reserved leadership role (which makes sense).  Each one has his own quirks; and, though any of them can be annoying on a certain level, you can't help but feel a degree of liking for each of them.  Their lines, though perhaps epic for the time, can be somewhat cheesy and/or cliche (Peppy's, ""It's Quiet . . . too quiet."" is a good example); but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and light-hearted game.  You often can't help but think, ""I shouldn't be laughing at this,"" but you'll laugh anyway.  It's just that kind of game.  The A.I. of each character on maneuvering is decent; but, until you get skilled enough, it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them, as they get in your way at the oddest times (then fuss at you when you do hit them).  Peppy occasionally gives advice that doesn't particularly help either, though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it.  Speaking of advice, though, the game can make you depend on your characters if you're newer at it, as they can each do something useful: Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot, Slippy analyzes boss health meters, and Falco often covers you.  If someone gets shot down, you'll miss him.  Finally, the characters are also pretty life-like in behavior: try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels, and listen to his reaction to it.

Graphics 9/10: Some issues with fog (common for Nintendo 64 games), but otherwise absolutely beautiful.  The fog itself, even, can be justified, as you spend most of your time in the air.  Though many stages take either a purely generic ""spacial"" theme, such as the asteroid field, the planets are really intuitive.  In this game you can find a volcanic environment, which even mimics the ""wavy"" effects of heat, an ocean environment (full of fish and plant life), a couple of cities, a train depot . . . the works!  The most interesting graphics you could see, however, has to be the part of the asteroid field you can ""warp"" to.  Though it probably looks like you've taken a medication or something else you shouldn't have, you can't deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level. . . . Please note, however, that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take; like the story, it's dependent upon your actions in the levels.

Mechanics 9/10: This covers things like controls, ability to save, and learning curve (whether it's easy or hard to master).  The controls, though they work well, are pretty complicated to learn.  This complication, however, is eased by the nice training mode they threw in; a few rounds in training mode, and you'll pretty much have them down!  The game can still be pretty tough to a degree, though; however, I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds (and I'm usually not too hot at games like this), before the Star Wolf team finished me off (they're pretty tough if you don't know how to handle them right).  Make sure to master the somersault maneuver; I've never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one!  In terms of saving, I was disappointed: there's no way to save; and, unlike what some people say, there's no password feature either.  You'll probably get sick of the first level for that reason.  While it's not a deal breaker, this game isn't for the busy person who's looking to play for only an hour or less and quit.  If you want to experience the true value of this game, you'd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it.  The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score, as I kept catching myself thinking, ""This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature!""

Music and Sound 10/10: No complaints in the music and sound department!  It pretty much captures the mood, be it suspenseful, hopeful, dramatic, or even rewarding.  The character voices are also well done, awesomely portraying the character personalities as well.  I can't describe any of this justly, though; you'll have to listen for yourself!

Conclusion: Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection, if only a few small blemishes hadn't reared their ugly heads.  Multiplayer, I hear, is lacking; but, overall, none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers.  Personally, I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands; the replay value is great with its various paths!  The final boss can be downright creepy, and . . . well, I think any critique could easily go on forever!  Long story short, this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it's at now.  A fond memory in many gamers hearts, this Star Fox 64 still remains as a highly recommended game to play!",4.0

As with the first there is no save option but it is still fun to see how far you get in this game. Its nice and challenging its just a drag there is no continue or save option here. You can get extra lives though. Like most games it gets easier the more you play it. The graphics are superb and the music is very good too. I just recommend you get the first Star Fox cause that game is longer. You should still get this though.,4.0
At first I thought this game [stunk] cause there was no save feature but there is a password feature and you can use other people's passwords to start out on whatever level you feel. Cheating has never looked so good! There are great graphics and action and the gameplay is very straightforward. All in all it deserves an A -. A great gift to receive in September.,4.0
"In 1997, Nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry. The Nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a CD-ROM gaming system was able to do, a cartridged based gaming system could do better. That June, the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox 64. The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo's Rumple Pak, a force-feedback device that let's players feel each and every vibration at hand.
In the game, you play Fox McCloud, a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross, a inane, mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system. There are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game, alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to Andross. The graphics are so realistic and full of promise, that you see the game so vividly, you feel like you're a part of it. In Starfox 64, you also have the use of 3 different vehicles, depending on your course, Arwing, Landmaster Tank, or the Blue Marine sub, only used in the Aquas sea level. The game also has a fierce battle level, for up to 4 players, where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders, Peppy, Falco, and Slippy.
It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game, the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64. The game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat. While Nintendo stopped releasing the Rumble Pak with the game nearly six months later, Starfox 64 is still truly a Nintendo gamer's paradise.",4.0

"The whole idea of this game sounds very familiar...banished evil scientists comes back to take his tolls.  It may not sound interesting now but the gameplay and the great speed and graphics really makes you wander how this was one of the first games to come out for N64.  You start out on a beautifulplanet that has been just recently ripped from war.  You begin to fight your way through as Fox with your trustworthy companions slippy, falco, and peppy.  You continue to fight your way through with many different outcomes dipending on your accomplishments at each mission.  Overall this game is very fun but lacks the long gameplay some may like.",4.0
"The mario party series (this game, MP2, and MP3) are all great fun multiplayer games for N64. The only drawback (which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5) for this game is games that require you to spin the joystick really fast can really hurt your hand. Nintendo was sued because of this and they handed out free gloves as a settlement to anyone who owns the game to wear when they play. THIS IS A GREAT GAME!!!",4.0
"When i first played this game last Christmas, for the first time, i thought ""oh my goodness, how do you play this! ""...this is a  mario game but at that time i wasn't feeling too well and the strange  appearance of the game made my head spin.
As a result, i played tomb  Raider:TLR insetad. Happy to tell you that today, i'd rather play this game  than Tomb Raider.
Well, it's like a board game but much more fun. Lot's  of minigames, lots of chances to shout and swear (not that i'm telling you  to) but it's all good-natured fun.
The characters look kind of silly (esp  Yoshi and Peach who look like circus rejects)but i don't think the purpose  of playing a mario game (or any decent video game) is to see hunks and  babes.
However, this game falls short of Mario Kart replay glory 'cause  the formula can get tired at times.
But if you want a solid first-party  party game, then this is it. I haven't played GoldenEye 007 or Perfect  Dark yet- so as far as pure multiplayer mania is concerned, this is number  2 next to Mario kart 64.
Yes, it's that good.",4.0
"This game is pretty cool, but after a few days it got a little boring, even thow it is probaly the best snowboarding game ever. I think every thing is good except the tricks!

"Unlike some other reviewers I actually found that this game was enjoyable. The only complaint I have is that the graphics looked like they belonged to a Super Nintendo. Besides that the game is awesome.
 The basic outline of the game is that you race the USA from California to Washington DC. Each level gets harder as you pass along but not to worry. Once you get the hang of the game you will beat the level after a few tries. Each time you complete the whole entire racee (California to D.C.) you will earn a faster car.
 So, all in all Crus n' USA is a pretty enjoyable game. Buy and enjoy.

"Prefer Mario Party 2 and 3 but as a fan, it is still quite fun to play of how it all started. As someone who started with Mario Party 2, this was a fun experience and to add to my N64 collection. No items and the random variations of item blocks (plus, minus, speed, slow, warp, bonus) made each start of the turn a surprise. Don't like the use of the rotation of the joystick for some minigames, but this seems like a faster game than the sequels. Also what was unique to the original is the host, Koopa, as he gave you coins for making your way back to START, just like Monopoly. Overall, I really enjoyed this game.",4.0

"CRUIS'N USA is my favorite racer on the n64. Is it the best one? Far from it, nobody has ever said Cruis'n USA was the best anything. What it is, however, is an extremely fun cooperative racing game that is substance friendly and absolutely ridiculous. Ever want to see Mt. Rushmore and the Grand Canyon in one two minute race? You can in Cruis'n USA. Ever want to knock down a redwood with nothing but the power of an indestructible generic branded car? You can in Cruis'n USA. Ever want to floor it straight into a crowd of half-naked cheering bitmap people? Cruis'n USA has got you.

The drive across America gimmick is a bit poorly managed. There's a glut of California tracks, after which the game seems to be running out of ideas. The highlight is ""Two Player Challenge!"", which is little more than a two player version of the Cruise the USA mode. This is like doing a Mario Kart GP with a friend, except you absolutely cannot advance unless you get first place. Two player helps this by turning Cruis'n into a competitive cooperative game. One person can try to cause traffic jams and the like by driving into traffic, other cars, etc. and creating a traffic jam while the other zooms into first. The traffic is one of this game's best features, and really is what elevates it into an amazing time with a friend. The collision detection is absolutely random, but this makes every colision, whether with a family sedan or a firetruck, a game of chance. Sometimes they'll go spinning above you and land right on their wheels. Sometimes you'll spin out. Sometimes you'll just kind of shove each other.

You know what, never mind what I said about Crus'n USA not being the best anything.",4.0

"The first of the Mario Party games!

It really is an awesome game. I only played it at a friend's house as a child really, so now, many years later, I finally decided to get it for myself, along with 2 and 3. The n64 games are classic.
I really only play it by myself, but it is so much funner to play with friends. You can get so angry when someone steals your star. This is how you get in fights with your friends.
The mini games are fun, not as fun as 2 and 3 though.
Never going to regret buying this game :)",4.0

"I'll be doing the Mario Party games next and besides this one and 9, I have the entire series. 1 is the first one I played and still the one I hold very highly as one of the best ones in the series.

The plot is very generic. Toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin. The original Mario Party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck. I might even add that some mini games like the tug-o-war required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand. Yeah some of the mini-games are brutal. On the plus side, there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didn't see that until Mario Party 9 with the boss battle.

The game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the character's personalities through the stages. This game kind of set up Peach's obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers. The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle. I love how whoever gets 4th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while 1st player achieves the mission needed.

Overall, a good start for the series, but good luck finding this game. This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high prices.",4.0

"this game is kind of long to complete, but it's a fun game. don't mean to be a spoiler if you didn't play the game, but when you go play the boards and unlock the minigames, when you want to play the minigames at minigame place, you have to buy them first w/ a certain ammount of coins, or pay 10 coins to give it a try, but you didn't really buy it. if you say it's boring, fun,or anything else, feel free to leave a comment.",4.0
"This is a great game.  I played it a lot growing up and it's been great to get to relive that time.  It's enjoyable because its like getting out a board game with your friends, only it includes exciting new twists. I definitely plan on collecting the successive Mario Partys as well!",4.0

This game came out before gran tourismo, need for speed,and midnight club. Crusin usa is weak compared to todays games but was awsome when it first came out. Those who had fun playing this game when they were a kid will buy this game. If you want great graphics, sound, and more subtance don't buy this game. I think its good and very fun.",4.0

"I've had this game basically since it launched in 2000. I must say, the graphics are rather impressive for an N64 game, and the gameplay is great. The minigames are fun, especially when playing with other people. The only real problem I had with this game is how it didn't last long at all. It has about 100-150 mini games, but you can easily beat the game and unlock them all within about a week of good playing time.",4.0
This game is everything I expected it to be...which is what you would want when buying something online,4.0
"The days when people said, ""We're having a Party, A Mario Party...""  Seems to be long past.  When this game first came out, it seemed to be the only thing people talked about.  Yet today, with 5 Mario Parties in the collection, this one still is wonderful for being the base roots.
Just like any of the other Mario Parties, you choose which character you'd like to be, Mario, Luigi, ect.  The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars.  Stars come at a price, 20 coins.  To get 20 coins, you must win mini games or land on blue spots.  This is like an advanced board game for the N64, but with a twist.  In addition to the board game aspect of this game, after everyone takes 1 turn a mini game takes place.
Competitions in this mini game include:
Everyone against eachother
1 Vs 3
2 Vs 2
This is where the intense fun comes on.  You and your friends button smash, spin the analog stick to your hearts content.  As a matter of fact, so much button smashing (fast taps on the buttons)takes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand.  Be warned, if you're too competitive with this particular Mario Party, you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers.
It's overall pure fun.  Games can last for hours and hours if you really want.  Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull, this game completely opposite of that!
If you want a great N64 game...this is a must buy.
If you are interested in this game, but don't want to play an older console anymore or don't have a N64, I recommend Mario Party 4 and 5 for the Nintendo Gamecube.  Exceptionally fun, with  quite a bit less dangerous button smashing.",4.0
"When Nintendo first made it onto the scene with Mario 64, they had no idea of how interesting it is to mold and shape the format of the Mario Brothers industry for the Nintendo 64. It became so big, that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement, and so on down the line.
With Mario Party for Nintendo 64, they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become. The game features your choice of six characters to choose from, Wario, Mario, Peach a.k.a. Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Luigi, and Donkey Kong. The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug O' War, where it is 1 player vs. 3 players, Bombs Away, where you have to try stay on a floating island for 30 seconds, without getting the shock from cannon shots coming, and there is Deep Sea Divers, where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible, without losing your breath. There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on, as well as two very special hidden boards, so look out.
It is a shame that most games didn't seem to be like Mario Party. Although many people are interested in the newer ones and the Gamecube version, the original is always the best one to try for starters. If you really want it, then roll the dice and take that very first chance.",4.0
"In Mario Party, you take control of one of six Nintendo characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, or Donkey Kong) and move around a board as if you were playing a board game. After each turn, you play a minigame. At the end of the minigame, the winner(s) get coins. The coins can then be used to buy stars from Toad. Sometimes you run into Bowser, who does something random, but never helps anyone. The winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns. A true original by Nintendo. However, there is a major problem with the controls...
As you may have heard, there are minigames in Mario Party that require rotating the control stick. Doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand. In fact, Nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of Mario Party. But instead, Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Party's instruction manual.
I realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game. Specifically, the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box. In this case, how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that Nintendo was looking for? Nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves. A way that would allow anyone who has the game, and cannot keep track of everything, get there hands on, or in, a glove.
Nintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing Mario Party. But don't let that stop you from buying it. It's still a great game; just don't forget to buy a glove!",4.0
this game was in excellent conditon. it was boring tho its for like anyone under 4th grade,4.0
"This game is basically just you controlling Flik and steering away from ""bad"" bugs and collecting points and power ups to win. I bought the game because I enjoy Toy Story on the Game Boy and figured PS1 action is just as fun. Well, I was mostly right. Here's the pros and cons:
Pros:
* Good graphics
*Good Character Model Animation
*Lots of Power Ups
* Training Level
Cons:
* Too many difficult enemies
* Levels don't get harder quickly
Anyway, good game!",4.0
"The graphics and audio in this game really leave more to be desired, but the overall gameplay is loads of fun.  Mission objectives and dificuly are good although you won't find yourself in a lot of full-blown shoot outs.  Nevertheless, it is a good game and I definitely would reccomend it.",4.0
"Rockstar games later went on to use the game engine and flight mechanics as well as the swimming and other parts of his game to improve what most of you would refer to as GTA:SA and GTA:4, one could be labored to suggest that this game allowed and was the father of said games. In the gaming industry it happens often that one game either spawns or helps improve the industry standards and this game thou over looked did more for the gaming world then most figure or see.

This game is to GTA, as Ultima Underworld is to Fallout 3, and that is to say they are the for runners that improved future games. I suggest if your looking for good harmless violence without human on human violence I recommend this one if you still use your N64. I would point out, that Human deaths that you allow or preform increase a ticking total and once you get to many you fail the level. So the game even goes so far as to not allow it, I will also add this game has one of the largest number of flying vehicles and ground vehicles and even boats and the likes of almost any game I have ever played in my entire life.",4.0
"This is my first review I've done of a video game. Body Harvest is a game that's very much fun to play. Although I read through the instruction booklet, this game SEEMS tough to figure out as to what to do next. It's almost like having your -own- Johnny Quest cartoon to play. Although you get just one life in your player (sort of a futuristic-like space warrior), you get plenty of chances to re-juice his power. The graphics, in MY opinion are good even though I've heard others quoting that they didn't care for them. Also enjoy the music that starts up whenever the aliens start coming in for the kill. An hour can easily pass by when you play Body Harvest. A good game to own.",4.0
"I have to admit, as much as I want to praise this game, it is mostly wasted potential.  Even though this game came out in the later stage of the N64's run, it has the graphics of a third party release title. (Read: They're not all that great.)  Everything about the game reaches towards high concepts, but almost nothing reaches its goal.  The idea is that you are a timetraveling hero who has to save the world from various attacks from interstellar insects throughout history.  While the story is pure fluff, the gameplay (at least in theory) is not.  DMA is well known for the Grand Theft Auto series of games, and Body Harvest follows a similar formula.  You shoot things, then you get into various vehicles and shoot more things.  The main difference is that in Body Harvest you don't want to run innocent people over.
The controls are innovative and simple, but not very well implimented.  Its easy to get the hang of walking and driving the multitudes of cars/boats/planes/tanks, but the controls are too lose for your character to move around with much precision.  In addition, the aiming system also fails to live up to its high concept.  Basically you press the aim button, which brings up a cool looking recticule, but limits your movements.  However, since the enemies are so slow and predictable, and the areas are so spacious, battles boil down to mere shooting galleries.  When the enemies get tougher, faster, and more numerous in the later levels, it remains a shooting gallery, just with the bugs doing the shooting.  At this point in the game, vehicles become not just the coolest part of the game (and they are cool) but totally necissary, since you are toast without them even on the easy difficulty.  Combat in vehicles, even with aiming cababilities, usually devolve into shooting whatever is right in front of you.
Basically, this is a high concept game that didn't quite make the grade and feels very rushed (despite the fact that I waited a long time during its extended development.)  Furthermore, with the next generation systems now on the market, the graphics and framerate become simply unacceptable and this game might be better off when viewed as a curiousity piece or a very early beta of Grand Theft Auto 3,",4.0
"If you want a [well priced], yet fulfilling few hours of destructive fun, this is your game. I found the ambience slightly disturbing, that's good.

"For those of us who got a PSX at rollout, Alien Trilogy deffinately belongs in the list of all time PSX classic games.  Sure, by today's graphics standards it's not so great but it has great game play.  The best thing about this game is the ambiance - dark, great music, it is a little scarry.  The game is simple to play and control.  Yes, the Doom/Unreal crowd won't like it - not enough buttons and weapons of mass destruction.  No, this is the first person shooter your girlfriend will want to play too.  Acclaim should remake this title for PS2 with more CG story cuts and cohesive plot.",4.0
"Alien Trilogy came out as a first person shooter. The developers really wanted to bring the audience more realistic feel in your movement, atmosphere, enemies and weapons. They brought awesome music, graphics, and enemies. The controls are very different, but they work well. Some games are just fun, entertaining, productive. That's the kind of experience you'll have if you sit down and actually play this title. It's very grim from the beginning to the very end, definitely worth beating. I highly recommend buying this if you have thought about playing a game set in the Alien franchise. Enjoy.",4.0
"I played this when it came out in Japan and have been looking for a US version. Personally I feel it's a better FPS on the marine side than AVP1&2. Very dark and brooding. Excellent soundtrack and environments. The game actually goes in the order of ALIENS - ALIEN3 - ALIEN. Which works quite nicely.

true to the movie-weapons, aliens, Weyland/Yutani symbols and guards. Very familiar maps and objectives. Imagine DOOM on LV426..

the only cons are that 1. it seems hard to find now. and 2. it was never remade. It's on the PS and the graphics are to be expected for that system. Though like most Playstation games, the play control and game scheme makes up for it..

"Originally released way, way back a little after the release of the original Playstation; Acclaim's Alien Trilogy (you can tell this game is old considering the film series stopped being a trilogy when the fourth film Alien Resurrection was released a year later on) is a straight forward first person shooter in which you play as Ripley going through all the Xenomorph infested areas from the first three films.  By today's standard's the graphics, gameplay, and weapon options are all pretty dated, but in it's day Alien Trilogy was one of the better FPS games to hit the PS1.  All in all, if you still have your PS1 and dig older FPS games, you should give this one time gem a look.",4.0

"Deep Cover Gecko is the third and last Gex game to be made. This entry was made with the help of british developer EIDOS in exchange for Crystal Dynamics' help in producing Soul Reaver and Tomb Raider: Revelations, but I digress.
This game picks up after Gex: Enter the Gecko with series baddie Rez kidnapping Gex's partner, Agent Xtra. Gex then heads back to the Media Dimension to save Extra and stop Rez once again.
Gex 3 is the second 3D Gex game and is unique in a few ways. Firstly, none of the levels repeat. In previous Gex games you would encounter multiple levels with the same theme. For example you'd complete a level based on horror films and then later in the game you'ld come across another one. Each level in Gex 3 on the other hand is unique. There is only one level per theme. One Mystery channel, one Anime channel, etc.
The Gameplay is largely the same as it was in Gex: Enter the Gecko. You control the camera with the shoulder buttons this time around, but it can still be a major problem when judging distance while platofrming. The other addition is a number of costumes that give you minor upgrades, like a vampire cape to glide, a superhero costume, or a tunic to make you strong. These are interesting and add some variety, however they're under utilized and don't show up very often. This game also appeared on the N64, however there are fewer voice clips and no 3D cutscenes. The other difference between the two is that the Mythology channel, a parody of the old Hercules movies and Clash of the Titans, has a different level design. On the PS1 it's set on Mt Olympus, and on the N64 it's set in Hades. Now a game changer, but a nifty fact.
Dana Gould returns to voice Gex, who is still amusing to listen to and Marliece Andrea plays Agent Xtra. If you're playing a PAL version Gex is played by Danny John-Jules, known for playing The Cat on BBC's Red Dwarf. The unique levels have their own set of jokes which greatly reduces the chance of repetition which was a problem with the previous games.

It's a shame that no new games have been made since, but this was a pretty good conclusion. It's a great PS1 game and a solid title for 3D platforming fans all around.",4.0
"The last time we saw Gex which was in the game called Gex: Enter the gecko he saved t.v. from a robot named Rez. Kinda wierd huh? Well in this game a woman named Agent Xtra was captured by Rez. When Gex was at home thinking about his last successes he decided to watch the news. When he was in the middle of watching the news he saw that Agent Xtra was captured by Rez. So Gex decided to go and save Agent Xtra. So he goes to the Gex caves and starts his new adventure.
What you gotta do is you have to go to new t.v. levels and collect as many t.v. remotes as you can. Remember, the more remotes you collect the closer you will get to Rez. In this game Gex wears all sorts of different costumes like Hercugex, Supergex, Privategex, Dracugex, Little Red Riding Gex, and Sherlockgex. There is a whole lot more, but I cannot name them all. Gex also has rides too like Al Nino the donkey which can help Gex go up hills that are too slippery for Gex to climb and Humps the camel which can help Gex cross sinky sand and there are a few others. There are secret characters that you can play in the bonus rounds, but you have to find them first before you can play them. There is Rex which is Gex's prehistoric ancestor and Cuz which is Gex's cousin.
This game is really fun to play and not only that, the graphics are very nice and colorful. The colors in this game are much brighter than the other Gex games which makes this game even better and more fun to play, but the camera is a bit slow, but that is ok. You will get used to it after a while. The bad thing about this game is that there is adult language in it. It says bad words like d--- and s---. While you are playing this game you will hear really, really, really funny one-liners from Gex, but some of them have bad words in the one-liners or shall we say quotes. Believe me do not let kids under the age of 10 to play this game. That was the reason why I gave this game a four star instead of a five star. But hey, this game is okay for the whole family anyway, if you have a child that is younger than the age of ten and you don't want your child to hear the bad words than you are lucky, because there is a way to turn off the voice of Gex that way Gex won't even speak at all. You can turn the Voice from Gex off by going to the pause menu.
Well that is all I have to say about Gex3: Deep cover Gecko. If you ever buy this game I hope you will like it as much as I did. Thanks for taking your time to read my review. ( - -,) ( ^ ^,) :)",4.0
"This game is pretty cool. It's like a hybrid between a shooter and a spy game. Syphon Filter has an awesome assortment of weapons that you can burn,  blow, tear, and otherwise give your enemies a few more holes in their body.  The level design is really good, with lots of nooks and crannies to hide  in. Perfect for snipers. But the voice acting is bad.
Pros: Cool weapons,  nice level design
Cons: Grahpics can be a bit blocky at times, the voice  acting is HORRIBLE, and there are some levels that you JUST CAN'T pass  without being seen or shot.
 Overall, this is a nice game. But once you  finish it, there's not much replay value except that itching urge to zap  some baddies with the taser. >:)",4.0
"Following the popularity of Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter is a game that stands up very well on its own.  It has enough that is different that it can be considered a very good game in its own right.  SF has a very nice  blend of shoot-em-up and stealth missions that it is never the same thing  over and over.  However, it does find a few things lacking.  The save  system is horrendous.  You can only save at points that are very far apart.  The checkpoint system which allows you to restart at the last checkpoint  helps this a little, but being able to save a checkpoints would have made  this game much better.  Also, some scenarios are very difficult, especially  if you've been playing it through and miss one detail.  Most likely, it's a  detail that you will miss everytime, which can make a few missions very  frustrating.  The cut scenes are good and the game control is good.  The  wide variety of weapons is very interesting as well.  All in all, this is a  very good game marred by a very few flaws.",4.0

"When I was a kid, my cousin would never let me play it because it was his ""newest game he had"", while I had to play with my sega genesis, but once he sold it to me and I got it, I felt in love with the game.

The game it self is very straight forward and very fun. But many things that come up now that I did not see as a kid are evident.

-The game is too easy. The AI's have to lock on you to start doing damage, were by the time they lock on, you could easyly aim for their heads and kill them.
-The graphics looks like a bunch of blocks put together (the character models) which in my personal taste makes the game very hilarious!
-There are many glitches that you notice along the way, but aren't really game breaking
-Even with all these problems, the gameplay is amazing. For a PSone game, this is defenetly a very good game!",4.0
"Syphon Filter is a good 3rd person shooter with stealth elements.  People have to remember that this was one of the early 3d games that tried to incorporate stealth elements, so it is not as smooth as some of today's games, but it is still pretty well done in my opinion. The game has its flaws, but was a very fun game and the difficulty was just right.  Not too easy and the boss fights were pretty sweet and did require multiple attempts on my part.  I have the disc version for the PS1, so I cannot comment on the digital version.",4.0

"I've been a big fan of the Street Fighter series since its outset. And to be quite honest, playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be. Sure, the game is mildly entertaining, but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had, it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters. The character roster totals out at 17, with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel. There are five modes of play including battle, versus, training, hero battle, and crossover. Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes. Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters. Nothing special here. Crossover mode, however, is at least somewhat interesting. You see, in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight. This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but couldn't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. Sadly, the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason. Sure, you can still pick two characters, but you can only play as one of them. The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter. Crossover mode tries to bring the game's main selling point home. This mode allows you to pick two characters, then the computer uses the same characters you picked. This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four. If you are victorious in this battle, the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another. This is done so that you aren't playing with and against the same two characters each fight. It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade, but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak. Visually, MSH vs. SF looks good. But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart, it simply fails. The colors aren't nearly as vibrant, and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown. It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, though, because not nearly as much animation was cut out. This is a major plus, since frames of animation not only affect the game's appearance but timing and gameplay as well. On the gameplay side, Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay. But in the end, it's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game. Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode, and with the overall exclusion of this mode, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game.",4.0
"The game is cool, but when you compare it to the arcade version, it's simply fails in comparision. The fighting and the hyper combos on their are tight and improved. Like Wolverine's Weapon X combo does more damage than on XvSF. If there are any availiable, comp this game cause it's hard as hell if you're a big Akuma fan.",4.0
"Despite it being licensed it has a large element of fantasy to it, hence ""adventure"". You'll be racing around volcanoes, pyramids and in the Alps. Is that a spaceship? It might be. This game holds up surprisingly well since the 90's and still offers a challenge and fun.",4.0
Great game. It shipped on time and worked when I loaded it into my N64. No complaints brings me back to the good old days!,4.0
"The game concept seems dull and unappealing but, surprisingly makes driving a Volkswagen exciting. The game has you race various colored Volkswagen bugs through beautiful scenery. The fun factor is short lived but, amazing while it lasts.",4.0
"For Beetle Adventure Racing, they decided to give a 1st time player only 2 tracks to play to start with!! Otherwise, to get more tracks you have to to go to Championship Race, and get the other tracks. I look at these cheat things on the Internet, and a lot of them don't mention that you can unlock tracks, so I wanted to tell people that yes you can unlock tracks - (6 racing tracks altogether) 4 tracks plus there are these multiplayer tracks to unlock. There are more multiplayer tracks, but these are simpler. They aren't real racing tracks like the other 6. Think of them like battle games such as the ones on Mario Kart 64.

Now, some people might say 6 racing tracks (other than multiplayer, that's it?? Cruisin USA 64 has 14 tracks.. However, the 6 tracks are not normal tracks. They are about twice as long as other racing games I have played such as Destruction Derby, Cruisin USA, Monster Truck Madness 64, etc. You can play 3 laps of a course such as Coventry Coves, and you are ending it in 7-8 minutes. This is without stops, or crashes. The handling is good on this game, so you probably wouldn't crash to begin with.

Again, the only thing I really don't like is that you to win the championship races to win so much. They should have had 6 tracks they give you already + 2 extra tracks you win with the championship races, and more cars to win with the championship races. It is what it is, but it's still a fun game.",4.0
"Electronic Arts was one of a small group of third party developers that supported the N64 with a decent amount of games. One of them, Beetle Adventure Racing, was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the Nintendo 64. Released in 1999, it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the game.

In BAR, you pick from a variety of Volkswagen Beetles and choose from one player mode(single and championship), two player mode(race only) and beetle battle mode (two to four players.) Select from one of six tracks (first one only available from the start.) and you're off! There are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels. As you pass each track, it becomes available in the other game modes. As you beat the game under each difficulty level, you unlock additional versions of Beetles. There are ""number"" boxes scattered throughout each track. They count as points and need to be collected to earn ""continues"" and depending on the difficulty level, you need a certain amount. You can earn up to 100 points; collect them all and you unlock a multi-player track for the Beetle Battle mode (only one track is available from the start) Lastly, there are ""flower"" boxes hidden throughout each track. Finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screen.

The PROS: There is so much content packed in this game, you get your money's worth instantly. First off, the graphics, music, sound effects, controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N64. Then, there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later. This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it. Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time. The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them. The Beetle Battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself (the tracks are huge so getting 3 more players is the best way to go.) This game will take you awhile to beat since it's quite challenging and that leads into...

The CONS:...right here. While BAR looks and sounds like an arcade racer, it uses real car physics so part of the challenge comes to getting used to how it feels and controls. The cars you start out with are slow and rigid while the ones you unlock later on control much better. Also, the A.I. cars start off slow and don't pose a challenge but as you play through each difficulty level, they go faster, bump into you and rarely make a mistake so don't be surprised if you have to try again to finish in 1st place. This game is for those who want to put in time to unlock all the goodies here so if you want to pick up and play right away, you won't have access to the entire game from the get go.

Beetle Adventure Racing is a great racer that while can be quite difficult at times, can be fun and is a good choice for those who like the San Francisco Rush and Cruis'n games. It's worth your money so those of you who like racing games and looking for a game to play with others, grab yourself a copy.",4.0
Racing is my favorite genre and this is my favorite racing game. The controls are grab and go with no fine points of control. Something about them all being VW Bugs makes it appealing instead of boring. Driving in the slush and snow here approaches the feel of real driving in snow ie planning turns.,4.0
for some reason it doesn't fit perfectly but it works so its not a big deal,4.0

"I think that Beetle Adventure Racing is an awsome game.  A couple of friends and I have this game and we love it!  You have single player races (basically to see your best time), chapionship races, & Beetle Battles (This game is so fun, and it has so many scenarios!).  I don't know if this helps you a whole lot, but this game is really fun.  Check it out.  Sorry for the spelling.  <laughs>  Bye!",4.0
"This game is a blast. If you race someone who is at the same level as you, then you really have a challenge. You can race alone with the machine and it is alot of fun. It has great graphics and the scenery is beautiful. It has short cuts and different weather conditions and tracks. Place 3rd or better and move to the next track, eventually you will get to do space trucking and earn cars as you win races.  Our family really enjoys it. We range from 8 years old to 49!

"This came to me today in what looks like what is supposed to go as it's ""original casing"" however the pack top is a darker red then any of the ones i seen growing up so it makes me feel it might have been made by a different company then the originals, also the top right side of the red thing was bent upward a bit exposing some of the metal it covered up. However it did the job it was made for and it came to me at the expected time so can't really complain that much, i'm just happy to be able to play my Majora's mask and Donkey Kong 64  again.",4.0

"Not OEM original but it does work, I bought the (3rd party) Retrobit expander, from SethCo on here. The heat grill is red, like the original, and yes. Retrobit works for all three of my 64s. Given, my consoles are American. Retrobit even comes with a lever to remove the Jumper pack.

 If SethCo doesn't sell it anymore, you should ask another seller for pictures of the expansion pack and openly question the product before you buy. Thankfully I was lucky mine was a supported pack and not a Japanese one.

I am giving it 4 stars only because the product is not well described on here, and there is still a chance someone may buy a fake and fry their console. But, it does work, and is properly priced for an aftermarket.",4.0
"This is an interesting product; I find that it does improve the graphics of the games on the Nintendo64.  The issue is that the improvement is rather small, at least compared to the graphics seen in today's games.  As such, I can only recommend it if, like me, you still play the N64 a fair bit, or else you won't get much use out of the extra memory.  I haven't noticed games running any faster or using the memory for more than graphics; I may be wrong.

I don't think anyone will regret the purchase, but it may not be as impressive as initially thought (though for its time, it was a nice improvement).",4.0
This is a must have for some games....DK/perfect dark.  This model is kinda ugly with the red bit showing always.,4.0

"When I first bought my N64 the expansion came with it. I didn't know much about expansion packs until I searched online. It basically improves the resolution and graphics in the games you play. I know that it only works for some older games like mario kart 64, or super mario 64. Required games are donkey kong 64 and the legend of zelda majora's mask. It's pretty good I guess accept I kinda wish it worked for all games.",4.0

"The product worked perfectly.  The only problem is that it does not fit flush with the N64, which is just an aesthetic problem.  Overall good product.",4.0
"You need this to play perfect dark as well as Donkey Kong.  It also helps (but is not required) for track and field, and tony hawk's pro skater 1 and 2.

so yeah, if you want to play perfect dark or donkey kong, get this.  otherwise, its not essential to play most games.",4.0
"They asked me to review this like a game? I got the expansion pak on time, it works was cheap and now I can play my old 64 games that require it.",4.0
It works like the one for the N64.  It's a little bit bigger that you're not able to put the cover back on the N64.  I haven't tried it yet with Perfect Dark and any other games that require the expansion pack.  It's alright though.,4.0
ok yeah i got my N64 a few days ago from EB Games and i cant figure out how to get it out but my friend had an N64 but he didn't have an expansion pak so we compared the graphics cuz ppl said it was better w/ the pak in it and they were right its alot better w/ the expansion pack,4.0
"If we are reviewing just the way the product works then I give it 5 stars.

But for just the overall fact that this is necesary to play certain games and that the price is so high is a tad annoying. The Fact that Nintendo did this and made it pretty expensive was really annoying. But If you can get it under 20 or even 15 dollars I still recomend getting it because it is neccesary for great games Like Zelda : Majora's Mask, Donkey Kong 64, or Perfect Dark (which is the reason I bought one.)",4.0
"when i bought my N64 i really suffered for games, it seem like no one had N64 the games,EVENTUALLY i was able to aquire game like Doom N64 / Duke Nuken ect..... with less than ordinary graphics in comparison to when i got my memory epansion, Then came games like Donkey Kong 64 , Perfect dark , Zelda Majaora's Mask, well  let say that i really was impress to see the full potential of the N64 ,i always wondered why??? for the power that N64 had it was hard to see how Ps1 was so much more popular than N64, i know N64 had some really great games and the graphic was superior to Ps1, anyhow if you are a serious gamer the expansion pak is a must have and also you can experience the full potential of the N64 laterzzzz folks / gamers.....",4.0
"It's a must have for playing Zelda: Majora's Mask, and a few others.  It adds a little texture to games like Rogue Squadron.  Worth the money.",4.0
"i just bought an n64, but i've played one before with and without the expansion pak.  though the pak does help with the graphics the n64 still can't touch the dreamcast or ps2 with regards to  graphics.  still the pak does let you play perfect dark so it is a must have.",4.0
"This expansion pak is becoming more and more of a necessity among new games. While it does improve the graphics of most games somewhat, you should but it it purely because most new games and eventually all (according to Nintendo) will require it. If money is a problem, you might as well get a great game, Donkey Kong 64, that comes with the pak. Happy gaming.",4.0
Some of the coolest new games coming out are going to require this to play so you better get yourself one now. It will be well worth it. It'll soup up some older games that are made to work with it as well.,4.0
"Ok, first off I'd like to say that it will only make a difference with games that are compattible with it.  Some games, like DK64 and Perfect Dark  require the thing to play, so it's a must buy if you're gonna get Perfect  Dark(Donkey Kong comes with one).  For other games, like Star Wars: Rogue  Squadron, it is not necesary, but it's like putting on a pair of glasses.  Things far away that used to be blurry are clearer and some levels make you  want to gasp in amazement!  GET THIS IF YOU HAVE ANY COMPATTIBLE GAMES!  Besides, most of the newer and upcoming games for n64 use it!",4.0
"As a collector I absolutely love to pick up old retro games at the local Game X-Change. A few months ago I happened to come across a copy of Donkey Kong Land III for six dollars and made a point to snag it. I didn't get around to playing it for a while but when I did it really helped me out some unexpected ways.

Now, I'm sure you're wondering how playing a video game can quote unquote ""help"" you. A few years ago I picked up a copy of the original Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo at the same store but when I played through it something felt a bit off. I just wasn't enjoying myself to the point I did when I played the game when I was younger. I wasn't sure if the problem was me or if it was the game... all I knew was I was going to have to play another game in the franchise (as a point of reference) to find out. Fast forward a few years when I got around to this and well, I had a blast. After completing Donkey Kong Land III I played a few more games like Donkey Kong Country 2 on the GameBoy Advance and the original Donkey Kong Land and those only solidified the weird fact that I don't like the first SNES game for some reason. Unfortunate (and bizarre) as that is I'm glad the whole series hasn't shared its fate.

Since I've finished this game I've played the other two Land games and while the original Land is good despite its problems (2 is oddly disappointing for some reason...) I feel this is the strongest of the GameBoy games and considering how little it costs to procure this is just an excellent game to add to anyone's collection. However, as good as Donkey Kong Land III is - and how rewarding the unlockable time trial mode is - the sad fact is many people have completely forgotten about the Land series. In a certain sense this isn't surprising given that ports of the original Super Nintendo games were made available on the GameBoy Advance but it's shame that these games are being passed up.

Regardless you can easily get about seven to eight hours of gameplay out of this one which is pretty impressive given today's second hand prices. If you're looking to introduce a younger gamer into gaming and want to do it with a less expensive system like the GameBoy Advance this is a great way to go.",4.0
"Donkey Kong Land III is agreat game for everything.  From long trips to those short waits on the Metro.  This is probably the best game in the Donkey Kong Land series for Game Boy and you have the choice of choosing the unusually large Kiddy Kong (a baby) or from my personal favorite character, Dixie Kong. No Donkey Kong? While apperintly he's not in this game.  This game has great side-scrolling action and also has some pretty good graphics.  With tons of lands with big enough levels, this game will keep you occupied for hours.  The enimies in DK3 are pretty much the same as the past DK games, but there are a lot more barrels and options in DK3.  The only two things I don't like about DK3 is that the boss in the third land is so darn hard and it took me a long time to beat him.  The other thing that I don't like is that the only way to save is if you make it to a little hut with some old guy in it and that could be four levels into a land.  While even though the game isn't perfect it's still a great game and is not bad compared to Donkey Kong Country on Super Nintendo.  If Action/Adventure is your bag than you've got to buy this game.",4.0
This game is great!  It is very challenging though.  The graphics aren't great but they work for this game.  Die Hard Trilogy is better than the sequel because it is more fun to play through.  It will take you a long while though.  The game follows with the movies pretty good.  All the modes on the game are fun but the driving mode is the hardest.  You will definitely love this game. Yippee Ki Yay!,4.0
"The game was okay, I was expecting more from it, but the three different play styles are nice if you like top down or rail shooters.",4.0
Its a great game first time through although there is not much replay value so I am selling mine with rainbow six for real cheap.,4.0
"Being both a Star Wars and racing game fan, I was hoping for something special. I wasn't disappointed. ""Star Wars Episode 1: Racer"" is one of the fastest and most exciting games available. The music and sound effects are amazing and the graphics are excellent.
There is a wide range of playable characters and pods available, and the choice of upgrading or buying parts for your vehicle. The speed of the racing is incredible; it's a white-knuckle ride across ice and desert and through caves and tunnels. None of the pods come equipped with weapons, but to be honest you just don't need them: the game in no way suffers from the lack of them and the racing is excellent by itself.
There are eight racing worlds and over twenty levels, each at different stages of difficulty. Each is beautifully designed and exciting to play, although later on in the game the tracks set in the same worlds may seem a little similar. The map of each track that appears at the top right of each screen can sometimes be hard to read as not enough of each track is shown and making out competing pods is difficult.
One great thing about the game is that it has great replay value. Even though it's pretty easy to beat, I've played it through several times now and still haven't got bored of it. Overall, four and a half stars. The graphics are excellent but the tracks can get a little repetitive. You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy this game.",4.0
I bought this game not knowing what to expect because I'm not really a racing fan. But after playing the game I enjoyed  myself. this game is good to get even if your not a fan of racing games and just want to waste some time. But I recommend buying a controller for this game it's makes it allot better.,4.0
"The races were fun and the difficulty level increased at a good rate.  Though getting first in all of the races, it became boring once they were  all completed.  The Winning Screen (on the pillars) was the same every  time.  Something different could have been done for more excitement.  Now  only multiplayer is exciting.",4.0
"The moment I popped this game into my computer, was the beginning of many unless nights of no sleep.  Not only did I find myself hooked to the game, my room mate and friends come around to play this fantastic racing game on  my computer.  Pod racers come and go as we play the game further and find  some unique pod racer to our liking, each one handles differently and has  it's advantages and disadvanatages.  The only two problems I found with  this game is that it's highly boring to play without a cool joystick, and  that it's incredibly difficult to win races after this certain point.  It  turns from moderately hard to impossible to beat.  The hardest thing to do.  however, was kicking my room mate off the game and off my computer.",4.0
"If you think that the ""Star Wars Episode 1: Racer"" is an effort to cash in on the _Phantom Menace_ hype, you vastly underestimate the  talent at Lucasarts.  As usual, they top expectations and deliver something  far beyond a merchandising tie-in.  This is a product which pushes the  boundaries of the racing genre. Take this feature-rich game out of the Star  Wars Universe and you still have a thrilling, easily-networkable ride.
The large number of different racers with different qualties is somewhat  _pro forma_ nowadays in the genre, but Lucasarts takes the idea one step  further.  By winning purses, you earn money with which to upgrade your  racer.  Thus there are a number of useful configurations which are only  possible through victory.
The number and quality of camera angles is  equally impressive.  In fact, the cockpit view is downright revolutionary.  From this vantage point, you feel the 400-mph+ speeds, and it's  comparatively harder in this camera to complete tricky courses.
Where the  game flags, I suppose, is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film.  There's no ability to eliminate opposition by ""dirty tricks"", and  you can't disable the ""i-crashed-but-now-i-have-a-new-racer""  feature.  The pod racers are absolutely indestructible here (though they  can be seriously damaged) and that's a disappointment.  I would've liked a  ""harder-edged"" version--perhaps one you could toggle on and  off--but it's a small complaint for an otherwise stunning effort.",4.0
"I had a lot of fun playing this game, the speed is knuckle-whitening, the graphics are top notch, and the whole experience is very entertaining.  Eventhough you get the hang of things very quick, and it becomes hard to  lose a race, there is still great fun in trying different vehicles and  changing the way you go through the courses.  This game is not for those  who want an in-depth thinking experience, but rather for those who like  fast-paced thrills.  Big thumbs up.",4.0
"It's been awhile, but I recall first playing this game with my brother and us declaring it the most enjoyable LucasArts venture yet.  Yes it has its flaws, especially now in 2004 when videogame graphics have since made stunning advancements.  But this 1999 game is simply classic - the ""choose-your-own-response"" dialogue, deceptively tricky puzzles, lightsaber and shoot-'em-up action - I'm sure any Star Wars fan who missed it the first time around would have a ball picking it up now, especially with the marked-down price.",4.0
"This is a great game and its fun too, but the bugs get annoying. but first the good things. The graphics are fairly good, the gameplay is good, the levels ar good, the weapons are good, and i like all the Characters you are in the diffirent levels, and it challenges you. Now the bad stuff. the camera views get messed up some times, some times the the characters repeat what they just said, some times it locks up when you try to save a game, some times the sound gets messed up (and its not my sound card), and some times the characters start saying things when a. they all ready said it b. your not even close to them. But overall this is a good game, and i recommend it to any one who likes star wars or adventure/Action games.",4.0
"The graphics are pretty good and the scenery is supurb. Its like looking at a piece of art. the AI lacks a bit but what it lacks in AI it makes up for in shere beauty. The game also does well to follow the film, although for people who have seen the film. Don't dismay, there are planty of side quests to surprise you. All in all, well done LucasArts, a good piece of work, many games on films do lack somewhat in what they can be but you've managed to pull through.",4.0
"This game is just great fun.  I highly recommend this for the PC gamers who are like me and were really ticked off when Microsoft put Obi-Wan on the Xbox instead of the PC.  In The Phantom Menace (TPM)you spend most of the game as Obi-Wan, wielding a lightsaber and cutting into droids (Much fun!).  However, there is more to the game then cutting down battle droids.  (You can use this excuse to get your parents to buy you the game) You have to solve brain-stimulating (wink, wink) puzzles and navigate through 11 levels of challenges, and in some levels, you hardly need to draw a weapon at all.
  Unfortunetly, like the film, it has a downside.  There is, of course, Jar Jar Binks, the most annoying creature in the galaxy.  (It's fun to get him with a saber)  Also, when you get to the end and beat Darth Maul, that's it, the game is over.  And unless you want to keep playing it over and over and over and over again (which I do), you're going to get bored quickly.
  So, all in all, TPM is a great game, it just needs to be a little longer.",4.0
"This is a very good game in a way that when you has seen the film you just have to get as the play is just so like the film. The game play is very like the film in many ways as if you split up the film in to sections then this game has a level in each piece of the film. You can even follow the story while playing it. So you don't have to have seen the film to appreciate this game but it will help as you will know what is happening throughout. It is quite a hard game to get used to but once you do, it becomes really good from there on and you can't get off of it as it is very addictive as you want to get to the next section of the film. The good thing is that it is not only just an action game like you would think but also very much a strategy one having to figure out where to go next. And to top it off you even play as queen amidala in one level! If you love the film like i do then you will love this!!",4.0
This game is great! ... I love Sonic! I reccomend people to buy this game. It will be worth it.,4.0
"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet ""the mysterious little boy."" There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that, this is a very solid effort.",4.0
"Let's break this down bit by bit.
1. The graphics are ok. The characters aren't realistic, yet the backgrounds, buildings and weapons look good.
2. The levels in this game are mind-boggling. Pretty  difficult to complete.
 3. Somethings are pretty aggrivating. Lightsabers  can't cut through walls, droids aren't killed in one shot. Destroyer Droids  are extermley, if not impossible, to blow up.
 4. Queen Amidala is very,  very, very irritating!
 5. If this matters in an action game, the voice  talents are, on the most part weak. A lot of the characters don't sound at  all like they do in the movie. (Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala, Captain  Panaka, Darth Maul)
 I thought that the game was fun. It was time  consuming, yet fun.",4.0
"I don't know what all the fuss is about!  The movie Episode I is possibly the best of all 4 so far, and the game is better than a good portion of the many, many games based upon the original trilogy.  You get to be 4  characters, which each have their own unique qualities.  Although there are  some boring parts of the game and there are some tricky spots, the game is  fantastic and allows for many hours of gameplay.  Lucasarts has done it  again.  Some people say the parts on Tatooine are so boring, but its not  that bad, they have to stick to the story pretty closely, and in the movie,  Tatooine isn't the best part, I mean stop trying to pick on it!  IT IS A  SWEET GAME (especially for the price of 20 bucks!) This game may not be as  good as Jedi Knight or Shadows of the Empire, but it definately ranks close  and it is a great game to add to your computer game collection.",4.0
i think it was great the graphics and everything but the gameis is so hard.  END,4.0

"This game it not just fighting ,you have to use your mind. You get to talk with characters go through mazes and even fight darth maul! I've played it 2 times. It takes 2 weeks to beat the game. I hope LucasArts makes episodes  4 5 and 6 in games. BUY IT!",4.0

"this was the first sonic game i ever played and i still find it fun because i like the idea of the team work gameplay because i like how you have to use the other characters's abilities to your advantage in order to progress through a level so you can't just rely on one character,you have to use team work in order to progress. Also,the music is amazing.",4.0
"It came bubble wrapped in an envelope. The box was in good shape and it included the instruction manual as promised. I take out the disk and I noticed that it had some scratches on the back, which is not cool. However the game play perfectly fine with zero
slow-down. Sonic Heroes is a great title to own!",4.0
"This game is great, I don't know why it gets so much hate. The plot is that Dr. Eggman has built the ultimate weapon and Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles have to stop him. The Game play is excellent, it can be a pain sometimes. The Music is amazing, The graphics are great for a Gamecube title. I recommend staying away from the PS2 verison. Because it has slower frame rates which can lead to alot of glitches.",4.0
Its a great game everything I expected it to be. My little girl just loves this game. I would recommed this game to anyone who wants to get away from the war type games.,4.0
"Overall a fun game, I'm glad I got it. Good gameplay, and I liked the music. The camera and controls weren't ideal, and I lost more lives to those problems than real difficulty, but on the whole it didn't take away from the fun except for a few moments of frustration. The voice actors weren't great, as other people have said, but I got used to it quickly.
Overall I wouldn't have recommended it at it's original price, but with how cheap you can buy it, it's certainly worth the price now.",4.0
"For me, this game is just about as fun as Sonic Adventure 2. It will keep you going for a pretty long time if you wanna beat the game with all 4 storylines. And, who doesn't? The controls, for the most part, are pretty good. Although, there a times where you can accidentally be swinging a weapon and you'll swing yourself right off a cliff and die. That will happen more than once to you.

My biggest problem with the game is the camera sometimes. Especially when flying, the camera will be in a position where you can't see the ground below you so you'll have to guess as where to land. And you WILL guess wrong at least once. And you will die.

I'm not sure, but I think the PS2 version is missing some textures. Particularly when flying, the shadow below the characters is missing. The shadow is critical for knowing where you will land. Without it, it just makes things all the more difficult. I think the shadow is present in the Gamecube version.

But I love the level designs and the missions. I don't find them overly difficult. They're a challenge but that's a good thing.

If you're a Sonic fan, this is a must have.",4.0
"My boys love this game and play it often. They are 6 and 9 years old and think it is one of the best games that they have. The game has good graphics, and has two player capability, challenges and races. Each player has three characters on his team that he can use for their abilities. They have very little difficulty playing it. I would say it is suitable for five years and up.",4.0
"My son is the player, here's his review:  Gameplays almost fast enough.  Slightly long lag on occasion.  Very frustrating on the Chaos Emerald Bonus Stages 4 & 7.  The Sonic and Chaotix bonus challenges are very, very hard.  The other two are very easy even though Team Rose and Team Dark are on opposite ends of the difficulty scale officially.  The actual story line is awesome but I have trouble finding someone to compete against for two player even though I've unlocked all seven two-player modes.  Count 'em seven. All in all, a fairly good Sonic Game.  However I do think they should go back to the 2-D games, those ones were awesome.",4.0
"This title marks Sonic's first launch on more than one platform...three to be exact. Finally a Sonic title is available on, not only Game Cube, but PlayStation 2 and XBox as well. The Story: Dr. Eggman has devised a new plan to take over the world, a newly reincarnated, and upgrated, Metal Sonic. That's right, Sonic's old rival from Sonic CD is back and ready for all new mayhem. It will take more than one hero to foil Eggman this time, It'll take twelve. But when Metal Sonic gets enough power to change into the all mighty Metal Overlord, will Sonic and his friends be enough to stop him? Heroes features a uniqe team based gameplay which includes four teams of three including: Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails and Knuckles), Team Rose (Amy, Big and new comers Cream and Cheese), Team Chaotix (Vector, Espio and Charmy), and Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge and new comer E-123 OMEGA). To add to the fun, each team has their own themed challenge i.e. Rose is easy, Sonic is medium, Dark is Hard and Chaotix is mission based. Also each member has their own affiliation: speed, flight and power. The game will tell you where you will need to use each character's uniqe skills. Overall, it's a bit challenging for a Sonic title, but it's worth checking out.",4.0
"Sonic Heroes is a pretty good game. The levels are super long, and some of the bosses will get you pissed out of your mind.  But after it's all done, the feeling of satisfaction is indescribable.  It's really good to finally be playing as Knuckles and not have to go hunting. The Chaotix are super cool too.  And for the record, HIS NAME IS ROBOTNIK!!!!!!!!!! What's with calling him Eggman?!!

Anyway, BUY THIS GAME!!! You'll be glad you did.",4.0
this game requires the eye to play it you see yourself playing in the game. thought any one who never saw the game but thought it was just another sega game should know it requires the eye to play.,4.0
"The last time i've played sonic was years ago, on my megadrive...

this game is about the same concept of fast running, collecting rings, going through loops and jumping like insane... but here you get to choose between 4 teams of 3 characters which are pretty different by gameplay, but the levels are about the same, which makes it pretty boring once you finished with 1 team...

the controlls are brilliant... team action at it's peak, one player for speed, one for flying and one for attacking, the only real problem i had with this game was the fact that you have limite lives... the game is very hard at some points, and it's very very easy to lose, and once you lose all you're lives, you need to start from the begining, which gets VERY frustrated and make the game harder then it is, when it's suppose to be a kids game.

i do recommend sonic heroes, it's very good, very colorfull and you'll have lots of fun with it, just know that it's not exactly a rollercoaster ride, which was pretty much what i expected",4.0
"People keep saying that ""its Sonic adventure 3"".It is not sonic adventure 3 by any circumstances.granted it is a fun game. But just becuase it has emblems,3d sonic gameplay,homing attack,light dash,it is still not a sonic adventure game!(just incase you are wondering,neither is sonic battle).but I still recomend this game if you are a sonic fan.when choosing,it would be best if you knew the difference in charicters episodes.

here is the difference

Team Sonic: Normal mode

Team Dark: Hard mode(more enemies)

Team Rose: Easy mode(less enemies,short levels)

Team Chaotix: Special(complete objective)

oh and I read a review that was asking why you are able to play as shadow.

*SPOILER*

even though it is my personal belief that shadow did not die because he could just as easily used chaos control clearly seing he is still in super form when he fell into the atmosphere and when he disapeared,there was a green flash.

But in this game,the shadow you play as is a robot.

you can tell because in the intro movie to team dark,omega is trying to kill shadow and at the same time he sais""must destroy all eggman robots"" and in the ending movie to team dark,rouge sais that he is a robot.

*SPOILER END*

all in all...SONIC HEROES IS STILL NOT SONIC ADVENTURE 3!

thankyou",4.0
"Ahh,Sonic. That name brings good memories,and so does this game. Sonic Heroes is the best 3-D Sonic game released yet! With great graphics,awesome gameplay,four entertaining stories,and one great,climactic ending! Sorry,no spoilers here. Find out yourself! I'm a Sonic veteran,so trust me when I say that this game is definitely Sonic at his best,SINCE I've been playing Sonic games for about 10 years now! If your a Sonic fan and you don't have this game yet,what are you waiting for,get up from your chair and go get it! You won't regret it,trust me! Overall, the only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because,out of all the many characters from the 4 different teams with 4 different stories and endings,yes,there are four teams,out of which there are 3 characters for each of those teams,the only reason I gave this game 4 stars is because I can't stand Charmy's voice! It's so high pitched,that it's annoying! Overall,this Sonic game is awesome as usual. 4 stars!",4.0
"Let me boil it down, basically, the whole game is composed of platforms suspended in mid air, so your biggest enemy isn't Eggman, nor Metal Sonic, it's the fall to your doom. The only characters that were useful in the game were the Tails and Kunckles, Tails can fly, and Kunckles can beat enemies, and Sonic is only good for leaping to your doom since whenever you decided to do something fast, you'll end up running over the ledge and fall. This really puts Sonic in the background, it's ironic how his name is actually in the title of the game. And if you were planning to buy this game for a son, daughter, or a nephew, don't bother, because they'll end up spending half the time crying, and half the time angry. Lastly, after spending nearly 6 hours of cursing and replaying, if you actually managed to get all 7 emeralds, you'll get to fight the final boss, so you spend time suffering, just to suffer some more? Very little replay value, gives you nightmares, I'd rather be spending time playing Sonic 3 and Kunckles on the Genesis (which is still the best Sonic game) then this disaster. Rent it, don't buy it. Don't get me wrong, the first 4-6 levels are fun, then you'll be cursing and swearing all the way to the credits.",4.0
"I love the three person tag teams, the trios run togeather, but you can tag the next leader by pushing circle. Every character on each team has their own special moves, but the teams are all pretty well balanced, they all have a fast hero, a strong hero, and a hero that can fly.
The grapics are great, fast and great! It has a great third person view, the camera is behind and above the team, you can move to either side, you can jump up, you can fall down, it's just a great 3D game!
It's soo easy and plays smoth, my only complaint is it that it is too fast in some places, like in the giant loops I easily lose track of the Sonic, with him moveing from side to side he will run off a cliff and I won't notice it until he is dead",4.0

"I first played this when i was 12 and absolutely loved it. i don't have a playstation anymore but im ordering it to play on my ps2. Yes, the graphics are terrible, the sound isn't good, but the actual gameplay itself is so much fun. this game has a free roaming feel to it, because you can do whatever you want. lots of random glitches happen but if you save your game every once in a while then its no big. Also, a lot of the one star reviews kept saying that when you die in a level you have to start all the way over...this is the case but what they didn't say is that you can save your game at any time down to the second. you have a huge jump to cross a gap? just save it, and if you don't make it, load your game and you'll end up right where you were. not great, but overall a fun game. the gameplay is what got this one 4 stars.",4.0

Over all it is an awesome game the graphics aren't great but hey its playstation not X box. the fighting is really exiting and the enemies are smart (like if charge them sometimes they will reatreat) it is pretty difficult i wouldnt recomend this game for a first timer(When i say first timer i mean u couldn't fricken beat space invaders)but i would definately reccomend buying it.",4.0
First of all on this game the graphics Suck very badly You have a limited number of moves you can perform. Also You don't always play as obi-wan OR Qui-gon Jinn This game is extremely difficult to beat the third level is almost impossible to beat.

"For us old pokemon fans, we fell in love with red and blue. I personally was a charzard fan in third grade, and this happened to be my first rpg. Everyone seemed to have some version of pokemon. You could even trade them with other people, providing you had the correct linking device. After pokemon fell out of fashion, no one seemed to want those really new games (except for the new third graders of course). The original set of pokemon were the greatest, even the strange ones like jynx. I hated the pokemon show after about a year of watching it everyday and owning all the pokemon merchandise. But I still buy the games and play them, because you can't beat the game play. It's quite simply amazing.

I'm sad to say my red version was stolen from me a few years ago, but I hope to purchase it once again at a used video game store.

Don't be expecting good graphics. This game has terrible graphics but it's still a wonderful game. Many old rpgs are :]",4.0
"On 02/14/1998, I recieved a game that ultimately became an obsession for me. I played this game whereever and whenever possible. I have caught all 151 of the original characters and kept on playing anyway. The game, it seems, never ends. I have about 215 hours on my file, and not once did it get boring. The Pokemon Era may have died down, but Red is still a great game. As the 10th anniversary of its American release rolls around, I can see the revival of a classic on the horizon.",4.0
"Pokemon was a great concept game that should've appealed to all ages, but really, the Pokemon culture and TV show and all that B/S completely wrecked it.  Just look at some of the reviews here.  Some of them include cliche stuff from the show such as the Rocket Team horse and ""Go Pokemon.""  It's really sad to see a great concept game like this go down the tubes now with the new releases that tie into the crap pop culture stuff.

Anyway, it's a great game, but don't play it in public, hide in your room and never tell anyone.",4.0
"This is a great classic game.  You begin as a new Pokemon trainer, and soon select your first Pokemon.  The choices are Charmander, a fire type;squirtle, a water type;or bulbasaur, a fire type.  Interestingly, three Pokemon you choose from are like rock/paper/scissors, charmander beats bulbasaur, squirtle beats charmander, and bulbasaur beats squirtle.  Soon, you rival chooses his Pokemon(annoyingly, its always the one that has the type advantage, like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander.  You are then given the task of completing a complete guide of Pokemon by catching all of them.  In order to beat the game, you only need the first 150 Pokemon, however, there is also a legendary number 151 Mew.  You catch Pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it, then catching it with a Pokeball.  Once you catch a Pokemon, you may use it to fight others, but you can only have up to 6 Pokemon at a time.  Along the way, you will encounter other trainers you may battle.  There are regular trainers, which you battle only for money, fun, and experience.  However, there are also gym leaders, which are specialized trainers with stronger Pokemon than regular trainers in their area have.  There are 8 in all, and once you beat them, you may then battle the elite four, who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession.  You also encounter your rival throughout the game.  And he becomes Pokemon League Champion, however, once you defeat him, you become Pokemon League Champion.  There are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well.  Their boss is also the leader of gym 8.  I have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what you're doing, however, the elite 4 is very tough, especially since you have to face them all toghether.  There are also legendary Pokemon, which are considered to be part of the 151 total, and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch.  Also, one cool thing is there is a lot of moves(although some are kind of stupid) and certain Pokemon have strengths over others.  For example, fire takes out grass easily.  However, you can beat the game just by having stronger Pokemon, however, this is actually harder than using strategy.  Because it takes a great length of time to level up, while a skilled player can quickly catch a Pokemon with a type advantage.  And to the guy who said he beat this game in a hour....if you think this game is easy, than you should quit playing videogames altoghether, because you obviously are such a great master of everything.  Also, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME IN A HOUR!  AT MINIMUM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT FOR AT LEAST LIKE 20 HOURS FOR YOUR POKEMON TO BE HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TOO!  Oh, wait, you must have used a gameshark.  Wow, no wonder you are so good at videogames.  But if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour, they either cheated, found a big glitch, or both.  Or else their exaggerating.  But the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide.  ""Oh this game is so easy, I only had to read 50 books on it to beat it on the first try.""  GET REAL!  IF THIS ISN'T A CHALLENGE, NOTHING IS!  Overall, its a great game, but there are some annoying things.  First off, to get all 151, you must trade with freinds, as neither red nor blue has every Pokemon, but they do combined.  Most Pokemon are in both versions, but some are exclusive to either red or blue.  Also, as you level up your Pokemon, they evolve(which is really more accurately described as metamorphises), and some only evolve by trading them with the same Pokemon with another player.  Another thing is there is only one save slot. Finally, in the Japenese version, by getting the first 150, you get number 151,but in the US version you can only get them through Nintendo's promotions or by cheating.  Hmm, giving Americans a raw deal, aye Nintendo?  You know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games.  In Japan, gamers would be outraged, but you know you can take advantage of us Americans?  Okay, go ahead.  But despite the fact that it isn't as good as the Japenese version or a perfect game, Pokemon Red is still one of my favorites.",4.0
"Let us be honest with ourselves. This is an old game. And yet it rocks most hard, say thankee. It's also highly addictive.

The point of Pokemon is simple: catch cute, little, animated talking monsters with magic, plastic balls, and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies. So in truth, it's a lot like real life.

Plus, said monsters are fully changeable. You can give them a name, teach them special fighting skills, and even control how much they grow. This makes them much better than hamsters as pets go.

Plus, its got ninjas! I'm not only talking about a ninja master who uses Pokemon to duel you (I guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff), I also mean you can name you Pokemon things like: Mifune or Hayabusa or Zatoichi or Swordsman with an Umbrella (that probably won't fit). Of course, you can also name it Winky-dinky-do, if it do please ya. But I digress.

Yes, Pokemon shows its age among modern video games. But so does Pong. And Pong is still mildly amusing. But without Pong, there'd be no Pokemom. And without Pokemon, there'd be no modern video gamage. And without video games, I'd have to actually face my family, friends and problems, and learn actual skills! So play Pokemon! It's better than Pong, and many other video games. Trust me. I've been there.",4.0

"I have no idea why I still play Pokemon from time to time.  I was into it before it became popular, and I still enjoy the games (not the cards... ...) more than 2 years after the fad breathed it's last.  Yes, new titles have been coming out, but no one seems to like them very much and they are not changing the game enough to make them worth buying.
  Anyway, about the game.  You start out as a young boy living with your mother, and set out to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer.  When you try to leave town, Professer Oak will give you a starter Pokemon (the only real difference between this one and Yellow is that in Yellow, you MUST start with Pikachu).  Once you have picked one, you must battle your rival, and then you can leave.  The rest is obvious...
  The main reason I still like this game is that it has amazing, Zelda-esque depth to it.  Many puzzles, and 15 element types of Pokemon.  Certain types are stronger against others, while each type has its weaknesses, too. There are a total of 150 Pokemon to be caught.  However, some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue.  You must link to the Blue version to catch all 150!  (To make this easier, some people buy a Red AND Blue AND a Game Link Cable so they could complete the game on their own).
  Overall, this game is surprisingly fun and amusing, and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG (role-playing game) lovers.  Great game, so if you like RPGs or adventure games, get this one, if you don't already have it.",4.0

"By now every man, woman andchild has heard of pokemon, and it's reputation.  The cute little animals you catch in a ball and then force to fight eachother has captured the hearts of kids in America, and the wallets of parents.  Many people hate this game with out even giving it a try.  Why is that, the overly priced, merchandice, the barbaric card game (banned in many elementary schools and pre schools nation wide) and terrible TV show and average movies...  When looking at all the [stuff] it's easy to forget the concept, and enjoyment of the game itself.
The game is an RPG, meaning experience building and random battles, all in a quest (in this case) to become the best.  You have a rival (who you name) and the two of you compete through out the entire game.
because this is on Gameboy (before Color) the graphics are dull, plain, boring.  However after getting past that you have a very deep, very fun, and very addicting game.  Catching 151 of the creatures (151 through either gameshark or Pokemon Conventions) and in these cases it is a little difficult to put the game down.
Overall the game is worth playing because it is a lot of fun, forget the [stuff] that it spawned and play the first game, if you are an RPG Fan you will not be disapointed.",4.0
"This red hot version of the Pokemon Game Boy game is sure to be a top-seller. If you're looking for a game where you can battle tough and have fun at the same time, then this is the game for you. The storyline goes something like this....... You are a trainer from Pallet Town. In the beggining, you are given a choice of three basic pokemon. Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle. All have their weaknesses and resistances. Charmander is good because he will beat grass type pokemon easiest but, Bulbasaur will be bad against these pokemon. However- Bulbasaur will be your best bet if you want to beat the rock type pokemon of Brocks. All round- Squirtle is your best bet. On your journey, youll catch new pokemon, fight new trainers and face up against real tough gym leaders! As the game progresses, your pokemon will evolve:eg- Sqirtle into Wartortle. However you can cancel this at any time by pushing the B button. Search around in grassy areas - you could find a common Pidgey- but you might find a really rare pokemon. There are many different areas and cities. In each city- youll battle a gym leader and if you win, youll win a badge.

"This type of RPG was easy to master, because at the start of the game, I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match.  I used him in the first 2 stages of the game, but sometimes the rest of the game.  Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type, it will either say ""It's super effective"" or ""It's not very effective""  Otherwise, this game's a blast to play, with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from.  Go buy them both.  You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver.",4.0

"I originally played this game on the PC, and having played this alternative port to the Nintendo 64, I find that one better overall. The graphics aren't quite as good, and the PC game plays more than just the three same tracks over and over again. But gameplay-wise, it's a lot of fun.",4.0

I am not much of a star wars fan but this game is fun. I found it for $3 at a used game store. It was worth it. Its actually more fun when playing multiplayer and with the steering wheel. I also enjoyed the star wars game shadow of the empire.,4.0
"the game worked just fine and was just as i expected, any star wars game is a crowd pleaser in our house",4.0
This was a great buy for the N64. I was inspired to buy this game after seeing the movie scene with the Podracing. So all an all you start off as a noob and work your way to the top buying parts for your pod. You can choose from many racers. I give this game the rating that it got for its fun with some frustrating races.,4.0
"This is a very fun game, possibly the best ""racing game"" I have played. I normally find them very dull, ""Nascar 64 anyone?"" However, as a racing game, I enjoyed this immensely.

Here is the flipside. This game is not NEAR as good as, say Hydro Thunder, or Need for Speed. The best thing about this game is the multiplayer, as the single player gets old fast.

My reccomendation, find a friend, rent the game, and have fun!",4.0
"Well, I love moving this fast in a vgame. I enjoyed playing in the Tatooine course, and the made-up levels actually seem like real STAR WARS designs, unlike Rogue Squadron 2. Often you're racing through a level, and you kind of want to stop playing....but you don't, because you want to make the next turn, or just love peacefully gliding over the land at that speed. I never got into tuning up the racers, maybe there's something lacking there. You aren't often right beside the other pod, it would have been nice to implement an element of slamming into the other pod to have a fun/dangerous fight while performing the race, if that option were here and was fun, it would provide an all-new level of depth/excitement to the game, maybe if you had to avoid Subulba like the film. I thought I heard there will be a sequel to this game, hopefully they will optimize it for the next-gen systems like Xbox, because they didn't when this was merely ported to Sega Dreamcast. A sequel would make a cool online game, but make they could introduce AOTC areas or make a 3-4 more Tatooine levels. The graphics here are very smudgey, I would advise getting the PC or DC version or something, but it's worth getting as it is so [inexpensive] now.",4.0

With practice and upgrades to your racer(s) you  certainly can go *really* fast...I've seen a bunch of my friends have a  zippy time playing this game.  Me, I'm just not so good at it.  So, be  warned.  If you're the type that gives up when things are too hard, then  don't get this game.  If you like hard games and are willing to invest the  time to get good at them...then this game would make you happy.  Race on!",4.0

Second, I have to say my favorite character on the game and forever will be Yoshi (who I believe outnumbers and can destroy Mario, Luigi, Kirby, Donkey Kong and the rest of the gang in a very short amount of time without breaking a sweat).

its great tons of choices of your favorite charictars and level select its controls are pretty simple but it may take some time if you are younger thiers item select for favorite things you want and they tell you how the charachtars were made and theirs no blood or anything goorey like that but its not real fun with just one player thats why i gave it four stars,4.0
"If you've got a Nintendo 64 you've gotta get this game! You can play as almost all of your favorite video game charactors, such as Donkey Kong, Picachu, Mario, Yoshi ect. This is deffently a must buy game!",4.0
"I didn't start playing this game until my sophmore year of college (2001-02).  Having gotten a late start, I quickly became obsessed, and I was not alone.  My frat brothers also became obsessed.  Devoted players joined our frat, because they recognized their fellow obsessors.  As it stands, there are 5 of us now who have nearly perfected this subtle game.  We all have at least two characters we can play with well.  My personal favourite is Kirby, who I consider to be the best at dealing out pain, and instantly executing people with what we call a ""smack-down"".  His defenses are a little weaker.  Pikachu is the best over all player, followed by Ness, the cheapest, but second best.  Samus is another one close to my heart.  The release of the Gamecube version of Smash, known as Melee, did much to draw the loyal N64 Smash crowd away, but it is not quite up to par with the N64 game in terms of playability.  The timing required to play the N64 game is so precise, so infinitely perfectable, that one never tires of playing the game.  I presently have an N64, 4 contollers, and one cartridge: Smash Brothers.  I will never need another cartridge (although Goldeneye was a great game).",4.0
"Super Smash Brothers is one of the most unique ideas to hit the gaming world since first person shooters featured deathmatch.  For this game it features numerouse memorable nintendo characters such as Link, MArio, Pikachu, Samus Arron, Fox Mcloud and more in basically a battle royal.  The real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle.  The action is almost always intense.  However I do have a few complaints about the game.
1: Character Diversity.  On the primary roster Three of the 8 basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe (Donkey Kong, Yoshi, MArio) and then Luigi as a hidden characeter.  So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked (a royal pain in the ***) one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe.
2: Story Mode: Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights, one on one, an army of characters, tag team, handicap, so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a (What you thought I was going to spoil the ending).
So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over, however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party.",4.0
This game was highly dispicable.  I had a horrible time playing super smash bros.  the game was extremely boring and it had no point in it.  all i did was fight against other stupid cartoon characters.  i think this game gets a four ONLY because it is extremely easy...so i was able to beat it.  the bad part about it being easy is that i can not concentrate and get a good full length time of playing because it is so very dull.  thank for this opportunity to express my feelings about this horrible..terrifying game.,4.0
"Super Smash Brothers is a good game. This is a game where you are a character and you have special abilities and you fight with other people. I think it's good because if you don't have a friend or two to play Super Smash Brothers with, you can play against the computer. You don't have all the characters at first you have to beat a certain section to get a certain character. I still haven't gotten back all of the characters. I think that there are like 5 or 6 characters to get.",4.0
"My brother and I rented this game numerous times and in the end finally decided to buy it. It is actually quite fun to play, with many arenas and many of the famous characters from Nintendo. Each character basically has their own arena, and all of the arenas have their advantages and disadvantages. This game is especially recommended as a gift for a child.
What I love about this game is that you can play with as many computers as you want, and they can be against you, or if you want to have fun they can be on your team. You can have timed battles or die from losing lives.
Pros:
1) Fun multiplayer action
2) Computer feature is great---you can set computers skill level
3) Good training level, where you can control many things, and add items and make the computer do things to help you train
4) Just Great!!
Cons:
1) Certain characters are hard to get (like Ness)
2) Less advanced than Super Smash Bros Melee
3) Controls are sometimes difficult
This is a great gift for anyone who is young (especially) and for anyone with a N64.",4.0
"This game is pretty good, but after a while it just seems repetitive.",4.0
"Ok, I'm really tired, so this'll be a short review.  Its really great, in adventure you get to fight lots of assorted people, and in vs, you get to pick your character to fight against an opponent.  I played it with my brother for about 1000 vs mode matches, and now I'm bored with it.  It lasts, but once you unlock all the secrets, and play vs a lot, it does get boring.",4.0
"This is a great personal combat game, especially for children.  I much prefer Tekken, but this game is also fun.  There is no blood or gore.  You chose from characters that star in other Nintendo games, and each has their own powers.  My sons (ages 6, 8 and 10) love this game.  Highly recommended for children (and adults)!",4.0
"In this game there are several different things to do.  One is fight another player(or several other players).  Two is practise against the computor.  And three is a one player game agaist the computor.  In the one player game you go against about ten players played by the computor.  If you beat the final boss(the Master Hand) you can fight a mystery player.  If you beat this mystery player you get to fight with him.  These four mystery players are:Loigy, Ness, Captain Falcon, and Jigglypuff.  Aside from these mystery players you can fight with eight players you get at the start.  At the most you can verse three other players.",4.0
"This game is okay but the way you get secret caracters is HORRIBLE! They tease you over and over again and once you  finally get to battle the secret caracter they set him on UNBEARABLY HARD so you CAN""T get him. HOW ANNOYING!!! So if you want this game because of it's secret caracters,you do NOT want this game(The only secret caracter you'll get is Jigglypuff and I HATE Jigglypuff). Overall, this game isn't to bad.",4.0
"a great game for 2 or more players. when i first played this game, it was really fun an challenging. after a while though it gets boring. if you play it alot it gets too easy and its not as fun anymore. if your going to play it you really need at least 2 players",4.0
"Super Smash Bros is an interesting fighting game. It shows people how the company thinks nintendo game characters can fight. There are characters from the old SNES and the present N64. It is a fun game but eventually you'll get sick of it. The graphics are pretty bad, and there is hardly a variety of moves, but it's fun. There are secret people, hidden levels, etc. It is challenging and is much more fun with 2+ people. It is frustrating with one player if you try it to hard. There are no combos or health bars. At the bottom it will show how many lives each player has and how much damage is on him. Unlike other fighting games the only way to kill people is by knocking them off the edge or by hitting the so far up they go out of sight. It doesn't take off of any fighting games and is probably one of the best N64 has to offer.",4.0
"All the moves in this game are wonderfully easy. If you learn one, you learn them all. But you have to master the nuiances of the characters to be able to play well. As a multiplayer game, there are very few games that compare to this one, but as anything else, it gets old quickly.",4.0
"Ready to stray away from the classic arcade-style fighting games? GET-READY-TO...RUMBLE! You can bash it out with your fave Nintendo characters; including Yoshi, Fox, Mario and Luigi, Samus, and Pokemon! This games has five great modes to play in: Really Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Really Hard.  By beating the game in different ways, you'll get a new character! As an added bonus, you even get a secret fighting arena! Now that's game for you're money.
Graphic-wise, this game is nothing to marvel at.  Characters often appear boxy and backgrounds are virtually 2-D.  Everything is very clear, and size isn't usually a problem - except when you've got one too many characters on the screen.
As a one player game, I say clearly that it sucks.  No offense to lovers of this great N64 fighting game.  One player mode travels by very quickly, and gets repetative.  But heck, just like any good fighting game one player's not the meat of the game.  THIS GAME WAS MEANT TO BE MULTI-PLAYER.  As a multi-player game, despite the size, its solid and great fun.
On to the *drumroll please* music.  Music fits very well for each level, but does tend to get annoying.  That's the flat-out answer...
So, you ask me, should I buy it? Sure.  If you like arcade-style fighting games, wanna twist on the classics, and are ready for some humor and fun with friends, go for it! Game's not expensive, and doesn't require an expansion pack.  It's defiantly a game worth you're money!",4.0
"What can I say? Smash Bros. is just an awesome game. This is the only game you can get where all of your favorite Nintendo characters come together on one screen and battle it out. I recommend calling over 3 more of your buddies and playing it because this game is nuts when 4 players go head to head.
Overall I give Mario Smash Bros. 4 stars. I took off a star because after you obtain the 4 missing characters, the game is basically over. You can still battle with your friends, but like most games, it starts to get old after a while. I recommend it for ages 5 - 15.",4.0
"SSB is an original fighter that is always fun to play. It has four unlockable characters, one unlockable arena, and some other secerets. The only bad part is it is a little to easy(even on very hard). But this game is addicitive. Short Version: Graphics: 4.4 Sound: 4.2 Control: 4.3 Fun Factor: 4.7 Total: 4.4",4.0
"This is a great family-safe game with the appeal of a ""fighter"" game without the realistic violence of a ""Tekken"" or ""Mortal Kombat"". Additionally, all of the arenas are considerably larger than the traditional ""fighter"" genre, giving the game the reminiscent feel of the classic ""Joust"" game. My 9-year-old son, my wife and I often play 3 player matches against each other and we have a blast! If you're a Video Game Family, this is a can't-miss!",4.0
"I say that because you cannot lose complete interest in this game.
The main feature is its Multiplayer mode.  The idea is a simple ""King-Of-The-Hill"" game where you throw others of the platform while keeping your own ground.  And with four players playing, there's bound to be some serious fun. However, the moves are all set to pressing B or just Up+B.  No confusing moves to remember or circling of the control-stick.  A 5 year old child can become a master of the game.
Not only that, but the one-player games are great too.  Beat your way through several different fights and mini games to win.  Also, if you complete certain tasks, you may win different options and characters!
My advice is if you have a bunch of friends (yound or old, boys or girls, gamers or non-gamers) and you want all of you to enjoy a game.  Get this one.  In a few minutes you'll all be double-jumping and back-throwing each other to infinite.",4.0

They like the two player option. They like the challenge  (they're not teens yet). They like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games. They like being able to set their and the opponent's  skill levels. They just love this game!
I personally wish it were a  little less violent, but compared to other games out there, this is a  teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of, buy this  game.",4.0

"Total Meltdown is the console version of Duke Nukem 3D with an additional scenario (but not the Plutonium Pack).
Duke has just been shot down to find aliens in control of Earth and they are trying to take out women.  This does not make Duke happy so he must try and stop the aliens.
Play is in first-person shooter mode (like in Doom) and handles pretty nicely.  Added to this game, and missing from so many shooters, is a level of humor as Duke wisecracks his way through the game.  The controls are not bad but luckily you never have to run, shoot, jump to stay alive.  You always seem to have some time to remember the L1, L2, R1 and R2 buttons.
All in all this was a very successful port of the PC game to a console.  Games load and save at about the same speed as the original did at its release.",4.0
"Today i saw this game at the store for 12 bucks, and i'm gonna pick it up since i have a PS2. I rented it 2 times (after that the dumb stores got rid of their copies) and it was better than the sega saturn version. The graphics didn't have the neat lighting effects, but the game was a whole lot more like the pc version. If you have a PC get that version, if you have a ps2 get this version, or both. I'm probably one of the biggest Duke fans in my area, i have the origional Duke 3D for PC, the Atomic Edtion , The sega saturn version(my 1st copy), Duke Manhatten Project, Time to Kill, Land of the Babes, the Duke Nukem album, all of the Duke Nukem action figures, The Duke Nukem screen saver pack, and now this. As the great Duke would say ""Holy S@$T!"" Any way if you are one of the few who don't have a PS2 yet here's what will happen to this game.. You know how these losers say the game looks flat? Lie! You know how they say the N64 version looks better? They fogot to tell you the game is cut up (no nude chix), and the textures are super-low res. But with this vesion, when you set up your PS2 for smooth texture mapping, it will make all the ""2D"" images get smooth edges, and the textures will be nice and smooth. Since the game is almost all sprites(which isn't realy a bad thing at all, easier to edit on pc) Every image on screen will look close to a PS2 game! The reason i don't give this 5 stars is because you can't edit it like the PC version.",4.0
"I agree, Gameboy has been around an awfully long time, but it's still got some great games like Zelda and Final Fantasy Adventure.
The Neo Geo is  superior, but beware, because Neo Geo is reportedly no longer producing the  pocket system. So if you are looking for something that is going to be  around for a while stick to game boy.
We've all seen systems that have  been dropped where nothing new ever came out of them again. (Atari Jaguar,  Sega Saturn, etc.)",4.0
"Although the Game Boy Advance is on the way, the original Game Boy (here in 'Colour' form) is still going strong, and is still the only mainstream  hand-held console.
Compared with the sadly-missed Neo Geo Pocket the  screen is slightly less vibrant, and sorely needs a backlight (although  adding one would decimate the battery life). Technically, although the NGP  was 16-bit, there doesn't seem to be much difference, and in any case it's  the quality of the games that's important. This is the Game Boy's strength  - it has an enormous, ever-growing range of games, some of which is  excellent (the third 'Wario' game, for example, or 'R-Type DX', a faithful  recreation of 'R-Type' on a tiny screen). There are some more esoteric  applications, too, including a camera, a sonar (really), productivity  software, and a sequencer (as used on Alec Empire's 'We Punk  Einheit').
As a possession, it's highly desirable - it's small, stylish  and easy to hold, and apart from the fragile battery cover, it seems very  solid. It's slightly bulkier than the Game Boy Pocket, but not  off-puttingly so, and keenly-priced, too. Only the high price of the  cartridges could put people off, but with several million Game Boys out  there (many of which are presumably restricted to playing 'Tetris' and  nothing else), there is a thriving second-hand market.",4.0

"I've always loved playing Super Mario. It was a video game I grew up with as a girl. The less than perfect graphics, some of the repetitive themes throughout the game...I love all the nostalgia. The only reason I'm giving this only 4 stars is unfortunately the seller was somewhat deceptive. Don't get me wrong, the condition and time it arrived were both great. However, the seller had listed the game as 'new'. Not in 'like new condition' or 'used' but new. I was a little annoyed that when I got the game there were already a lot of things already saved on there. I guess I'm just a little picky in that when a seller describes the condition their product being sold is in, I expect it to actually be in that condition. Again, the game plays great, but like new and new definitely don't count as the same kind of conditions.",4.0

"If Gran Turismo had been an arcade game first, R4 might just be what it would have been. Ridge Racer Type 4 returns the series to its less-realistic roots after the uneven (but decent,) Rage Racer, but still adds enough new stuff to make it stick out in the post-Gran Turismo world of racing games. Why does it stick out? Because it remembers not to be TOO real. See, if I want a truly ""real"" driving experience, that's what the cars parked outside are for. R4 remembers to be fun first, real second...but it's a close second. The physics of the game are tight, and the graphics are about as good as PS1 gets. The premise of racing for a team is a good story point (a point that most racing games skip altogether,) and also gives you a weird sense of responsibility when you win or lose a race. The car selection is both a good thing and a bad thing. The variety is outstanding, with dozens and dozens of different customizable designs, including some really neat hidden stuff. Unfortunately, the Gran Turismo effect has to be addressed here, as none of the cars are based on actual models. You can tell what a few of them are based on, but after Test Drive and Gran Turismo spoiled us all with real cars from the real manufacturers, generic stuff knocks a star off of this one. But other than that, it's a true gamer's game, and is a worthy substitute for GT when you're tired of sweating over getting a license just to get anywhere in the game. Plus, it's now a ""Greatest Hits"" title, and the price is very, very nice if you're not moving up from your PS1 for a while. A keeper.",4.0
"Graphics: 8/10 - Ridge Racer Type 4 is plausible in this area. The car designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and well-crafted.
Sound: 9/10 - Fantastic! Not too much of this comes from the cars themselves, but the groovy soundtrack, great commentator and crashing sounds give this baby a boost!
Value: 7/10 - A fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better. But in this genre, we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them instead.
Overall: 8/10 - What can I say? I thought this was a blast. It was fun, energetic and speedy. A good instalment to the Ridge Racer series. The cars were brilliant and the Great Gran Prix is the best part. However, Ridge Racer Type 4 loses points because it is simply too much like Gran Turismo and you might tire of its same-old routine. Still lots of fun and recommended!",4.0
An essential item for any  game user and I LOVE the color!!!!!,4.0
I recieved this game as a gift at the same time i got my gameboy color and it was a lot of fun and quite challenging. Now about 2 years later i have beaten the game but there is still much more to do on here. I found no faults with the game ( i wasn't looking for say.. the screen not being big enough) it was a lot of fun and there are many bonus things to do afterwards.,4.0
OK,4.0
Condition wise color was faded and a bit dirty but screen works and same with the audio so I give it a 4.5,4.0
I little scratch but it works great. Great value and quality for an used game boy.,4.0
"Came in pretty quickly by my surprise actually, Lime green exactly, worked and still works.
However when I got it in it was dirty I had to clean it. It had black smears all over the back as if someone with dirty hands was holding it or left it somewhere for a bit and then dirty hands handled and no one cleaned it prior to shipping it which was kinda gross lolol and annoying.

Photo is what I did which was add sparkles to it :3 there is a glitter spray about 8$ at Walmart that can go on surfaces fabric so on and I covered the screen and sprayed let sit for the day and that's the outcome. Some of the black stuff that came on it when opened wouldn't get off you can see a smudge of it left corner which is also why I sprayed it it had other spots and I didn't like them, the photo didn't show black smudges on it so that was a surprise but easy fix from my crafty self it works came quickly so could be worse !",4.0

"For anyone who remembers the classic gameplay of the origional Super Mario Bros. for your old 8 bit Nintendo Entertainment System back in the mid 80's  rejoice, its back!  The simple nature of this game makes it so wonderful.  Its easy for players of all ages and skills to learn very quickly, but will  take hours to master.  Super Mario Bros. is a true Video game origional.  Its simply was the first well executed game of its kind.  A side scrolling  adventure game, with tasks to be completed that require skill and paitence,  not just mindless button mashing.
The Game Boy color version is no  different.  It is a perfect translation of this timeless classic, so give  it a whirl and fall in love all over again!",4.0

"No matter what you type into the description box, a customer still expects to see an actual photo of what they are buying. The photos used here were not of the item purchased, they were taken from someone else's sale of a nicer system. But that aside, I received what I expected; a GameBoy in need of some TLC and that's just what it'll get. I can't wait to fix it up.",4.0
"Item arrived about 5 days late, but there WAS a snow storm. Also it was a lot more worn than advertised, but it is fully functional and I'm very satisfied. I just wouldn't have paid as much as I did if I knew all of this beforehand.",4.0
"The gameboy works great and it was accurately described. It was shipped on time, but not as fast as expected. The description also led me to believe that there would be other things coming along with the system (cable, case, and two games). None of which ever came. He was apologetic for the mix up and stated he never intended for those to be a part of the sale process, but he did offer to refund the transaction. I would strongly suggest that you send this person an email to find out what you're actually buying before you purchase something.",4.0
"im doing this review well after this item is gone but from what i can remember it worked great.
it was a good buy.",4.0
Really great for an old school Game Boy Color. It has very few scratches on the screen but the battery case is still there. Despite the minor astetic wears it plays well and the volume works perfectly. I would have given this five stars but the scratches were a minor problem that stopped me from doing so.,4.0
"Game Boy Color works perfectly, has sound, a little scratched but only if you look close, but all in all I'm so excited I got it today.",4.0
I gave this as a gift to a friend who needed a new one. She says it works great and looks good..,4.0
"I was skeptical of buying a used game boy color because I have seen how some people have treated this system, and it is not as kindly as I have babied mine throughout its 15 years on this earth. Once I received this product, I put batteries in it and it didn't turn on, so of course I thought I was scammed. After another minute or two of swapping batteries in and out of it, it turned on and now I have no issues. Now I can traded all of the pokemon I want from Red to Silver and vice versa!",4.0
"The start button is sometimes hard to get working, and the back is missing. But I'm really not complaining, it's fantastic and works perfectly!",4.0
I got it for my daughter and she loves it. So get one of your own so you can be cool like her.,4.0
"This product is in perfect quality. The screen is in perfect condition, though not as bright as it seems in the product picture. The atomic purple coloring is also not as vibrant, but that is not the companies fault. That is simply how Nintendo made them. I'm a pleasantly pleased with this product and will be purchasing from this selller again.",4.0
I brought this product for my son. He thoroughly  enjoys it. He plays the game all the time. I would recommend it.,4.0
"I got this for a few reasons. To relive my childhood and to play my gamboy games the right way. It came the same day as the game I ordered and though it had a nik or two on it, it still looked pretty and clean. Great product. Plus it had a new screen which was a nice little bonus for me.",4.0
This worked great. Although I was a little scared when I first got it because it wouldn't work I just popped the batteries out and back in and it worked perfectly. I was surprised that they sold it so cheaply because a brand new one was highly expensive. So I would say that this was a great deal for what I got and they got it to me before I was expecting it to be here too without me having to pay extras for shipping.,4.0
"This wa a gift my grandson asked for.  As near as I know, he loves it!  Been looking for one in good shape fo a few years and this fit the bill!  Great seller too.  Really stood behind the game boy.  Honest and would do business with them again.",4.0
"Fast shipping, good product. I was surprised that the back looked as warn as it did but it probably mentioned it in the description. Overall great for what I paid.",4.0
"I'm so happy to have a gameboy again after mine broke years ago,and fotlr that, I'm thankful. The one thing that wasn't mentioned was the fact that the Gameboy is kind of dirty...since thos is the atomic purple version, you can see all the pieces of whatever that are under the controls, and at the top, there is a very thin line of some brownish- looking crust. I'm aware tgat I bought cheap, but it would've been nice to know in advance what I was getting. I'll be cleaning it soon.",4.0
It works really well and showed up on time the only weird thing about it is if you have a cable connector in it. The game boy will not show the picture of the game. ( i mean the light comes on and the game turns on but nothing appears on screen). Over all it works fine. It's a very good product,4.0
I was happy with my product as it is in perfect working condition as advertised. I love my new game boy,4.0
"i bought this for a gift first off
the used gamboys don't come with a back FYI other than that its good.  so have fun but you must remember that if  you intended on purchasing the used version NO BACK COVER",4.0
I'm completely happy with this game boy! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the screen is a little scratched up and the D- pad is squeaky; but what can you expect from a used device? It works perfectly and it really takes me back to my childhood.,4.0
"This works great with my MegaMemoryCard! When i was backing up a file on my MMC on my new GameBoy color the battery died in my GBC so my save data was lost.
SO put NEW batteries in Your GBC before you use the ones yours comes with.
But anyway Money well spent the GameBoy Color is awesome.",4.0
"I bought the Game Boy Color because I lost my original one. I was a little fed up with my nintendo DS, because I think most the games really aren't that special. However, all of the pokemon games made for gameboy color are excellent. I also bought Hamtaro Hams Hams Unite- which is another great and actually challenging game- and played for hours!",4.0
The gameboy color I ordered for my son was great! I had ordered one from someone on Ebay and it would constantly turn off by itself on him so I sent it back.  Thankfully I found this site that offered the same thing and it has played flawlessly ever since!,4.0
"I bought this for my daughter and she LOVES THIS THING!!!!! Thank you, Nintendo! The only complaint I have about it is the dark screen. She has to play it with the bright light on next to her. Other than that, I'm glad I bought it for her. I recommend this product to Game Boy fans everywhere!",4.0
"the product has been great, except the sounding is not working well anymore.don't know why. disappointed.",4.0
"I liked this thing. It played in color, but used up batteries fast. The sound isn't all that great (too quiet), and the screen scratches easily.",4.0
this isn't bad i have it and it works great i think this is better then alot of older systems like game boy or super nt but still its a good system.,4.0
"It's very fun to play with anytime, any where(especially on a trip). It's so fun that my sister wanted one.",4.0
"About two years ago I bought a GBC (GameBoy Color) for the Pokemon titles. Then I discoverd tons of other games that I enjoy! GBC is perfect for long and boring road trips. And if you have to go to a boring wedding or even church (amen) you can turn down the sound or stick in headphones and bother no one and help you to not fall asleep! It fits comfortably in your pocket. (even though it is slightly larger than the GameBoy Pocket) The graphics are wonderful!(for a system like this) Way better thn GBP or GB! You can play all GameBoy games on it (except for advance) and it adds a little color to regular games and a lot of color to GBC games. Lots of people are playing into the GameBoy Advance (GBA) but it isn't that much better. I've played one at the store. GBA is way heavier, it doesn't fit in your hands as easy as GBC and the graphics are barely better. So just buy a GBC it is cheaper and there are more color choices!!! (i like teal, kiwi and dandelion:)",4.0
"For the 20+ crowd it becomes useful in situations like long flights, just be sure to buy ""complex"" game titles like zelda, or you'll be dissapointed with the short and easy games. Perfect to rotate with a good business or computer/software book (400 pages max. or you will struggle to read it on a plane) and your laptop. Almost forgot: Remember to buy a light for these one, and a couple of extra batteries.",4.0
"The problem with GBC is that the screen is really difficult to see. Also the screen protector is reflective, if you put light above it, you will see the light source very easily, which makes the screen even more difficult to see. Maybe I am too picky, but my eye hurts after playing after a while.
The case is tall in height and narrow in width which makes holding it while playing games tiresome.
It looks like the new ""Gameboy advance"" solves the two problems and I will get one when it is available and retire GBC.",4.0
The Gameboy Colors' sound isn't all that good even at full volume but other than that it's all good. Good color for a little package. If you didn't know instead of having 4 batteries like the orginal Color has 2.,4.0
I like the gameboy color because it is portable and fun to use. it has 1 or 2 draw backs I'll name one. The screen is not backlit but a good part to this is because it's not backlit the batteries last longer. GameBoy Color compared to Neo-Geo Pocket Color is better because it has a bigger selection of games. And because it isn't backlit the colros don't bleed together so its easier to read.,4.0
"I bought a Gameboy to entertain my children and me when we are traveling.  I'm not sure why reviews of the ""dandelion"" Gameboy are different  from the ""teal"" Gameboy, but I bought the teal.  First, my  7-year-old loves this game!  I bought Super Mario Deluxe to go with this  and she had never seen it before.  I enjoy this game, too.  The small size  of the Gameboy is amazing.  This is the 8-bit gaming that used to require a  TV and a large plastic box.  Now, the Gameboy Color will easily fit in your  pocket.  And, the picture quality is comparable to what you used to see on  TV.  However, it's not all a paradise.  In low light conditions, the screen  is invisible without a supplemental light.  I read about this in other  reviews and I bought the worm light to go with it.  These work and come in  matching colors, but there is a definite drawback.  They don't illuminate  the whole screen and there is a definite glare on the screen.  You must  move the Gameboy around to create the best light condition at the spot on  the screen you want to see.  There are other lights available and I would  like to try them to see if there is an improvement in quality.  Still, this  is a fun game.  This console is relatively cheap and very portable.  This  will be perfect on long, boring plane and car trips.  So, I recommend you  buy this console.  It doesn't come with any games, so be sure to buy a game  at the same time.  It does come with batteries, though.  And, you will need  a light to see the screen unless you only want to play outside on sunny  days.",4.0
"Street Fighter Alpha 3 - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- Good Balanced 2D fighter, considered a classic to many hardcore 2D fighting fans

- Lots of modes to unlock and lots of fighters to choose from

BAD:

- Loading times, very short but still there

- Graphics might be dated for some people

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- Not over the top like Guilty Gear X/X2, Marvel Vs Capcom, or Capcom Vs SNK

- Old School type game play and not combo heavy

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- King of fighters 2000 and up

- Fatal Fury: Mark of Wolves

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Last game in the Street Fighter ""Alpha"" franchise (as of 1999)

- Has all fighters from Street Fighters Alpha 1 and 2 as well as a few from the old time Street Fighter's like Street Fighter II: The world Tour

- Street Fighter Alpha is called Street Fighter Zero in Japan

- Practicality same game on Sega Dreamcast",4.0
"SFA3 is good. It has great graphics, it doesn't take forever to load, and theres lots of extra things and choices you can do and lots of characters. It is very hard but it's still a fun game! Get it, It's worth endless hours of fun.",4.0

"Street fighter alpha 3 is an ok game. Its not as good as the older versions.  If you want a great fighting game get tekken3  ehgeriz, or  marvel vs street fighter.  I still reccomed this game though renting or  buying.  A problem is each fighter in the game does not have a lot of  moves.",4.0
The joystick was working fine and I liked using it. My problem is that it broke at the base and I have been trying to get a new one from the company. They have not respond to three e-mails I sent them.,4.0
This joystick is a very good stick for the gamer . I fly the Sims and aircraft type games and have used several joysticks. This one is the most accurate I have used. Is sad Microsoft has stopped making them. Cons.....Not enough programable buttons.,4.0
"I am confused by the claims that this joystick does not work with XP.  XP is plug-and-play: just hook up the USB adapter and plug the thing in.  It registers perfectly.  Go to control panel and mess with the calibration and test all your buttons - that works perfectly as well.  One drawback in not being able to use the W95 software is a lack of ability to reprogram the buttons - no biggie since most software will let you do the same, but I dropped one star for that reason.  XP users - don't concern yourself with the disk that comes with the joystick, just plug the thing in and get on with the games!",4.0
"After having tested several joysticks, this is the one I kept coming back to.  I've had a version of this joystick on my system for two years, and have yet to find anything better.  I don't at all agree with the ......  editorial review that says it's got stiff joystick movement.  Quite to the  contrary, it's capable of very subtle movement.
Plus, it's got lots of  features without being over-engineered. I especially like the fact that it  comes with both throttle and rudder control within easy reach.  The button  cluster on the stick itself is very sensibly designed, with all major  buttons a comfortable distance apart.  The hat is cleverly devised as well,  being both solid and flexible.  Most importantly, perhaps, the software,  now at least two years old, is very stable, and allows you complete control  over each button.
Yet, there are some people who might not find this  product enjoyable.  As others have commented, it is a very  right-hand-centric design.  Since there are a host of buttons on the  left-hand side of the base, you can't hold the joystick in your left hand  and access those buttons without crossing your hands.  Also, the cluster of  buttons on the joystick itself are designed to fit the right hand.  If  you're a right-handed person, this design is ergonomically perfect.  It  literally fits in the palm of your (right) hand.  But a left-handed person  has no business whatever buying this product.
Neither does a Mac owner.  This product's USB connectivity, though convenient to Windows users, does  not extend to the Mac.  That's an unfortunate oversight that, one suspects,  wouldn't be all that difficult to correct.
Still, if you only intend to  use this thing on a Windows machine, and if you're right handed, you'd be  hard-pressed to find a better joystick.",4.0
"This is a good product, but it did not include a Windows 98 driver -- not good.  I was already unhappy with Windows 98, so this was the clincher.  I went back to Windows 95.  This, of course, meant rebuilding my PC from scratch, but I have done this before so it was not a huge problem for me.  Then the V3 racing wheel installed just fine and does actually work very  nicely, especially for the price.  I assume Interact will create a driver  for Windows 98, if they have not already.",4.0
"I have owned this wheel for 8 or 9 years, still works, but when I bought it, it was the best deal for the money, comparing $40 to then $90 and up, but today, the best buy on the market has to be Logitech GP force feedback, for $69 and less.
Still for youngsters, the V3 works great, and as long as you don't try to use it as a paper weight, or stand on it it should last as mine has, and we have used it ""a bunch""",4.0
Alot of the reviews I've read on here have nothing to do with the wheel being bad. Its just that their computers just suck. If you have a decent computer and want a good cheap wheel with pedals than this is the one. Most of the reviews on here make it sound like they were wanting to get all the great functions and capability of a $150 wheel in this $40 wheel. The only problem I had was the tilt. It takes some getting used to. The pedals are alittle light so make sure u have something behind them to keep them from moving. Other than that I see no problems with it. It's worked for all my racing games and even my flight sims. Just remember your going to get what you pay for. IMO You get plenty for your money in this wheel. The button configuration are easily  used while driving and you can change the sensitivy of the wheel while playing the game. Its one of the best your gunna find for its price tag.,4.0
"The only problem is that there is no way to make it work in Win 98. This product is cool, for people that like car games. If anyone knows how to make it work in Win 98 please send me a E-mail to MichaelGarcia17@hotmail.com By the way I live in Azores you should visit it. It got`s the best food and the best view.",4.0
Worked well in my n64. Had needed more controllers and they were reasonable priced,4.0
Analog is slightly sticky but overall it works,4.0
"It was as described, scratches, plays well, pretty tight joystick,",4.0
"I bought my controller from gtsboy for $22.99. It came in good shape. You could tell it was used because the buttons moved easily and they weren't stiff (that's a good thing!). However, the joystick had a problem. The character would keep moving forward without the joystick being moved so I had to open it up and clean it a bit, but other than that it was a great buy!",4.0
"Thin plastic kinda turned me off but the stick was fine not perfect but it's how all my old controllers used to be. Worn in, and all buttons are responsive",4.0
It looks good. I haven't used it yet but I held it to try to remember how I used to hold it. I felt like the joystick was a little loose. I'll use the controller eventually but i might have to see if I can get that fixed.,4.0
It's a great controller! A little expensive but that was ok! It was delivered on time and in great condition!,4.0
"The outer-most layer of the wire was frayed at the end. I simply slapped some electric tape on it to prevent any furry animals destroying it in two seconds. Works perfectly, I was very adamant about having a significantly accurate joystick and this fits my perspective of a refurbished controller.

Was definitely not cleaned before shipping. Not too big of a deal, but really?",4.0
"Genuine N64 controller. Tight joystick and quick delivery. Product as described. Cable is in good condition. The product doesn't look as dark black as the controller in the image, but I'm not sure if that is because of wear or not.",4.0
It works to my expectations. I wish they Didn't demand a certain number of words since i don't have that much to say.,4.0
"A used original Nintendo brand N64 controllers is far superior than a new aftermarket brand controller. I've tried a few aftermarket brands and they end up falling apart (literally) are otherwise breaking while my used original Nintendo brand controllers still function. The main weak point of any original Nintendo brand N64 controller is the stick. This is almost always the part to fail, so much that sellers know a ""firm stick"" is a selling point. There is no question as to whether this will happen, but how long until you have to fix it... No worries, when your stick gets loose, buy a stick replacement. Replacing the stick is far less troublesome then some of the issues I've faced with the aftermarket brands. Completely satisfied with this purchase.",4.0
Bought this and May Flash N64 Controller Adapter for PC USB for My Laptop and after i installed it and googled how to set it up to work with games on my computer in a couple of minutes i had my new N64 controller all set up and ready to play games on my PC and i've used it many times and still works as good as the day i got it,4.0
Have not personally used 64 controller yet.  I'm sure it works fine.  Bought because dog chewed up the old one.,4.0

"I was very excited to find this game so cheap online, and was very satisfied with the condition of it and the speed in which it was delivered.

"A game for the Playstation that was released a couple of years ago didn't get huge media attention, but now that it can be found in bargain bins across the country, you should do yourself a favor and check it out. ""Abe's Oddworld Oddysee"" is a game of great imagination, fun, and immense challenge. In fact, some of the game may be two challenging. The basic game style is from a side view, with rooms, and in each room Abe has to figure out how to get something done. It's a puzzle game with an action twist, with a great story and a sequel hot in stores now. The main drawback is that this game may be in some ways too difficult for young children, or even for those without quick video game reflexes. But for the rest of us, check it out.

Pros:Fun, challenging, great story

Cons:Slightly repetitive, almost too challenging

"I purchased this game and it took longer than expected to get to our house. About a month. The disk is in good quality. The game plays well. the only problem was there is a green line down the right side of the screen sometimes, during the first two screen as the game gets started. I was very surprised with the product's overall quality. Very happy.",4.0
"I was thinking a lot about this game, I had played it at my brothers house a long time ago and wanted to get it.  No one carried it in the stores around me so I checked her on Amazon.com.  I found it at a great price and used and when it came it was in good condition with the case and book inside.  I am pleased and enjoy it when I have time to play.  This game makes me smile and the endless journeys are fun.",4.0

"This is a fun game that came out after the popular Dragon's Lair game. It's not as good as the DL game, but it is amusing.  The animations are great as usual. Game play is pretty good too. Not too difficult.  Overall  it's a fun game to play and gorgeous to look at. Especially if you like  good animation.",4.0
"Back in the 80's Space Ace was a game for people to get in line because it was a lot of fun. Space Ace has been in every format, and now after almost 20 years from its release we can enjoy it in our house with our DVD's.  There is a little pause between every move to the game but that will vary  from player to player. There is also a ""watch"" option that lets  you relax and watch the hole game without playing it. A great Classic. Don  Bluth made a great game.",4.0
"Back in 1983 a game called Dragon's Lair came to the local arcades, 3 months later came Space Ace in early 1984. The rest is history. Space Ace back in the day was a laserdisc video game produced by Don Bluth Studios and Cinematronics. Just like Dragon's Lair, Space Ace's gameplay consists of requiring the gamer to move the joystick or press the fire button at precise moments in the animated sequences to govern the hero's actions. It's basically a mini-animated movie. You think for a video game's purposes the animation will be pretty lame, but both Space Ace and Dragon's Lair had animation that Disney would love to have a hold of.

Even 25+ years later, I still find myself enjoying these games, but as with them back in the day, it's definitely an acquired taste and not for everybody. This version of Space Ace is clearly the best Space Ace ever released to a home console. The graphics have been immensely improved and the controls are more lenient on the gamer. I noticed only a couple of bugs where there is an annoying clicking sound after a death or scene, but that's only a minor nitpick. Space Ace definitely is not a fun as Dragon's Lair. I think it's the characters in Space Ace that are sometimes just annoying for my tastes, but the game is still fun to play and watch at times. The extras has some nice additions including a full movie video of the game without interruption and some nice interviews of the creators of the game and even includes Don Bluth. It also contains playable levels from Dragons Lair, and Dragons Lair II. Not bad!

 I played it on my PS3 without problems and I hear it should run on all other blu-ray players without a hitch. Obviously it's going to feel more like a game with a PS3 controller, but the regular DVD controller will do the job too. Definitely pick this up if you want to take a trip down Laserdisc video game lane...",4.0
"A+ for the game itself, it's an arcade classic from the 1980s and IMO the best of the 3 Bluth games.

A+ too for the transfer, the visuals and sound are great.

I thought using the Blu-Ray remote to play the game vs. a joystick or computer keyboard would be annoying, but it's not too bad.  Game play is very faithful to the arcade experience I remember from when I was a kid.

The ""attract mode"" sequence, which has some nice animation, is included.  But it's a bit hard to find because they put it under ""Previews.""  There's also one playable level from each of Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair II, which is nice.

My only complaints are:

1. As another reviewer noted, the ""Get me out of here!!!!"" sequence is missing after Ace leaves the planet for the first time.  It's there when you play on Cadet level though.

2. I get a lot of stutter when the game seeks to a new scene.  Sometimes I see the first few frames flash on the screen, then black, and this happens a few times before the scene plays.  Could be an issue with my player.

Overall, I'm having a lot of fun playing the game and the purchase was well worth it.",4.0
The high definition remastering of this game is very impressive.  I would recommend this to anyone who owns a blu ray player and likes Don Bluth's animation.,4.0
"If you plunked a lot of quarters into the old Dragon's Lair or Space Ace arcade games then give this game a shot.  The graphics and move sequences of Space Ace DVD-ROM emulate the arcade game almost perfectly.  The only shortcomings of this game are that the ""good move"", ""bad move"" sounds are missing. Also, the timing of some of the moves is slightly off in some areas, which means that you have to make your move a split second before the ""danger"" appears.
Other than that, it's like having a ""Space Ace"" arcade game on your computer!
If you have never heard of or played ""Space Ace"" however, then I don't really recommend it.  By today's standards, it is not that great of a game.  I bought it largely as a nostalgia item.",4.0
"This game is loaded with goods. It brings back memories of great rpgs when sega was still making consoles but with better graphics. Story is great even though its predictable. Same with the battle system, simple but yet original. a game for anyone who wants a great rpg.",4.0
"I replay games a lot. Replayability is a must for me. And I've got to say I replay this a lot.

The characters suck me in. I find myself starting at the beginning again and again just to hear the characters' introductions and growth. Sometimes I reload at the end just to watch the ending.

The battle system can get boring at the end, as you'll just be using the same moves to power through stuff; and targeting is actually important, so you can't have it on auto. But, that's only at the end, because as you level up you'll be adding new attacks.

This game has a following for a reason. It's a 'must play at least once in your life' game.",4.0
"I would say that Lunar is a worthy RPG and definitely still worth playing if you have an appreciation for the classics.  However, it may not be worth paying the exorbitant used prices (the cheapest I found my copy was $60, then one of the discs was all scratched up and nonfunctioning, and I had to buy new discs for $30!  Yikes!).  Anyway, let's see if Lunar withstands the test of time.

Graphics (score 8/10): Well, since this version of Lunar (the Playstation version) was enhanced from the original, it looks really good for an older RPG, especially when compared to the playstation ports of Final Fantasy V and VI.  However, the graphics are still undeniably dated.  On the bright side, anime cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game. There's also an anime portrait whenever they speak, which adds much needed detail to the characters (so you can see what they really look like).

Music (score 7/10): Music is decent, nothing that would make you buy the soundtrack or anything.  There are a couple vocal tracks in the game, which are also decent.  Thankfully, Luna's singing voice isn't too grating on the ears.  I still don't understand, though, why everyone in the game keeps referring to her amazing singing voice, when in my opinion, she is only average.  Well anyway, there is limited voice acting in the game during scenes and also a couple battle phrases.  The voice acting is pretty good; the only voice I'm glad we don't hear much of is Nall's, which I imagine would get really annoying (it's high-pitched and squeaky).  You don't get to hear much voice acting anyway, since it's really only present during cutscenes.

Characters (score 8/10): Characters are likeable and amusing.  They do have a decent amount of depth to their personalities, so you really come to be attached to them.  Because the story is so basic, the likeable characters are really what keep this game afloat.  Also, some of the NPCs are downright hilarious!

Story (score 7/10):  Lunar is certainly no Final Fantasy VII.  The story itself is pretty basic.  You start off as Alex, who sets off on a quest to become a Dragonmaster (person of status who helps keep things in order and peace).  Then the story falls into the old pattern of finding X number of things (in this case, 4 dragons) and saving the world from a power-hungry would-be ruler along the way.  This is sort of the formula for every RPG in existence, but at least other games add in unique and intriguing twists on this old formula to keep things interesting.  Lunar's storyline really has no extra twists or new concepts in it to keep things interesting (thus it relies on excellent characterization).  I really wish the game had explored certain concepts in more detail, such as the why the Vile Tribe rejected Althena, Ghaleon's motivations, and Althena's personality, motivations, and origin.  However, given the age of this game, the lack of story depth is forgivable.  After all, almost all games made during this time period were pretty shallow story-wise.

Battle System (score 8/10): Battles are a basic turn-based system.  The usual attack, defend, magic, item commands.  As an interesting twist, you can move around the battle screen, thus making position a part of strategy.  The only complaint I have with battles is that there is an ""A.I."" command, whereby you can have the battle automatically fought for you.  I didn't really like this because the option is listed first in the menu, which means you'll spend some time accidentally hitting it.  It would've been better if they'd put it at the bottom of the menu.  Well, this isn't really a big deal since the cursor in the game ""remembers"" where you last had it and always starts up there.  So, once you turn on the game and select ""command"", the next battle will have the cursor already on ""command"".  This was quite convenient.

Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  One thing of note is that the menu system was a bit confusing, at least for me.  I really felt that it was needlessly complicated and I never quite got the hang going through it quickly.  It's rather annoying having every party member have their own ""equip"" menu when you could just have one big ""equip"" option, and then just select a character from there.  I also hated having to physically put equipment in the person's hand before I could equip it.  It would've been better to just let me select a person, and then have every available piece of equipment in inventory for them pop up in a list.  Shuffling items from Nall's inventory to each individual character's inventories is a pain, especially if their inventory is full, and you have to move items out first.  Well, anyway, also of note is the leveling system.  Bosses are always the same level as Alex is, but regular enemies all have their own preset levels.  This means that you must strike a delicate balance between under-leveling and over-leveling.  I really liked this feature since it kept you from having to level grind all the time.  Also, enemies appear onscreen--so there are no random battles, which is awesome.  Overall, the gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable, especially for an older game.

Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Overall, this was a decent, enjoyable game.  Even though the story isn't the best, I really enjoyed the characters and they kept me playing.  Is this game worth playing? Yes.  Is this game worth the eventual $90 I had to spend on it?  Definitely not.  I personally don't think this game is worth more than $40.  If you can find it for less than that, then go for it.  If not, then you might want to try the GBA remake, Lunar Legend (though I don't know how good it is, since I've never played it).  If you don't happen to ever play this game, then it's no real loss since there are plenty of contemporary RPG's available that are much better.",4.0
"Lunar is my favorite RPG game of all time! What it lacks in battle graphics it makes up for in story line as well as cut scene animation. Lunar provides players with a fulfill storyline and several plat twists. This is one of the few RPG's that will truly make you care about all the characters in your party, not just Alex (the hero). Very few RPG's take the time to develop all characters and maintain an intriguing storyline. The animation for cut scenes will have you watching again and again. This is not your average boy saves girl RPG!",4.0
"This is an old fashioned RPG that may not appeal to those who have only known the likes of Final Fantasy X, FFX-2, and Xenosaga.  There's not a lot of cutscenes here to help tell the story.  No fancy soundtrack.  Very little voice acting, which is a shame considering the voice actor for Ghaleon did a wonderful job. There's nothing like an elaborate prologue or ending that you got out of Xenosaga. Instead, gamers will have to depend on lots of reading and playing to make the story unfold.
Battles are quite challenging.  Basically, you plan the moves for all of your characters and then turn control over to the battle system.  There is also an option to have the battle system fight for you, but this mode is not recommended.
This game's story is very mild and shallow compared to the other RPGs mentioned above.  LSSS's strong points are definitely fighting and solving puzzles.  The story is a lightweight.  And definitely not for those looking for something along the lines of ""epic"".",4.0
"Originally released back on the Sega Saturn, Working Designs ports it over to the Playstation, VERY NICELY. The original great game is here, with a few good enhancments. The best one being the Anime scenes. Very well done, and they help move the story along nicely. The game's not up to par with the likes of most Final Fantasy games, or many other Square/Enix RPG's, but it's definitely a must have for any RPG fan.
Gameplay: 8.1/10
I'll start with the battle system. The battles you run into to aren't random; you can see them on the screen, and avoid some of them if you don't want to battle. A lot of them are impossible to avoid, though; this is needed, so you aren't just running through the game not fighting. You have the usual attack, run, and skills during the battles. When you have your character do a physical attack, he will move to the enemie he's attacking and stay in that spot while the enemies do their attacks. Some of the enemy attacks will move your character a spot or two back. This way, there's some strategy involved on the placement of your character. Each enemy has a certain amount of spots it can move, so if you want to stay away from some of them, don't attack an enemy that's surrounded by other enemies, because they all will be in attacking range, and they will all get a good attack in on you. A lot of the times, I didn't really worry about this, but it's a little added strategy to the battles other than the usual fighting. One of the more useful ways of taking advantage of this, though, is to defend on one turn, let the enemies move close to you, and then hack and slash away. This way, you don't move in without getting an attack on your enemy, and letting them attack you. Be smart, and you can avoid a hit here and there. The battles are turn based, by the way; none of that meter stuff seen in most Final Fantasy games. Really either way is good to me.
The way skills are learned in this game is just your basic learn a skill at a certain level system. Example: Learn a small healing spell at level 5. There's no custom way of learning your attacks. You have to realize, that this came out in the early 90's, where there was only a game here and there had a deep system to go along with it. It gets the job done, but it's not as advanced as some RPG'ers would like. I didn't mind, though. Don't let this turn you away from the game. You will miss out on a memorable experience if you do.
The areas in this game are big, good looking, and fun to work your way through. Your usual RPG stuff is here. Caves, Villages, Castles, etc. They offer up a good challenge, too, which you can't say about a lot of RPG's out there. It's not impossible by any means, but it's not easy either. Good challenge. The world you travel through is well designed, and pretty big. As a whole, you won't find a bad or boring level in this game. It's an expansive RPG world, with many fun challenges along the way.
The characters are very good. They are pretty artistic. A couple basic looking ones, but overall, they have my pick as some of the better ones in an RPG, ever. The character development is not too bad, either. It's not the best, but you should soon care for each character atleast a little. Especially the main ones like Alex, and Luna.
I like the story a lot. You won't find a deep, complex plot. You get a straight-foward, hero defeating the villian, type of story. There's a good surprise here and there, but not many. You will grow to hate the villians, and the story, while not being too complex, pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you finish the game. I guarantee you will enjoy it.
I take off the 1.9 because the battle system can get repetitive near the end of the game. The boss battles have you basically using the same spell per character each turn, hoping you have enough left to finish him off. This makes the usual fun boss fights, a little less fun than normal. Atleast they're challenging, though, since they always have the same level as your characters. I didn't take off any more for the semi-basic storyline, and not so deep skill learning system because of the time it came out. That's something you have to realize when playing this game: it was one of the best for it's time.
Replay Value: 6.5/10
As with a lot of RPG's, it's not very good. I, and many will play through again for the positives I mentioned above, but there's really no incentive to come back and play through the 25+ hour quest again. Only for the hardcore RPGer, I guess.
Music: 8.2/10
Overall, some very nice tunes scattered through out the game. It's not mind blowing like some of the Square soundtracks, but it's a good one. You will enjoy it for the most part, I know I did.
Graphics: 9/10
I'm basing it on the year it came out. The levels,and battle graphics look stunning. With that said, though, the characters suffered and look pretty bland. That's the reason for the 1 point off. Not a major problem at all, though. Especially when you play this one for the gameplay, like all RPG's.
Overall:(Not an average) 8.5/10
For it's time, it offered a fun battle system, great graphics, a good story, and clever, fun level design. One of the best games in the genre at the time, and rightfully so. It has taken a slight hit over the years, but overall, it has stood the test of time pretty well. RPG fans would be wise to not miss out on this. With the special package one, you get tons of extra goodies; well worth the money, although it's only possible to find it on sites like Ebay. If you find it, go for it. You will not be disappointed in the slightest at this classic RPG.
I recommend Lunar 2 as well. It improves upon this game in almost every way.",4.0
"Ok.. I'll be honest here. I read couple reviews and sensing that this game is 'bit' over-rated. (I sense people who wrote reviews frowning) I did finish this game and trust me, I had lot of expectation for this game. I haven't played the Sega CD version of it and actually blamed one of the reviewers from EGM, who gave 8.5 when rest of them gave 9 or higher. I thought this game deserves at least 9, I mean, look at the animation, the title animation is one of the most well-represented animated beginning ever, and the music was just amazing.  I was constantly humming the tune because it was so, so, SO GOOD- couldn't help myself from humming it all the time. Not only that, Working Design did a fantastic/excellent job on putting in all the extra you are getting with this game, it's simply amazing- I'm left with no choice but to give credit for that.  However, after I finish the game, I realized that I came to conclusion too soon, when I did play only beginning portion of the game, mesmerized with beautifully animated movie scene.
I wasn't inspired or felt that heartache or anything like that..
  I mean, characters are adorable and the story is good enough to pull you in, however, it wasn't just strong enough-
So when I read several reviews saying this is the best RPG for PS or anything like that, I just couldn't agree with what they were saying, of course, everyone has right to their own opinion, but in my humble opinion, I just didn't feel it.  It seemed to me that I'm more attracted to the games with more stronger theme, like Xenogear, and Lunar falls into mild-themed game, which is, of course, enjoyable.
I didn't buy the sequel, Eternal Blue, which comes with more extra and whole box for the game looks great, however, I wasn't inspired enough to purchase Eternal Blue because it wasn't just there to hook me, wasn't just there...
Well, it's definitely your call.. so if the price is reasonable for you and plenty of time, then give it a try and see how it goes. It's nice to have this game if you are a collector, however, I wouldn't buy this game if you are picking this ONE RPG to enjoy in your busy life, because there are better RPGs out there for PSOne in my humble opinion.",4.0
"This was the first RPG I ever played and it got me hooked on them.  The story is great and the battle system is easy to understand and operate.  The videos were really cool, too.  I strongly reccomend this to anyone who would like to get started playing RPG's.  The only downfall, for me anyway, was the cheesy music.",4.0
"If you are looking for story as the driving force behind an RPG, then this is a game you will enjoy.  Lunar doesn't rely on graphics or amazing sound.  It relies on the strength of its storyline.  The graphics are the type you'd find on an older system, which makes sense because this game was originally released on the Sega-CD.  This comes with two bonus CD's. One is a soundtrack, which is nothing to be excited about since the music isn't something you'd want to listen to outside of the game, but is a nice touch.  The other is a making of CD that was rather interesting because you get to see how much the people who made this game were into it and cared about the finished product.
One of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting.  It's such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game.  The female voices can seem rather whiny and too high pitched (which could be said of the males at times too), but other than that, it's quite good.  Also, there is a lot of pop culture references and innuendo going on that make you laugh.  That may be the best thing about the game.  The story is fun.  The game is fun.  You have fun playing the game.
It's not new.  It's not full of eye candy.  But the game is very enjoyable and worth the money if you enjoy playing with a good story.",4.0
"For a while now I've heard a lot of people complaining about how bad Superman 64 is. So, after seeing it here on Amazon, I decided to get it and see what's up. Just so I can cover every aspect of the game easier, let me break it down in sections:

Plot: Lex Luthor kidnaps Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, and Professor Hamilton and traps them in a virtual Metropolis. As Superman, you have to fly around and rescue them. So maybe the plot isn't exactly the greatest, but it isn't that bad. Except for when you realize that (SPOILER ALERT) after you save your friends and get back home, Lex essentially programmed a way for Superman to beat him again.

Graphics: The less said, the better. This is one of the worst parts of this game. During the opening scene, Superman's friends don't even look like people. And throughout the city, you find a thick green ""Kryptonite Fog"" (actually distance fog) that seems to make the ring stages a little bit harder.

Gameplay: You get to fly around and use Superman's powers, just like it says on the box. What they leave off of the box, however, is that you have to collect tokens/chips with that power's picture on it to use it (ex. Superman finds a token with heat rays on it. Touching it will make him shoot heat rays). You also get to fly around the city during 'Ring Stages'. The controls during the stages are difficult to get at first, but once you get used to them it isn't so bad. A good trick to keep yourself from flying in random directions when trying to turn a corner is to let go of the 'B' button.

Ending: Easily one of the worst endings I've ever seen. I can't even write about it here, it's that bad.

Overall, it isn't that bad of a game. Is it good? Not really. But if you collect video games or just happen to love a good challenge, then pick up Superman.",4.0

Ordered this game and received it promptly.  It was fun collaborating with my brother and finally beating Myst in 2 days.  The price was very affordable.,4.0
"There are very few video games from over 20 years ago that still go strong in the second decade of the 21st century. Myst is one of them. I remember playing this game back in 1993 and getting my but whipped with the puzzles. I recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is. Of course, graphics have advanced since 1993, but Myst shows game developers how puzzles should really work.

Unlike too many games today, Myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery. When you start the game, you're just thrown into a new world with no explanation. You are left to explore and discover. There is a story with shocking twists, but the story depends upon your involvement and choices, not simply handed to you.

The puzzles require a lot of time and thought. If you don't like puzzles and thinking, don't play this game. If you like challenges, Myst will challenge you. The puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way. Some are frustrating and I did need to look at a hint guide a few times (particularly for the Mechanical Age elevator) but they all do have a logic.

Unlike other reviewers, I found the one area Myst doesn't hold up well is in building an immersive environment. Myst as a world doesn't have a logic. There's a spaceship, a boat, a clock tower, etc., just sitting on the island. It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world. I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world.

Overall, Myst was a historic computer game back in 1993 and is still worth playing 20 years later. From the early 1990s, I personally preferred Presto Studios' Journeyman Project, which also had a compelling point-and-click adventure and featured pre-rendered 3D environments. However, until that game gets rereleased, Myst is easily the best point-and-click adventure readily out there.

Note: the game is also available on iPhone, iPad, Nintendo 3DS, so there's no excuse not to try it out.",4.0
"This is my favorite Myst game thus far.  I have played other's and the only one that I like compared to this one is Myst 5.. This is a great game!!

"The hit 1990s game ""Myst"" set off the immensely popular ""Myst"" series, as well as ""Myst"" spin-off computer games. The game is fantasy-based, puzzle game, incorporating unique locations and mechanical motifs. While a bit outdated in some ways, the game is intriguing and fun and well worth buying.

-Plot

You play a character who finds themselves stranded on a tiny island. While exploring, you begin to discover the dark past of the island which you are visiting. Using ingenious ""linking books"" you can access other islands and unravel the truth behind the lonely, mysterious worlds.

-Environment

The environments, while not necessarily beautiful, are well done. There are a total of five islands, all with different motifs. These islands, or ""ages"" include:

-A world with half-sunken boats and flooded tunnels.

-An age with a spinning building.

-A Cyprus forest with a network of treehouses.

-An odd, out-of-this world island with a gigantic tunnel.

The environments can be rather dark at times. In general there is little character interaction, leaving the player dealing mostly with puzzles and exploring.

Music drifts in and out of the game, with some locations dominated by the sound of wind while others have music in the background. The music alternates between very dark to dark tinged. While the game does not have catchy tunes, it suits the game quite well as background music.

-Characters

There are few characters, and interaction is limited. There is a selection of journals in a library which provide interesting reading and histories of the various islands.

-Puzzles

This game is a puzzle game. The puzzles are generally mechanical in nature. The puzzle solutions can be illusive, but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious. Once you have solved puzzles once, they can generally be solved again quickly, allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet again.

If you enjoy puzzles that involve common sense more than mathematics and like interesting and unique worlds, you will enjoy ""Myst."" The game has decent replay value. The game is rather old, and an updated edition called ""Real Myst"" is available on Amazon. However, for a genuine piece of gaming history, the original is the way to go.",4.0
"Myst is a fun, fascinating, addictive, and very difficult first person puzzle adventure game with a good storyline. The plot isn't immediately obvious, but is revealed bit by bit and finally in its entirety at the end. You must figure things out partly through making inferences based on what you know and partly through written clues.

Finishing takes patience (it's a LONG game) and an ability to figure things out that aren't immediately obvious and/or cheating by using strategy guide (you can buy one or find one on the internet) or asking someone who's played before.

The game's settings are each innovative, very pretty, and feel very realistic, with the exception of the water in Myst (it looks like a giant green mat). Rand Miller's performance in the game as the character of Atrus is good enough, and his performance as Achenar is even better, as is Robyn Miller's as Sirrus. The sound effects and background music are great.

I do think two puzzles are unfair, but they are solvable if you cheat (see above) or have a really good memory and a really good ear. The interface also makes getting to certain locations more of a hassle then it should be sometimes.

The ending (even if you get the happy one) explains a lot but leaves many questions unanswered.

Despite ifs flaws, I love it and highly recommend it.",4.0
"myst is strictly a one-player game, other players can play when your journey has been ""saved"". i preferred two-player games like mortal combat where the action is fast and someone ""wins"". the style of myst is ""point and click"" and your pace is self directed. having a high patiance level is paramount if you want to finish myst. once you solve all the puzzles and reach the end ....the game loses its appeal. this review might sound pessimistic, but i think its real in its approach. as the sequalls evolved, so did the hint books. i personally disagree with the whole concept of a ""hint book"". its self defeating by having the game ""spoon fed"" to me. i actually liked myst but i still wouldnt call it ""fun""......""fun"" is a two player game of mortal combat (at least you get to say i whipped your ***)",4.0

"""Myst"" is the one that started it all.  ""Myst"" is the game by which all other role-playing games are measured.  No one had any idea when the game first came out in 1993 that it would eventually become the best-selling computer game of all time.
Rand and Robyn Miller, the brothers who created the wildly successful game, hit upon a winning idea.  Place someone into an unknown world where the clues he or she uncovers reveals the story.  And one of the biggest perks of all - you can't die.
""Myst"" starts off by dumping you on a dock overlooking a vast ocean.  You can hear water lapping along the dock, and a wind makes the hair on your neck stand up.  And from there it only gets more interesting - you discover books that can link you to other worlds like this one, more commonly called Ages; you encounter all sorts of devices that, even though they don't appear to do much, are all part of the underlying thread tying the game together; and just by wandering around you immerse yourself in the world that is ""Myst.""
Occasionally, I meet people who are baffled at the success of ""Myst.""  They don't understand how a game where you just walk around and solve stuff can be so appealing.  There is little or no character interaction, they say.  I've noticed that a lot of these same people are those who like those ""shoot'em up and splatter their guts all over the wall"" type of gamers.  The reason ""Myst"" has been so successful is because it so pure - you don't have to worry about dying, you use your head to get your way through things, and each new Age you encounter is just bursting with intriguing things to discover.  That and each world is beautiful.  Not as jaw-dropping as ""Riven"" and not nearly as mesmerizing as ""Myst III: Exile"", but ""Myst"" has a subtle yet majestic beauty that makes it stand apart from other games.
If you have never played a computer game before, give ""Myst"" a try.  You will be surprised at how addictive it can become.  Did I mention that there is no possible way in which you can be killed?  Seriously!  How many games today offer that?  There's a reason why it has been such a hit; millions and millions of people can't be wrong.",4.0
"When I first got this game, I immediately became obsessed with it. I spent hours each day trying to come up with solutions to all the puzzles. It was all worth it, though.
The basic story is fairly unique. You are dropped onto an island without a clue as to what is going on. Exploring the island, you find two men trapped inside books. They are brothers, and each claims that he is innocent and the other is guilty of killing their father and burning his books. Obviously someone is lying, and you have to figure out who by traveling to different ages through other hidden books and putting together the clues you find there. By the end, you must come to a decision about who is innocent and should be set free. However, before you can do that something happens that makes you rethink the entire scenario. I've probably said too much already, and I won't say anything more about the plot.
Myst's graphics were amazing when it first came out, but now look rather simple and cartoonish compared to Riven and Exile. This is why the game misses out on the full five stars.
Also notable is that Myst is the only game of the series that never ends. Once you have completed your mission and freed the right person, you are free to keep exploring as long as you want. Although it might be nice to see some more ages, there is simply not enough space on one disk, and the five ages that are available are very scenic and enjoyable. If you want a unique game that may even give you a new perspective on your own life, you could do a lot worse than Myst.",4.0
"This Game is a good game depending on your personality.  If you like to drive around in a car in  New  York City or shooting up alien invaders,in other words you like games with a lot of action, then this is probably not the game for you.  there is no action, or enemies.  Myst is more of exploring and puzzle solving.  It requires quite a bit of patience to play.  If your looking for an adventure/puzzle game then you should get myst. in my opinion it is a great game.  one of the best i have ever played",4.0
"I purchased this game about a year ago, and I started up the game and I had no clue what was happening. But as soon as I saw how everything was working out and it simply became easier. This game takes alot of thought and this is a game youll be hooked on. I have played this game hours at a time. The graphics for this game a very nice and the Quicktime Animation enhance th experince all the better. I eventually beat the game (after cheating two or three times). Some of the puzzles were almost impossible where I just stood back and was like ""huh?"". But all of the secrets of Myst Island are explained in the Library (hint, hint!), but I would recommend buying the Masterpiece Editon if you really want this game.",4.0
"OK, so there's probably not much point in writing a review for such an old game, but, the game is so good I figured why not. Basically, this game is just like Shadowgate and/or Deja Vu for the NES, except the puzzles are now slightly more logical. The game has the single best soundtrack I have ever heard, and I've played a lot of games. The soundtrack is truly medieval and it sets the tone perfectly for each area in the game. The graphics aren't much, but they really are perfect for this game {dark and grim}. Gameplay mostly consists of puzzles and/or doing side tasks required to advance. Puzzles can vary from easy to hard, so it's a good mix of challenge and fun. Overall it's just a great game, I can't really explain in words why I love it so much.....so you'll just have to get it and find out yourself!",4.0
"Playing Shadowgate 64 was my first time playing any Shadowgate game....and I gotta say, this sure was fun as hell.

It's like a first-person shooter....but....not. You're in first person mode, and you go around searching for clues in the castle. Doesn't sound like fun, right? Wrong. The graphics are beautiful and the levels are nicely done and full of goodies. Going around solving the game's many puzzles isn't tedious in any way....it's a joy, and it's a journey many should take the time to take.

Sure, the game has a few downsides....one being that your guy walks around like a lumbering beast. Slow as hell. And then the other is that there were a few times I died cheap....like thinking I would be able to swim, jumping into the water, and immediately drowning, because obviously elves didn't get the poolside lessons....lol. Oh well, though, it was actually good for a laugh. Just save your game often, and get this game now!!!

Overall, 9 out of 10, a solid title to add to your N64 collection.",4.0
"I enjoyed this game where I was a character locked in a dungeon, had to find my way out and then around castle Shadowgate to finally meet up with the main bad guy. This is not a slash around killing game, it is a puzzle and thinking game. You walk around picking up things, talking to people, doing things a certain way to see what happens. You can get killed in this game, so be sure to save often, your last save point is where you will start again if you are killed. You need a memory card to save with this game! I did get stuck in the game several times, at least 3 times and had to write to Nintendo to find out how to proceed! But with their help I made it to the very end. This game is appropriate for children that can read, as you must read to play the game, and there is no goulish violence.",4.0
"This is a wonderful way to get young kids interested in the computer.  The software follows the book almost word for word, plus the words appear on the screen, and are highlighted when said.  Your child has the option of  allowing the book to be read to them or playing within the pages.  My  daughter has been using this since she was two and a half.  She loves to  click on the various items on the screen and see the action.  This is her  favorite software.  It is nonthreatening, and fun, plus kids become more  familiar with the words as they appear on the screen.  Highly recommend for  2-5.",4.0
"Hexen was the second game I can ever remember playing as a kid. It was fun back then, but now (since repurchasing many games from my childhood) as a more comprehensive gamer, it's absolutely amazing. It is just the right amount of challenge, even on lower difficulties. It is a good game for single player, and an interesting multiplayer. 3 classes and 5 difficulties keep you entertained.

A strong recommendation for any 64 gamer's collection.",4.0
"Probably one of the most anticipated games since it's predecessor, Myst, was released, and well it should be. This game features extraordinary 3d art, and along with the puzzles and challenges that await you, it is definitley well worth purchasing. However..If you are impatient, this game is not worth the fifty bucks, for it requires paying hours and hours of close attention, and note taking. But the funny thing is..that still isn't enough. Have fun.",4.0
"Great immersion , awesome graphics. Very cool game in it's time ( still holds up today ) Some freeze issues now w/modern OS's but can be solved w/retro driver up loads. [...]  Cyan needs to address this but they probably won't. Loved this game when it came out.",4.0
"Given the success of Myst, a sequel was inevitable. Riven is both a sequel in spirit and in its story. The game takes place just after Myst and takes the player to another age where you meet Atrus' father and wife, amongst others. As in Myst, the story is told through journal entries, puzzles, and a few cinematic scenes. Riven does develop the story more than Myst did, with more cinematic cutscenes and longer books. Overall, I think this is a great addition and the actor who plays Ghen (Atrus' father) is actually quite good.

Like Myst, Riven is a challenging puzzle game. Overall, the game isn't quite as challenging as Myst because the relationship between the puzzles and solutions aren't as attenuated. However, there are a few cases where I felt like I knew what information I needed, but didn't know where to find it. This is particularly problematic in a point-and-click game with limited movement. I was particularly frustrated with learning the Riven numbers - I knew I needed to in order to learn a code, but couldn't figure out where to get the translation! Also, there is one thing in the very last puzzle which is a real pain - something impossible to see that needs to be moved.

The graphics in Riven look beautiful, even 15 years later. The Riven environment is gorgeous and has some really startling landscape. However, the geography in Riven is supposedly 5 times larger than Myst's, but because most of the game occurs within a single Age is actually does feel a bit smaller. Moreover, I felt like there were more ""corridors"", or areas that had no function other than to serve as space between two other areas. Myst by contrast was extremely compact. I'm not sure which is better, but I'd guess that in terms of puzzle content the two games were about equal. I would have preferred a bit more environment and fewer corridors.

Ultimately, Riven is a worthy sequel to Myst and follows its predecessor closely. If you like Myst, you'll probably love Riven. If not, Riven probably doesn't offer anything new to change your mind. Recommended.",4.0

The game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all 5 games, simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future under-developed, but beautiful lands Myst would take us to..Obviously this game is for a certain type of ""quiet"" gamer, who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral, button mashing action..If those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however, there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary Myst series..",4.0
"I told myself I was NOT going to use any hints to solve Riven. Actually I got through most of the game without hints. But then I got frustrated and finally gave in and got help. Riven is perhaps the most difficult of the Myst series. The one critical puzzle involving coded locks was so difficult that after finding the solution online, and realizing I had been on the right track towards the solution, still there was no way I would have cracked the full code, even though I had deciphered some of the code on my own. As with other Myst games, there was also one important area that I didn't find on my own, because I didn't click around enough (a small and non-obvious hot spot). There are fewer ages in Riven than in the other Myst games, and about 95% of the game consists of finding your way around the islands that make up the first age. In that respect it is a different game experience than the others. The prerendered point-and-click interface is much like the original Myst.",4.0
"Riven is a worthy followup to Myst and still must rate as one of the alltime great adventure games.
Those familiar with the Myst series will know some of what to expect: lush visuals (although in static form, no 360 rendering), a detailed storyline, fiendishly clever puzzles, much mysterious machinery, and a need to respond to and interact with the environment in order to solve the game.
There are some important differences to the Myst series.  First of all, rather than exploring a number of different worlds, or 'ages', in Riven you explore one (albeit large) world, comprised of five islands.  There are links to two other 'ages' but these are very sketchily developed and there is not much to explore here.  There are some differences between the islands, but the radically different tones of the ages in Myst or Myst III is missing.
This has its advantages and disadvantages.  The world you explore is much larger, and you can progress over virtually the whole world without needing to solve many puzzles, allowing even a casual player a good glimpse at the world of Riven.
However, it also means that the puzzles are less contained and linear than in the other Myst games.  As well as a number of smaller puzzles, there are two major puzzles to be solved, clues for which are scattered throughout the islands.  Even with the smaller puzzles, the control to open a vital door might be located a long distance away, or only accessible via a very circuitous route.  This can add another degree of complexity to the puzzles.  Having said that, there is a degree of logic to most of the controls which are based on the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of Riven.  The puzzles generally also operate in a logical manner and relate well to the entire environment of the game.
There is little action for the punch-em-up enthusiasts - but they're unlikely to be reading the review anyway.
In summary, a fantastic game that will engross you for hours - I just wish more alternative ages could have been included.",4.0
"Riven is quite a far step up from Myst and requires some experience with Myst beforehand in order to sucessfully navigate throughout the game. This is yet another masterpiece of the Myst trilogy with it's interaction with characters and a whole new batch of intriguing yet infuriating puzzles that toy with the mind. I found Riven rather enjoyable mainly because it kept my brain hard at work and of course the graphics kept me entertained while I pondered on what to do next. If you liked Myst, Riven is most definitely worth a try!",4.0
"I havn't played Myst yet, but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics, great sound, great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world, but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all, WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy, puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone.",4.0
"Riven, the sequel to Myst, is a great game. I got hooked and played it waaaay too much for the first month! The graphics and sound effects are great, and it is good that the Cyan boyz added living creatures. Learning more about D'Ni history was great, and this game was an overall success with me and my friends. I like Riven at least as much as Myst, and hope the next Myst game is this good!",4.0
"Beautiful computer game that you can waste mindless hours on when you should be out saving the world.  Pretty difficult.  You may find yourself wondering aimlessly around the amazing landscapes, not having a clue what to do.  But that's like real life, and this game tries to be like real life.  So if you enjoy real life, you might like this game.  If you hate life, go play Pac-Man.
Gotta love those roller coaster-type rides!",4.0
"Riven is the best game.  If I were a genius, I would love it, but average old me thinks it is too hard to beat without the walkthrough, so I got it.  The game is a must-buy, but it is too difficult if you don't plan on  playing for years and still having only a small chance of winning.",4.0
"... I had no clue what I was doing, was hopelessly stuck, and was in general LOST. But then the other day it started coming together for me. I started figuring out what I needed to do and what the nature of the puzzles  were. They're not all in one place as in you have to pass one to get to  another.
Yes, the graphics are lovely, the sound effects are dead-on  REAL, the music (when it appears) is fitting. But it's how different this  is from everything else I've ever played! Though I was sooo lost at first,  now I'm having a blast and don't want it to end.
To play Riven you have  to be OBSERVANT, patient, and tireless. Don't be in a hurry to finish or  you'll just get frustrated like I did and will give up before even getting  into it. If that sounds like you then this game is IT. It works on your  mind like few other computer games do and you really really have to think  to get it.
If you like being around other characters, violence, and fast  action, or archade style games, don't even spend a dime on Riven. If you  like being able to completely explore a world without barriers save  logistic ones, puzzle-solving, using your powers of observation then RUN  and get this cuz you'll love it!
For those out there playing it or  thinking of playing it, I recommend taking notes (you'll know when) and  making several copies of games as you go. As in use your ""Save  as"" command. Not like you'll get stuck irrevocably as in other games  but it makes it easier to go back and look at something you missed as you  proceed.
Minuses are that I wish there was more constant music in the  background since it's lovely music. It seems to come and go when you enter  certain area. And that the transitions from screen to screen were a bit  smoother in places. But that's it. Reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz  I'm not done yet :)",4.0
"I just finished Riven and it was one of the most exciting games I have ever played, if not the most. The graphics were superb and I felt like I was on a roller-coaster ride many times.  The puzzles were diffecult, but I  got through the majority of them with only a few hints, but I'm not sure I  could have done it without help.  I'm really looking forward to whatever  sequel RedOrb has in mind. It will be at the top of my list as soon as it  is released. Check out the web site on the Riven box for input and help,  but then if you are as into puzzles as Riven fans are, you don't need that  hint.  Go for it. Give your imagination some exercise.",4.0
"Riven is a worthy sequel to Myst, and takes the Myst ""mystique"" to another level with five new worlds and an expanded story line.  The brilliantly realized environments and mood-setting soundtrack draw you in  immediately and keep you there until the sun comes up.  Riven is not for  gamers with short attention spans--simply navigating and charting the  accessible areas of the Age of Riven take patience and time, and solving  what I would characterize as the two major puzzles requires all of the  intelligence and tenacity one can muster.  As some reviewers have said,  having played Myst first is helpful background to have, but this is not  because the puzzles of Riven are similar to those of Myst, but because Myst  will acquaint you with how the creators conceive puzzles, and heighten your  sensitivity to factors in the environment that bear noting and  investigating.  I gave Riven 4 stars, rather than 5, for two reasons: (a)  one of the major puzzles is sound-based, and after some long and  frustrating efforts at solving it on my own, I obtained some hints on the  internet and found that the solution required matching up particular sounds  from the game that, in fact, simply did not match up (at least not in the  version that I bought); and (b) one other crucial clue is a tiny, blurry  image.  In these respects, I felt that the creators did not play fair.  Two  other points:(i) contrary to what some have said, it is indeed possible to  lose this game and meet an untimely end, so be careful out there, and (ii)  recognize that the CD-Rom version is on 5 discs, which need to be changed  every time you travel from one world to another--if you have a DVD-Rom  player, by all means spring for the DVD version, which consists of one  disc.",4.0
"Riven is a visual masterpiece. Set in a beautifully rendered world of still images and animated cut scenes, Riven takes you through an intriguing story and wonderfully creative places. Riven isn't just a pretty game  though... it is composed of challenging (and often frustrating) interactive  puzzles that must be solved to complete the game.
If you've played games  like the 7th Guest, or Myst, you'll find Riven challenging. If you've never  played any puzzle-based games before, you'll find Riven insanely hard. If  you are not familiar with interactive puzzles, I would highly recommend  starting with Myst. Not only is it easier and almost as beautifully  rendered as Riven, but it'll do a great job priming you for the more  difficult puzzles you'll encounter in this game.
While I cannot praise  the creators of Riven enough for the depth of their creativity, I cannot  recommend this game to just anyone. Riven is perfect for the avid puzzle  solver, but much too difficult for the casual game player. Younger children  (and most teens) may lose interest in this game very quickly, as the  puzzles will often stop a player dead in their tracks until they can muster  up the brainpower to figure them out. If you're looking for action, this  isn't the place you'll find it.
On the other hand, Riven contains no  violence, and is definitely a game that will make you think. You can't say  that about many games these days, which is one of the reasons why this game  is perfectly suited for a more cognitive crowd.
Riven gets four out of  five stars because I believe that some puzzles may be out of the reach of  most people without the use of a hint book. Regardless of this drawback,  it's one of the best games in it's class... and I highly recommend it.",4.0
"Once again you put your hand to the book, and enter another world...this time, Riven, in an effort to find the wife of your host.

"Ape Escape is on one of the sleekest action games on Playstation, which is, in theory, a pretty low-power console. The graphics, despite being  rather choppy, are colorful and well-textured. Most of all, the game has a  high frame rate with no noticeable slowdown to speak of, which allows  things to move quickly and smoothly. The control scheme is intuitive  despite being complex at the outset. Fortunately, no action you can take  requires pressing more than one button. Right shoulder buttons are jumping,  left shoulder buttons center camera and bring you into a first-person  lookaround mode, digital d-pad moves the camera, left and right sticks move  the character and the selected tool respectively, which the X, triangle,  circle, and square buttons select your tool. Also, the controls are quite  tight, which will save you much frustration from falling over cliffs and  such. The camera is one of the best I've ever seen. It rarely swings around  the character, although at times I did experience a few odd, glitchy  perspectives, such as from behind walls and from under floors. Fortunately,  the camera is spring-loaded to auto-center on the character.
The level  selection is the usual cliche pretty meadows/volcanoes/robotic factory  fare, but in order to fulfill your quota of monkeys (capturing  anachronistic, and very agile monkeys is the point of the game) you will  have to navigate your surroundings in all of the three dimensions and  utilize all of your equipment (monkeys are caught with a net, enemies are  disposed of with a ""force club"", you can glide with a hand copter  to reach higher ground, or swim via help of a motorized sub), which is part  of the appeal. The levels are large and complex.
The game is relatively  easy, but the frantic excitement it creates will make you play it over and  over again.",4.0

"First, let me start by saying this game is about monkeys. MONKEYS!

Okay, now that that's out of the way, Ape Escape is one of the greatest platformers of all time, and truly a forgotten PS1 classic. Basically, Specter is an evil monkey, and he has a helmet that makes him super smart, so he's amassed a legion of monkeys (around 204, to be somewhat exact) to go back in time and take over the world. We can't have that, so it's your job to go through time, catching all of the monkeys and preventing the world from being all monkeyed and stuff. You don't have to catch all of the monkeys, but that's part of the replay value; After you finally run Specter off, you'll likely only have a bit more than half of the game completed. To get the real ending, you have to catch every monkey and Specter to get the real ending. Combine that with all the Specter Coins hidden throughout the levels, and you've got quite a sizable game here, especially considering that it's now eleven years old. The difficulty ensures that you won't finish this in a day, too; While at first this game is quite simple, it quickly ramps up the challenge enough to hold your interest. It can be so hard at some times that it's really frustrating, but not too frustrating. Early on in the game, they give you gadgets every few levels, too, so you don't get bored while the game is still easy. Some of these gadgets include:

A slingshot, which comes in handy throughout the whole game;

A radar for detecting those sneaky monkeys;

And even a boxing glove on a spring that smashes walls.

I really liked nearly all of the gadgets, and I also thought it was great how they stay useful through the whole game. Some, like the super hoop, tend to fall into disuse, but most of the others maintain a strong presence in every level.

The graphics are dated these days, but they still look fun and cartoony, and they're not bad for being over ten years old.

The sound is good, nothing spectacular. The music is alright, but I turned it off so I could listen to my own music while I play. Animal Collective makes for wonderful ambiance.

The controls, oh, the controls. Ape Escape is one of the only PSX games to truly use the DualShock correctly. That's right, the DualShock. You may notice that on the front of the box. This game makes constant use of the sticks, and at first that's quite strange, sometimes getting you killed (I've mistakenly hit the X button and run off a cliff a few times before), but pretty soon you'll get used to it. Unfortunately, many things in this game use the sticks too much, like the tank. At times I wished they had just let me push forward on the left stick instead of having to use both for the vehicles, but it's not that bad. Most of the time everything works smoothly. The cool thing about this innovative control scheme is how much control it gives you. You can attack in any direction with your club or net, much like MGS2's high frequency blade. Control over these things is good, because catching those monkeys gets hard, and you have to be quick. In short, the controls are innovative and work well most of the time.

All in all, this is a really fun game for all ages. Nearly everyone who plays it, whether it be you or your kids, will enjoy it greatly. There's tons to do, it will keep you entertained for days, and you should be able to get it for a great price because of how old it is. I'd highly recommend it to anyone.",4.0

"Ape Escape consists of more than 20 3D levels based on a variety of time zones. To clear a level, Spike (played by you) must capture a set number of monkeys. After filling that quota, you must access the next level. Reaching the monkeys will require you to jump, sneak, swim, climb and fly through a variety of situations.  To help you on your way, you are given a net and a lightsaber type stun club.  Throughout the course of the game, Spike will collect six additional gadgets.  In addition to providing the means of completing future levels, returning to previous levels with new gadgets will allow Spike to capture any monkeys he left behind. In addition to monkeys, each level has tokens to collect. Collecting enough tokens will open minigames.  This game gets addicting pretty fast.",4.0

Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer, 12 or older, rent this game, but do not buy. Most 11 year olds, and even some 10 year old have found this game easy.

There are many gadgets that you can use such as:a remote control car, net,stun club,and many more! Don't think it is a easy game on some levels you really have to use your head.

"This is one of the best shoot 'em ups on the 64. This game is pretty much the same as the PC version, but with more levels, extended levels / or added bits and peices, and a few new toys.

It pretty much feels just like the PC version but it's a little darker on the graphics. You will have to run trough the game control settings to find the right feel for you if you're like me and where used to using the keyboard.

Most of the cool stuff is still there from the PC game. There is the same sayings, some new ones, same levels etc.. whats missing is the adult content the PC had packed into it. So some things are different like, there is no strippers dancing around, and you can't go up and press OPEN to throw them money, and the posters are different etc... infact the second levels strip club has been completly re decorated into an out-door loading dock with trucks. Thats a bit of a disapointment that that stuff was replaced to tone it down.

There is some new toys to play with, but overall, there isn't enough weaopens. There is a hand gun, shot gun, machine gun, plasma shooter, grenade thrower, shrinkin ray, enlarging ray (new weopen! enlrage you're enemy till the explode!) and a few other ones. But compared to something like Goldeneye, there feels like harldy any guns to choose from.

I used to love to use cheats on the PC version, and with this 64 version, there are a couple of cheats, but there's none to walk through walls which I do miss.

Ofcourse now we have Call of Duty, Battlefield, Dead Space, etc... But if you are wanting a vintage gem pick up this game!  I stayed up countless nights with friends playing through the game in co-op mode and facing off with each other in team death match.  Solo player itself was quite challenging, and still is.  I have always felt this game sort of set the stage for FPS along with Perfect Dark and Golden Eye.

Bad points:  It can be irritating because it is so challenging.  Also, there are a lot of extremely dark areas of maps that make it hard to see (maybe even impossible).  At the time of its release I thought the graphics were great, but now that I play through it again, they are kind of disappointing.  I mean, still decent for the time but considering similar games that were on the 64...they could have done a bit better.

Good points: Weapons are awesome.  SMGs, plasma canon that evaporates everything in its path, pipe bombs, shrink ray allowing you to crush your enemy, expand ray that enlarges them until they explode...HA just coolness.  Combat boosts were always a neat item that I wish had been in more games.  You can also aquire a jetpack, Vitamin X, holoduke to confuse enemies, dumdum (explosive) pistol rounds, and many other helpful items.

Fairly smart enemies and a wide variety of aliens.  Challenging bosses as well.

A lot of objectives on each map.  Rescue the hidden ""babes"", find keycards, solve lock puzzles, even crush toilets and drink the water to regain health.  And you get a good number of maps too!

I would suggest picking this game up, you get a lot of play time out of it.  Its a good blast from the past for us who miss the N64 on occassion.",4.0
ok first off i would like to add duke 3d is mutch better . but their are alot of improvements  over this first off the grabbing theme is mutch better but all in game music is. Gone so any track's that we'er in the pc verson are gone and dukes  1 liners are censored  however their  are  some good things. one his pistol looks much cooler wit h a laser sighting addded. the last boss moveing in 3d but these are just small up gradeing . i say download ed its free and you can buy duke 3d and have a ball plus when you get good with pc you can all so join multiplayer games over it.,4.0

"I have always loved this game since I was a child. They incorproate all of the events from the movie in a really uniwue way, and there is relatively good level variety. But I say relatively, because a few of the levels seem to be awfully similar to each other.",4.0
"When I hear of a Tarzan video game, I don't think of it like this. In some ways it's good. Other ways... Not so much.
P.S: I had to buy the game elsewhere from here because the 2 copies I bought here arrived busted.

The Good:
FMVs before every stage come right from the film, aren't grainy, and get you pumped for the level ahead.
Nice controls. Works best with the Analog Stick in my opinion.
Lush and colorful backgrounds.

The Bad:
Extremely blocky graphics, even for PlayStation. The N64 and PC are the same as well.
No continues. (If you die, highly unlikely.)
The jump is a bit delayed, which can cause accidental deaths.

Overall, I like this title and I'd recommend it.",4.0
"MY daughter had this game for the PC when she was maybe 5 or 6.  She loved it.  The Playstation version is EXACTLY the same.  In comparison to 2012, the graphics are crude but this game follows along with the animated Disney movie in may ways, though it is not a storybook adventure.  My daughter had as much playing it at 18 as she did when she was little on the PC and it took us all back to her childhood.  For a couple dollars, it was worth the investment.",4.0
Great game but never got the manual (which was supposed to be included).  It would be nice if you got what you paid extra for.,4.0
"I got this game and I thought it was going to be just an okay game. Did I ever find out how wrong I was! The game is absolutely addictive! You can play as the Global Defense Initiative (GDI)the good guys or the bad guys, who are simply called the NOD. There are 15 GDI missions and 13 NOD missions. There are also two exclusive N64 only missions for each side. The grapihics are okay, but not anything real fancy. If you want to run the game in High Resolution mode make sure you have an expansion pack; this also makes the graphics better. Just remember to go to the opions menu and select High Resolution everytime you play because if you don't the game will run on Medium Resolution. When you use and airstrick for the GDI or use a lot of flamthrowers, flamtankes, or a Nuclear Missile for the NOD, the game play will so slow down to a crawl until the fire stopsm but after the napalm is it out the game goes back to its normal speed. When a soldier dies he spills over and a little pile of blood comes out and then it disappears along with the body. If you run over enemy troops with tank or something, you get a squishy sound. When a soldier dies you may hear a scream. These are the only violent grapcis in the game. The music is great at times, but some of the tracks are boring. This is the best strategy game for the N64! A little hint to help is that the NOD are great at whiping out infantry while the GDI are better equipped to handle tanks and defensive positions. When you are capable to produce tanks and vehicles build vehicles instead of infratry because a NOD flame tank or a NOD flamethrower can wipe out a lot of infantry with no problem at all. If you play as the NOD then build turrets and light tanks to take out the GDI forces. You can use a group of light tanks to run over infantry. Also another hint is that if you play as NOD build some recon motorcycles in the later missions when GDI uses ORCAs, they are kind of like helicopters, to harrass you and if the recon units are in guard mode they will attack the flying pests. This is definitely a must have since new N64 games are no longer coming out. Some of the later missions can take up to three to four hours to complete. Have fun!",4.0
This game is cool.  It's the only N64 game I know of that allows you to command attacks and build things to help you in your conquest.  The graphics are only OK if you don't have an expansion pack.,4.0
"It's a good game, hell it's a great game but it' not worth over 100 dollars. That's my only critique. Sellers on here are asking way too much or this game. It was revolutionary for it time, but it's not worth an arm  and a leg. I still have my copy from Walmart back when stores still sold ps1 games (showing my age eh) and it was about 30 something then. It's a great game but don't break the bank over it.",4.0

"I never got the chance to play this growing up. I finally went out to buy it to see what all the hype was about, and it took me back to memory lane. I love the soundtrack, and love the overall interactive design. The interaction factor can keep you engaged. The story was always weird to me, and felt like patchwork, but now that I am older and wiser, I can make sense out of it now. After playing through this recently, I can saw that for its time, it may have been seen as the greatest ever, but I have a few grips I don't like about it. Yet, still it is good game! I played Crisis Core first, so next will be Dirge of Cerebus. To any fan or newcomer to Final Fantasy, such as myself, I highly recommend this game, but you will have to set aside alot of time to get the most out of it.",4.0

"It's most likely that you have played, or at least heard of FF7 somewhere along the line. Given how much praise it gets even to this day, over a decade later. But with so much praise, there is a big chance for letdowns. Most of the acclaim for this entry in the series comes from the fact it ""was"" a graphical monster. No RPG had been done in 3D before it, but if you take that away; what else makes it so good? Well thankfully, there are many other strengths that the game has going for it. The characters are very well done for the most part, although I question Cloud's consistency in personality throughout the game; still the characters are for the most part very unique. The story is, as you'd expect from the Final Fantasy name; amazing. Although it too gets tangled up some times, the main theme is still very much worth playing for. The game plays much like the other titles, any character in the game can use any magic in your inventory. If you have played any of the earlier titles you'd probably feel right at home. The sounds in this game are very nice, and the music is amazing throughout. The only things I can say would turn you off for this title would be that the price may be a bit much for a used copy. The other is that most people these days are spoiled with amazing graphics, and might not really get into this sort of game. But if you can look past these issues, then I'd say absolutely; you should get it.",4.0
"I had never played this game until this year; I wanted to see if this game lived up to its name.

My previous experience with this series includes X, XI, and a touch of XIII; I have to say that while I enjoy parts of X, on the whole I hate these games.  Most of this hatred stems from having more hours of cut scenes than hours of actual gameplay.  I also like RPG's to have a roaming element; I like being able to explore and I like finding sidequests and items.  I did not get that with these titles.  I expected FFVII to be the same and just riding its reputation.

Bad news first.  This is a PlayStation 1 game, and oh my does it look it.  This is an ugly game.  Battles aren't bad and cut scenes could be worse, but walking around is bad.  When exploring an area, it's often difficult to identify exits, ramps and ladders, and various ""switches.""  There's a command that highlights ladders and exits to other areas, but ramps and switches are still hidden.  This option has saved me some headaches, but it's aesthetically displeasing.  RPG's hadn't started the ""journal"" thing yet, so skipping dialogue (even accidentally) or coming back to game after a busy week can lead to some confusion.  The combat system because combat isn't intuitive and that there are a few too many status effects, some of which can easily break the game with a bit of bad luck.

Good news.  The characters are varied and this together with the materia system allows for a wonderful amount of customization and different play styles.  The characters themselves, while definitely cliche, have decent back-stories and fairly strong characterization.  I've heard a lot of complaints about character angst in this game, but I think those complaints are exaggerations and what angst is there matches the story and characters well.  The plot itself is solid and has plenty of twists.  The combat system works.  I say it's complicated and unintuitive, but it functions well and allows experimentation with different tactics.  Most importantly, there isn't a single algorithm for success; there are a variety of viable strategies for combat.  Most sidequests are fun, and while you don't need the sidequest rewards to beat the game, those prizes are often quite powerful but not overpowered.  This is nice as said sidequests neither feel like fluff/padding nor only masquerading as optional.  The net result is that the game rewards exploration and experimentation.  An additional nice touch is that grinding is, on the whole, unnecessary.  The cut scenes are well done, always convey something relevant, and never overstay their welcome.

Summary:  The graphics are bad enough to be a turn-off, but this is the only thing that doesn't hold up well.  It's a long, fun game with plenty of replay value.  The combat is complex, but it works well and that complexity allows the player to be creative and to try some very interesting things.  This game certainly has its problems, but its quality is undeniable and it's rapidly becoming my favorite game.",4.0
"So least to say. I felt compelled to write about this game. I have at least 5 good friends growing up that told me I HAD to play this game and that it was just so amazing...

So I finished the game and here is what I have to say.

Good things: Cool Summons. Great music. Creative plot/atmospheres.

THINGS I HATE: GETTING ATTACKED EVERY TWO SECONDS. I WANT TO PLAY THE DAMN GAME AND STORY, NOT FIGHT STUPID LITTLE CREATURES EVERY TWO SECONDS THAT GIVE JACK SQUAT FOR XP. I also hated Those YOU GOTTA BE @#!$# KIDDING ME moments that happened at least 5 times where I was really far and some crazy enemy pulls out 20x attacks on me before I can even prepare or respond and I have to waste another hour of my life (which working as much as I do, don't really have anymore)starting back from a save point. I hate how they didn't even bother naming the towns on the @!#$#ING MAP. Seriously guys? Really? I have to hop on the internet everytime I have to remember where some random town is? stupid... Oh and I love how at the end of the game, the creators got a ridiculous notion to make every creature except for a few have INSTANT kill spells etc. That is super. @#$#@ing. annoying. I shouldn't have to carry 200x Phoenix Down's to make it through the end of the game... And if one of you nerds lame excuses like ""well why didn't you barrier at the start of every fight"", well it's because I shouldn't have to barrier unless I'm fighting a real boss. They just made a lot of the parts of this game SUPER annoying and irritating. And as much as I wanted to say @%#@ this, I felt compelled to play since everyone ranted about how amazing this game was...

So sorry to my friends and people who are obsessed with this game. Chrono Cross takes a huge dump on this game in every way except for the story (which i had to read way into the background on both to fully understand them. I don't have any problems with reading complex stories). I absolutely loved Chrono Cross. I was not impressed with FFVII at all.",4.0
"While this game may not be the very best RPG in my opinion, I must give this game credit for being able to finally throw the RPG genre into the mainstream for two gaming generations. This game was the first game in the series to feature stunning FMV with 3D character models in pre-rendered backgrounds, which was a major step up for the RPG world, considering that any RPG released before this one either only had 3D models during battle sequences or none at all, but of course graphics are not everything. Gameplay will always matter much more than the graphics in any game; it is the sole reason games are played, to enjoy the game itself with graphics just being an added bonus to the already great game itself.

This game still maintains the fast-paced ATB system where the characters must react in a timely manner to defeat the enemies or bosses that will cross paths with the characters controlled in the battles. One of the greatest highlights of this game is that this is the first game in the series to have a science fiction based plot otherwise unseen in earlier titles, and very few other RPGs at the time.
This game is also the first in the series to add character peripherals such as ""materia"". Materia can be equipped and can be made more powerful each time it is used.

Overall, I would highly recommend this title to advanced and beginners alike, as this game has a straightforward level up system with a neat addition of the character peripheral I have mentioned above. This should last one a good 50-70 hours, depending on whether one decides to undertake the various sidequests offered in the game or not.",4.0
"Everyone complains how great or how bad this game was. To me when it first came out I loved it, it was the first Final Fantasy game I played i was like 9 or 10 years old. I still like the game a lot yes now it has bad graphics but they were cool back then. The story was good but at times made you laugh. Cloud was alright but there has been better but I thought sephiroth was a great bad guy and to me the best character in the game. Yes it is long but I enjoy games that take time to beat and it wasn't very difficult to beat. I enjoyed that there was a lot of extra stuff to do in the game besides the main storyline which is smoething games are missing these days.

All in all I still enojy playing this game as most of the other Final Fantasy's, my favorite is 9 to be honest. They all have good and bad things about them. So it's not my favorite game but its still one of them.",4.0
"The only qualm I have for the game itself is that, while I can play it on my Play Station 2, I can not save it on there because the memory disk-things are a different format than those of a PS1.

The game was delivered to me promptly and in extremely good condition, practically like new, minus the cellophane.",4.0
"Got this game quickly in the mail and was as it was described! Fun to play, lots of characters and villians. A good plot. Overall a great buy!",4.0
"I enjoyed this game a lot for many reasons, mainly nostalgia and pure fun factor. I've played a few RPGs over time and most I just couldn't get into enough to beat.

Final Fantasy VII was different because it was pretty much consistently fun and the story was engaging. The graphics were great at the time (I remember being awestruck by them then) and today the pre-rendered backgrounds still have some amazing detail and art. Character design is going to be a little strange for some people who are used to today's graphics; during exploration and some of the interaction your character is ""super-deformed"" and looks like a kid while in battle he is fully grown and adult in stature.

If you play the game within the context it was made and considering what it was up against you may appreciate its style more. On top of that, many of the elements within the game are still great and have aged gracefully in time- the great battle system, intriguing story (although imho it had a few too many twists toward the end), collecting ""materia"" (essentially a crystal-like material that adds abilities and power to weapons, armor, and your character, and allows you to summon creatures; also, it levels up the more you use it and your spells/abilities gain power), the dystopian-style setting, quirky characters, and the overall ""sci-fi meets fantasy"" feel.

But there are some negatives, and I'll list them-

1. (This is relative to your gaming habits and expectations)- as with most serious rpg games, FFVII is long, featuring 3 disks and about 50-60 hour of gameplay. Save points are usually plentiful enough though.

2. Like many Final Fantasy games, there is no quest log to tell you what your current quest/mission is. So if decide to not play it for a week or more and come back to it and know what to do you might find yourself lost (I did, anyway). FORTUNATELY, there is gamefaqs and other websites to help you with that.

3. The 3D graphics are old and simple and some of the super-deformed characters may not be appealing to people who are used to today's games.

4. Some (occasionally) repetitive battles and animations.

5. Mostly linear storyline and game.

I think a lot of people tend overrate this game. It's very good and still better than a lot of games out there yet it might not be everyone's cup of tea. The story, while told AMAZINGLY well, doesn't give a message that everyone has to hear (especially if you've already seen movies like ""Avatar""). That being said it is one of three rpgs I actually played all the way through, and that is saying something. If there are some things that keep me coming back to it they're probably nostalgia, collecting materia, playing through memorable parts (especially the boss battles, which are just plain fun and strategy-intensive) and the battle system (especially with the ""death blow"" materia; ""limit breaks"" are great too).

Parental Note- The ESRB rating was, imho, questionable. Some of the adult subject matter seems to push it closer into M- rated territory. I'd say it's borderline T/M.",4.0
"Well I've never beaten this game. Actually I've never beaten any Final Fantasy game. For all games, you are forced to level up by repeatedly going up against foes. Anyway i liked this game, especially the part where you have to dress cloud up like a girl. Favorite part of the game. I did get to the end to fight Sephiroth, but I could never beat him. Anyway this was actually the second Final Fantasy game I played. I got Final Fantasy 8 and got close to beating it, but didn't. Yes a character does die, and that sucks because I thought maybe Cloud would end up with her, but oh well.",4.0
"All ""cloud's giant sword"" jokes aside, this game has one of the most loyal fanbase in gaming.
Is it worthy of all the fanfare?

Well, i don't thing it's worthy of rabid fanboyism and a 200 dollor price range, but it is a damn good game.

Dispensing with my usual ""the good, the bad, and the meh."" format. let's do a rundown by detail.

Graphics:
It is a real mixed bag.
The character models out of battle look ridiculous out of battle and pretty nice in battle.
the backgrounds range to beautifully picturesque to ""let's see how much brown we can get away with."" The cutscenes are pretty epic.

*SPOILER ALERT*

The high points to me were the opening, the shinra building getting blown up and part of midgar callapsing onto a section of the slums.

*okay you can look now*

The gameplay:
No real suprises really, aside from it including an active time battle system.

Minigames:
They are actually pretty neat and they give you lots of incentive to do them.
(maybe a little too much incentive actually, seeing how one of them is the only place to get Omnislash.) My favorite being the chocobo farming and racing.

The story:
Well, pretty good, but i think FF VI and IV did it better tbh.

Most of the game is traveling around the world chasing the big bad while avoiding or fighting the other big bad (shrinra) and unraveling the past.
oh, and there's this really weird scene in wall-market...

The music:
Here's where the game REALLY shines, giving us some of the most memorable tunes in video games.
Just listen to One winged angel, Now THAT is what death sounds like!
(albeit kinda a Jaw's theme rip-off)
Cosmo Canyon's theme is amazing.
The shinra theme stands out to me to.

Music is subjective though so you may hate it.

The characters:
Cloud: For most of the game, he's a pretentious douchebag, but he lightens up a bit near the end.

Barret: He is Mr T. (I guess someone at square really liked the A-team.)

Tifa: Sweet, good-natured girl who isn't afraid to fist fight godzilla. (kinda awesome.)
oh, and she has a thing for cloud, for some reason. Speaking of that...

Aerith: The obligatory love interest.

Red XIII: He's a lion that talks. He's the most level headed.

Cid: A washed up, foul mouth old pilot/technician  (my favorite.)

Vincent: He's a shapeshifting vampire and he's kinda sad about it.
His past happens to be kinda messed up...he's even sadder about that.

Yuffie: Was the lolita ninja a trope before this girl?

Cait Sith: I really don't remember many details about this thing beside that he's a robot controlled by Reeve , a shinra employee.

I'd go over the antogonist but i don't want this review/retrospectic go be much longer.

So, if these character's sound cool to you then great!

If you like this game then check out, Legend of Dragoon, by the way.

"I like how 90% of people either rate this game absolutely perfect or a complete waste of time with almost no 2-4 star ratings. Complete fanboyism or complete anti-fanboy, fanboyism. Let it be known that I did not grow up with this game so I don't have the nostalgia glasses on when reviewing this game. So, let me grab my anti-flame shield to avoid being destroyed by 30-something-year old, butthurt fanboys for giving this game a star less from absolute perfection.

1. Gameplay/Battle System - The controls are intuitive and easy to understand. Nothing complicated there. The game's challenge comes in the ATB where characters have to actively wait before acting on your commands. It creates a tension in battle because you have to quickly decide what to do before time is up and you can't afford those precious seconds wasted, especially during boss battles. The game is neither too hard nor too easy. Power leveling isn't required for normal battles. Grinding a level or two is required for some bosses, especially the secret ones. Ohter than that the game does a good job with difficulty. The materia system takes some getting used to however. That is the complicated part to really grasp and use intelligently. Some characters, like Tifa wouldn't be a good healer, so white magic materia is useless to her. You have to take each characters stats into play when equipping them with materia on their weapons. I like the strategy system in play, though some felt it to be somewhat overly complicated.

Plotline/Characters - Many people consider this the best part of the game. I think it's a very intelligent story, even by today's standard. In fact, it's better than about 90% of video game plotlines. No exaggeration and I played this game in 2010. It really does get you caring about the characters. One thing I didn't like however, and this is kinda big, is the main protaganist Cloud Strife. He's just plain unlikeable and hasn't the slightest inkling of a distinct personality, BUT the storyline justifies him being the way he is and I understand his appeal to young people, but I just plain don't like him. He has basically no personality. Everyone else, especially Tifa are very likeable and you find yourself involved with their personal place in the overarching plot.

Graphics - First rpg with 3D rendering that complimented the gameplay and story. PSOne graphics aside, they are groundbreaking like everything else.

Overall, this is a fantastic game. A few unanswered story elements and an  emotionally dead protaganist are my only real gripes. If you have a ps2, buy this game. Do it. Forget the hype, haters and fanboyism and enjoy this marvelous experience. Cheers and happy gaming!",4.0
"I found the only challenge to be the weapons and the final showdown with sephiroth. This was a great game but way to easy to play because i played Phantasy Star prior to this. On the other hand it had a slew of extra missions and hidden items and stuff to play for. Find the ribbons and sephiroth will be a lot easier to fight. I found two.

"Final Fantasy 7, although over ten years old, is still listed by many people as the best game ever. The biggest reason is the story line of the game, and the development of the characters. This is one of those games where you start fretting that you're near the end, and a whole new level to the game opens up instead.
  The only bummer for the game is the ten-year-old graphics. The graphics at that time were drastically increasing, and ff7 is frozen where it is. The characters have block hands like legos and the hi-res movies are below gameplay quality in games today. But don't let that get to you.
  Although the game is old, this is one of the greatest game made, it opened up a lot of advancement in how character development is handled in games. It's also one of the few games that so many sequels, prequels, and even movies have been from. I highly recommend them all, but first start with the game that began the whole movement.",4.0
"This review is more about sellers than the game itself. I was just looking through and found people selling versions of FFVII without the original case, artwork or manual for upwards of $50.

"I'm on my dad's account and I'm 13 and I found this game under my tv and started to play it. to my surprize it was fun and mostly easy. i had just beat kingdom hearts 2 (also a very good game) it is made by the same person who made final fantasy 7 and I think it was the best horrible graphic game i have ever played. yes i know that the game was made a long time ago so im not going to judge it by that. but i really liked the game. if u don't mind bad graphics and sometimes haveing to figure it out then im sure you will love this game like i did. (maybe you should try to play kindom hearts also, best game ever)",4.0
"i liked this one. story was good enough to keep me playing battle system was sweet. materia system made it more strategic as to the reason of having a limited amount of slots to equip them on. ENDLESS weapons to collect. lots of mini games. some people kick it for having poor graphics..too bad they cant see it was created in late 90s..oh well if ignorance is bliss :). i liked FF II(4 in jap) a lil more better then vii ive so far replayed II about 10 times of off and on playing from the gba port to when it first came out. a good game to try and get into the final fantasy universe. still lookin to get this one again..need to beat the weapons at end of game. was surprised when i saw a revamped vid of this couple years ago. wouldve been awesome to see it all polished and see what would have been added into it. over all a good rpg game to try out.

"Well from Final Fantasy series the only games that I have play are FFIV, FFVI, FFVII and FFVIII, I liked the materia system wich allow to customize how you use magic, but the story was a little cliche, an evil corporation(Shinra) who are sucking energy from the planet, and the good guys here want to stop them. Also the evil guy (Sephirot) want to destroy and again the heroes want to stop him.  Well Overall it's one of the best rpg ever created but not the best (my personal favorite one Final Fantasy 6).",4.0
The overall gameplay works fine but there have been minor lagging in cutscenes overall I am pleased with this game and it's one of the best games ever created you should definently check this one out if your a FF fan.,4.0
"I'll admit, the first time I ever played this game, I wasn't that into it. The main reason was that there, in my opinion, too many damn mini-games that were kinda hard (I STILL can't figure out how to get in line with the soldiers at the parade in I think Junon). Also, the music, while very emotional, is very very sad. So is the story... it got a little depressing to me.

But that was the first time I played it. Now I'm playing it again (this is my third time and I just beat the game about 6 months ago), and I'm finding the mini-games aren't quite as difficult; I'm not getting lost nearly as much, and I've gotta say the music's not quite so depressing anymore either. Also, I think it helps to play Crisis Core (PSP prequel to the game) or at least watch Advent Children (movie whose plot takes place about 2 years after the events of the PS game). The story is still quite sad, but it works. I think anyone who is into RPGs will definitely enjoy this one.",4.0
"This is definetly one of the greatest games ever made- but remember its gotten quite old now, and for diehard RPG fans this game is not that great.",4.0
"I have been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy saga, since the Super Nintendo came out (would have been regular Nintendo, except I couldn't get anyone to buy it for me  lol) One thing I miss about Final Fantasy 7 is that you don't really go through and get random magics while you leveled up (always made me more interested when my mage would level to see what was next).  Instead it has a Materia system, where at the end of each battle, you earned AP, which is required to get your materia higher level (ie the fire materia might have fire 1, 2, and 3, so you have access to more spells.

 The flaw, it takes away most individualities from the FF saga. I can take my female or male characters and they hit close to the same.  Everyone old-school RPGer knows the basics....keep your mage and archers (any long-range attacker) at the back of the party because they get killed easier and regular attacks do little damage, and keep swordsmen, samurai, etc at the front because they are tougher and do much more damage.

  Most of the characters, no matter their past do the same basic damage, or close to it, and magics can be used by anyone, so if going to fight a bunch of monsters weak against fire (for example), everyone can be equipped with Fire 3...though admittedly it is fun mixing and matching your materia for different effects, like using the ""all"" materia linked to a spell, so it hurts everyone or heals everyone with 1 use, otherwise any attack spell or healing spell can only be used on 1 character or monster

  With these said, it's a good game, with good storyline and fairly good graphics and gameplay, and I would recommend this game to any RPG or FF fan, even though to master takes a bit of practice",4.0
"I'm not even going to bother repeating some of the things people have said in the 1100+ reviews of this game, but I would like to address some of those things.

1. THE GRAPHICS ARE TERRIBLE.

A. This complaint is most often seen in reviews written by people who purchased the game during the advent of the PS2 when graphics were starting to become crisper and clearer. The graphics aren't ""good"" because the game was made in 1997. Get this into your head before you devalue this game for its poor graphics. Strangely enough, I've seen this complaint more frequently in games like this than in older ""top-down"" RPGs like FFV or FFVI.

2. THE STORY IS CRAP.

A. This is half true, but also somewhat untrue. FFVII's storyline is actually quite colorful and interesting, and I think people miss the point of an RPG when they complain that ""hours go by without story development"". Lame as some may find it, this is a typical characteristic of most RPGs because the character needs to be given time to prepare for difficulties later in the game. However, I must agree that FFVII's story is a bit disjointed and confusing, but once you find a site that explains it all for you, it makes much more sense and is a bit less stupefying. This does raise the complaint, however, that not enough was explained in the game; this is true. A game should provide complete closure on all aspects of its plot by the ending credits, but FFVII does not.

3. A MAIN CHARACTER DIES AND YOU CAN'T REVIVE THEM.

A. Characters that ""die"" in Final Fantasy battles do not actually ""die"". Like in the famous Pokemon series, when one loses all of its hit points (HP), it ""faints"" and must be revived through treatment. I think this concept is more clear in later RPGs (who give you 1 HP after a battle in which a character faints). The Phoenix Down is a bit confusing because of the Phoenix traditionally reviving the ""dead"", but let me assure you, characters never DIE in an RPG unless the story permits it (as is the case of FFVII). Why people really complain about this is kind of a mystery to me. Perhaps they're angry that they spent so much time building Aeris up only to have her go kaput. That's understandable.

3. THE BATTLE SYSTEM IS UNBALANCED.

A. I'm inclined to disagree with this complaint. Because of the way one can easily switch the powers of one character to another causes the player not to become too dependent on one character. With unique abilities, for example, the player might invest all of their time in one character that has proven to be useful only to find them completely worthless against a boss that is immune to their particular skill. In FFVII, any character can be invaluable against a boss as long as they have been equipped with the right stuff. This is quite an advantage in FFVII. Sure, it may make the characters seem less unique, but it might save one some frustration when combating difficult enemies in the game.

Apart from that, the music is amazing and the gameplay is fantastic. Despite some minor drawbacks, this game is definitely in the running for the top ten RPGs of all time.",4.0
"Hi this is to be heard this game is good while not in my opinion the BEST game ( I've played a LOAD of games so competition for my favorites can be fierce ) but nonetheless is very good after all how can you not love the characters even if the graphics aren't amazing anymore plus nice storyline I wouldn't recommend giving it to a 6 yr. old though unless you've taugh them a couple words they usually WOULDN'T know until later or they are really mature she was playing games like that when i was about 7 though she's about 5 yrs. older now (12)
so that kinda thing dosn't bother me or her but I know some parents are a little more strict on that kinda thing so you know... she combats a ""really harsh review"" as she says and it'll be easier to just link.unfortunately we can't do that so we'll tell you the name  the review's name is ""once again..."" it's the first review under the 1 * reviews ( 1 star ) and underneath the review is the word comment click it to see her review there it is. note that she says this is REALLY important to get across it'll be under both the kid AND normal review sections ( I'M writing it this time i'm her mom though i'm writing almost exactly what she said with a few minor changes of course! doing what was wanted ) thanks for hearing us out!",4.0
"I can't believe how many gamers are hailing this game as the best final fantasy ever... i mean i know everyone has a different opinion and all but i mean come on, hasn't any of you played final fantasy 6? that game pretty much did everything this game did, only so much better. where do i begin?

characters: cloud-an emo whiny brat that annoyed me to know end. i wish there was a shut up spell in this game to make him stop crying. barret-how many black stereotypes can we fit into a single character? lame.

Tife-hey she has a killer body, not much personality but hey sex sells right?. Yuffie-what was here purpose again?. -aeris-hey someone with potential, too bad she died before we could start to care. cait sith- although i shouldn't have to explain why this character is lame, ill do it anyways....hes a cat, that rides on a stuffed animal robot....pause for laughter....a CAT that rides on a robotic stuffed animal!!!!!! then there is Vincent: basically there for five minutes of an already convoluted story line that is other than that piece of the story he is in is an intirely optional character, and can be put in the OF NO REAL IMPORTANCE folder. oh and i almost forgot Cid: yup his character was so awesome that i almost for got to mention him. and then finaly Red 13. another character that had potential, but when your surrounded by a bunch of numbskulls, in a convoluted story line, you stop caring about one character that has potential.

then there is the main bad guy sepheroth... many people say he is the best bad guy EVER!!!! ""Sepheroth is so BAD TO THE BONE man he rulz!!!!"" he was equally as much of a whiny emo brat like cloud (he wanted to destroy the world cause he missed mommy and a whole lot of other silly plot twists to make the storyline seem more advanced and mature). and i say this whoile heartedly....if you get defeated by a group of 1)an emo whiner 2) a woman who has no real point in life other than to be said emo's love object (and to sell units do to sex appeal), and 3) a CAT riding a robotic stuffed animal you are A) not BAD TO THE BONE and B) disqualified from the greatest villain of all time list. sorry.

story line:convoluted. a lot of unnessisary plot twists, although it was servicable and interesting at points. it would have helped to add characters with...character into the mix. also there was several completely unncessary scenes in it where i thought totally didn't add a single thing to the game (the cloud in the bath tub with the dude or the cross dressing game?) plus the ending reeked of don't know what to do wiht the story line so lets just say this happens.

gameplay: once again servicable but nothing revolutionary or even evolutionary. as a matter of fact, i think this game takes a step backwords instead of forwards. 5 had the job system. 2 had the unique leveling system. 6 had not only unique skills per character, but had awesome gameplay sequences such as the opera house, the stategic scens where you control 3 parties to more and block advancing troops, etc etc. what did 7 do? had cool summon animations that got old after the second view and could not be skipped....pass!!!!

graphics. they were horrible. yes even for that time. save for the stunning FMV sequences and the cool summon scenes (that got old way too quick) there was nothing pretty about this game. dull grey and bland environments abound. characters that made Lego characters look realistic, and just an overall boring and grimmy disgusting lifelesslook to the whole project.

sigh...where do you find best FF ever from this game? Its not even close to the top 3. was it fun? yes. did it make RPG's popular in the states? Yes (although i prefer some of the other games that came out on the PS at the time, such as wild arms, suikodin, and revelations persona, more entertaining). but the best? not even close. although i have to say it is better than 8.",4.0
"Final Fantasy VII is a good game to play. It is difficult at some points in the game. I started 3 times just to overcome the beginning of the game and to progress to the continuation of the story. The story line is good. I especially like the stealing of items from monsters, to see what all you can get,sometimes a weapon or just healing items. Sofar I,m just at the stage where I left the city, and roaming the world map. I'm trying to get more familiar with it. It will take me a long time to finish this game, since it has 3 discs, maybe I'll never finish it.",4.0
"Let me just break this game down step by step.

Storyline:

Very good and very easy to follow. I like how it separates between Shinra and Sephiroth before the first disk is even half way over. Very addicting and very fun to follow, and it still always gets me going without ever getting old.

Graphics:

10 years ago these graphics were considered ""best of all time"".

10 years later, we ask ourselves 'What the heck is this crap?'

One thing that never gets old is the fact that these poorly drawn 3D characters are unequally proportioned. Huge hands, twig arms? No mouths or noses, and yet they have huge hair? In 2007 all I can think of is to thank whoever came up with REAL 3D graphics.

Characters:

Each has their own special personality that I love. Barrett being my favorite. His attitude and swearing habits are possibly the funniest thing in the game. I usually keep him in my party just for that reason. Cloud is  stubborn, but not as funny. Tifa's got that hair thing going(like I just mentioned). Aeris is kind of boring and dies too early in the game to get to know her a lot more than you do. Red XII.....he's a dog? Cid, another character who can't control his mouth. Yuffie....some ninja girl that really serves no more meaning than a side quest. Vincent, amazing character who can morph into creatures. And Cait Sith....wait a minute, he's a toy? O.O;;;

Bosses:

Each have their own difficulty which I like.

Some require you to actually have trained or else face a brutal whipping. Final 3 bosses each have their own ""twang"" to them. Especially Sephiroth who is fun to go up against time and time again. I mean c'mon, who doesn't like a cool character with a wing for an arm? Music kind of gets to you though and his 5 minute Super Nova attack gets really frustrating when he does it about 10 times.

I kind of wish there were more than 2 All-American Creature bosses though

Magic:

The whole materia thing is fun, except for the fact that it ruins your stats.

Limit Breaks:

Easy to use, hard to obtain.

Playability:

Very-High

I've replayed this game time after time again without getting bored. I try new strategies and new characters each time and try to level up differently than I did before.",4.0
"I was in high school when this game came out. I saw the commercials. I was little confused about the title (what happened to Final Fantasies 4 through 6???), but the game looked cool. I wanted it.

I did not have a psx, though. However, my best friend did. A week after he bought it, he invited me over, and he showed me the game. I was hooked by the time Cloud and Barrett rushed off the train.

I had to have the game. It was like no other Final Fantasy. The characters and the environments were so vivid... so REAL.

I left my friend's house with a burning desire to own this game and the knowledge of what had happened to Final Fantasies 4 through 6 (or Final Fantasies 2, 3, and 5).

After a few months of saving I had enough money, and I bought the Playstation, a memory card, and Final Fantasy 7.

All in all, the game kept me riveted until the very end. The presentation was incredible. The story was intriguing. The game, for me, was an absolutely breath-taking experience.

Really, the only turn-offs for me were a handful of instances where the translation was confusing and some weird instances of homosexual innuendo (honestly, that was more comical than detracting).

By today's standards, the graphics are dated, but I still play through this game from time to time, and I thoroughly enjoy it every time.",4.0
"This is a truly great game, some people feel that it's the best of the series, I wouldnt go that far, but I'm still quite pleased.  The only problem is that there is no objectives list, and no map markers for objectives, so you really have to pay attention to whats being said by the characters in the story or you'll have no idea where to go.  And of course, if you stop playing for a month or whatever you might need a walkthrough to get back on track lol.",4.0
"I literally wasted an entire summer playing FF 7. It's that good, people! The storyline is a big plus, Final Fantasy games always have good storylines but even for them it's exceptional. It starts off as a simple good v. evil thing, but quickly explodes into a complex tale featuring some of video games' most memorable characters: Aerith, Sepheroth, Barret, Cid and our troubled hero, Cloud Strife. There's also a great battle system, a multitude of vechiles at your disposal, an excellent soundtrack, and plenty of other goodies. Really, my only complaint is the graphics, which even then only looked bad to me because I first bought it in 2004.",4.0
This is a good game overal.  the cut scenes can get a bit long.  but I would buy it if you like the final fantasy series.  I would not pay over 29 for this game.  It is an older game and people are just ripping others off.  there are alot of other places to get this.  Dont get taken,4.0
"...this is certainly one of the weakest games in the series,IMO.  I can remember back in middle school when everyone was raving about this game.  I remember watching a video my friends made of the game.  It spanned the entire game and I was totally enthralled.  I didn't end up owning a copy of FFVII until FFVIII was just released.  I received both games at the same time.  I tried out FFVII first and to be honest I found it cumbersome.  I eventually went on to play FFVIII and loved it.  I try not to let my exprience with FFVIII ruin my experience with any of the other games from the series but so far none of them have lived up to FFVIII.  My first experience with FFVII was a bit let down.  I killed the mighty Sephiroth in two hits.  The ending anti-climatic too.  It's a good thing that Advent Children came out.  The movie wasn't too promising storywise though.  I've gone back through and played FFVII many times just to see if I like the game any better.  It's hit and miss.  This time around I'm playing it and I must say I have noticed quite a few things.

Music:

For Midi files these are very well done.  The score to this game isn't my favorite.  Not a whole lot of the 'epic' tracks in the game really appeal to me.  Still, the presentation through the game is very nice and if you're new to the series then this is the game that features the quintessential FF music.

Gameplay:

The gameplay is relatively balanced.  There are no designated roles outside of character personality.  Each character is pretty much interchangable with minor differences here and there.  The controls are smooth, especially if you're using a new PS controller.  The magic system is balanced with strong physical attacks.  The game does reqire a bit of battle strategy and that's definately a plus.  The limit break system is great as well though some of the actually characters' final limit breaks are very disappointing.  Outside of Cloud, Aeris, and Tifa the other characters' limit breaks are pretty weak but visually fulfiling. Also, the materia system isn't too hard to understand though I had trouble with it the first time I played through the game.  Personally, I find it to be a bit lackluster for the fact that, unless you set it up a certain way, detracts from a character's role in the party.  At least with 8 and beyond you could get a feel for who played what role in your party.  I do think that if you're a newcomer to the series or RPGs in general then the gameplay is fantastic.  Fluidity and simplicity are a great pairing.

Plot:

Weak.  I'm sorry but the plot to this game is weak and it's very confusing. There are a lot of things that go unresolved in this game plus there are so many dry spots where nothing of merit is happening. The core storyline is intriguing but the presentation seems to be jumbled, IMO. Cloud is the hero and I think he fails in the role.  It may be due to a terrible english translation from the original Japanese but Cloud comes off as a major prude.  He's aloof, weak minded, and has terrible dialogue.  It's very frustrating.  The storyline was just interesting enough for me to get through the game.  It's mainly the final fight with Sephiroth that drew me into the game.  However, if you're a higher level character...or you just have some upper level limit breaks then you should easily make quick work of this alleged 'badass'.  The ending resolves very little and creates more questions than answer.  The ending to this was even worse than that of FFX.  At least with FFX there was X-2.  It took years for Advent Children to come out and even the movie couldn't salvage the disappointing ending to FFVII.

Characters:

Here is where I find my biggest gripe with the game.  Cloud is just borderline pathetic.  I'll never forget what he said to everyone right before you go down to fight Jenova at the bottom of the crater.  There is no real love story between himself and Aeris.  It's questionable if Cloud is heterosexual or not.  Sephiroth is probably the fanchise's most recognizable character.  He's the reason I watched Advent Children.  However, anyone who shows relative skill at this type of game genre could probably wipe the floor with the Almighty Sephiroth.  Going through the game now I find Sephiroth to be a bit of a tweener as well.  Barret has to be the most stereotypical character I've ever seen.  I'm surprised the NAACP hasn't lobbied Square.  The only characters I really have any respect for are Cid and Vincent.  Tifa is a great character as well but her inability to get Cloud's attention is irritating.  Cid is a brash and cocky individual which you can't help but love and Vincent is the mall goth that could rip you to shreds.  Red XIII is a very well done character. However, the biggest turd in all of FF history came with the creation of Cait Sith.  I really do wish they would've replaced Cait Sith with Reeve later in the game.  For Reeve's good nature to get the best of him and join forces with Cloud directly would've been fantastic.  Overall, the characters do have enough depth to them to allow the player to show some attatchment.

Conclusion:

As much as I complain about this game there is certainly something about it that will keep you playing it for hours on end.  It has solid replay value.  Most all of the FF games do.  It's just a matter of which one captivates you the most.  This game just wasn't for me.  The FF clique from high school I used to hang out with all adored this game and hated FFVIII. I'd have to say that this is probably the gateway game I'd use to get someone into the series and turn based RPGs in general. The gameplay is balanced and simple enough for all gamers and the storyline is interesting enough to keep you playing.  Also, paying attention to the music coreography will only enhance your experience with this game.  Enjoy.",4.0

"Final Fantasy VII - Circa 1997

GOOD:

- Considered a Classic PS1 RPG by many people

- Arguably Best story in a video game

- Epic story with fleshed out character

BAD:

- Graphics are really dated, 3D character models looked old even in 1997

- Game play may feel dated

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Turn based RPG

- No voice-overs, so there is lots of reading

- Unless your looking for or like that retro look/feel of an RPG, it will feel dated to those raised on Final Fantasy X or Kingdom Hearts

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Final Fantasy VIII

- Final Fantasy IX

- Legend of Dragoon

- Chrono Cross

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is two versions of this game in one version the female playable character is called Aeris and in another it is called Aerith (note this is the same character)

- There is a version for the P.C. as well

- The CG movie Final Fantasy: Advent Children is a direct sequel to this game

- Note: all Final Fantasy are not related to one another, think of each Final Fantasy a it's own game not connect in any real/true way to another Final Fantasy, the only exception is Final Fantasy X-2 which is a sequel to Final Fantasy X",4.0
"Now i've beat final fantasies 6,7,8,9,X,X-2 tactics and tactics advanced.  Out of all those games there is simply one thing that i can not do without.  which is a Killer story. For its time FF7 had a killer story but the only killer part of it was the infamous sephiroth aeris scene, which i almost shed a tear for.

It did have memorable characters.  Tifas chest, clouds hair and sword.  Barret with his gun arm, Aeris with her innocence. and Sephiroth with his mean look. Though alot of the other ff's had memorable characters.

I had a problem with the whole materia use, i prefer the junction system of ff8. but the gameplay didn't please no annoy me. It was just a means to getting where all gamers want to go which is the end of the game. and Speaking of the end of the game, the final boss is the one reason i won't play this game again.  I got to him once, beat him once and vowed never to play this again.

Advice:  If you're into realistic graphics and in my view a better story than go with ff8, but don't get me wrong this is a great game, just not what alot of others say.",4.0
This game is OK but not near as good as FF9. FF9 has better graphics. The characters look like dolls. The cut scenes have good graphics. If you want this game get it for a cheap price or get FF9. If your a big Final Fantasy buy it but if not I don't think you should get it. I think you should buy FF9 instead.,4.0
"OK, i know this game is supposedly the best game ever. It even says so on the back of the disc case as ""quite possibly the greatest game ever made"" (GameFan). I can agree that this is indeed a superb game with a great storyline, it's just that some things in the game drag it down, which is why i gave it four stars. Let's start with the Pros.

  Pros: An excellent storyline (one that's far easier to understand than FF VIII) that truly brings out the characters and their moving development. The multitude of characters are also a big plus. Everyone from the uber-sweet folk like Ester and Marlene all the way to the downright evil Heidegger and Sephiroth, with everyone else falling somewhere in the vast expanse between the two. Some characters are even evil, yet you feel sympathy for them. Characters like Dyne who only wants to see his daughter again, or Cait Sith, a member of your party who's actually (SPOILER SPOILER) a robot controlled from a guy in Shinra HQ, yet he tries to be on the good side... most of the time. The music is another huge plus in this game. Tunes such as Aeris' theme and the Boss Fight theme will be in your head for hours at a time. The sound effects are also a plus, most of which, if you're playing with surround sound, put you right in the game. The graphics are also very good for a PSOne game, with cut-scenes that look better than most PS2 games nowadays. The Materia system is probably the best magic system I've ever seen in a FF game, although FFX's thing with the orbs on the little map is also an excellent version. It gives the player a true ability to customize the character for particular bosses, i.e., before fighting a particularly tough Turk, you can equip your weapon to attack AND induce poison at the same time. The game also has an IMMENSE level of replay value. After you've gone through and beaten the final boss, you can go back and get all the Enemy Skills, collect each materia, raise a gold chocobo, defeat the Emerald and Ruby weapons (I've done it, it IS possible), get each Master Materia, raise each characters limits to level 4, get the secret characters Yuffi and Vincent, go to the Gold Saucer and waste some time and money, and many other challenges, such as beating the game again using only green materia or never saving except between discs (don't even try this unless you have a good tolerance for frustration). Replay value, a definite plus. OK, now for the bad news...

  Cons: The gameplay can get very, Very, VERY boring. Moments in the game take a complete departure from the action and elaborate on the storyline for much too long. (SPOILER SPOILER)Tifa's trip in Cloud's consciousness is a perfect example of this where over an hour is taken to reveal whether or not Cloud is a Sephiroth clone. You can't save the game anywhere in it, so you're stuck having to listen to this hour-long monologue, especially sucky if it's your 2nd time playing the game and you already know whats gonna happen. The same is true for the small, menial side-stories that are supposed to bring out more of a certain character, but actually just distract from the main storyline at times, such as the whole thing with Barret and the folks of Corel. The sound effects, although good, are very repetitive. Each character's attack weapon has the same sound, no matter which version of the weapon is being used. The music can also be repetitive and sometimes lacking. Sometimes, yes, it's perfectly fitting to have a section with no music at all or only a low cello voice with a bass drum in the background, but why on Earth did Nobuo Uematsu decide to have no music for the snowboarding segments?!? Also, for some reason they put fairly light-hearted BGM in the section where the team is lost in the snow, a scene that could've taken a lesson from the snow levels in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. Oh well...

  OK, so it's not the best game in the world (I personally think Zelda: OoT is the best), but it is definitely worth the 20 bucks you'll pay for a new copy.",4.0
"I had heard about the FF series but never paid too much attention to it mainly because I didn't have a PS, fast foward to a couple of years and I was trying to get some games for my PS2 library I fell upon FFX let me just say I was blown away and I think the FF bug bit me hard, I bought X-2 and told everyone I got it for my sis. Then talking with other FF Fantics they told me about VII. I haven't finished it yet that is why I gave it a 4 star review but it is awesome so far. Love the scene where Cloud has the Motorcycle. Despite the age of this game it really does stand the test of time and personally I agree with belledandy about doing a remake I'd probably be the first person to buy it too. For people considering buying this game, believe me when I say it is 'worth every penny you spend on it' If you are a fan of RPGs or of games on the whole, it's great, I really don't care if people call it the best game ever or not all I know is that since I have started playing it I can't put it down and my family and friends do feel neglected.",4.0
"To be honest, when I first played FF7, I expected more then what I found.  I enjoyed it, definently, but the plot threw me at a couple segments of the story.  And since I apparently missed certain characters, I missed some of the explanation to the story.  The ending also seemed to fall short of my expectations.

  Eventually, after reading praise for the game from many different places, I decided to give the game another run through.  Wow, things actually seem to make a bit more sense that time.",4.0
"I would like to say that I have played this game, and I loved it. I have fond memories playing it, and am dissapointed in the 1 star reveiw. I noticed that all the 1 star reviews are all submited near or on the same date. Somebody obivously has alot of time on ones's hands and thought that it would be good to ruin this game for others. Give one 1 star review and be done, keep your thoughts to yourself and leave this classic alone.  However I will give that person the graphics, they do suck, but I can deal with that.",4.0
"I'm old enough to remember when RPGs weren't called RPGs. In those days the essence of the game was to move the players about a game board, fighting battles, collecting treasure, and finding clues. Origin's Ultima series was the grandparent of these games - immensely entertaining, but essentially two-dimensional. Among its heirs were the first games in the Final Fantasy line.

This was also a time when computer capabilities and capacity seemed to double every few months. Final Fantasy VII is the result of an inevitable synergy between technology and imagination. Players found themselves in a three-dimensional world where they could wander at will. They were playing with characters that were not only more animated and lifelike, but also had something that resembled personalities. In a very real sense, FFVII changed the gaming landscape, and RPGs reached a new level of credibility.

What is inside is the story of Cloud Strife; an ex-soldier turned mercenary who is drawn into the struggle between Avalanche, a revolutionary group, and Shinra, a rapacious company that is rapidly draining the resources of the planet. Starting out in the city Midgar the battle moves back and forth across the planet, as Cloud gathers team members, accessories and power. Everyone has a history, often mysterious, and an important role to play.

Eventually it becomes clear that the real enemy is a laboratory experiment gone horribly wrong. Shinra's effort to produce supermen has created Sephiroth, who has become one of the legendary villains of the gaming world. Physically beautiful, his mind has been ruined by his knowledge of what he is, and his goal has become the destruction of the world.

The plot is remarkably rich. Within the main story arc are many smaller stories that build the players understanding of the nature of each of the characters. There seem to be an unending number of weapons, powers, and monsters. More than enough material for many replays. The graphics are a bit primitive for our time, but were startling when this game first came out. As your imagination adapts to the imagery, the game becomes truly engaging on many levels. Final Fantasy VII is still one of the best of its genre, Whether you are a student of gaming or an aficionado, it belongs on your shelf.",4.0
"I have just recently finished playing FFVII for the first time.  Before playing it, I read a lot of comments from people claiming that this game is the best ever.  While I do believe it to be good, I can't fully agree.  I enjoyed FFVIII more (despite the fact that that opinion will likely discredit anything else I say in the eyes of all the rampant FF8 haters out there), I must admit.  But vastly, this was a great game.

The graphics weren't wonderful, but what can you expect from the earliest of the 3D Square games?  I had played 8 and 9 before this, so the graphics were admittedly a bit of a letdown, but the story was more than enough to make up for it.  I just found it quite funny how everyone's hands looked like large boxes.  ^_^

The music was good, and the character development was about as good as you can expect in a video game with more than four main characters.  Even in the best of games, some characters are left undeveloped, and it is no difference here.  Cloud, Tifa, and Barret get a good deal of character development, though other main characters are left less known.

There were a great deal of side quests and minigames, which I enjoyed immensely.  Snowboarding was my personal favorite.  :-)  You can spend hours completeing the sidequests alone, and most people end up detouring from the plot for vast amounts of time at the Gold Saucer.

The plot tended to be confusing at times, at least for the first time through.  However, it was intriguing, and Sephrioth is a refreshingly evil bad guy.  The final battle against him was pathetically easy (I killed him twice in a row without dying once at level 60 or so), but up until the point you actually fight him in his final form, he's a truely malevolent villain.

I would recommend this game for any Final Fantasy fan, or any fan of RPGs in general.  It's well worth the money and time.  Just because I said I didn't believe the theory that this is the greatest game ever invented does not in any way mean that I dislike it.  It's and excellent and entertaining game, and by no means should be passed up.",4.0
"There is little to be said about Final Fantasy VII that hasn't been said before.  Many people believe it to be the best Final Fantasy game ever, and some think it to be the best game ever, period.  I, however, do not subscribe to this belief.  It was good, and any fan of the Final Fantasy series should play it.  It is just not worth the hype surrounding it.  The game, for the most part, is a single button game.  You can press one button and make it though most fights easily.  The final boss can be beaten this way if you are at as low of a level as 60.  Without spoiling the story, I will say that only four characters are somewhat developed.  Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, and Barret are the only ones that are developed.  Barret's use of foul language became boring after a while.  It was like the translator didn't understand the Japanese character he saw and just added an obscenity to cover his mistakes up.  It might just be me, but I don't find profanity funny.  If anything, it detracted from the game.  Barret's sentences don't make grammatical sense, and you find yourself skipping over the profanity to just be able to read the sentence.  I wish I was overstating this, but anytime the same obscenity is used more than three times in a sentence, you either are trying to cater to thirteen year olds, or you need better writing.  But I digress...  The story itself was good, but it was too short.  The plot was very dark, and I enjoyed what there was of it.  The graphics were great for their time, but would look better if the game were re-made (if only Square-Enix would concede to all our requests for remakes of both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII).  I would definitely recommend this game, but be cautioned about the language.",4.0
"Just because the entire genre of RPG doesn't appeal to everyone, doesn't mean it sucks as some people believe. It requires some thought which obviously some people are adverse to, but that is by no means a reason to condemn final fantasy or any other game along these lines. I enjoy Halo just fine and have played many a hour on it, but I also enjoy RPGs as well and anyone who believes these games are ""too much like chess"" is obviously using a shortcut to thinking. I play different games when I am in different moods and most people are the same way. Play the game and decide for yourself. If you like RPGs, you owe it to yourself to see the game the changed the genre's approach forever.",4.0
"When I played this it was magic. Journey back to the mid-life of the PlayStation. No, not the PlayStation 2, the original PlayStation. Yes, to the kids who were born just before the release of the PlayStation 2 and are now reviewing FFVII against games on the PS2 and Xbox, there really was a previous version of the PS2. It was a greyish top loading CD based (yes! CD!) system with no USB or iLink (FireWire/1394 for the PC crowd). After the end of Final Fantasy games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Nintendo (yes, there really was a system called SNES that came before the Game Cube and for you old foagies among us, the N64 (Nintendo 64)) Final Fantasy finally got the 3D treatment for the first time. Or at least the characters did. The backgrounds were pre-rendered textures. That is the backgrounds weren't true 3D, they were rendered on a computer in 3D and then a snapshot of them at a certain angle was taken and slapped behind characters who were complete 3D rendered internally by the original PlayStation (remember, the system that came from Sony before the PS2). Only because the PlayStation couldn't render fully 3D extremely detailed environments by itself. Up until FFVII, which, by the way, was not the first Final Fantasy to be developed (there were other 2D (two-dimensional) offerings that only people who are long dead or are old and senile will remember, ask your great, great, great grandfather if he remembers playing Final Fantasy on his Nintin'do Entur-Tain'Mant Sih'stim back in the trenches during WWII), there was a real worry that Squaresoft (as Square-Enix was called back then) really had abandoned Final Fantasy games in favor of simple graphic demos on completely unknown systems like the N64. Not so. Those demos were actually distractions from the truth. That Square-Enix... errr... I mean, Squaresoft was readying its Final Fantasy XII demo called Final Fantasy VII on the equally unknown PlayStation (or as some Amish like to call it, the PSX). But at that time the network feature wasn't fully implemented which made for a lonely playing experience for some already lonely and pathetic super-nerds out there. But for us old timers it was a blast seeing Final Fantasy in 3D finally. However, we didn't get the demo but unfortunately we got the fully playable game. Which was great in and of itself. Because it showed what was possible with the Final Fantasy franchise which wouldn't be fully realized until late 2004 when all gamers finally proclaim in one voice ""What? Another Final Fantasy game? I thought they discontinued it back when Roman caesars ruled the known reality/universe and mammoths roamed computer generated alien landscapes"". Oh well, anything before Doom 3 is going to vanish from the collective memory of computer-gamedom anyway so don't play this because you won't be able to. It's just too alien an experience for today's DDR generation (oh, for those fetuses unfamiliar with DDR it's ""Dance Dance Revolution"" and it's what today's elderly play when their hips aren't healing fast enough).
BTW, stop being putzes and review the game fairly and in its own context of time. It looks really dumb when someone starts comparing it to something so far advanced it's not even fair. Perspective, my children. Get some.",4.0
"Final Fantasy 7 is possibly the best game ever made. But there are a few things to take into consideration the grafics aren't the best seing as it was made in 1990 or1997 (I really don't know) but this is one of the best games I've ever played and I've been playing games since I was two!! You start as Cloud an ex-member of a group called Soldier and has joined the terrorist group called Avalanch. As the story goes on you find out that there is a lot more to fight against than a power hungry company called Shinra who is sucking the life energy of the planet and end up fighting a much bigger threat to the planet. The characters are extremely cool and everyone can relate to at least one. The cinemas are put together beutifully to give the impression of a much more modern game. When out of battle all the characters assume a polygon type form but while in battle they look soooo much mor impressive. The music constantly changes and adds a certain mood to the story.
If you manage to get past its few bad qualities wich only mediocre gamers would hold against it you will be addicted to this game and unable to put it down.
It's worth every penny.",4.0
"I've read a lot of the reviews on here... and although everyone has their own opinion, the bottom line is that when this game was released in 1997 it did change the gaming world. Few can argue the hype it received and the sales it got, but did it deserve it? Does it stand the test of time.
Yes and No. The graphics do look like a bunch of lego-popeye's walking around, but it still was an incredible leap over what was available at the time. In ten years we will be saying the same thing about most of the PS2 games we own... or fighting with all the young gamers who don't remember the classics.
Personally I put FFVII at the top of my favorite games of all time, but that's because it holds a lot of great memories of staying up late and enjoying an intriguing story and some wonderful music. Even so, FFVII is starting to show it's age, and everyone seems to either love it, or hate it. I'll let them have their opinion's, but please give a better reason then: ""This game SUX!! It's THE WORST GAME EVER""... or ""GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!!""
Just makes you wonder how old these reviewers are...",4.0
"I was hesitant to get this game at first and still have some reservations because of it's flaws, but I honestly believe that this is a good, solid game that could have been one of the best if it weren't for those glaring flaws.
Stregths:
Storyline, Characterization(especially when they interact), the depth of the world(LOVED reading through the libraries), some of the spells/FMVs, music and dialogue that rivals Lunar. In fact, IMO, the dialogue is considerably better than most Final Fantasies and even the Suikodens!
Weaknesses:
Graphics(but not a big deal to people not too concerned with that, like me), certain elements of the story could have been expanded, could have had better characterization and the battles were awkward and took a lot of getting used to as you didn't have time to do much of anything.
So, the game is good, just good. It could have been much better, but it does NOT deserve the bad reputation it has.",4.0
"I agree with Yojimbo. What are you guys blabbing on about?
The only thing you guys (the 1/5ers) have to say about this game is that 'omg teh grafix r teh sux!111' But, really, who cares? As far as I'm concerned, graphics are there to push or motorize the game and keep it from being all text. Think about it, although FFVII may not be the most 'visually pleasing' game out there, it's not the graphics hinder the story or the gameplay or the music any. I'll ask you guys, what do you think makes us like it? Maybe you should play it, and instead of invoking that 'I'm going to hate it' mindframe, try to enjoy it. Few other games could inspire hundreds of thousands of fansites and hundreds (thousands?) of fanshrines. There are times when FFVII wants to be graphically enhanced (FMVs) and those are executed and designed quite spectacularly. It's the second Final Fantasy to get a sequel (Final Fantasy VII: Advant Children, a movie) and for a reason. As for the music, some of my favorite songs come from Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, and Final Fantasy IX. Nobuo Uematsu is, simply put, a god. I know this isn't going to change any minds, but I felt like adding my $0.02.",4.0

"I find it funny that all of the reviewers either gave this game 5 stars or 1. Seriously...and most of them go about without telling why they think so rather just..""This game sucks!"" or ""The graphics suck"" or ""this game is the best!"" Without any real reasoning behind it. I find it childish and immature and I've come to respect those only to give a thorough opinion on the game, whether positive or negative.
 I, myself, must say that when I first played this game in 1997, it had been the best RPG that I've ever come across, in fact, the best game. The story intrigued me, and I grew attached to the characters. It was the first Final Fantasy on the Playstation, and it was truly innovating. RPGs were brought into a 3D world with an epic story sprawled across multiple discs. At the time, the graphics were gorgeous. Then, came FFVIII, IX, and then Anthology. I had high expectations for VIII after VII, and I must say that VIII still holds its place as my favorite RPG today. IX, however, fell below VIII, but still above VII. I figured that it was because they were made after VII, and I still loved that game to death. When Anthology came out, however, VI changed my views entirely. It was made BEFORE VII and I found it as a superior game.
 I guess you have to think of it this way...VII was a great game when it came out. It was a new idea and was the first Final Fantasy on the psx. Many people ,like me, didn't even hear of Final Fantasy until VII and it set an incredibly high standard for the later installments. In my opinion, they surpassed the standard, except for X. I liked VII better than X. I played this game again recently after finishing VIII for the 20th or so time, and I must say, although I didn't like it as much as I did before, I had come to respect it more than any other game because it set the standard for RPGs.",4.0
"Quite possibly one of the best RPG out there for the time. It's great if you can play throught the pain at the beginning, as It becomes much better as you go on. The game does lack a little in design of the characters, but it was excellent for the time. A pure classic. Two Thumbs up. Final Fantasy 7 launches probably what is the greatest enemy in all of the RPG even in the Video game world. Seperioth. The game has many challanges, and not to mention trying to Get the GOLD CHOOCOBO. Huh, Good luck, and if you like RPGs, your bound to love it. Five Stars, Pure classic.",4.0
"My favorite character is Sephiroth. He also makes an appearance in ""kingdom Hearts"" as the toughest boss in the game.(but i beat him!)
Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mind-blowing game.
Cloud is the main character of this game. He also makes an appearance in ""Kingdom Hearts"" as 3 or 4 bosses,he's easy.
The thing is,I couldn't even get past the mechanical scorpion!
The game is just way too hard for me. But I beat it.
The Sephiroth's are also Hard.
If you're in for some action,buy this.
Cloud is just such an amzig character,and so is Sephiroth.

I thought this game was excellent. It's the first FF game I've ever owned or played and I've absolutely fallen in love with it.

"I love this game. The first of the Final Fantasy series I ever played. No doubt, over time, better games have come out since this, but this is STILL a GREAT game. You grow to love (and hate!) characters. You get INVOLVED with the storyline. The music is fitting, and fantastic. Giving players the ability to summon characters such as Ifrit, Odin & Bahamut, this game is TRULY going to take your breath away.

Many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the mini-battle game available in the Golden Saucer, also why didn't they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript?  This was probably to save money so Square wouldnt have to hire voice actors. Although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written story.",4.0

One thing was it is confusing and I cant say its for everyone, i say this because if you don't like FF and you haven't tried FF before don't start here. The game is fun,but not good graphics, and its confusing. Yu may not like this game,I warn you.",4.0
"I'm just now pushing my way through the first disc. Of all the years this has been out, I played it once for about 10 minutes. I thought, ""Wow, this game doesn't strike me as great."" I always hated it. The original six Final Fantasy games were enough for me; I'll leave the others untouched. I decided that I needed to justify my opinion. I bought the game with the lowest of expectations, and I was just blown away.
The instant I started playing this game, I knew I was going to enjoy it. The biggest part of a RPG is the battles. This game stays true to the Final Fantasy 3/6 way of doing battles, and I enjoy it immesely. The new addition is the limit break attacks, which don't make much sense to me, but I love them, too.
The graphics aren't great. But I don't look to this game for phenominal graphics. The FMV's (full motion video, or CGI) are straight beautiful. Some of them are amazing considering when this game came out. They leave me staring at the TV thinking, ""1997?!"" Other than that, they aren't stunning, and leave you sometimes confused as to what you can walk on and what you can't, but I really don't look at a game for the graphics if it's an RPG. First is gameplay, second is music, third is story, last is graphics. Oldschool. :-)
Regarding music, I'm not impressed. This is one section of the game where I thought it fell short. None of the music really leaves me ""THERE"" in the game, where I feel like it fits in perfectly. Good, yes, but it isn't at the level I felt 2/4 and 3/6 were. The sound is okay - nothing amazing.
Story is interesting. To point I think I still enjoy the complexity of the Final Fantasy 3/6 story, only because that one is so well explained. This one is more of a movie style, where there is constantly holes in the story being filled. When the holes are filled, there's more holes to be filled. And I've come to realize that some holes are just going to stay there, without any answers. The story is a little spotty when it comes to that, but up until now I've really enjoyed playing through the game, and I can't wait to continue.
All in all, I came in expecting nothing, and I got a lot. Definately impressive. I suggest you pick this one up, if you're a fan of the NES and SNES FF games, but you aren't really sure.",4.0
"The story and plot are interesting enough to keep a gamer entertained.  Gameplay is entertaining, but also challenging.
I cannot give the game five stars though.  I had already played the likes of FFX and Xenosaga prior to playing this game.

In other words, I would have enjoyed FF7 if I had experienced the game prior to playing more recent RPGs.",4.0

the only real flaw in the game is the character graphics which are realitively poor in the real world but in the battle scenes the characters take on a personality of their own as they launch some immensly impressive attacks.(you've got to love vincents transformations!)
as with all RPG's the game can get a bit static and repetitive as you get stuck on your first adventure.
I myself have completed the game 21 times(I have ridiculous amounts of spare time!) and the story is the best one in the entire series(I have played 1-10)",4.0
"Final Fantasy 7, is one of those games that deals with a variety of aspects, instead of just focusing on one. It may seem to have just your simple everyday theme, of an average game. Once you get to actually playing the game, and beating it, you will understand what the whole concept of this game is about. It is more than just a battle of good and evil... it deals with what certain characters are going through at a time of crisis...
Story
  The story in FF7 was very well done; fit very nicely with the characters and surroundings. At first playing FF7, I didn't really think much of the story... until they started to developing the characters, and other minor aspects in to place. Once the game progressed, I could tell that I was starting to become entwined with this game; not only physically, but emotionally as well. One thing on the story I feel that they could have portrayed better, would have been how it all started... they never really went into much depth of how it all started.
10/10
Appearance
  At first glance at FF7, it doesn't really look like much. Basically looks like your ""average"" game, where you fight the bad guy, save the girl, and so on. The appearance of the game, also relies on the story. You have to understand what is going on, to get the whole meaning out of a certain scene. FF7, is one of those games that illustrates this property very well. At the time of the games release, which you can see here, it had some of the best graphics for any PSX game.
9/10
Characters
  The characters of FF7 were portrayed beautifully. Another reason why FF7 had a unique character design, is because the characters had been introduced with some background information; instead of the traditional way, were they just introduce a character and that's that. The way that characters developed, in the game, also had its strong points to back up many of the games likings. The way that I first saw the game, character wise, was that each really didn't care about each other. Once the story, and overall plot thickened, the characters attitudes towards each other became more appealing.
9/10
Music
  The music in the game was also another high end of the game. In my opinion, the music of the game, is what gave it that certain vibe, to make it a higher end game. I can't really say much about the music, though it was excellent. Overall Nobuo Uematsu did a very good at composing and producing the music of FF7.
9/10
Overall
  Final Fantasy 7, what more can I say... This is one excellent RPG that I would recommend to anyone who is remotely interested in gaming. The overall atmosphere that Final Fantasy 7 brings with it, is incredible. The overall mixture of what it represents, varies from person to person. Some people call this ""The greatest game of all time."" and I fully agree with this statement... Gaming just doesn't get any better than this.

It's still a good game, the second best one from the three released for PS (IX is the best of the PlayStation era).  The dark realism pioneered by this game made for a good story, and was much more well done than Final Fantasy VIII.  The addition of FMV for the first time was also a nice new element.  However, the gameplay and story still fall short of Final Fantasy VI and IX.  Worth a play, especially since the price is good now.",4.0
"Being a diehard Final Fantasy fan, I just had to get this game.  While I enjoyed it for the most part, I was disappointed by the ""feel"" of the game for lack of a better term.  It was not fantasy, it was more science fiction, and I really could have done without the awkward-looking polygon characters.  But the music is fantastic, the storyline is moderately interesting, and I think it just depends on what kind of gamer you are as to how much you like it.  Most newer gamers really love it, so if you are hesitant rent before you buy.  (They finally listened to us old-school gamers and did us right with Final Fantasy IX, though!  Marvelous!!)",4.0
"While being an excellent RPG, it is not up to the caliber of the originals, especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game, namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff, ie. master materia, just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets, but only really worth playing once.",4.0
Great game this game hs great graphics and is very adicticing and fun this is 4 stars not 5 stars because this game is hard to play but you need the guide or else it is inpossible. oerall it is a gratgame,4.0
"Get this game only if you know you have at least 90+ hours available to spend on this game. That is at approx: 7 hours a day non-stop for 2 weeks.  You can do it less but that also means you are not doing all the adventures within the game.  Which is NOT GOOD.  Believe me...once you start you can't stop.  I gave this game a 4 instead of 5, because I couldn't stop thinking about this game while I was at school.  Playing this game also doesn't help your personal life because you will be too busy playing this game instead of hanging with your girlfriend at the mall of something. Fact: Girls doesn't like watching their boyfriend play video games.  Enough about my personal life.
If you get this game be sure to also get your very own strategy guide. Without it you will be lost and will be able to get all the goodies and important hidden stuff within the game.  Even with the guide...it is still awefully hard to breed the chocobo birds that you want or beat the toughest monsters near the end.
Good luck.",4.0
"This game is a great game...though not as great as it's decendant (FF8).This game offers great graphics the best ever next to 8. I have yet to play (ff9).85 %-90% you will play the part of cloud strife,an ex-SOLDIER.Soldier is an elite group of men and Women taught to fight very well. However cloud is removed from training because he doesn't fit the parameters of a soldier. If you intend on buying it you should also get the memory card and the Offical guide to go along. Both will help in that the memory card will save your current location ..without it you cannot save and your work would have been for nothing. The Offical guide will help you to navigate through this fast paced game. It can get confusing at times so be careful. The battle system is somewhat tricky at first but you get used to it. This game has an excellent story line as does mostly everything that squaresoft produces. The numerous enemies and bosses that you pummel into the ground will earn you experience points and gil. Gil is the money system they have .Only way to get gil is to battle.only way to find materia is to buy it or find it. Money is a key asset. Many times you will have to buy life potions and weapons. You can find one in any stage you go to if you look hard enough. The game itself is not bad but it lacks light.which is what Final Fantasy 8 turns out to be. This game is long and full of excitement. Though long it is an excellent game .The characters that they designed are extremmely cool whether it be the gentle but strong Aeris or the stubborn yet cool Tifa. Both female characters are interesting as a love triangle forms between cloud and these two ladies. The music is the best ever better that 8,I would say. The victory song from after you've beaten an enemy into oblivion is by far the best in the game. While it only lasts a minate it will stick in your mind. In several parts in the game cloud our main character must save either Tifa or Aeris. There are also event games where they snow board or ride bikes. And last a word or advice,while battling keep in  mind you and your companions health levels. Build up experience and money. GOOD LUCK ON YOUR JOURNEY NEW PLAYERS!",4.0
game came in the mail very quickly which was a plus. The game works great and is in very good condition,4.0

"This is a classic that took fighting games to a new level. Although i am a Mortal Kombat fan, i admit that this game is actually cool to a certain point. The second one is alot better and the third one is pretty sweet. However, you must remember the humble beginings of Super hero/ Street fighter games. I like it.",4.0
"There is doubt about it, this was the game that showed the dreamcast could be a major competitor.  Being a big fan of the arcade version, I must say(for the billionth time), that this one surapasses the arcade version.  This is a very strategic fighting game,  And it is extremely deep gameplay.  Although my only compaint is that a button masher can beat the computer.  That is my compliant about all 3-d fighting game(as opposed to earlier, Street Fighter2, And Street fighter alpa, series games.), is that button mashing can get you over.  Although, in 3-d fighting games(like Tekken and, of course Soul Calibur), you cant pull off impressive,beautiful,combos with just button mashing.  For the most part, this game has alot of relay value, lots of of unlockable characters. The mssion mode, which adds even more to replay value, and the cool museum mode.  In my opinion, Time attack mode, is useless.  The survival mode, while great, is just too easy.  Another problem, the final Boss, Inferno.  He is pretty easy as well. But this is common in 3-d fighters.  But all in all this is a solid fighting game. It is just a bit too easy.  Even ultra hard mode, can be easily won by a competent Soul Calibur player.(although button mashers can win the first two stages).  This game is a must-have for Dreamcast owners.",4.0
"This game was good but not great. It was the very first MVC game and started the ball rolling. I had this game for the Dreamcast and played it the arcade for awhile. I thought it was pretty cool but just like XMen vs SF or Marvel vs SF., but the difference was that people could call out special assists characters. I give credit though for starting the idea of having 3 on 3 matches in MVC2.",4.0
"Boy after being used to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 for so long (I have the Dreamcast copy as well), it was funny to see how inferior this one is. It's still a lot of fun (My best team is Strider and War Machine, with Ryu and Venom a close 2nd), and I like to fight Onslaught a lot more than the last boss in part 2.",4.0
"There are secret ways to unlock alternate versions of some of the characters, and even unlock Onslaught. You'll have to beat the game using certain techniques. In order to beat the game very easily, I personally found it best to use Ryu and Venom on Easy mode. Use them to beat the game multiple times and you'll be able to unlock all of the secret characters.

PROS:
1) The vibration feedback is extremely sensitive !!! You feel every bump and hit that you give your opponent.
2) There is an Easy mode, which strangely is not in MvC part 2. The Easy mode allows you to use Chun Li's lighting fast kicks.
3) There are a few super moves that are not in MvC part 2. Like Chun Li's has four supers in this game, while she has only three in part 2.

CONS:
1) There is a little slow-down with a few characters like War Machine and Strider. These characters move a lot faster in MvC part 2.
2) You can not select the same person twice. In MvC part 2, you are allowed to select the same person so you may have a team of three Akumas or whomever else.

Overall, it's a great game, and I urge you to buy it even if you already own MvC part 2. I own both games and love them equally.",4.0
"Until the Dreamcast came along no other system could handle the 2-D graphic processing power of a lot of 2-D games without a lot of loading.  Marvel VS Capcom is better on the Dreamcast than it was in the arcades, the control is easy, the graphics are sharp and crisp and bright, and the action is fast, so fast you might lose track of what your doing.  Though it was overshadowed by it's superior sequel, Marvel VS Capcom is a must own Dreamcast title on its own.  Also recommended is Marvel VS Capcom 2, Power Stone 1&2, Capcom VS SNK, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Dead or Alive 2, and Soul Calibur.",4.0
"Marvel Vs. Capcom is an excellent game. I bought it last year. There are many great things about it. First, you can use classic street fighter and Marvel characters(who really cares about captain commando anyway?). The graphics are excellent. While they are not 3d, they are animated with anime style drawing. The frame rate generally runs smoothly and the super combos are awesome to watch, including Shin Ryu's Raging Demon super combo. 3d games are terrible anyway since it's usually all about hitting buns quickly then running away. Anyways buy this game, its well worth it.",4.0
"On the plus side:  1) OUTSTANDING graphics and animation.  2) Excellent sound effects.  3) Beautifully fluid and very addictive gameplay.  4) Easy to pick up and play the first time, but difficult to master, especially at the harder levels.
On the minus side:  1) Repetitave, commentary by the narrator and characters, to the point of being annoying.  2) Inability to silence same while retaining music and sound effects.
Other than the commentary, the game is as close to perfect as something manmade can be.  Fix that, and I'd have given it 5 stars (should be about 4.75 stars, but Amazon.com won't let us rate it that way).  I've noticed people who don't even like video games, getting a real kick out of playing this one.
It is a great way to get out your frustrations.
If you are not willing to pay the [cash] for this game, you probably shouldn't own the Sega Dreamcast.  It's a bargain, and is the best fighting game I have ever seen/played in my 20 years of playing video games.",4.0
"hydro thunder is a speed boat racing game that has 13 courses all of which vary greatly from each other in design and locations. tropical islands to chinese water ways. the controls feel like they should, as you slide across water. there are also at least (probably more) 9 different craft to choose from each with distinctive handling which can be necessary on harder tracks. about that, this game is crazy hard to finish everything. you need to play decently and some how hit nearly EVERY boost power up in each course. the AI seems to pace things out so you're always just barely where you want to be. finishing in first is a rare thing and takes real skill, but at least you'll have a lot of fun getting that skilled.",4.0

"Capcom continues to make great fighting games, but this time out with Power Stone they create something special.  Power Stone was one of the first Dreamcast games out for the Dreamcast and helped make the system worth buying.  You can go anywhere, grab anything, and then beat the hell out of your opponent.  Its a great game, the only problem is that there is so much going on during the game you can lose your concentration at times, but thats the only flaw.  Otherwise, its a great game.",4.0
"Powerstone is a very exciting fighting game.  I enjoyed it very much.  It gave a strong challenge with an interesting story to boot.  However, after the many weeks it will take you to beat it, you sigh, ""Finally!"", and you pretty much will lose it in the stack of games you have after that.
With that aside, if you like fighting games, and you are sick of Soul Caliber, this game is for you.  Enjoy it while you can.",4.0
"This is one of the best fighting games that i have ever played (other than killer instinct), and i have to congratulate sega on it.  The graphics are amazing there  are plenty of characters to choose from, the levels are all varied and the two player mode has kept my friends and I busy for months.",4.0
"Ok as its my habit to say the BAD things first, i'll do it.
Well the gameplay is a little slow and like the moves are sometimes hard to perform. but i got the trick on how to do these moves easily (u will know it too after u play the game for some days), so i am being able to perform the most comlicated moves pretty darn easily, so i don't need to complain! but the gameplay in the SD series is very good.
the career mode is OK but u don't actually see the belt ie u winning the belt somewhere, and u cant fight for belts in exhibition mode but u can do that in SD2.
another glitch is the movelist. i cant see why rock does not have the sharpshooter as it is one of the only submissions he does best. and many more movelist problems are there but there's no prob with that.
Ok now for the Good part.
The game's really exciting and can keep u entertained for hours. unlike SD2, the moves are not so easy to perform and u get really excited when u make a finishing move (coz in SD2 i perform my finishing move atleast 20 times hehe) the character list is very good and thanx for putting in Owen Hart i love him and also rare people like kurrgan and goldust, and Dr. Death and EVEN Sgt. Slaughter is there *u gotta unlock him tho*
there are alternate costumes too ie we can have a stonecold or ANYONE with 4 different types of costumes in the game. its very cool. another thing i liked in the game is the different types of matches, there are lumberjack matches, stable matches, and EVEM grudge matches. awesome.
Overall : Well its a very good game and a must buy for anyone who atleast KNOWS what the WWF  is. and those who don't know what the WWF is, this would be a good choice for u to start off!!
This Game Rules, And Thats The Bottom Line, Coz STONE COLD Said SO",4.0
"I personally own this game and can testify to how good it is. WWF attitude has eccellent character selection, and create a player mode....for its time. Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon 2 with its quick executing of moves, unlike Attitude, and its enormous backstage area, unlike attitude. But on the good side it has some things other games don't, tag team Gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock. Great game, i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace games.",4.0
"One of my favorites. The graphics are very good. Some of the move though are hard to do and there are not a lot of good moves from the tie-up like  in Warzone. I still play this game a lot. The Create-A-PPV mode is very  cool and you can make your own rings before every match. The gamemodes are  endless. Sometimes I can't even think of what to do. The entrances are the  biggest improvement and my favorite aspect of the game. They're as good as  it gets. A successful end to a great line of WWF games. Thanks for the  ride, Acclaim.",4.0
Attitude was like warzone but more match types and a much bigger roster and his a fun game.,4.0
"WWF Attitude was a good solid Sony game with lots of fun things to do in it. There was blood,create a PPV mode,lots of match types,good career mode and lots of other great things. I will now sum up some of the basic pros and cons.

Pros-

1)Great roster including such wrestlers as Undertaker,Rock,Mankind,Kane,Stone Cold,D-X,Shawn Michaels and many more.

2)Blood.

3)Many match types such as Hardcore,I Quit,Last Man Standing,First Blood,Stable Match,Survivor Series,Gauntlet & Tag Gauntlet and many more.

4)Nice Career mode with three different belts you have to win before you can become the ultimate champion.

5)Nice long lasting and always worth a laugh on.

6)Lots of good moves to do at anytime in lots of positions.

7)Very advanced.

Cons-

1)Moves are hard to execute.

2)Create A Wrestler doesn't have very much you can do.

3)Never being able to follow this game up with a sequel of such.

4)The ability to have the same wrestler all the time versing each other.

5)Not the greatest graphics especially with the blood on the wrestler.

This game is really good and its very nolstalgic. Its definetly worth the money and if you can get it really cheap thats even better. This is one of the greatest most brutal games ever mode for wrestling in my opinion.",4.0

"Allright, I admit It When it comes to Gameplay This Game [loses] But When It Comes To Creating Wrestlers This Game Is Revolutionary. The Create-A-Wrestler Feature On This Game Is So Detailed That You Don't Just Pick The Face, You Pick The Eyes The Nose and The Mouth. You Also Can Put Lettering On Your Clothing, And Have A Wide Variety Of Masks, Face-Paint, And Apparel. With This Game You Could Create The L.O.D., And Even The Insane Clown Posse! The Create-A-Wrestler Mode Is So Detailed This Game Is Worth Playing Just For That. I Only Wish That Modern Wrestling Games With C.A.W. Mode Would Take a Page From This Game.",4.0
"Absolutely great game and it came in near perfect condition. Now some of you may be wondering why I took one star off and that is simply due to the product coming in a day late on one day shipping. As far as the game goes I'd highly recommend this game to survival horror fans and Resident Evil fans alike. Code Veronica and Code Veronica X are great changeling games within the series, and despite it lacking features that were present in Resident Evil 3 it still manages to be just as good if not better than 3, which is one of my personal favorites in the series.",4.0

"Resident Evil: Code Veronica.

This was originally released on the Dreamcast and originally intended to be the third of the Resident Evil series. However, that went to what we now know as the excellent Nemesis game for playstation.

This game was the first to be set in full 3D with no pre-rendered backgrounds. This game has held up very well and the graphics are more polished on the PS2 and gamecube versions.

It follows the story of Claire Redfield after the events of Resident Evil 2 and also reintroduces us to one of the heroes from the original game, Chris Redfield. It features new enemies, weapons and entirely new locations.

Something about the location didn't set right with me. Oh, I know...it's not Raccoon City. Well, I guess they couldn't help that after Nemesis, but still.

I say this is where Resident Evil started to go down hill. That doesn't mean this is a bad game, but this doesn't feel as fresh as the others before it, who still play great in 2009. I'd recommend this as it is better than Resident Evil Zero, 4 and much better than 5.",4.0
"[Baio Hazard] series have the most popularity in Japan. Especially Code Veronica is one of the most favorite thing. Because it game is  very real gurafic game used the spec of Dream Cast ability very well. Even if it is now time that there are more great spec hard, PS2, XBOX etc, you can play the came with the joy and the satisfication.
Vaio series is ,if I say to that simply, a active horror and action game. The main character of the game collect many weapons and curing items etc , you defeat the monsters that get to be stronger and storonger as story advance. The weapon is real too. For instance, the sound of the bullets, gravity feeling when the character have his gums at the ready...
When you use your bullets, there is fun that you consider the remaining bullets. And the sound is the horror sound. The monster are horror too.
Thank you for reading poor writing.",4.0

She is the master of all the ashfords which are a family of very wealthy people. Youll meet Alexia and Alfred. They are deadly so becareful. The graphics are the best part. Youll see a world of reality when you first see the first fmv. The Plot is good but not the best. And the handgun you get as your first weapon, lol sux.

"This game is great. I enjoy playing it, but it is definitely for mature players. I do NOT suggest this game for anyone under 16 at youngest!

"NBA Showtime was the newest incarnation of the very popular and ongoing NBA JAM series except now it went a little more high scale because it takes the NBA on NBC jingles, videos and of course the stills and visuals of the NBA on NBC TV programming.
Like all NBA JAMs, totally outrageous basketball from start to finish. You can expect anything and everything in this one from more out of this world dunks to being ""On Fire"" shooting and of course the newly added alley oops and free throws. Yes that's right, no more shoving your opponents all over the place because now they get 2 foul shots, each worth 3 points a piece (and even Shaq can hit these free throws!)
You can even create your own character and build that character to be the best as you take on the entire NBA in 2 on 2 mayhem. You also get to answer NBA trivia (just like on TV during games). Pretty cool.
I'd get this one because I personally think that this is NBA JAM at it's best. Very fun and also very cool to play with friends. Especially if you and a friend are good enough to pull off the triple alley oop pass for Team Fire. Again, check it out!",4.0
This is a really great game that is non-stop fun. The graphics are really cool. You can also do cool dunks and moves that make the game fun. If you want a game that is like the NBA this isn't the game for you.  The only thing I don't like about it is that their isn't a season mode so playing by yourself isn't as fun as playing with your friends.  I really enjoy this game and I recomend you get it.,4.0

"Okay so Resident Evil 2 for the n64 is good graphics during game play are better then the play station.

  As long as you have the Red Expansion pack it will make the graphics good Its a good classic game but not like resident evil 4 example: The zombies take forever to kill and you cant just shoot there head off and be done with them.

Also The controls for the n64 might be a little weird but it just takes some time getting used too.

I have not played the game in A LONG TIME but what from I remember and from Youtube It is a good game.

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes resident evil just a warning though it A LOT DIFFERENT then the newer ones but its still a good game you cant go wrong with buying Resident evil 2 for any console :)",4.0

"To be frank, this is what got me hooked on Pac-Man.  After I tried the original Mrs. Pac-Man, I wondered about the other version.  I'd heard good things about it, and that it was a very good game, but I wasn't so sure.  Then I tried my cousin's Game Boy version of it and I loved it too.  Pretty soon, I had forgot in favor of my now favorite video game series, Crash Bandicoot.  Then, we went game shopping in Toys R Us, and I saw it.  The 1st thing that popped into my mind was, ""That's a Cool Looking Pac-Man.""  Since mny dad had said no more Crash games for a bit, I asked him for this.  I loved Pac-Man World's graphics, game play, controls, worlds, and the challenge.  I was hooked.

The storyline is quite simple.  It's Pac-Man's 20th anniversary, and the Pac family is gearing up for it. They're preparing a big party, but suddenly, guess who shows up and kidnaps them?  That's right the Ghosts.  Their new boss, Toc-Man wants to replace the ""Pac"" in all the titles of Pac-Man's games with ""Toc"", thereby making himself the star of the series.  So, Pac-Man must rescue his family.

"This game was a lot of fun! The graphics were cool, the controls were tight, the camera didn't misbehave much and it was an overall joy to play. My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars, is that it was just too short. With only 15 levels and 6 bosses I beat the whole game in one weekend,(10-12 hours) so I'm not sure it's worth recommending a purchase. However if you're a huge Pac fan, or you're a little less experienced with these platformer type games then I think you'll find a highly enjoyable game for a reasonable price.

"The N64 port of the original NFL Blitz was such insane football game. I recall renting it several times back in Blitz's heyday. The players are so aggressive, and you literally beat the other team to death all the way through.

NFL Blitz 2000 appears to be pretty much the same game with better graphics, a play editor, a 4-person multiplayer, and a roster update. Like the original, you have a series of passing plays that you use to gain 30 yards in 4 plays. Also like the original, all conventional rules regarding football have been thrown out the window. It's a pretty wild ride.

Right now, in 2012, if you're collecting N64 games for nostalgia's sake or for whatever , I'd say one of the console's Blitz games is a good and necessary investment. They're definitely ""core"" N64 games.. whatever that means. However, it's not the kind of football game you can really sit down and enjoy too too much by yourself. It's a lot of fun to just knock the daylights out of your friends in Blitz. But alas, the AI just can't provide the kind of reaction that makes it entertaining.",4.0

"There are usually too many football video games that try to bring more special graphics displays, then the actual enjoyment of humor and feel of a actual enjoyable sports video game in the entire field of video games. The only acception, NFL Blitz, is a perfect exception to the rule, blending in some zany humor, and some incredible things you'd never expect to see in any real football game.
NFL Blitz 2000, the successful sequel to NFL Blitz, contains all of the componens of each team in the AFC and NFC. Also added to the mix are incredible zany stadiums that consist of playing football on a rooftop in the middle of a city, to the classic style of an traditional stadium. Also included are humorous codes that can change the game into a war zone. Codes like No Interceptions, changing the football into the size of an giant balloon, and even super field goals, can change the face of football time and time again. It is just too bad that can't happen in the real game, it would finally make sports fun.
While many people are now into the games for Nintendo's Gamecube, for those who still own the Nintendo 64, really need to own this sports game. It is just a first down to the ultimate gaming library. Only, if you still own the Nintendo 64 and didn't trade it in for a CD-ROM gaming system that takes longer to upload the game. NFL Blitz 2000 is that one kind of fantasy sports game, that continues to bring in the touchdowns easily.",4.0
"Dino Crisis is a great game -- lots of excitement, suspense, and action.  It doesn't fail there.  I beat it in four days (seven hours playing time), though, so definitely rent it first.
Some of the voice acting is weak,  but it's not the worst out there.  The story will keep you interested, as  will the battles with the enemy dinosaurs.  An added plus is the decisions  you must make at key points in the story, but even this (and the different  costumes) isn't enough to give the game the replay value it needs to make  it a 5-star game.",4.0
"Good service, great game, as expected",4.0
"If you loved Resident Evil 1 and 2 you will love Dino Crisis. Bult with the same operating engine as the RE games this classic sci-fi horror survival adventure keeps you excited while dodging raptors and scrounging for ammo.
Be careful not to bleed out!... Seriously though, not just a joke but an extremely annoying game mechanic.",4.0

"Dino Crisis is brought to us by Capcom, makers of many great games such as the also fantastic survival horror series: Resident Evil. The game is far from a clone of that game though, nor is it like Jurassic Park...well...ok it's ""kind of"" like Jurassic Park.

Basically you and a team of guys are sent in to this facility to find and question this Dr. Kirk Guy (Paging Dr. Spock. Dr. Spock, to the front desk, please) who infiltrated the facility some time ago posing as a scientist, but faked his death and is now involved in a top secret, non-weapon project, and it's your job to locate him....or something. You get there and find that the power is down and discover the dismembered body of some guy and before you know it a teammate goes missing, and you're running around frantically trying to get away from velociraptors who want to EAT YOU. Unlike in RE however, you're starting pistol is COMPLETELY USELESS and unreliable. It's incredibly slow to fire and barely inflicts any damage to dinosaurs, so your first real goal is to locate a decent weapon and some ammo...which is easier said than done.

Dinosaurs more often then not will come in either pairs or packs of several, and all you can do is either run, or stun them if you have stun darts, which will put them to sleep temporarilly.

The Dino's AI is REALLY smart and can and will corner you if you're not careful. They're tough as nails too, so you'd better be on your guard at all times. Two cool features that this game has that the Resident Evil Games don't are: 1. Your weapon can be knocked out of your hand by a dinosaur if you point it at them for too long and fail to fire it, forcing you to run over to it, pick it up, and reequip both it and its ammo; and 2. you can actually lose blood constantly if a dinosaur inflicts a big enough wound on you. You actually see the blood drip down on the ground as you walk. These two things add extra layers of challenge and difficulty to the game, so if you're out of the item that stops bleeding, you'll have to walk slowly to keep from losing too much blood.

Like resident evil, the medical items in the game can be mixed for added effect, and some items don't work by themselves, so you'll need to add something to them in order to make the healing agent work. Also like Resident Evil are the medical storage boxes, which you need a ""plug"" to access. They can only store medical items though, so that's a bit of a downside.

Another big downside are the save rooms, in Resident Evil you pick up ink ribbons and save your game using a typewriter (which was clever enough), so I expected this game to utilize PCs for saving but...it doesn't. Saving is a complicated affair in this game, as is trying to open any electronically locked door. In order to save, you have to exit the save room, where-in the games asks you if you want to save. You save and then exit the door. Kind of weird, but it works.

Then there are the electronically locked doors, which are a serious PAIN IN THE NECK to get open. In order to open them, you need 2 items: a code disc and a key disc, but both items have to match the letter on the lock, such as ""H"". Then once you DO get both items, you then need to unscramble the code word and input it into the electronic lock before the door will open. How do you DO this, you eliminate the letters on the ""code"" disc from the ""key"" on the key disc, which spells out the passcode. After you unscramble the passcode, you can open the door. Confusing? Well it is.

The backgrounds in the game are FULL 3D, instead of pre-rendered, but it does effectively use changing camera angles to its advantage though.

Another cool feature absent from resident evil games is the ability to set traps and barricades for the dinosaurs. You can lock them on one side of a room that has a laser lock by pushing the button on the control panel, and in some areas can use environmental objects to your advantage to stun the dinosaurs, such as electricity or smoke. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, as well as keeping it somewhere between ""difficult"" and ""extremely difficult"" as you progress in the game.

Just like RE, you'll be doing lots of backtracking, key hunting, and occasionally boss-fighting and interacting with survivors as you progress through the game.

The writing and acting are FAR better than any RE game I've played, so major bonus points for having dialogue and line delivery that I can actually stand to listen to without getting annoyed or laughing my ass off and not being able to take the game seriously.

One other thing I'm not a fan of is the inventory. I HATE the layout and confusing to navigate item screen in this game. Having RE's item screen would have helped this game a lot I think. You use ""O"" of all buttons to bring up the menu/inventory screen and ""X"" and the Dpad to select and use items. ""O"" and ""Triangle"" then go back to the main game.

Some of the mini-games are just downright annoying. One of them involves you spending an insanely long amount of time playing a 3D version of pipe dream. It's puzzles like this in games that I can't stand and this game has several of those. That's not to say that all of the puzzle in the game are like that, some are downright challenging and make you think quite a bit to figure them out.

At one part in the game (and probably others, I haven't finished it yet, so I don't know) You are given the choice between 2 objectives: help one guy and continue on with the main quest, or help another guy and do a side quest. The choice(s) you make will effect the game and I've heard that there are 3 or 4 different endings, giving it some replayability.

Overall:

If you like survival horror and want to try something a bit different, give this game a try, you'll end up enjoying it.

The graphics and cutscenes are realistic and excellent for the time. The control scheme is tight, and precise, and it has plenty of genuinely terrifying moments sprinkled throughout the game. There's plenty of gore, mild language, and tough dinosaurs to keep you busy for a while. I highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for an intense, fast paced, survival horror experience. 4/5",4.0
"You can say this is resident evil with dinosaurs but it's a little more than that. Definitely scary. Puzzles are a little complex and tricky. You'll need a pen and paper to figure them out. Cutscenes are awesome. Monsters are quick here. You no longer have the comfort of running away from a slow moving zombie. Certainly challenging. Four stars overall because this game is short, but still worth it.

I did play Dino Crises 2 and it was okay. More of a shooter. Wished Capcom stayed with the survival horror element. They had a winner here.",4.0
"While some reviews hail this as a Resident Evil with Dinosaurs it's much more than that. The characters were great,and the story line is awesome. The only complaints I had for this game were the camera angles, some were very infuriating! The game play is solid, and this game is an instant classic. I would recommend picking this game up at the cheap price it is being sold for before it's too late! Fast shipper as well, and prompt service!",4.0
"This game isn't historically important(in the history of videogames), it's derivitive, and flawed, but I still had a lot of fun playing it. It's like a good b-movie. I tend not to like the graphics of playstation games, I preferred the snes back in the day, but here they work. The graphics lean towards realism but have a hint of anime influence, and I think they did a really great job on the dinosaur models, and most of the animations are pretty expressive, the limping of Regina when she's injured for example. The grainyness of the graphics enhance the b-movie feel. The voice acting isn't great but each character has a distinct personality. I also enjoyed the item mixing system, this allows you to customize the difficulty of the game, you can choose to use weak items or level+ items. There is also a decent amount of strategy in the game depending on the kind of weapon you use: raptors will be unfazed, stunned, or knocked down depending on the strength of the weapon; and there are also laser shields in some areas you can use to knock down raptors in order to run from them.
Flaws: the first and most serious flaw in the game is that the areas on the map aren't labeled, this is idiotic, it means that when you find clues with room specific information then, unless you have a great memory, you won't know where to look. Another problem is that sometimes important objects in the environment will blend in with the background and look unimportant, there is a key slot that would have taken me hours to find if I didn't get annoyed and look at a game walkthough. Sometimes the camera angles can hide important objects too. There is also a problem with damage detection and hit point arithmetic: a raptor won't take damage during some parts of it's animation, and if you get in some shot gun blasts then switch to the hand gun sometimes it won't count the damage done with the shotgun, both of these issues waste bullets. You can't group items how you want, sometimes you'll want to upgrade just one item but are forced to waste two others because of auto grouping. The select sound effect gets annoying considering how often you have to go to your inventory. The save system is slow and annoying. The pace of the game gets stalled from puzzles sometimes, you'll be running for your life but then have to stop and do a puzzle, and I never figured out the rules of the crane puzzle it just felt like trial and error.",4.0
"Around 1999 this game hit shelves on the coat tails of the success of the famed Resident Evil series. It even comes with a demo for Resident Evil 3 Nemesis! That said, this is not Resident Evil. It has similar controls and a story a little too silly to understand, but that is it.

The game is dependant on your ability to craft darts or find bullets to kill the enemys of the game. You will never have enough ammo to march through the compound and kill every enemy. You will need to run, close doors, operate lazer gates, and ect to get through this game.

There are puzzles as well, none that I can immediately remember except for the puzzle where you move cargo holds to make a path.

The enemies are excellent. This game has dinosaurs that look and feel like Jurrasic Park dinosaurs. The raptors are vicious and terrifying, the pterradactyles are a situational enemy but they are a thrilling challenge, the dome-headed dinosaurs show up and kick your can, and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is simply great. The enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable. They take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you apart.

I give this game praise for going away from the zombie threat and replacing them with something exceedingly more violent and threatening. I love zombie games more than the next guy, but this was just good. The story was B-Movie, just like in Resident Evil, and the enemys were terrifying and threatening. The enviroments were dynamic and look really good on PS1. Very little did not work in the game, and if ther was something then I cannot remember it.",4.0
"Nope.... the title of my review IS NOT misleading, yes DC had a much better and more complete plot than either RE1 or RE3. RE2, not quiet as the scientific aura of the game sucks you in. Anyway, to get started, Regina and her fellow comrades are out on Ibis Island in search of a man by the name of Professor Kirk. Apparently he's got this new ""Third Energy Experiment"" which he is conducting.. I won't spoil as to what is behind this experiment as it'll ruin the gaming experience. The gameplay is similar to that of RE2/3 but instead of zombies, you face dinosaurs. You will NOT be dissapointed. I must say Shinji Mikami has good taste when it comes to creating a game with a very good storyline.

Gameplay:9/10(Exactly like RE except you have 3D graphics instead of 2D)
Story:8.5/10(It's very rare for a game to earn a good rating in this area)
Replay Value:8/10 Hey, you have three different endings and replaying it gives a chance to experience the different possbilities.
Suspense: 9/10 This game is easily a victor in this department. My hats off to Shinji for making this game more suspensful unlike its sucessor, DC2.",4.0
REALLY GOOD GAME. And AMAZON treated me right. I got my order within THREE BUSNESS DAYS!That is phenomanal! But back to the game. It is very exciting and an awesome cure for boredom. The graphics are really good and I like the dinosaurs. Overall the game gets a nine out of ten. BUY IT!!!! at AMAZON,4.0
"I am basically buying and beating old playstation games I never got a chance to beat. I just finished this game today and it was pretty good. The controls are prettymuch identical to the early resident evil series and so is gameplay really. The story is pretty decent the only things I did not like about the game is it can become tedious running and back and fourth and some of the puzzles,  not hard,  are just kind of annoying. Good pickup if you can find it for under 10 bucks and looking to waste a saturday with a  6 pack. Game should take no more than 8 hours and thats really pushing it",4.0
"I remember back in 1999 when I received Dino Crisis as a Christmas present. This was my first exposure to a survival horror game. Believe it or not, I actually didn't bother with the Resident Evil series until six years later, in the summer of 2005, which is when I played Resident Evil 2 for the very first time.

Now, let's go back to 1999 for a moment. The world of 3D gaming was in full swing at that point in time. 1999 was a year when people were anxiously awaiting what the Playstation 2 would give us, while at the same time, we were appreciating what the original Playstation was offering. The original Playstation, as you may already know, is where the survival horror genre *really* became popular. Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and, the now underrated and unfortunately forgotten, Dino Crisis series.

Over time, people haven't treated the Dino Crisis series with *nearly* as much respect as the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series. It probably has something to do with Dino Crisis 3 being a really bad game with horrible camera angles, which meant, after that failed experiment hit the market, people weren't interested in any more Dino Crisis games. But, you know, even before Dino Crisis 3 was released, people didn't respect the Dino Crisis series as much as the other survival horror games. I really have no idea why. Dinosaurs can be *just* as cool as zombies. Believe me. Perhaps it has something to do with the animation? Even though killing dinosaurs is fun and addicting, Capcom made killing zombies slightly more interesting, thanks mainly to better animation from pointing and shooting your guns at a zombies head. It just looks and feels better in Resident Evil.  This in NO WAY should be reason to avoid Dino Crisis. This also doesn't mean Dino Crisis is flawed in the shooting department. Both Resident Evil and Dino Crisis offer tons of enjoyment. TONS of enjoyment. They are just separate beasts.

The original Dino Crisis is supposed to be about making the right decisions when it comes to either keeping your ammo and health in one place, or making the decision to bring the ammo and health with you. It's supposed to be about guessing whether or not the ammo or health will eventually be necessary as you progress through the game. However, on easy mode, none of this makes a difference. The game is *so* easy on easy mode, that you can literally get attacked by dinosaurs about five or six times before you even need one of those Med Pack M's (used to bring your health back to 100%). Seeing as how there aren't many dinosaurs in the game overall, you will only need to use one of these health packs maybe two or three times throughout the entire game. Dino Crisis is *that* easy!  This means you will only have to bring one or two Med Packs with you, and leave the rest behind.

To be fair, you can't just mindlessly shoot every dinosaur you arrive to, because you aren't given a whole lot of ammo. Certainly not as much ammo is given to you compared to how many health packs are available throughout the journey. Despite that, running out of bullets probably won't ever be a problem.  Just make certain you avoid some of the weaker dinosaurs in the early parts of the game. That way you will have enough bullets for the bigger and deadlier dinosaurs in the later parts of the game (which obviously require more bullets to kill).

You are given the ability to mix things together, to create dangerous darts. These darts are used to kill dinosaurs *very* quickly, sometimes in a single shot. The problem here is that, on easy mode, the game is so simple that mixing darts together isn't even important. You don't have to worry about dart-mixing on easy mode *at all*. You can simply shoot or avoid all the dinosaurs you come across on easy mode and not have to worry about dart-mixing EVER. That kind of ruins the whole ""survival horror"" aspect of the game.  You should have been required to use at least one or two of these darts.

People criticize Dino Crisis 2 for being just a mindless shooting game where you have to kill as many dinosaurs as possible to progress to the next area and collect bigger guns, but the honest truth is, the original is a MUCH easier game overall because you can simply run past all the dinosaurs that stand in your way. You can't do that in the second game. You have to stand up to them and shoot. So Dino Crisis 2 is a harder game, in my opinion. Oh sure, you are given an option to up the difficulty (in both Dino Crisis games) but the problem here is that the difficulty goes up SIGNIFICANTLY, making the game nearly impossible.

Another problem I have with the game is the amount of cutscenes. You CANNOT skip over them, so you are forced to watch almost every single one of them. Most of them are kind of boring because most of the cutscenes feature the main characters just talking to each other. Sometimes you will see a cool-looking dinosaur attacking something, though. But Capcom *really* should have given you an option to skip over the cutscenes like they did in the sequel, because most of them are flat-out boring. These conversations are supposed to create a spooky mood, but it doesn't work in my opinion.

I also have a problem with the INCREDIBLE amount of puzzles you come across. I am not kidding, there's over 25 puzzles in this game. Some of them are just a matter of typing in the correct series of numbers, or the correct words to access the next area. Some of the puzzles are more along the lines of finding the right way to complete them, such as the puzzle where you're pushing these Up, Down, Left and Right buttons to figure out how to sucessfully lift up and put down boxes using a giant crane. These are extremely hard puzzles to figure out by yourself unless you have a walkthrough.  Once you figure them out, the sequence is exactly the same the next time you play the game, though.  They're not random like in Resident Evil 3.

The game is also *very* heavy on searching for the correct key cards to gain access to the next part of the game, which can be annoying. Simply put, the game is dominated with puzzles and key cards, which are always required to access the next area.  A bit much, to say the least.

Despite the above problems, Dino Crisis is STILL a pretty fun game because the dinosaurs are animated beautifully and the graphics as a whole are really good for 1999 as well. The actual gameplay has some problems mentioned above, but there's also plenty of action to be found. Also, the game is pretty scary and intense, and the dinosaurs are simply wonderful looking and it's interesting the way they can attack you because they attack differently each time. Sometimes they will bite at your arm, other times they will pick you up from off the ground, and more.

Oh, and the music and sound effects are amazing.  Perhaps the best music and sound effects in a survival horror game ever. Instead of featuring melodic themes, you are treated to sound effects and musical notes that seem to play randomly, almost making it sound like improvised music, like something from a King Crimson record.  This means, if you listen to the music carefully, you can hear a bunch of unusual and creepy sound effects in the background.  You hear something different each time.  It's awesome, and works great.  It's not a typical soundtrack in any shape or form, even by survival horror standards.  It's so good.

Overall, even though Dino Crisis has almost zero replay value, and too much time is spent running around inside a facility doing one puzzle after another (and collecting one key card after another) the game is worth the experience.  It's not a classic, just a nice game.",4.0
"Having played a rather large number of survival horror titles in my time, I uncovered this title at the local flea market for 3 bucks. Having missed it back on the ps1 days (I was too busy with Silent Hill and Resident Evil I guess...) and being a die hard fan of Survival Horror, I picked it up. First and for most, many people have claimed this to be Rresident Evil with dinosaurs. Don't get me wrong, the similarities are hard to miss, but this really is something unique. Enimies are fast... the slow moving zombie has been replaced with the screeching, agile, adreniline fueled velociraptor... Which makes this game pretty difficult. No, think about it. RE controlls... only with zombies that move faster than you. Get the picture? While this does ramp the difficulty significantly, it isn't too over bearing (You just have to learn that blasting dinos isn't a good idea and running away is). Despite the more frentic combat, the game still moves at a sluggish pace that survival horror players have either come to love or hate. This is due in large part to a vast number of puzzles (which make little sense, as usual... colored key cards, statues, crate moving, etc.)and back tracking, in true RE fashion. However, this game offers some really chilling atmosphere, and despite the slow moving speed, it really does feel faster and more frentic than it's compitition, just because dinos are everywhere, you are always running and usually have an extremely low ammount of ammo at all times. Because nearly every area has key items, you have to explore. Because these same areas feature dinos, you have to use ammo to kill them. Because dinos are so fast and hard to kill you are always taking damage. You use healing items to cure wounds, so there for, unlike Resident Evil, it is pretty damn hard to hoard ammo and healers... all this results from fast moving enemies, and because you almost always just barely escape every situation by the seat of your pants, this gives dino crisis an exciting edge that most other horror games still haven't perfected. Add to this, ""choose your own adventure"" style twists in the plot where you call the shots as to which direction the story goes, the ability to combine items to create more powerful weapons, new types of ammo, and more potent healing items, and some pretty nifty graphics (they really aren't that bad, considering this game is almost 5 years old)and you have a winning title. As for the not-so-juicy parts, well... there are only about 4 types of enemies. And if you ever saw Jurassic Park or opened up a childrens Dinosaur book, you already know what they look like and how they will act. I'm not complaining, because each dino still scares the crap out of you when it pops out of a vent shaft or chases you down a corridor at high speed... but they lack that what-the-hell-is-it? factor of the mutants seen in RE and Silent Hill... Before you ever encounter them, you already know exactly what the enemies will look like, and how they will try and kill you. It just isn't as disturbing as the freekish encounters experienced in most other games of the genre. More so, the weapon selection is a little limited (3 weapons: Pistol, Shotgun, Grenade Gun), which offer a nice balance of speed, ammo availability and power... but it still leaves something to be desired, as pistol ammo is far too week to be useful (7 to 10 hits for a kill on a fast moving enemy... yeah right) and shotgun ammo is far to scarce to be wasted on anything but important circumstances (obviously grenades are saved exclusively for bosses if you actually want to beat the game). A good middle ground weapon would have been nice, just to lower frustration and make combat more stream-lined. In short, if you never liked Survival Horror, this isn't going to turn you into a fan. But if you like the corridor romping, the solving of mundane puzzles that pop out of no where and a few heart pounding marrathon runs while being chased by savage lizards, this is a game you should check out. Dated by today's standerds, but still decient enough to replay to see the 4 different endings. I give it a solid 85 out of 100.",4.0
"As my first forray into the world of survival horror, I was very curious to see how this game would hold up in this age of Playstation 2s and Halo.  I am pleased to say that this is a pretty fun game that has its strenghts and weaknesses.
You play as a secret agent named Regina.  Your mission is to infiltrate Ibis island to find a mysterious scientest named Dr. Kirk.  Upon landing on the island, it quickly becomes obvious that there is something very wrong with the island.  Then it becomes a quest to survive the evil reptillian menace.
Many, many people have complained about how dino crisis should be called puzzle crisis.  It is true that there is an unusual amount of puzzles in the game that you must solve to advance.  They range from simple (switch the batteries) to the moderatly difficult (move the crates with a crane) to the quite difficult (Rotate electronic chips to divert power).  There are also a mamoth amount of keys that you must get (Around 50).  There are also DDK locks that you have to dechiper to unlock doors (Hence the title of this review).  Most of these puzzles can be solved moderatly easily, if you really think about it.  Overall, I'd say that the game is a 50/50 mix of puzzles and dinosaur action.
As for the fighting part of the game, you get a total of three weapons, (Shotgun, handgun, and grenade gun) to exterminate raptors, pteradons, etc.  Some people might be turned off at the idea of only 3 weapons, but I don't find it a problem.  Combat is handled in the RE control scheme, which works pretty well.  As with a lot of survival horror games, you have to be carefull as to how you make your way through with ammo, which is not unlimited (Except in 1 case).  Fighting the dinosaurs can be difficult, but mastered.  Overall, I'd give the combat a B
There are some things to really like about Dino Crisis.  At certian points during the game, you have to make decisions aka ""Choose your own adventure"" style (Do you investigate the underground area, or go save a comrade?).  This adds a nice touch of replay value.  The graphics are pretty good (By PS1 standards).  The best part of the game however, is the T-rex.  The T-rex provides the most exciting elements in the game, and each encounter is a adrenaline charged rush.  Likewise, the 4 possible different endings are all very exciting and cool to play through, although there are a few things I am curious about.  For example, (Spoiler!!!) how can a T-rex swim 30 miles an hour in water?  That dosent make much sense. (End Spoiler)
The weak points of the game are mostly the puzzles.  There are a bit too many of them, and not enough dino battles.  Also, the devlopers throw puzzles at you when you least suspect it, and when you don't want them.  While racing to a heliport for example, a big race against time with tense dramatic music, the game tosses a box pushing puzzle that you have to solve to advance.  Another time, you have to solve 2 big puzzles in the span of 10 minnutes, where you have to power an elevator, then move cranes when they are only 3 minnutes apart.  Also, the unlockable mini-game you earn if you beat the game in under 5 hours, is dissapointing (At least to me).  The element of strategy is unwelcome, I just want to blast dinosaurs, and not worry about ammo, and Why isint the T-rex included?
overall, I think that Dino Crisis is a fun game, and a good start to the world of Survival horror.  I recomend picking it up if you find it for uner $$$ .
The good:
good graphics
good dino action
good story
Choose your own adventure style branches
The T-rex
4 cool endings
The not so good:
a bit too many puzzles
some really difficult puzzles
not enough dino action
mediocre mini game (See above)",4.0

"Let me give it to you really short and sweet! Did you like Resident Evil? Then you will like Dino Crisis; it's Resident Evil with dinosaurs. All Capcom did was change the characters and instead of shooting zombies you get to shoot and kill raptors and other dinosaurs that are trying to eat you.
I myself am a fan of Resident Evil so for the price this is a cool game. The same problems from RE come with Dino Crisis however.... lack of ammo!! Besides this it's a fun game, lots of puzzles to figure out and lots of shoot first ask questions later type of fun.",4.0
"I loved this game. I like the fact of killing smart and fast dinos alot more than killing stupid,retarded,slow and mindless zombies. It makes the game a little more challenging and this game has so many surprises going from raptors poping out from a corner to rip your face off all the way to a gient T-Rex busting through a window to bite you in half. I must say that this game is very gory but in a way still cannot compare to the goryness of RE games. I bet though that your wondering why I called this one of the best survival-horrors when I have only givin it 4 stars instead of a perfect 5. Well,the game seems to have to much puzzle solving and not enough killing dinos. Like there is about a dino in every hall and in a few rooms but after you kill them all your stuck with about 50 puzzles to open a new area and then you finally get the opportunity to kill a few more dinos and then the same proccess over and over. 50 puzzles,10 dinos,50 puzzles,10 dinos. But hey,look on the bright side. The graphics are very great,along with the sound and awesome FMV's and the game also has its great and fun moments like when the T-Rex comes out. In this game the T-Rex plays a simmilar role such as the Nemises does in RE3 because they are both constant enemys that keep showing up to ruin your day and they seem invincable. This annoys some because of the same boss showing up over and over but I think its great!!Plus if you have played RE3 and got annoyed by the Nemises showing up over and over,you may like this a little better because in here the T-Rex does not show up as near asmany times as the Nemises does. Aside from the T-Rex and the Raptors there are 3 other deadly dinos. One is the small and very very annoying Compys,who show up and theres about 20 of them you gota kill which wastes a great deal of your ammo. Anouther is the flying bird dinos(I don't know how to spell there names)and last but not the least,these very very strong and very big(bigger than a raptor anyways but way smaller than the T-Rex)wierd looking things that I do not have a clue to what there names are. Oh,now I would like to get to the ammo. Ammo is very very hard to find in this game,and there is not even that much to find...But I suggest to you to get and infit ammo cheat because you'll need it for this game. This games AI(artificial intellagence)is very good. The dinos are smart and if you are bleeding they can smell it all the way from a different hall and start stalking you. So over all this is a great horror-survival that has (somwhat little)but good action none the less. Buy it,you'll love it(exept if your not good at solving puzzles).
  bye now.",4.0
"I enjoyed Dino Crisis. It's a good action/adventure game if you like Resident Evil or Jurassic Park (although it may not be as instense as the movie). The graphics, sounds and voice acting, plot are great. It doesn't have extremely a lot of surprises to make you jump out of your seat, but the plot goes by well. Dinosaurs are nearly random and there are multiple endings so the game won't be so linear like most.

"Its a nifty little console, however, it makes a really menacing grinding noise whenever its loading a disk, I'm not sure if that's normal because I've never owned a Dreamcast before, and It also sounds like the internal cooling fans are having a hard time cooling it. I'm glad I made the purchase, however I am uncertain of the longevity of its life.

It arrived in a medium sized box, and it had like, 20 layers of saran wrap on it, which was kind of annoying to peel off, but I suppose it did its job in keeping the console safe, and the console itself is only a little bigger than the controller.

I highly recommend this console. I gave it a 4 because there's a few errors with my console, but only minor ones, like having to reset the internal clock EVERY TIME I turn it on, long loading times on games, the grinding noise, which I might add, my PS2 started making before it died, and the cooling fan. I feel like I should also add that it had a bit of trouble picking up the controller the first time I used it, but that was easily fixable.

Overall its a great console that I would recommend to people who want to experience some history in gaming without the loss of content from an N64 cartridge.",4.0
"I got this mainly to play Resident Evil CV, Carrier and a few other games so didn't use it as much as my other consoles. To be honest it just didn't have many games I was interested in.

I thought it was a competent game console though did have an issue with the controller. It seemed poorly designed or at least for the games I was playing. Other than that I thought it was a decent console.",4.0

"After replaying both RE and RE2 from my childhood days; I couldn't wait to buy RE3 since I had missed that one growing up and was dying to try it out. Well... I've had the game for a few nights (7 hours gameplay) and have already beaten it. And I gotta say it was a fun ride, but I'm kind of disappointed. I'm a huge Resident Evil fan and I've been wanting to play this game for years.

Don't get me wrong the game was very entertaining and still withheld the ability to scare the hell out of me. I did enjoy it a lot, but it just doesn't justify itself as much of a sequel in my opinion.

Here's why.

First off, whats up with the difficulty modes? You're only given two choices; Hard or Easy. And their both screwed up. Why?

EASY MODE:
- The game starts you (Jill) off with an assault rifle and 3 F.Aid sprays.
- Enemies are way too easy to shrug off.
- Jill can take up to 6 bites from a zombie and still be in ""Fine"" condition.
- You have infinite ink ribbons.
- All of the weapons in the game are already unlocked and located in your storage crate.
- You have massive amounts of ammo for each gun already in the storage crate. (And I'm talking MASSIVE) For example: 250 Handgun rounds, 76 Shotgun shells, and 2 100% AR clips.
- Picking up ammo, Gun powder, and health items is pointless since you already have enough of each to last you to the end of the game.
- It is not much of a challenge.

Needless to say, I quickly changed from Easy to Hard mode after the first 10 minutes of playing. I usually don't like playing Hard mode on any game. But it didn't leave me much of a choice, and being a RE veteran I figured I could handle it. In other words, Easy mode was obviously designed for newbies and people that absolutely SUCK.

HARD MODE:
- You start with almost no ammo at all.
- Jill takes too much damage even from the smallest attacks.
- The new ""dodging"" feature is nearly impossible to use.
- Nemesis is way too strong and can kill you in one or two hits.
- Jill's inventory is very small. Unlike the first Resident Evil.
- Zombies respawn after you enter and exit a room. (True, considering the situation and environment does make sense. Like its impossible to kill every zombie in the city.)

Nonetheless I completed the game on Hard. Having died 3 or 4 times being annihilated by Nemesis. My only question is... why wasn't there a ""Normal"" or ""Original"" mode to play? I like to be challenged and enjoy the game at the same time. Playing on Hard was difficult and irritating. Especially when you have an 8 ft. monster on your tail most of the time.

Secondly, the story.

STORY:
To sum it all up the story is about Jill desperately trying to escape Raccoon city alive. And the first part of the story actually takes place like a day before the events of Resident Evil 2. The main conflict in the story is that Umbrella corp. has secretly dispatched a mutant tyrant called ""Nemesis"" into Raccoon city to seek out and destroy all the remaining S.T.A.R.S members. Namely Jill and Brad Vickers. I won't spoil the ending for anyone and I think most RE fans know what happens anyway.

What I didn't like about the story was that it was too confusing. Like, who is Nemesis?? Where did he come from?? I mean seriously whats his origin? Also, in RE2 Leon and Claire were looking for Chris, who we later discovered had traveled to Europe. But your telling me that Jill was in the city the whole time? And not once did Leon and Claire cross paths with her? Come on...

Another thing that doesn't make sense (keep in mind this is before RE2) is when Jill makes her way into the R.P.D. building only to find that half of the doors are boarded up/barricaded having no access. Which would contradict RE2's plot altogether. How would Leon and Claire get around the building? It doesn't make any sense. Why didn't they just have all of the doors Jill didn't need to go in locked? The story itself is pretty clustered. And it's really not even a story, its more like a side-story. It just seems that it was really rushed through and not a lot of thought was put into it.

Thirdly, the Nemesis.

NEMESIS:
Despite what I said earlier.. I thought that Nemesis was a great addition to the game. He definitely adds to the suspense and you never know when or where he's going to pop up and surprise you. However, it doesn't take long to get tired and frustrated with him. Mainly because there were a lot of areas in the city that I wanted to explore but couldn't because I was being pursued by Nemesis!!! And he shows up like 15 minutes apart from each appearance. So, exploring or not he'll always turn up sooner or later. And yes you can fend him off. But there's really no point since he's nearly impossible to kill, and your only wasting precious ammo and health trying to fight him.  By the way, some of you may remember Mr. X from RE2... well there's a big similarity between the two. Their both huge mutant zombies that stalk you throughout the game. So its quite obvious that Nemesis was a variation of Mr. X.

Pros:
RE3 did improve and add some great new features. Such as... The new ""dodge"" feature that really adds to the gameplay and helps a ton when your in combat. It took Capcom 3 games to finally add the 180 degree spin; which enables you to turn around quickly and run to avoid danger. I also liked the new ""Gun powder"" mixing feature, which enables you to create ammunition for your weapons. There is a lot of action and surprises in the game. Adding the interactive environmental objects (explosive barrels, etc.) was a nice feature and really helped in difficult situations. I did really like the outdoor environment in the game. I thought that was a nice break-away from the first two games. And finally, you don't need to press the action button to go up or down a flight of stairs.

Cons:
The graphics are the same as in RE and RE2 only with slight improvement on the character models and design. The pre-rendered environments don't look as good or dark as in RE2 but are still nice. The game itself is very short compared to the first two, and the only playable character is Jill. The camera angles can get annoying sometimes, especially when there is an enemy blocking your view. (This problem is in the first two games also.) It wasn't as scary, exciting, or suspenseful as RE and RE2. But still has moments that make you jump out of your seat. And lastly, it lacks a story.

Conclusion:
Bottom line, RE3:Nemesis is a good game. It's fun, scary, and entertaining. And no its not the best, and in my opinion its the weakest game in the series. And anyone who disagrees, obviously hasn't played the first two. But I will cut it some slack because Resident evil 3 had a lot to live up to. And it was because Resident Evil 2 really set a high standard for the series. Lets face it, Resident Evil 2 was a legendary game, and quite possibly the greatest sequel to any video game in history. I just think that RE3 could of been a better sequel. And it isn't as good as its predecessor.

Final Rating: 3.8/5",4.0
"The movie part's and the background's are the best. But the character's, zombies and nemisis could of been drawed or animated better and the character's lip's could have match what their saying like in the movie part's. But other than shooting the zombie's right between the leg's. It's a great game to play.",4.0

"I am a huge fan of the series, but this one is my favorite. It may not be the best overall (see re4, then re2) but it is by far the best story and i love the nemesis. the fact that he is so violent and unrelenting make him the best. the only gripe i have is that i beat it the first day i had it in only 3 hours. :(",4.0
"Resident Evil 3: Nemesis adds a nice touch to the Resident Evil formula. Not only do you have to deal with oncoming hordes of zombies, but now you have another worry...being chased by a Nemesis that will come after you no matter what you do to try and stop it. The addition of Nemesis made this game one of the most enjoyable, and my favorite of the Resident Evil\'s. The addition to now be able to walk up stairs without pressing a button really did help way back when, though wondering how that was ever not a feature in the games is a bit of a puzzlement. And on the subject of puzzles, the only flaw this game has is the \""water puzzle\"" near the end of the game. Only because it is totally random. Meaning you can get lucky and solve it in 20 seconds, or it could take about 30 minutes to beat. But other than that, this is a great game that any Resident Evil fan should have in their collection. NnyCW for CapCity.",4.0
i heard re3 was supposed to be before re2 and i am not sure but i know one thing re 2 the second senario was sweet they atleast couldve put a 2nd sanerio in this one with carlos and they couldve put mrx from 2 in here because that wouldve made it better but overall this is a very sweet game.i like that nemesis is hard as hell to beat but they couldve put  more enemys in thisone to. but allwell they didn't but other that that i love it now if i could get it to work in my playstation!,4.0

"I played the second resident evil when it came out on nintendo64. And I must admit, Resident Evil 2 is hands on more brilliant than Resident Evil 3. Nemesis is a cool character, but basically it get's borring after a while. It does follow a similiar story line and it seems the creatures always stay the same. The downside of having Resident Evil 3 was the fact that it kind of tore me away from the series. Although the second resident evil game was awesome, Resident Evil 3, couldn't pull off on the graphics. The music was good however, and it did have a good sound to it. It just needs a different story line and a more complex one. I must say, if this is your first time playing Resident Evil play the second game before you play this game. The second game is by far better through it's graphics, story line, and characters. Overall, this game would be good for a addon for someone who collects resident evil games. I, myself, didn't care to much for the game.",4.0
"okay, first of all, i havnt played this for a while so just hang in there with me. i was always a big resident evil fan, from the first game where you see the first zombie, i was hooked.

Now, the review itself. This game is full of gore, ranging from blowing the head off a zombie with a magnum, or shooting them in half with a shot-gun, this is not a game for the feint of heart or the squeemish. with that said, onto the game itself.  In the begining you start out as the lovely, as always, Jill Valentine.  You are in a building with zombies trying to get at you from all angles (breaking through windows and trying to beat down doors). Suddenly a make-shift wall explodes and you come running out, rou have to make your way down the alley way and into a safe place, blasting zombies on the way. You stumble into a building and meet some random guy, and like alway he has no idea whats going on.

Now, this game is not full of action and explosions, even thought those things are evident in the game, this is a survival horror game suggesting exactly what the genre says, surving the horrors of a zombie take over.

You run around the city from place to place collecting keys and items that will help unlock areas as you go, along with weapons and ammo. Being the seemingly frail Jill Valentine may not appeal to most gamers, but to me, i couldn't enjoy it more. Blasting zombies from a females perspective is not only awesome, but sometimes tricky. She is obviously not as strong as a man, and cannot perform some tasks due to this fact, but those things she cant do don't really have a place in this game. It also makes fighting the zombies feel realistic, because she has trouble fighting them off when the get too close.

The zombies themselves are your typical zombies, slow and usually unthreatening, but once you open a door and six or seven of the ugly beasts come pooring out and the dramatic music kicks in, your heart will definately race.  There are boss monsters here and there, but most of them have a pattern, and once you figure it out they are not that difficult.

The main badguy, the nemesis, is down right frightening, and hes not your typical boss either. He is terrifyingly (sp?) fast.  He will pop out of nowhere and scare the begesis out of you. Fighting him at first is not an option you want to persue, but it is possible to defeat him. Did i mention how fast he his? Dont get your hopes up becasue he will eventually get back up and hunt you down again. He has his own agenda, which is to track down all the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members, which you (Jill Valentine) are a part of. He also, at one point in the game, has a freaking rocket launcher strapped to his arm!!! That just shows you how powerfull this guy is.

The graphics of the game are pretty good, but they could have been better. One thing you have to keep in mind though, is the time period the game was made, and the system it is on. So comparing them to the graphics of today would be rediculous. They are good though.

The controls are typical to the Resident evil series, which to those who never played one of these games before will take a few minutes to get used to, but once you do, you will be bobbing and weaving through those hordes of zombis like a pro.

The game play is decent. Again, typical to the series. This game, over all doesnt stray too far from the genre. Although Capcom did introduce a decision making factor where in certain situations you have to make one of two choices which will slightly determain the ending of the game, so the re-play value is moderatly high. Once yo beat the game you will unlock a mini game called ""The Mercinaries"" which places you in the shoes of one of the character you will meet in the game, and you will have to make it from point A to point B in a certain amoutnt of time.  You will only have a limited amount of ammo and items to get you through it. If you make it you will be rewarded with money to buy some extras in the game, like weapons and costumes.

The ending is kinda drab, but still great non-the-less. Once you see it you will find out the it is necessary. Dont let what i said about the ending drive you away from purcasing this beauty of a survival horror game, because this game is great and a must have for any gamer, whether you're a colector or a player, so what are you waiting for?

I like the direction Sega took memory cards. At the time I really thought it was the future of controllers and memory cards. I might've been half right I guess.

"Man, this game is one of the funnyest i ever played. Almost the whole game, theres a big dope  chasing after u with a bazzuka, saying the same thing over and over again....""STARS"". After the 50th time he says ""STARS"", u'll get so annoyed that u'll want to turn down the volume. Its really funny when u blow a zombies head off with a shot gun or something else like that. Jill is a hot chick that knows she wants the mercenary Carlos. Carlos is sooo cool. I think if ur looking for a scary game, u should play resident evil 1. That was probally the freakest.",4.0
"This review is actually in reference to both the Dreamcast version and the Playstation version. For PS 1, RE 3 offers some of the best graphics available on the system, on DC the graphics are a sore disappointment as there were only minimal improvements, and while it does look better on the DC there are other enhancements that I would have implemented. This game had scared me when I rented it on the PS 1 so bad that I set it aside. It had got my heart racing, the whole running away and running for dear life... and me without a guidebook! Several years later I buy the DreamCast version just to complete the collection, and while waiting for the remake of RE 1 for my GCN I dust this game off and played through it, without a guidebook. This time I didn't get spooked at all. I was up pretty late that night I got scared anyway.
RE 3: Nemesis focuses more so on action than anything else, and there is (thankfully) more than enough ammo and herbs to go around. I think that this is probably the easiest of the Resident Evil games, not saying that you won't encounter the ""You Died"" screen on occasion, but less often than in other installments. This is also the shortest game in the series. The voice acting is dramatically better than previous games, as well as the in game cut scenes a little more fleshed out. However the story is not as fleshed out as it should have been. The game does have some advantages. It is the first game to allow you to ascend and descend stairs without using the action button, and it was the only game of the series to have a functional dodge button, which was great. I also enjoyed the gunpowder mixing. All in all this game is a lot of fun, short, but sweet, and although it is not the pinnacle of the series it is a worthy sequel. Plus the DreamCast version has more than enough extras to keep a person busy for a while. Lie RE 2 this game is being ported to GCN with minimal improvements. I only wish that Capcom would consider a total remake of this game as well with more story elements. If future installments of RE are to keep the tank like movement than I hope that they will reincorporate the dodge button.",4.0
"I am a Dreamcast holdout.  And I am proud of it.  The DC is...was the new Resident Evil Machine and every game in the series except for 1 was on it.  Which brings me to Resident Evil 3
This is the Survival Horror god.  RE3 is perhaps the most scary(insert shocking here) game of the series I have played yet.  Rather than face several boss charactors at obvious areas, Nemisis, the big, bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout the game.  I still remember fondly the first time I saw his distorted face.  And I remember well his tenacious persuit of me causing my fingers to curl and my stomach to clench.  He is scary.
Added to Nemisis himself is the wonderful, useful dodge ability.  Tired of Zombies walking through your hail of fire to rip open your neck?  Charge them and push them back!  Tired of spiders wraping their legs around you and pumping you full of poison?  Jump aside.  It is so nice to actually roll out of the way of a enemies swinging claws.  And RE3 is the only game so far where you get to do this.
Finally, the gripes.  Although I have not played 1, RE3 is the shortest of the series I have played.  It is also much less epic than 2 or Veronica.  If it is lengh and amazing story you are looking for, go for RE code Veronica.  But is you want to be gripping the armchair seat and shivering from overdose excitement...This is the game for you.",4.0
"For anyone who has not played this stellar game series, this is what you call a ""survival horror"" game, which means you have a gun, you are alone and you have 1000s of zombies, dogs, ravens, monsters and mutants after you. The third installment of the Resident Evil game series actually takes place before the second game, so you are writing the future, playing as the lead heroine Jill (who survived the first game). You start out on the streets of Raccoon City, which has been ravaged by zombies, and you work your way to the Police Station and back into the city streets, trying to escape the town, all the while being stalked by a huge ugly killer which appears every once in a while to give the player a scare. Unlike the other two games, Jill is armed to the teeth right when you begin the game. She has a handgun, shotgun, magnum and an assault rifle, however unlike the original two games there are not waves of zombies to go through, instead there are only a few zombies, but the city streets are like a maze, so there is lots of ground to cover. There are only a few improvements made from the first two games. In Resident Evil 2, there were only 4 types of zombies, with this game there are dozens of zombies, such as fat zombies, beautiful zombies and so on. There is also a new system where you can make bullets for certain guns, but there is no chance you will ever run out of ammo. Another nice addition is that the player can dodge attacks without the player's help. The graphics and sound are still excellent, but several graphics were taken straight from Resident Evil 2.",4.0

"I got my dreamcast last year, brand new bc I missed a lot of the classic games (house of the dead 2, soul reaver, soul calibur, marvel vs. capcom, etc.) Thankfully I got it before amazon started selling it for close to $200. I love this system but it is disappointing that there isn't as many games for it as the newer consoles. Also some of the best games are ridiculously priced in second hand game stores and online. marvel vs capcom was $60 at my favorite game store and house of the dead was close to $30. This is pretty pricey especially b/c xbox/ ps2 games go for like $5-$20 and all the other old consoles like Nintendo and sega, have games for like $.50. Most of the games I had my heart set on, I had 2 buy on amazon or other sites just to avoid spending an arm and leg for games that are close to a decade old. After playing my favorites several times, I wanted to play some games that were new to me and came to realize I really didn't have that much to chose from in the store. There was maybe 20 games or less in the store and most of the ones in my price range, I wasn't really interested in. Online you can find more but not nearly as many as the newer consoles. However, once you find the games you want for a decent price, the dreamcast is tons of fun and has a lot to offer. The graphics are pretty good. I love that you can put music on it and can go on the internet (though I haven't tried)and the vmus are really awesome. I love how on soul calibur you can see the characters fighting on the vmu screen. All in all it's a great system. I just wish it had been more popular maybe then it'd have more games.",4.0
"The final instalment of the series on Playstation 1 doesn't disappoint. This is a classic game, an all time great. Although not as good as it's two prequals, Res Evil 3 makes up for it with improved graphics and an amazing mercenaries game. The hard mode also offers the most difficult of challenges ever seen on the PS One. If you are a fan of the series then you MUST own this. Some gamers may feel it's too easy iof they complete the game but try it on Hard Mode and then try the mercenaries and you get all the challenge you could ever ask for. The only reason why I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is the basic fact, Res Evil 1 and 2 are both better. But don't let that stop you buying it, this is a game that offers challenge, new enemies, harder puzzles and throws further into the series' evil, intricate plot. A classic game.",4.0
"OK this game was great.  The time line is very interesting in this game cause it takes place before and into the same time period of RE2.

"this game is excillent, the graphics are top notch, the game is chalinging but not to hard, it is just a great game, why did I only give it 4 stars? because the stupid voice acting, and why do the characters always move thair hands like that, do you know anyone who waves thair hands in slashing motions while they talk. If they would stop the hand movements and tried harder on the voices, the game would be perfict! Don't let the voices discurage you from buying this game, thair is so much to this game, let me talk about replay value, almost every puzzle in the game is random, so you can't just use the same solutions every time through the game. Let me talk about the nemesis, he's a 8ft(I think) tall monster that makes frankenstein look like a whimp, with a tenticle that spews poison at you, and equipped with a cannon. He sounds dangerious, you face him more than wonce in this adventure.

"In Res Evil two, you had two discs of stuff to get done, one playing as Leon, and the other as Claire. In this one, you are Jill Valentine, and you can't really pick anyone else.
Still, the weapons in this game improved a great deal! You get the standard pistol, shotgun etc... but there are improved bullets to be made, more powerful shotguns/pistols, M-16 rifles, and so much more! Also, each time you defeat Nemesis in the hard level, he gives you a peice to a gun you won't find in the game, or something cool like that. Then there is the Mercenaries game after you beat the actual game through the first time. Mercenaries is a little bit redundant, but if you keep at it, you can buy unlimited ammo, start with automatic weapons and more! This means any gun you find in the game never runs dry, and believe me, the first time through the hard level, you're going to WANT more ammo! Besides, as you obtain more powerful weapons, you can swat Nemesis like a pesky fly with the missile launcher, mow down Zombies with the Magnum, or mass-attack with the mini gun.
The story is pretty much ""get outta Dodge"", but the added affects of meeting various survivors here and there is kind of cool (although some of the survivors are not always the good guys). Also, each time you beat the game, you get another peice of what is happening with Leon, Claire, Barry, and more!

  Still I think all Dreamcast owners should have at least one VMU and maybe some normal memory cards or an 800 block memory card. Or more VMUs if you don't care about any of the problems.",4.0

"resident evil 2 was the best game i ever played.  i didn't play it until it came to the pc.  with better graphics than the ps version i never thought it could be surpassed.  well i was proved wrong with nemesis.  the controll is excellent, the side step and push are good additions.  the graphics, although not up to par to a pc are still very good, the characters movments are much more fluid than the previous incarnations.  with the same ambient music and sound affect to set the mood, this game truely is one of the best avaiable for the play station.  the only thing that detracts from the game is the fact its too short.  i beat it in a few hours with out a walkthrough can you imagine?  cant wait for this to get ported to pc, come on capcom get a move on!!!",4.0
"Well, it really depends what games you play with the Jump pack. it barely rumbles with Soul Calibur and sonic, but you can play Tony hawk or something else. The only real rumbling i feal is when i play a game where something werid happens and it ""Jumps"" out of my hands.",4.0
"Dreamcast was a system I obtained In 2000 as a Christmas gift. I wanted a Ps2 and acted like any slightly spoiled child would when I opened it. Ten years later I still have one and enjoyed it very much. In no way am I saying that Ps2 didn't blow this console out of the water however ten years later I still play it. My first dreamcast I did absolutely no up keep to it but sadly a hazed friend of mine belly uped my first off of a counter by snagging the controller I lazily left out. Luckily I was able to replace it new for 75$.Over that ten years everything worked great on my first except for some reason Shenmue did not like to be read. I believe that meant the eye was going out or my dreamcast just did not like that particular disk(s).Some games on a disk sometimes didn't work on other dreamcasts. If that happens you need to repurchase the same game and usually the other disk would work. For some reasons some disks wouldn't work on some dreamcasts. This was/is uncommon but it happens.

My new one runs like new. Every game boots right up. The design IMO is attractive but dirties to easily. Fan power seems a little weak, but vacuuming the vents every few weeks or so really helps mine -- do at own risk. Its a little brick with a mediocre hardware system. Its easily just as loud as an xbox 360 when disks are read. Has a cd player option that is attractive when used alright sound put out. The system utilizes its 4 controller slots a lot of the time to the max. This is a fun party game system. Roommates really helped with The use of this system. Games such as: DOA,Wetrix,Le mans,Crazy taxi 1(2),Power stone 1(2),soul caliber,and many others were fun games to play with four people sometimes two right next to you.
  Other multiplayers still had home multi player but also went online. Games Like bomberman online,PsO,chu chu rocket were a hit online for a short period. Understand that this is the first system to Fully push online play -- ok people say saturn did and in fact yes their right but if anyone had played it they would probably agree with me that it was a joke. If you've never played online for dreamcast lets say Compared to Ps3, dreamcast would make you laugh. If you are younger and started next gen you may not understand why I even put up with it. Understand even when I played PsO online As slow as dial up was that I put up with it because this was a first. This was like Black ops of 2000. Online play is no longer supported through Sega on dreamcast. I believe if you are smart enough some people still play games like quake 3 online with their dreamcast,somehow.
  The Next thing that is neat about the dreamcast is their games that were individually selected for that system. Games such as D2,Project Justice,Samba de Amigo(WITH MIRACHAS),And Seaman(With Mic), give you huge bragging rights. Samba di Amigo,W/ Mirachas easily could fetch 150$.Some of these games are hard to find cheap or even at all. With the Accessories it gets even more expensive.
  Though the listed genres I put were Strong -- a lot side scrollers and 2d fighters--Rpg is where it really took a hit. Yes Skies of Arcadia was perfection,Shenmue rocked,and PsO was decent but thats about it...Sad.
  Fps were scarce too. Soldier of fortune is the only one I'd really recommend now that quake 3 isn't online.
  I love my dreamcast and play it regularly however A lot of the reason I enjoy it so much is because during my peak of gaming this is the system I had. If you missed the dreamcast growing up think twice and try it before you buy. Some of the happiest times were playing games like Nfl 2k1 when they came out or if a childhood friend came to visit. If you jump from next gen into dreamcast without experiencing it as when it was the NEW thing, your content with the console may not be as much as some reviewers will say. You kind of had to experience it IMO to fully enjoy it.",4.0

Thanks",4.0
"The Dreamcast, when it came out, was the best system available. Even today, it can still hold its own against most consoles. The problem that doomed the Dreamcast was timing.

Usually, and we see it even today, consoles come out in groups - SNES/Genesis, PlayStation/N64, the PS2/Gamecube/XBox, PS3/Wii/XBox 360. The Dreamcast came between the PS1/N64 wave and the PS2/GC/XBox wave. Casual gamers had just shelled out money for the previous generation, and the more savvy ones were saving up for the next. Developers held off making Dreamcast games, so when the next generation did come out the Dreamcast had a lack of titles and less-advanced tech, dooming it.

That said, the Dreamcast is a good console. The controllers look weird but actually sit well in the hands, and I like that the DC has four ports off the shelf. The console is also fairly compact. Plus, for its lack of titles, it had some really good ones: the original Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Skies of Arcadia and Grandia II come to mind.",4.0
"There's no greater case for questioning ""why"" and ""what if"" than the Dreamcast. Everything you can say about this system has been said 100x over. Underrated, overlooked, before it's time, revolutionary. The list goes on and on. It all adds up to fun anyway.

I'm one of those that was completely sold on the Dreamcast. I'd never been more excited about a console and never have since. This was the console that finally would give us arcade quality games in our homes. I remember when I first saw 'Ready to Rumble' up and running. I just couldn't believe how good it looked and how fun it was to play. After looking at jagged and pixelated PS1 games for so long, it was a sight for sore eyes, literally. That game alone sold me on the system.

I was crushed when I heard that Sega was pulling the plug and abandoning the Dreamcast. The best console with the best games was on the way out and it didn't seem right. It didn't make sense. It was immensely popular, had one of the best launches in console history and it's sports games were flourishing even without EA's support. It still stings the memory like your favorite team losing the championship.

But we still have our memories and even better, many of us still have our Dreamcasts. A true testament to a console and games of the past is how well they hold up today. Many times, your memory serves you better than reality. I've experienced that many times with old games I used to like. But many of these are still alot of fun. Maybe not as much as they were at first but they can still provide a good time.

Sega was in it's prime when they made games for the Dreamcast. Sonic, Crazy Taxi, House of the Dead 2, Sega Bass and Marine Fishing, Daytona USA, and Virtua Tennis are still among the best and most playable today. Other honorable mentions go to Soul Calibur, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Power Stone 2, Marvel vs Capcom 2, Jet Grind Radio, 18 Wheeler, and Silent Scope. Unfortunately, the dreamcast will never come back and Sega may never again be the giant that they once were, but you can still find  the console, the games, VMU's, fishing controller's, and light gun's to experience some of the best that gaming has to offer. Get it while the gettin's good.",4.0
Even though it didn't last long. It had great games. i will always love sega.,4.0
"The Dreamcast has(had) some of the funnest games. Powerstone 2(the greatest 4 player brawler ever. Smash Bros. Sucks), chu-chu rocket, Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Soul Caliber, and Skies of Arcadia, will always hold a place in my heart.

The greatest fault I found with the dreamcast was the inability to play the dvd-roms of the contemporary systems. The graphics easily rival the x-box and ps2, but the sheer size of the xbox and Ps2 titles simply outperformed the Dreamcast. Had Sega been patient and released an up-to-date system, maybe the Dreamcast would not have gone the way of its predicessors, the Saturn and CD.

Note: I bought a PS2, which, broke soon after purchasing. I coulda got it fixed, but I realized that it's the games, not the system which matters. I returned to playing NES, PS1, N64, and DC games. To my surprise, many of these ""old"" games are more fun and worthwhile than many of the PS2 and Xbox games I played. I guess the inferior games of every system are forgotten and only the best games are still being played.",4.0
"This was definitely a fun, great system to own.  I got mine a few months after it came out and was instantly hooked on Sonic Adventure and couldn't put it down for months.  It's just a shame the timing wasn't better (X-Box and PS2 came out later and blew Dreamcast out of the water) and more great games weren't released for it.

I recently put my Dreamcast up for sale, along with all the games and accessories and I'll definitely be sad to see it go.  I'm a poor, starving college student so I need the money.",4.0
"I just bought a Dreamcast not but a week ago for the sole purpose of playing online with Phantasy Star Online. Unfortunately connectivity stopped in 2003 according to Sega's homepage. Just a heads up for some of you that are looking to buy it with the intentions of going online with it. Other than that, I am really pleased with it.",4.0
"This is a very good gaming system. It was released by in September of 1999. I think that Sega made their point out when they installed the 56K modem with this. It's a really nice feature to have and now every modern-day system comes with a ethernet or dial-up modem port. I didn't rate this a perfect because I think that the graphics aren't that good. I really don't like how the controllers are. But I think that atleast they have disks because since NES-N64 Nintendo has been using cartridges and Sega made cartridges in the beginning but they changed to disks before the Nintendo (and atleast their disks are normal). They have some good games like Sonic which are really good games to own. Here are the technical specs of the Dreamcast.

CPU: 128-bit Hitachi SH-4 RISC processor (200MHz 360 MIPS)

Graphics: NEC CLX2 processor

RAM: 16MB, 8MB Video RAM, 2MB Sound RAM

Colors: 16.7 million

Polygons: 3 million per second

Game Media: 1.2GB GD-ROM, 12x access speed

Resolution: 640x480 pixels

Sound: Yamaha 64 channel

Operating System: Custom Windows CE with DirectX support

Modem: 56Kbps (US/JP NTSC), 33.3Kbps (PAL)

It's a really good system but I don't think you should buy it now because it's WAY to old!",4.0
"Sales of the Dreamcast went sour largely due to the number of people who wanted to get a PlayStation 2.  Sony emphasized the PlayStation 2's superior processor and memory.  However, the PlayStation 2 has approximately equal visual quality with the Dreamcast.  There are two reasons for this.  One, the architecture of the Dreamcast's hardware is better.  Two, the Dreamcast uses Windows CE for its programming platform, making programming much easier on the Dreamcast than on the PS2.  However, the PlayStation's previous success and the Sega Saturn's previous failure turned the tides in favor of Sony.

The layout and feel of Dreamcast controllers is good.  The four-button design is easy to feel around with just your thumb and all of the buttons and sensors are very responsive.  Also, Dreamcast games play will even with minor scratches.  I sometimes leave a game out of its case too long, but the Dreamcast plays on.  I have a VGA Box for the DC, which is great, though I am disappointed that more DC games aren't VGA compatible.  The crispness and clarity of the Dreamcast on a monitor combined with a game like Soul Calibur is enough to make me drool.  What really defines the system is the variety of games available, and the high quality of so many of those.  My recommendations for the Dreamcast are The Typing of the Dead, Jet Grind Radio, Grandia II, Space Channel 5, MDK 2, Maken X, Frogger 2, Samba de Amigo, Sega Bass Fishing, and Bangai-O.  These are not necessarily the best games of the DC, but rather, some of the unique ones.",4.0
"After my friend let me play the game at his house it was very, very fun.  It's very cool how your car gets damaged, but you should be able to choose a ""no damage"" option.  The grapics are great,but the Lamborghini  Diablo SV looks like a monster truck, cause of the LARGE wheels(that's the  weird part).  The cars look more realistic in NFS 3.  NFS 4 is fun to play  because of the:skid marks, dirt smoke, the look of the damaged cars, and  the variety of cars.  The cop mode is also very enjoyable.  For high speed  action, this game is for all you car lovers.",4.0

"My friend and I played this years ago. It is the most fun I have ever had on the PC. The multiplayer rocks, and the graphics were great for back then.

It's funny that I would review this now, because my computer won't even run a game this old. But, if you have an older PC, and it runs games, you need this.",4.0
"Sega's detractors still ask  ""why own a Dreamcast?They also state they're a waste of money because they failed the 128 bit system wars."" I respond by saying they are pretty inexpensive if you can find them used. I recently rebought a Sega Dreamcast, 4 controllers, 5 games and it only cost me 50$. I think that's a great deal. The Dreamcast's graphics still impress even today. Not to mention that the Dreamcast's best games are also in my opinion some of the best of all time. The Dreamcast's library consists of adventure games like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 plus fighting games like Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter 4. If you get tired of playing games for a while the Dreamcast will also play audio cds and features an internet connection.  So even though the Dreamcast didn't survive the battle of the other 128 bit systems that came after it they set the bar for them and are still worth owning in my opinion.",4.0
"The Dreamcast was (is) a good system.  t's only fault was arriving when it did--either too late or too early. It has a sleek and quasi-'futuristic' look. The controller is a bit blocky, and not as smooth as the Playstation. The memory cards are huge and 'chunky' and don't do that great of a job, at least not compared to other systems. But the most important element to a game system are the games. I've never been a huge fan of Sega games or their systems. But one thing I noticed about the Dreamcast is that the sports games they have are generally some of the better games in their genre and are quite fun. And Crazy Taxi plays well on the Dreamcast. I wouldn't recommend the Dreamcast as your first or only system (but since it is discontinued, I guess I don't have to worry about that), but if you come across one used for a reasonable deal, it does make a nice system to add to the one you already have in place.",4.0
"Contrary to polpular belief the Dreamcast's graphics are almost as good as PS2's, Gamecube's, and XBOX's. If all you want is pretty graphics invest in a good computer. In regards to other's comments about the VMU, when it's plugged into your controller it doesn't run off of the batteries and is powered by the Dreamcast. Also it has 8 megs of video memory , not 4, and it has another 16 megs of system memory. It has many great games and although it is ""dead"" it is still a great console.",4.0
"As an avid driving sim gamer, I love the NFS series.  The latest in this series, High Stakes, has great tracks, good special effects, and a killer Hot Pursuit mode that lets you chase or be chased. But, I have to say, the  cars could look better. I guess I have been spoiled by Need for Speed 3.  Don't get me wrong, any of the NFS games are better than any sim out there,  but I still find myself playing NFS3 more than this one.
As with 3, you  can download cars, or even build your own!  And a great plus about High  Stakes is that all the tracks that are in 3, are in this game.  All in all,  it's still a must have!",4.0
"For starters I'm a nintendo fan, I never thought that I would end up buying a sega system and far worse a ""dead system"", but I found out I was wrong, the dreamcast offered a whole wide range of games, and I discovered that it has the best selection of fighting 2D games (from street fighter alpha 3 to SNK2), I'm not really a next generation fighting gamer, I'm still from the old school, and I can tell you that I'm satisfied with it.",4.0
"Dreamcast is a very excellent system!  It is underrated due to the bootlegging of video games.  It many ways, it can compete with the Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube.  The negative to owning a Dreamcast is the fact that games are no longer maufactured for it.  Other than that, I would give it a 5!",4.0
"Sony's latest console certainly has the best selection of games, chief among them, Pro Evolution Soccer and The Getaway. It is, however, a tad too expensive, considering its specs.
The DC has an interesting game library. Neither the best (PS2), nor the worst.
What it does offer is awesome quality for a low price tag. The PS2 is capable of displaying 6 million polygons, the same as the DC. The PS2 has 4MB of VRAM, while the Dreamcast has 8MB of VRAM.
But the most astounding thing is that, to this day, the DC thorougly dominates two key gaming genres - racing and fighting.
Metropolis Street Racing has, overall, better graphics than GT3, and handles really well. Arcade racers abound, such as the great Tokyo Xtreme Racer series. To top it off, the DC boasts the awesome F355, possibly the most realistic car sim ever.
The DC also has what has been recognized as the best fighting game of all time - the wonderfully deep Soul Calibur. Add to this countless 2D fighting games, and other fare such as Dead or Alive 2 and Virtua Fighter 3tb, and you have happy fighting game fans.
Other areas that are very well covered by the DC are sports, with the famed Sega Sports series, and ""offbeat"" games, such as Rez, Space Channel 5 and the 3D version of Q*Bert. There are also a number of kids games, probably more so than on the PS2.
The only bad thing about the DC are a few 2nd gen games such as Test Drive 6 and Rainbow Six which hold the system back somewhat. And, needless to be said, it cannot playback your Citizen Kane DVD.
Although I'd take the PS2's controller over the DC's, the Dreamcast's joypad is certainly better than the X-Box's or that of the N64.
Another plus is you will find every one of the games for less than half their original price, given that the DC has been discontinued.
If you really want a PS2, XBox or GC, I suggest waiting until they drop their price which they most likely will. I do not think those consoles are worth that much.
In short, the Dreamcast's price to quality ratio cannot be beaten.",4.0
dreamcast is the 2nd best systom only behind xbox next is ps2. Now that dreamcast is out of buisnus games are cheap. If you want a good systom at a low price dreamcast is your answer. Such games like nfl 2k2 and the rest of the 2ks are the best games on the market,4.0
"I hooked up my Dreamcast again and I forgot how fun this was. Maybe is not as good as PS2 but if your a gamer on a budget I highly recomend it. What can you say,a system for under $100 and most games are $20 new and you can find a ton of used games for the system. If you have not bought one I would do so before they are all gone.",4.0
"Unfortunately the Dreamcast was not a big seller.  But is does pack quite a punch for its price.  For the same price as an Nintendo 64 or a Playstation, you get 3-5 times the power.  Also the Dreamcast has a 56K modem to surf the internet, a built in CD player, (unlike Nintendo 64) and stunning graphics almost as good as the Playstation 2.  Of course the Dreamcast does not do as much as the Playstation 2 or Xbox, but, it is overall a pretty good machine.  It's only con is that they just stopped making games for the Dreamcast, but they are cheap enough to pick up.  I hope this review was enough to help you in your buying decision.",4.0
"Game consoles are expensive these days.  I'm not getting an XBox because it's only available in bundles at $500.  GameCube is nice, but there arn't very many good games out for it.  I have a PlayStation2 and Game Boy Advance, and recently bought a Dreamcast.  Why do I always leave the things I really want to buy for last?
I have so many friends that think a system with fun titles can actually ""die.""  ""You still play that?  They stopped making them and don't make games for it anymore!  It's dead, it's old! It came out in 1999!"" Uh, that really wasn't that long ago.  I still want an Atari 2600, but I got a Pocket PC and a few more games at the top of my list!
The Dreamcast is possibly the best console I've had the pleasure of wasting my eye-sight on.  It's the first system to launch with a successful online plan (*** for Genesis, it tried yet nobody I know knows they really DID try).  That, and it has some of the best games available for it: Soul Reaver, MDK2, Jet Grind Radio, Crazy Taxi, many more to name.  In addition, it has the most confortable controller I've ever used (good for big or small hands).  And now that Sega is out of the hardware industry and trying to sell-out their whole Dreamcast inventory, the price for the Dreamcast has now dropped to $50.  It goes neck-to-neck with more recent consoles and it's dirt-cheap.
I honestly don't see any reason what-so-ever why you shouldn't buy Sega's final legacy.  For any holiday, if you have a nephew, son, friend, or whoever that wants to play games for at least 20 hours a week and doesn't have one yet, at $50 this is more than a real-steal.  Most of the games now are cheap (around the $10 range) and the system costs only 5 times that price.
In short, buy the Dreamcast.  Sega only stopped making them because of financial problems despite the Dreamcast's success.  A lot of good games to play on it, and gives the options of internet play or surfing the web, or even hooking the thing up to your monitor for crisper graphics.  Outstanding.  I'd give it a 5, but only if it had a built-in toaster.",4.0

Dreamcast has a very good looking disine.
A disine that would capture anyone's eye. To me the dreamcast
is flawless. It's grahpics ar simply amazing when compared to
playstation, and nintendo 64. It has four controller ports.
Wich can be very usful. And playstation 2 only has two controller
ports. Sony acually wants you to invest some more money for a
multi tab. Even after you bout a 300$ machine. Plus the dreamcast doesn't cost that much, and the games are very fun!!!! Here are my favorite games for the system and the ones i think are the funest. SONIC ADVENTURE, SONIC SHUFFLE, SONIC ADVENTURE 2
,CRAZY TAXI, CRAZY TAXI 2, FUR FIGHTERS, MSR, SEGA GT, SPEED DEVILS, NFL 2K1, WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 2K2, KAO THE KANGAROO, AND RAY MAN 2. DREAMCAST IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMING CONSOLES EVER!",4.0

"I am utterly disappointed with the over hyped and heralded PS2 console. I waited a good 2 years for it's arrival to find that no one has heart to code for it sufficiently because of the developer's kit difficulty level and unuser-friendliness.
So I decided to invest in a Dreamcast [...]. And after purchasing several games along with it (Phantasy Star Online, Sonic Adventure, Crazy Taxi 2, Quake3 Arena and more), I was most satisfied. Not only do most of these titles provide some source of online play, they are not rush jobs [...].
Despite Dreamcast units have stopped being produced, it hasn't stopped Sega's Sonic Team giving it their all in every upcoming title. This is unlike Sony with the PSOne, which has now resorted to last-minute [...] cash-ins of mundane sports sims and innumerous sequels.
Buy this console, a game or 2 from every genre that tickles your fancy and you will not be left sat in the dark in a corner punished. This console is not only the pioneer of the 128-bit console market, the companies backing it DO think of the fans [...].
I've played the Jap GameCube also, and am glad to see the wonderful Sega affiliated with Nintendo, for now the Sony PS monopoly will crumble.",4.0
"I would give it 4 1/2 but you can, cuz thats what it gets, everythings is great about it, only 2 bad thing! 1. It makes a LOUD nosie when you first turn it on 2. It loads, but it loads fast! I love this system, but I think I'll like Xbox more!",4.0
"The following is the review of the SYSTEM, not the games that can be played on it. First off, at first I thought that the controller would be pretty clunky due to its size. But in actuality, it is fairly light and fits nicely in one's hand. Bigger-handed people might have a problem, though. What I REALLY like about the controller is that ALL buttons are accessible without having to remove your hand from ANYTHING. Unlike that stupid N64 system that has buttons in the most unreachable places in the heat of battle. I didn't see the point behind the little video-game screen on the controller, though. To me, it just weighs it down more and--let's face it--why bother playing pixally games when you can play your Dreamcast? One thing that I like about Playstation is that the memory cards are inserted into the system, not the controller. Wise move. But unfortunately, Sega didn't have the foresight to do that. As for the system, it is slightly smaller than a Sony Playstation. Graphics run really well on this system and I'm surprised at what it can do. There is one thing that I have to say about the 4 Megs of Video RAM on Playstation /PS2 versus the 8 Megs of Video RAM on Dreamcast. When I watch a Final Fantasy FMV on Playstation, I know that they are pushing that system TO THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT. If Dreamcast has TWICE the Video RAM, then I expect to see something TWICE as impressive, something that is so graphically intense that it threatens to overheat the system. But sadly, I haven't seen any Dreamcast game do that. In fact, some of these games look like the regular Playstation could handle them. Overall, this is a nicely designed system, but now that Sega is putting an end to its Dreamcast games, it's not worth buying. I'd buy a Playstation 2--Metal Gear 2 is around the corner (and FF X) or maybe a Nintendo Dolphin.",4.0
"Naturally, everyone is gearing up to take part in the Dreamcast, if they haven't already.  Allow me to demonstrate to you, the reader, why you must at least try this incredible system. Rumor has it that Sega is going out of the hardware business, to hit the software business (which in truth is worth more money anyway).  So, if you have never played a Sega system, at least try the Dreamcast to see how far they've come! In comparison to the N64 and PS, the consoles in Dreamcast's generation, the newbie is obviously the bestie... but this bestness is being put to waste by a line of sorry games.  Unfortunately, the only games I've played that are worth trying are Sonic Adventure, Quake III, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and one other... um... see?  I don't even remember its name.  The release of the Bleemcast PS emulator has vastly increased Dreamcast's game listings... so it is still worth it. The graphics are well worth the trying.  One good look at Quake III will amaze you.
Naturally, I cannot do much to influence you, but you can rent one and a game at any ... for a $100-150 deposit.  Surely worth the try!",4.0
Great ;),4.0
Although the inside of the case was missing most of the plastic pieces that hold the disk in place the game plays great. I have no loading or game play issues at all. This was a great purchase and I am happy to add this game to my Tekken collection.,4.0
"I play games, simply put.  If I want to play Gran Turismo2, Metal Gear Solid or Final Fantasy 7, 8, or 9, I need a PSX.  If I want to play Phantasy Star4, I need a Sega Genesis.  But in this case, with the Dreamcast consoles' production be halted and for a rather low price (not necessarily through Amazon), it's quite a deal.
The games that I have look very good.  I have found that the Sega products tend to keep a more 'cartoony' style while the PS2 is desperately trying to get the characters to look more human.  (Well, humanoid.  Only Square can do it best...)  I don't have many and that brings up the next case.
Sega honestly doesn't have any games that I really want to play.  Even when first coming out over a year ago, there were few games that really caught my eye.  Carrier was one of them because I thought the premise was better than the Resident Evil games (which I don't care for...).  I needed a fighter and Streetfighter fulfills that.  I have DOA2 on the way, but the game that made me buy the DC was Phantasy Star On-Line.
This review is about the Dreamcast and it IS a worthy machine no matter what anybody says about it.  The problem (and why it receives 4 stars) is that the majority of games are absolute junk.  (I have specific tastes and Sega just doesn't quite cater...  BUT, that's not a bad deal!)",4.0
The gameplay are good on this game. The graphics are less blocky the they are on Tekken 2. Tekken Ball is a fun mode to play. Tekken Force and Tekken Ball offered something new to the series.,4.0
believe or not tekken 3 won't probably be available on the psn because of the copyright of one the characters called Gon because its not an original character from tekken it was meant to be a joke but it backlash on the product so hurry up and get your tekken 3 cuz its one the best fighting games on the playstation 1 and still to this day,4.0
"Tekken 3 was the best of the Tekken series until 5, so I'd say this game is basic classic Tekken greatness...  Pick it up if you love great oldschool fighting.",4.0
Okay this game is cool and has more moves and characters. It is cool becuase it has a diffrent background for each person and the graphics aren't bad either.,4.0
"Sorry Tekken fans, good graphics, cool characters, but lacking personality. Yes, I know it's stupid to take off one star for personalities, but hey, I paid for this game!!! If you liked Tekken 2 without the personalities too, I recommend buying this with Tekken 2.",4.0

"My friends and I are Tekken Fanatics.. Every since the original Tekken came out. This game has filled my head with fond memories of hauling out the furniture on the front lawn and sitting there from 12pm till well after dark with a cooler full of alcoholic beverages, and 5 of my best friends. To say this is one of the greatest games of all time would be an overstatement but, It is a great game especially for the price now. I have one thing to say 99 hit combo. After mastering this you are a Tekken master.",4.0

TEKKEN FANS WILL LOVE THIS ONE A LOT.",4.0
"Just when you think,they can't improve the great sophomore version of the Tekken series,they come out with an amazingly dramatic ""Tekken 3"".I can't really describe it in one section,so I'll just put it into a few sections:
Graphics(3.5/5):The graphics here are worthy of praise,but there's one thing that kills it:the corny little sparks that come out when you hit an opponent hard(Nina's lightning,Eddy's spark seems to be some purple light)And do the girls always have to look like (...)?.But,the characters have still improved greatly in the graphics department,escaping the dreaded pixel look it had in ""Tekken 2"".
Storyline(5.5/5):Unlike other fighting games,the Tekken series has something they don't:a great amount of depth. These storylines are so dramatic and so captivating,they are almost like a cool version of a soap opera. There are more than several great storylines,since it has been more than 20 years since the last Tekken tournament,at least in Tekken years. From Jin seeking revenge from ogre after his mother Jun died in a mysterious forest fire to Nina trying to get her memory back after being stuck in a lab for 20 years,this is one game to get for the stories.
Sound(4/5):Sure,the screams are a little annoying,but the music is great to listen to and get you riled up while you're fighting an opponent.
Gameplay(5/5):The fighting here is just right,not too difficult,yet not too easy. You'll probably find yourself picking Eddy the most,since his moves are very hard to block. And the modes are very entertaining,especially the Tekken Force Mode,where you have to get through evil Heihachi's men to get a secret character. And the Tekken Ball Mode may not be liked by many people,but is still a humorous way to get the loveable dinosaur Gon.
Characters(4/5):The characters are definitely something to love here,since every character has a different reason to win the Tekken tournament,and the game isn't so redundant. From feisty (...) sisters Nina&Anna to the evil power-hungry villain Heihachi,every character is one you love or love to hate.
Anyway,Tekken 3 is one of the few video game essentials of the '90's,and is a must-have if you want a real video game collection.",4.0
"Hello,
  I am jeremy I really like Tekken 3 cause I like fighting!!!I really like Anna cause she is a model!!!And she is fun to play whith. My friends brother has it and I played it at his house. And I also like the game Mortal Combat!!!And I love playstation. Well I gotta go.

"this gameis really pretty fun. The graphics are awsome, and gameplay is almost as good but not as great. I just bought tekken3,its really a great allaround game for playstation. Anyone who likes tekken should probably buy it at a well worth it price of about 12.00, to 20.00$.But you should probably(most likley)not expect to atomaticly be the best at this game,(i wasnt).Gameplay can be pretty tough for a beginner finished this game in about fourty minutes. You should look at my tekken4 review.i will put the#123 in my title. hope his was helpful.thanks for reading, bye.",4.0
"You can't but help love this game the game charcters, the grahpics, and mostly the endings",4.0
"Tekken 3 is awesome! New characters, new moves, new combos and some favorites as well. Along with some great extra features aside from the tournament like Force Mode, Survival and Volleyball?! Tekken 3 delivers!
This is a really good game for all gamers and it hits the essence that is 3-D fighting games. Plus new characters and new fighting styles are also pretty cool. The drawback is that the old ""button mashing"" is still a viable means of winning the fights and for a lot of the characters, some of thier combos that's all you have to do (best example: Eddy Gordo). For those of you advanced gamers, try the new and improved King, Jin and Law.
Definately check out TEKKEN 3. This one is definitely worth it for the PSone. If you're looking for other great fighting games on the PSone, check out the STREET FIGHTER ALPHA series, SOUL BLADE and DEAD OR ALIVE 2.",4.0
"This is one kick-[butt] game. I mean it. Literally. About two dozen characters, multiple difficulty levels, a couple of interesting games, this is one super-cool game.
The graphics are great and the fight moves flow so prettily it's almost scary. The characters are all interesting to use, at the very least, and there's something for everyone from an enormous, slow-moving bear to the lightning-quick but tiny Xiou Yu.
My only beef is with the Tekken Ball stage and the side-stepping. Tekken Ball is just silly. It does nothing for your characters, it's decidedly simple, it's . . . well, it's a little kid's game stuck in the middle of a rather bloody 3D fighter. It just doesn't seem to fit with everything else.
The side-stepping is almost ludicrously difficult. You have to tap the controller so lightly that taking a few simple steps to the side becomes impossible. I realize that, logistically, it would be difficult to find another way, but it does hamper your stride, particularly in the Tekken Force stage.
A great game, though.",4.0
"This game is a good game. It has people, monsters, robots and animals. It has great effects. It is  fighting game. It is a game that has 10 stages.  The best part of the game is the fighting. Tekken3 is so cool game.",4.0
One of the classics!,4.0
"I read a lot of reviews on this game before buying it, so maybe my expectations were a little high.  The graphics here are really not that different in quality from X-Men MA2 (actually, the backgrounds in X-Men are more dynamic).  The fighting is good here though, and the characters really do have distinct fighting styles that give you quite the challenge in Arcade mode. They also tend to defend themselves more here, so your every kick or punch won't connect like you want it to.  If you're buying for a good fighting game, then you shouldn't be disappointed...but if you're buying expecting graphics that are unlike anything you've ever seen before, you may be.",4.0
"Gauntlet Legends is a mindless hack, slash, burn, and blast game. There is nothing wrong with aimlessly wandering about creepy dungeons, mashing buttons, and mowing down bad guys. It's especially fun with companions. This game is a classic. I enjoy the graphics, the audio effects, the characters, the different environments, and seemingly endless procession of monsters in this game. Finding all the switches one needs to progress is sometimes tiresome. The game's storyline is linear, but that's okay. Sometimes a formulaic approach is just what the doctor ordered!",4.0
"Let's be fair. This game is pretty short and I'd imagine that playing it solo would be a total grindfest. That said, playing co-op is enormously fun and the structure is very flexible. Players can be added or removed from play without resetting the game or system, allowing people to jump in whenever they're ready and drop out if they want to without disturbing everyone else's good time. Gameplay is extremely simple, but the levels are somewhat labyrinthine. No vicinity map or level map is provided, only a compass. Personally, I'm a terrible mental mapper and would be completely lost if I tried to play this game by myself. The narrator's announcements are the best part, by far - RED WARRIOR IS ABOUT TO DIE! We can't even understand what he's saying half of the time, but he's just so hilariously dramatic.",4.0
"I bought this game in hopes of experiencing that arcade feel, not that this wasn't a fun game its just that it wasn't as exciting as the arcade version. If your looking for a semi-entertaining game with wizards , and knights then i recommend this game but if if its for that old arcade feel i don't recommend.",4.0
"""Gauntlet Legends"" is a simple yet surprisingly entertaining game geared more towards teens. Based off of the original Midway classic ""Gauntlet"", originally an arcade game that came to the NES, ""Gauntlet Legends"" is still the same smash-em-up type of entertainment, but drastically improved.

COMPARISON
In the original, the player would have limited choice in his character, and would always start on the first level. Every level was basically the same, kill as many enemies as you can, while moving through levels that soon begin repeating themselves. However, in Legends, it behaves as an RPG, and is based more on a system of levels and bosses. The player may not only choose his character freely, but also his color and outfit. The levels still have that basic ""kill everything"" mentality, but it seems to have a little more purpose and focus, and it is better disguised. Each level gets progressively more difficult, but you can go to each one at almost any time. You don't even have to complete the first world to progress to the second!

THE GAME ITSELF
The fun mainly comes from using your character, choices are warrior (strong hand-to-hand), wizard (strong magic), elf (fast), and valkyrie (balance, armor), and going throughout the levels destroying everything. Various objectives and items improve fun and replayability. Each character has four outfits (colors) to choose from, and they each have a set of specials tailored to them and to certain situations. For instance, the wizards medium special is perfect for bosses, and his strong special is good for a line of enemies. It's a lot of fun to bash those baddies over and over, and the levels you have already completed will become more difficult as your level increases!

CAUTIONS
As fun a game as this is, there are a couple things of which to be cautious. The storyline is based on the idea of going through the levels and eventually defeating a large demon named Skorne. This, along with the undead enemies you fight, the wizards and magic, and small (poorly animated, barely seen) poofs of enemy blood, could pose objection for a variety of reasons. What concerns me most is the atire of most of the female characters. Most are very revealing, and one of the unlockables (the falcon) could hardly be said to be wearing anything. These female characters can be avoided for the most part; warriors and wizards are all male, and if you choose an elf or a valkyrie, which are all female, the yellow are a lot better than the blue, red, or green, and don't aquire the falcon. Overall, this game is not for younger players. Ages 13+ should be fine, as long as they stay away from the non-yellow female characters.

OVERALL
""Gauntlet Legends"" is a load of fun. If you need a release for all that tension, grab your level 50 warrior and smash some orcs. A plethora of items allow free use of things like fire breath or amulets that increase attack strength. These definately increase the fun. Skorne's levels are the best, as they are chocked full of your character's soon-to-be victims. Big fun if you like big bangs or causing lots of destruction.",4.0

I hoped  you like the fantastic Tekken Three",4.0
"The Tekken catagory of games (3D style) came about on its own and took the gaming world by storm. Tekken 3 is just another step up the ladder of success for the Tekken series. This game has ""Tekken Ball"" where you play volleyball, it has numerous hidden characters, and it will definitely keep you playing for hours so you can see your move over and over again in instant replay.",4.0
"The Dreamcast is the next generation of gaming machine from Sega, most well known for its Sonic the Hedgehog games. With Dreamcast, Sega moves beyond Sonic into a heavily graphic and net-savvy arcade machine.
Probably the biggest difference between the Dreamcast and its competitors is the built in 56k modem. This allows Dreamcast owners to log on to the net, surf the web, and fight other opponents head to head. This opens up a HUGE opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers. The web surfing ability only sweetens the deal, although like WebTV, there is no ability to download.
It's not for free - ... - but for a household that is currently not on the Internet, the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay. You also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web work.
Like the Sony Playstation, the Dreamcast will play audio CDs. Unlike the Playstation 2, it will not play DVDs, however. Also, while the Playstation 2 can play all Playstation games (since both are CD based) the Sega Dreamcast cannot play older Sega games.
Popular Sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games - Rayman 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3. The incredibly high polygon draw rate (three million polygons per second) means that these games fly, giving great gameplay.
Even though this is equipped with a 12x CD player, it's still slower than a cartridge system like the N64. On the up-side, CDs are cheaper than cartridges, and can hold a lot more information on them, leading to more involved games.
I'm personally not a huge Dreamcast fan - the types of games available on it aren't ones that tend to appeal to me - but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great deal.
Specifications: CPU: 128-bit RISC Clock Speed: 200 MHz  Sound: CD quality, 64 voices Connector: standard 3-plug video/audio connector 1600 x 1200 resolution",4.0
This game is awesome.  The controls are pretty easy to learn and the game play is slow enough to let you focus but its fast enough to keep you concentrated.  Also the enemies and power-ups are really cool.  The bosses are neat too all having their own special attacks.  You can find certain items in the levels that will help you beat the bosses a lot more quickly. Believe me I tried to beat the bosses without certain things you pick up in the levels in nooks and crannies(example:the ice ax of Untar)and it was alot harder! I would have had to be at least at level 30 to just be able to contend with the first boss.  The level growing also makes it fun.  Finding the powerups and using them is cool too.  Good luck!!!,4.0
"Okay, so Gauntlet Legends has awful sound, gameplay, and graphics. So parts of the game can become irritating, aggravating, and repetitive. (well, the whole game is pretty repetitive) One thing you MUST know about Gauntlet Legends is that you MUST play with more than one person. Preferably, you play with four. It rocks as a multiplayer game. There is nothing like getting with three of your friends and just wandering around killing everything. There is something oddly satisfying about running around tapping buttons so you get blisters on your thumb. If you find yourself thinking this game is not very good, it is because you are probably playing one player. Some other cool parts about the game is that you don't have to start a brand new character if you invite a friend to play it with. The character creation is so simple that you can fool it into duplicating one character into four with different names and types. The stats will stay the same, unfortunatly. Almost everyone who plays this game will either love it or hate it. I found that most people will play it and enjoy it whatever they said about how much they hate it. This game is a good edition to anyone's collection as an arcade game, a multiplayer game, a button-mashing action game, or simply as a game for letting off some steam.",4.0
"A follow up to what was probably the best fighting game on the market for the time, Tekken 2, this game doesn't let you down.
The storyline is incidental but for interest, after the last tournament, Heihachi is back having defeated his son Kazuya in Tekken 2. He then throws him into the  same ravine that Kazuya threw him in after Tekken
1. However, Jun Kazama  (from Tekken 2) and Kazuya have gone on to have a son Jin (don't ask me  how) and then Heihachi's company has unearthed some powerful force which  goes on to kill Jun. It doesn't really make a great deal of sense but it is  an excuse for another tournament.
Some of the characters are sons or  daughters of the original 2 Tekken's (ie:they're more or less the same)  though Paul is back (and looking older) and for some reason Nina has been  in cryogenic stasis for 20 years (which doesn't explain why her sister Anna  hasn't aged though). There are some new characters with distinctly new  fighting styles, other new characters have similar fighting styles to  characters they replaced in Tekken 2.
The graphics are excellent and are  very close to the arcade version. There is also the added bonuses of having  a number of different game modes and also when you complete the game, this  releases an animated movie sequence for that character, as well as a new  character you can use.
A few characters are released by different means.  Doctor Boskonovich (who rebuilt Yoshimitsu) can be accessed if you complete  the Tekken Force option 3 times. It is worth the effort both because Tekken  Force is practically a game in its own right, where you fight armies of  henchmen and an end stage boss (one of the other characters), all against a  fast disappearing time limit. Also, Doctor Boskonovich has a fighting style  quite unlike any of the other characters available to use, so he is worth  getting. The Tekken Force option definitely helps extend the life of the  game with the player instead of if this had just been another Tekken  retread.
Also, something you might miss is that after enough characters  have been released, pressing the Start button on Eddy will allow you access  to the character Tiger (which is more or less still Eddy but has his own  animation).
All up I think there are 22 characters. You get Gon when,  after releasing enough characters you get and win the Tekken Ball mode.
A  few drawbacks, one is that to get most of the hidden characters, you have  to just keep playing and winning the game which despite the excellence of  the game, does eventually start to get a little boring. Especially since  this is what you had to do in Tekken 2 and the games aren't radically  different. As a result, I found myself losing interest sooner than with  Tekken 2. I think it would be worthwhile for a different approach with the  next Tekken where distinctly different things have to be done for accessing  each new character than just finishing the game over and over.  Also,  essentially the game is still 2-D in the sense that the characters still  fight in a line, apart from now being able to side-step (which you couldn't  do in Tekken 2) which has mixed results in evading attacks. It will be  interesting to see if the series will move to true 3-D arena fighting like  Ehrgeiz or Tobal for example.
Another small gripe is that the version  I've played in Australia, after the Ogre is defeated, the animation showing  the transformation into the True Ogre seems to have been edited, it simply  shows the Ogre raising Heihachi into the air, the screen going white and  then the next fight starts. I'm sure I'm not imagining this, I could swear  I remember in the arcade that the Ogre actually goes on to  ""consume"" Heihachi's body and turn into The True Ogre. Why it  would be cut at that point is beyond me, it was not a graphic scene at all  anyway, more bright lights, electricity and metamorphising than anything  else.
However though, Tekken and Tekken 2 were the sole reasons I bought  a Playstation in the first place and the only games I have. Tekken 3 hasn't  disappointed as a follow up and there's enough new stuff in the options,  characters and animations to make it worthwhile, even if you've finished  the arcade game.",4.0

There are quite a few other great games available as well and more soon to come (Jet Set Radio and Metropolitan Street Racer look awesome).  The DC has a lot of fun games and although I've never tried it, most reviewers say that the Internet play is virtually flawless.  I'm a pretty big gamer, so I'll also be buying the PS2 later this month.  If you can't buy both the DC and PS2, you should probably wait for the PS2 (I heard they lowered the price ...).  I think the PS2 will be a better system in the long run.  However, you can't go wrong with a DC.  It's a good value ... and has plenty of great games.  If you really like arcade style games with fast gameplay, the DC is the perfect system for you because it has a lot of great arcade ports.  RPG fans should definitely hold off for the PS2.  My only complaint about the system is the controller.  I don't like the placement of the start button and the whole shape of the controller seems to cramp my hands.  I would have preferred a smaller more practical controller like the PS2 and Gamecube are opting for.  All in all, the Dreamcast is definitely a solid system and won't disappoint.",4.0

I believe I got to the last boss once but got demolished so gave up and deleted my file.  That was some years ago.  I have the PS2 version too.  Think I had the same issue but actually did better.

"All gamers have had the experence of playing a game (be it an RPG or anything else) they felt had its fair share of flaws, but has that one, very bright redeeming quality that makes all those flaws take a backseat to that one positive.

Star Ocean: The Second Story is one of those games. Star Ocean's appeal (at least in my case) can be summed up in a single word: combat. Star Ocean's combat system is probably the game's most notable feature. The real-time battle system, which has a very arcade-like feel to it, is a very enjoyable change than your standard-fair RPG battles. It's just so much fun to destory enemies with a volley a special attacks from you and your allies. The skill system is also a plus as well, increasing characters stats and developing other usefull, non combat skills.

Unfortunately, the rest of Star Ocean's elements aren't quite up to par when compared to the hustle and bustle of battle. Graphically, Star Ocean is behind the times no matter where you turn (excluding the FMV's). Actually, the game's graphic engine is very simular to a 1998 Square-Enix title, the often overlooked and bashed-to-no-end SaGa Frontier (one of my favorites - yes, I'm serious). The fact the game uses most of the same graphical tricks empolyed by a game two years earlier underlines this fact.

Storywise, Star Ocean 2 suffers another, slightly smaller blow. While the story is generally good, it seems to drag on until you reach the second disc, where you do more exploring and fighting and the story begins to unfold more. Characters aren't as developed as well in Star Ocean compared to other RPG's such as Final Fantasy or Wild Arms, though the game tries to make a very obvious effort to do this though the use of the private actions system (where you enter a location and your characters split up and you can talk to them on a one-on-one basis to discover more about them - this affects the outcome of the game in various ways). I will give the developers credit for trying though.

Musically, Star Ocean 2 has it's ups and downs. Some of the tunes can be quite annoying, but no game score is without it's duds. However, when you hear the battle themes played near the end of the game for the final bosses, which mainly are of heavy rock/metal variety, all is foregiven. Soundwise, the characters various soundbites during battle are cute at first, but become annoying really quickly (how many times can you remember Claude saying ""that's around 50 points"" after a battle - too many to admit when I'm sober).

Even with it's flaws, Star Ocean: The Second Story is an above average RPG. While I'm not sure if I would call it a ""classic"",  I would recommend it to anyone who had the time or showed interest in the genre.",4.0
I love this game because of its great battle system and the characters you lern to love! I beat this game twice once with Claud and Once with Rena. Rena is a far better choose since u get Diaz. But the best charocter is Ashton. The story is sort of slow at first but once you get into things you should love it to.  I am waiting for number 3 to come out and i just hope it's just as good as this one and i don't want to be disapointed.,4.0
"I've been an RPG fan for longer than I can remember, and have played around 70 of em.

Hell, sure the story wasn't to die for,but beautiful music,acool combat system, and tons of replay value make this one that every fan of the genre should own.",4.0
"Virtua Fighter may have a hard time competing with games such as DOA2, or tekken tag, but believe me this was what paved the way for those games.  All though it lacks where the others seem to excell with story modes and hidden characters, virtua fighter makes up with character variety and a great display of styles (drunken style, mantis, sumo, etc.).  I was shocked at how fun this game was even after playing more modern games.  Even with new games on the market, I think i'll be playing this one for a while.  The teacher of fighting games.",4.0
"Words cannot describe.
You need to feel this game. Cringe as Pai floors  you with a double toe kick and mercilessly follows up with a jumping knee  to the midriff. Cheer as you fight back with a spinning kick as you get up.  You nimbly dodge the next kick and fire off a triple punch combo, finishing  with a powerful backhanded punch to win the round. Watch it on the replay,  go on. Laugh at Shun's ever-increasing drunkenness. Memorise that sweep  kick movement. Gape as you realise fighting games do not have to feature  blazing blue fireballs and Super Hyper Alpha Combo Breaking Double EX  Special Level Three moves. Instead, here's a fighting game where the  feature is actual fighting! Crikey!
So, why only 4?
Get to about...  oooh... Level 7. Battle relentlessly until both characters are nearing the  end of their tether. Open your attack and watch as the opposition stops it  and fires one back, knocking you out. Pound your controller through the  floor while screaming ""BUT-I-PUSHED-PUNCH-THEN!""
Recover from  that bout of frustration, continue the game and realise that when you're  not frustrated you're having incredible fun. Read this review. Go to the  store. Buy the game. Do it now.",4.0
The dream cast equipment was much better than the knockoff's.  There are fewer problems and it lasts foever. I purchased a madcats version in 1996 and it died after only about a year; The Dreamcast F.Controler I purchased new in 1998 is still going strong today(2008),4.0
"After playing through this game, I've concluded there are really three games going on here: 1) the 3D action stages, 2) a puzzle game mostly between those stages, and 3) sub-games consisting of riding vehicles like airplanes, go-carts, etc. The action stages are terrific, while the sub-games seem lazily designed and largely forgettable (except the Snowboard) and the puzzle sections are more infuriating than fun and break up the action. Thank God for online walkthroughs, since it can take some time figuring the pointless tasks. These puzzles required to solve were a new element to the sonic system and in my opinion unnecessary and bring down the game. I don't think anyone is playing this game for the puzzles; just have to wade through them to be rewarded with an action stage, which are genuinely awesome. Thankfully, the game became more action oriented the it progressed. The action stages are well designed and still have the speed and aggressiveness of the the original games, only now in 3D. Thankfully, you when running out of lives, you can simply continue at the beginning of the stage instead of being thrown back all the way to the start of the game. Action stages somewhat on the easy side, which is OK, gives a more pleasant time and since most games make things too hard. Some people complain about camera issues, but I was not bothered by the camera, plus you can control the camera with L R buttons and the D-pad. The graphics were impressive and beautiful. The music is lame and forgettable, consisting of cheesy glam-metal goop, and is largely overdone, which is strange since the previous sonic games had such great music, but this did not ruin the game. Sonic Adventure only got better toward toward the end and basically delivered.",4.0
"Sonic Adventure is a phenomenal game on Dreamcast but it's not all Sunshine and Lollipops and this is due to three flaws:
1. The camera system is iffy
2. Big the Cat's fishing stages
3. NO WAY TO SKIP CUTSCENES",4.0
Voice acting is cringy. But overall good gameplay.,4.0

"This is a must own for Dreamcast owners and Sonic fans.  There are six major campaigns, Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big the Cat, and Gamma.  Each have their own style of gameplay and each campaign adds to the story.  When you beat al six campaigns, a seventh and final campaign allows you to play as Super Sonic to conclude the story.

Now there are a few flaws.  Sometimes the control in the game is pretty bad and the camera doesn't always go where you want it to go.  My least favorite campaign is Big the Cat's because it focuses less on action and focuses on fishing.

But it's still a fun game and I can still play it.",4.0
"I never actually played the original Sonic Adventure until I was in my mid-late teens (this game came out when I was 4 or 5). I grew up on SADX on the gamecube. The game is almost exactly the same, but the different, more vivid textures make it seem like a more realistic environment while also giving it a sense of older fashion-sense days.

I'll skip the gameplay, since it's a very basic Sonic gameplay most people in the mid-Sonic times are familiar with. I'll definitely say it's a bit more slippery and bouncy, though, but that was probably to show off the major advantage the DreamCast had over the original PlayStation or the N64.

The chao garden in this game is easily the most far removed from the other 3 versions (in SA2, SA2B, and SADX). The others have cute, snuggly, happy chao whose lives are only miserable if your torture them. You know what you're doing with your chao and accidents are rare. Not the case in this game. Every chao is born as an adult, and will very quickly kill itself if you don't do something soon. Their movements, like most of the game, are very bouncy. I dare say this is the bounciest thing in any major-release game I've ever seen, actually. It's almost a high-speed environment with a visible difficulty level.

If you're looking for a sentimental chao garden, this better be your last buy. If you're only after something nostalgic or want to collect for SEGA fandom's sake, this is one you absolutely can't leave out.

I'd also like to mention that when this game was released, I didn't know about it until about 5 years later. At the time, I was into Sonic and Pokemon (when Kanto was the only region!), for the most part, and I thought the new art style was as cool as anything could ever be. I didn't recognize Knuckles, though, because I'd only ever seen AoStH and a few Sonic products in stores (such as spaghetti-os). I literally thought Knuckles was an enhanced-awesomeness version of Tails, since he was the only character on the can with Sonic. I completely forgot about that feeling until this showed up in the mail after I ordered it. The box art is just so much more detailed than any other Sonic game's that I can think of (regarding resolution, at least).

If you're just breezing through and want a Sonic game with good music or gameplay, this won't be close to the bottom of your list, but not the top, either. This is a casual buy if you're not collecting or shooting for nostalgia.",4.0

"Sonic Adventure is one of the most important game's of Sonic's History, being it was the first 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game.
If you recall on the Sega Saturn-
Sonic Xtreme was going to be 3D, but it was cancelled.
Sonic 3D Blast was isometric, not 3D.
Sonic R was 3D, but it was a racing game.
Sonic World was 3D, but it was in Sonic Jam.
Sonic Jame was a compilation of the first 4 sonic games.

The Hub Worlds are amazing, and so are the action fields.
It makes sense to have you complete all the stories to get the final story, It was repeated for a few until 2006. We ALL know what happened then.
The Camera, oh God the camera, I have SO MANY TIMES due to the camera, which is why my rating is 4 stars.",4.0
This is sonic adventure for the dreamcast!! Long story short... Very good game if you get past slippery controls! I recommend this highly! Check out my youtube at [...],4.0
"Sonic Adventure took Sonic to an amazing level, and it only took 5 years of Sega Saturn failures. The first thing Sonic does is fight a monster called ""Chaos"". After beating Chaos, the camera turns to Eggman, who ominously tells himself Sonic has no idea what he is up against... the perfect start to the game. Sonic then goes off to rescue Tails from a plane crash, starting the first level. Emerald Coast was a beautifully rendered beach with a beautiful theme and HUGE 3D ACTION! The camera shifts and Sonic is suddenly is being chased by a giant whale! After that he runs through a tight cave... and then finally rescues Tails! After a happy reunion, Eggman steals Tail's Chaos Emerald and feeds it to... Chaos the monster. Congratulations, you can now play as Tails! He can fly! His levels involve racing Sonic and Eggman (Just like in Sonic R!), and thats about it. The best thing about Tails was his inspirational motto, ""I want to fly high! I shall belive in myself!"". After Tails was Knuckles, who had a totally different story. One night he was rethinking his life and why exactly he was guarding the Master Emerald, when somebody steals the Master Emerald (way to go, Knucklehead)! His levels are composed of finding the Master Emerald pieces. Knuckles wasn't nearly as good as Tails. After Knuckles comes Amy Rose, Sonic's... girlfriend. Her levels focused on platforming while avoiding a robot that decided to chase her. Maybe a 6 year old girl would find Amy and her obnoxious theme song cool, but the teenage nerd reviewing this finds Amy very annoying. Big was next... and Sega really should avoided this idea while in development. Big is a BIG ""cat"", according to the Sonic Team. He really looked like a purple bunny-bear creature. His whole goal was to find his pet frog... Froggy (what a clever name!). It was torture watching him trudge to some water in the great zones Sonic and Tails enjoyed. Twinkle Park was only a lake for Big. For Sonic it was a bumper car ride followed by intense platforming, and the great voices Sonic, Tails, Amy, E-102 Gamma, and Eggman made Big even worse. In a dumb voice Big constantly shouts ""FROGGY! WHERE ARE YA!?"".
Thankfully, E102 Gamma came after Big. Gamma is a robot built by Eggman. You start out following Eggman's orders: Shoot the Sonic Doll, shoot the real Sonic, lock Amy in jail. After that, Gamma accidently sees Eggman torturing his robot rival, Beta, and starts to wonder if he should follow Eggman's rules. Like every good robot character, Gamma decides to betray Eggman and find his true destiny...
*SPOILER!*

Which, sadly, is exploding while sad music plays.

*SPOILER OVER*

Update (10/19/12): Okay, I am almost through with this game and feel like throwing up. The end is VERY intense, with the Final Egg level almost being impossible due to collision issues and camera bugs, but I got through it. Chaos actually succeeds and completely destroys the city (which is only made worse by the Dreamcast / Gamecube's jaw-dropping graphics), and the song that plays (Open Your Heart) really makes me sick. Awesome.",4.0
"Sonic Adventure was the start of Sonic's 'Modern' appearence, its an excellent game, and the storyline will send shivers of joy down your back, it was also the first game to allow you to raise Chao!, its really cool, also try the sequel (sonic Adventure 2) its got an even better storyline and is the first appearence of Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the bat",4.0
"Darkstone is indeed a fine RPG game.  Sadly, it was released with numerous bugs, only some of which are corrected by the game patch.
I share most of the opinions of those who have extolled it virtues, and shall not repeat  them.  Instead I wish to point out two of the game's most irksome  shortcomings.
While it is nice to have the second character there to  resurrect you, I have found that character #2 is much more proficient at  getting himself killed.  The AI controlling #2's actions is not the best.  I recommend using #2 for his native skills and as a pack animal  only.
Also, the default graphical cursor is slow and laggy, making melee  with a dozen or so critters very difficult.  The game comes with the option  of switching to a hardware-controlled cursor, but this option does not work  with all video cards.
In spite of all that, I have played through  Darkstone many times already.  The most fun I've had is picking the pockets  of the dungeon creatures with my thief.",4.0
"Sonic Adventure is an instant Dreamcast classic that shouldn't be missed by any Dreamcast owner.  The game features Sonic in full 3d with newly detailed level enviroment.  This was one of the first games to launch with the Dreamcast and is still one of my favorite Dreamcast game.  The game features a brand new system called the ""Chao system"" you basicly take care of them and show them new moves it's very simple but you'll need to have a VMU card to do it.  The game features more then 5 playable characters.  The story in the game is very lame if you ask me they could have done better, not to mention the english dubbing is terrible so just stick to japanes language and english subtitles.

I'll make this short and sweet for you.  Sonic Adventure is the best sonic game ever and has great levels, awesome 3d levels and lots of things to do but personally I wanted to beat the storyline instead of that whole chaos thing.  I'm going to make this review short and sweet...

Good

-Great Level desighn

-awesome 3d graphics of Sonic for the Dreamcast

-Lots of playable characters which is really great

-the new Chaos growing process, but I really didn't do it I just play the storyline..

-Superb fast pace action

Bad

-horrindess english dubbing

-the cutscenes look horrible even the ingameplay is better then the cutscenes

-Some really bad camera angles ruin the fast pace of this game

-I kind of wished it was a SONIC ONLY adventure...but ohwell

The ugly

-Robotnick..ehehheh

Overall Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast is an instant classic packed with full 3d enviroment and Full 3d character model and fast paced action with some really great music.  Some things like camera angles ruin this game and some really bad english dubbing makes it even worse!  But overall this game doesn't dissapoint Sonic fans and that is why I'm giving it a

4.2 out 5.

This is still in my opinion the best Sonic Game ever but it was ruined by some flaws...Great game overall though..

Lates",4.0
"Nice speed and gameplay overall.  The only 2 cons are the camera angles and some of the enviroments aren't fully interactive.  You can't enter all the buildings with each character.  Even with that though it's a great game and some levels are extremely well matched with the background music ""red hot mountain"". I played this game for nearly three hours before realizing how long I'd been on it.  Deffinetly worth the time and money to pick this one up.",4.0
"I'm not a big fan of the Diablo/D&D typr game but this game is really neat. The one big advantage of this game over Diablo is the ability to control 2 characters in one game. Very high replay value also makes this game a winner. Pick up a copy if you can; I've seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store. For the price, you can't go wrong.",4.0
"Now that I've gone back and started replaying Diablo, I realize how spoiled I've become playing Darkstone. Major improvements were made the the Diablo engine by GOD when they put this game out, and Diablo actually feels somewhat kludgy in comparison. Ability to change camera angle, the Previously Visited Places menu, that sort of thing. GOD/Take 2 did a good job with the patches, as well, not only fixing some D3D problems in the original version but adding playability as well. A fine product overall that's still got me banging away at monsters after months of single-minded playing.",4.0
"It's interesting to note, now that Diablo II has come out, how many of the improvements Darkstone incorporated into the Diablo play model are now found in Diablo II. Darkstone has a ""previously visited  locations"" menu that allows you to reduce the tedium of having to  navigate a lot of area you've cleaned out already; Diablo II has  ""waypoints"". Darkstone had extra skills which you could customize  classes with, as does Diablo II. Darkstone had a populated wilderness area,  as does Diablo II.
Darkstone gives you two characters, one of which will  contribute to battles when you're controlling the other, it can be a fun  game for a younger child (who wouldn't be able to play Diablo). Even if he  can't click fast enough to kill the monsters, he'll have backup. Also, the  shops use pictures of items, which means a child who can't read or is just  learning can still play, if he knows his numbers. The game generally seems  less spooky and bloody.
With all due respect to T. Byrl, the voice  acting is a bit strained, though not the worst we've heard.
The quests  pile up a lot more quickly than in Diablo, as well. It's difficult to get  through the first two villages without being accosted by half-a-dozen  villagers needing tasks performed. That keeps things moving  along.
Overall, the game seems a =lot= easier than Diablo. Spells cost  less, gold is more plentiful, magical items easier to come by, resurrection  spells allow one surviving character to bring bacak one that just died,  etc. etc. etc. And you have to worry less about moving in combat rather  than attacking, as would happen in Diablo quite a bit.
But the combat's a  bit mushy relative to Diablo--a little too automatic feeling, perhaps,  which is the only thing that keeps me from giving it the five stars. I  killed the first ""boss"", losing one of my own characters, before  I knew what happened. But then I could just resurrect him.
Overall, a  worthwhile contribution to the genre.",4.0
"Look, Darkstone is to Diablo what Hexen was to Doom.  Or what Warcraft is to Command and Conquer. They share a lot of the same commands, and a good bit of the gameplay is the same.  So if you're going to sit there and fault  one game for following in the design footsteps of another, we're going to  be here all day.
I recently purchased Darkstone for just twenty bucks.  Twenty bucks!  Too often I've spent twice as much and didn't receive half  as much fun as Darkstone deliveres.
It boils down to this:  If you  already own Diablo and it satifies your need for hack and slash adventure,  then by all means save your money.  But if you're looking for a variation  on a theme (and I think the 3D effects add a good bit to the gameplay), and  you're looking for a new quality game at a budget price, then Darkstone is  a great choice.",4.0
"Not perfect by any means, but it has addicted me. Graphics are OK. Voice-overs are not the kind Blizzard has made us come to expect. Not the best story. But I am enjoying it- and for thirty bucks that says a lot.
True, they also won't win any points for originality... all though there  are a number of game play innovations that I hope the staff at Diablo II  won't ignore(upgrading weapons, skills, better mapping, running, and that  feature that autopilots you to certain places you've been before). Single  player was fun- featuring the ability to use two characters, but as with  almost games I play nowadays- multiplayer is what I care about. And with  two good friends- We had quite a blast romping through the dungeons at  Heat.net, all though its difficult to get a game going there as it hasn't  achieved a high level of popularity. What made it even better was that the  three of us were using Roger Wilco to communicate. It felt like we were in  our High school Dungeons and Dragons days even though we were in different  states.
Well until Diablo II comes out (as many have said) you could do a  lot worse than this game.",4.0
"When it came out, this game was HUGELY anticipated. After all, the Sonic the Hedgehog series is one of the most popular in videogame history. Was it worth the wait? Was it worth the hype? Is it worth picking up even now?
The transition from 2D to 3D has been much discussed in the past, and you can see why. What works great in 2D doesn't always translate so well into the 3D world. And when a series makes this sometimes awkward transition there are usually a few hiccups.
Sonic Adventure attempts to use level design that gives you the speed of the original games, while also featuring puzzle solving and rpg/adventure elements (talk to people, play mini-games, open doors, ect.). By featuring several different characters for you to play as, the game allows you to play a balanced game (sonic), blast through stages with nothing slowing you down (tails), run away like a chicken (amy), shoot everythign in sight (the robot), go on a treasure hunt (knuckles), or spend all your time fishing(?) (big the cat). Each of these elements is entertaining in its own right, but where the game really shines is the action scenes as sonic and tails. The adventure portion of this game suffers from the same flaw as many rpgs (namely, you can't find the stupid key to open the door). So the first time through you may hit a few snags. And the some of the more adventure/platformer elements can get VERY frustrating (I hate the platforming section of the snow level and the skydeck level in particular). And of course, the collision detection, polygon clipping, and camera problems are pretty darn buggy.
Still, you've got to love this game. The graphics are great, some of the levels (the first level, windy valley, and speed highway especially) are just plain awesome. Everyone should at the very least play this game, and true videogames fans should own it. It has flaws that can't be ignored, but there are enough moments of greatness (how about the part in the temple where you see the stone carving of chaos destroying the world?!) to more than make up for it. Definitely check it out.",4.0
"Whoa! I have never seen such a fast-paced game like this one! After playing the demo on the Sega Dreamcast generator disk I decided to try to find this and after playing for about 3 hours I was definently satisfied with it. Being a long time fan of Sonic (Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, and 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Sonic 3-D Blast) I was looking forward to this Dreamcast title. The graphics are absolutely amazing, the music is great and the action is fast, furious and entertaining. However, I have to deduct a star for the occasional camera angle which somtimes interfered with gameplay. Besides that, this game is a keeper for all Dreamcast owners. Get this along with it's awesome sequel Sonic Adventure 2 ASAP!",4.0
"Excellent ATC interaction, weather generation, and all-around realism.  Would hope for more detailed and interactive instrumentation on secondary aircraft in future versions  (such as interactive instrumentation available  on the Beechjet.)

"Flight Unlimited 3 is a good flight simulation game. the planes flew better than i thought i even think better than FS2000. There where not that many airports avaliable though, and also not that much scenery. So for  people that are really just wanna fly I recommend you buy this product.",4.0
"""Sonic Adventure"" starts off easily, and it's easy to get the hang of.  However, it may be a little too easy.  There is a lack of puzzles, and the bosses are pretty simple.  I guess I'm the person that likes RPG's like Zelda and Grandia II.  The story is ho-hum, but once you get into it, the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with.  That's the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two.  Also, the graphics and sound are good.  My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking, their mouths speak Japanese, but they speak in English.  (That is if you have the language set on English.)  I'm not sure of this, but I AM sure that their oral movements definately aren't matching what they say.  Overall, it's worth the price.",4.0

"Sonic is back folks and better than ever. Sonic Adventure is fast paced, good time gaming. Controls are easy to use, graphics are pretty good, and there are many characters to choose from, but you have to find them. The voice overs are really bad because their mouth moves at a different time then when they actually speak. There are many levels to go through, and each level has three levels to beat it with, A, B, and C. Overall it's a good game, but once you beat it with everyone, you don't really want to go back. There's no replay value in this game, but it's good until you beat it. Hope this was useful for you. I can't wait until the second one comes out.",4.0
"In this game you play Sonic the Hedgehog attempting to Chaos, the watery God of Destruction, from annihilating the world.  Later in the game, five additional characters are introduced into the game - each with their own style of play.
There are basically two types of levels in Sonic.  In action stages, the game behaves like any other platform game (Mario Adventure, Pandemonium, Crash Bandicoot), where you run around a 3D world along a predefined path, dodging traps, destroying enemies and collection objects.  In adventure stages, your character is allowed to free form explore - talking to characters and finding hidden objects.
There are also a couple of mini games (including a chao breeding simulation) which provide additional amusement.
The graphics are beautiful to look at and the level design is extensive and complex.  The sound effects and sound track are also very well executed, although there is no attempt to lipsynch the voiceovers.  Overall, the game is fun and has a lot of replay value.",4.0
"This game COULD have been a classic but it isn't. The game has been developed under a very strict deadline and because of this you'll often get the feeling that things should've been tweaked a bit. Don't get me wrong, it still has got plenty of things in it to justify the purchase but it's a darn shame that they didn't wait, let's say a month, with the release.
I've got almost no complaints about the graphics. They're very good and move very fast. The camera doesn't always cooperate though, and that can sometimes be very annoying. It also seems that Tails hovers a bit over the landscape so he doesn't let himself be controled fluently.
The difficultylevel of the Sonic and Tails campaign is okay, although sometimes it's a little too easy. I didn't find the Knuckles-campaign quite entertaining. In each level you'll have to find 3 emeralds, adventure-style. This isn't fun because the sonic-games are fun because they're fast and pretty much straight-forward. With knuckles you'll sometime be looking for an emerald for five minutes. The robot-campaign is far too easy, but has a very original and even moving story-line. You'll have to find out for yourself!
The leveldesign varies from pretty good (snow-level) to simply amazing (amusementpark-level)
Overall it's a pretty good game that could've been better. It doesn't cost all that much, though.",4.0
"Descent 3 is Interplay's follow-up to the highly acclaimed Descent franchise.  You are once again cast in the role of the Material Defender.  This time, however, your mission is one of retribution as you battle  virally-infected robots across 17 levels (15 normal plus 2 secret). You  must prove that the head of the PTMC intentionally contaminated the  company's robots with an alien virus.  After your rescue in the stunning  opening cutscene you learn that the PTMC went so far to modify the virus as  well.
You will fly a total of three ships in this sequel, including the  old PyroGL.  Weapons run the gamut from the standard concussion missile to  the all-powerful Black Shark.  New energy weapons such as the Microwave  Cannon add a new twist to decimating enemies and standbys such as the  Fusion Cannon and Plasma Cannon make a return. The graphics are  breath-taking and the sound is nothing short of immersive.
Descent 3  requires a 200MHz Pentium processor with a 4MB 3D accelerator card that  supports Direct3D, Glide, or OpenGL.  I recommend a Pentium II or III class  machine to get the most enjoyment out the game.  Certain details can be  turned off to get an acceptible framerate on lower-end machines but it  detracts from the overall experience.
If you're a Descent fan or a newbie  Descent 3 is a nice to get acquainted with the wonderful world of PC  gaming.",4.0

"If you expect Sonic Adventure is just going to be another one of those typical Sonic games - think again. Sonic Adventure is  loads of fun, essential for your Dreamcast collection. (Who can own a Sega system without a Sonic game?) I think that is a huge accomplishment for Sega, because it's really hard to find a game out there with a good story line that is appropriate for anyone. The graphics are great! Unfortunately, you will probably be paying more attention to the realistic scenery than beating the game (Sonic Adventure is rediculously easy). I beat it in 2 days, I'm 13 years old. However, my 9 year old cousin spent a lot more time on it, it took her about 6 weeks or so. It basically depends on your problem solving skills, and things like that. Oh - did I mention the camera problem? (This one hurts) Throughout the game, the camera is a MAJOR obstacle. You are CONSTANLY hidden behind some rock, pillar, or even the scenery! Sometimes this can give you a bit of a headache, the camera is so bad it makes you dizzy.
Overall, I give this game 4 stars - it would have been 5 if there wasn't that stupid camera problem. Also, I recommend this game for all ages, especially ages around 7-15.",4.0
"SOnic is back and is looking like he never has before. This game is very fun and addictive. It has awesome graphics, and has tons of levels. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is it is a little to easy. You can unlock up to six characters,each with their own adventure. You can play mini-games, and replay previous levels.

"This game would have gotten a five from me, except for all the movies.  I hate it when games have those stupid half hour movies interspersed throughout the game.  I had a friend over once who wanted to play the game, and he couldn't play with a new character because the friggin intro was too long.  He eventually got bored before he played.  The movie thing happens all throughout the game, not just in the intro.  It really breaks up the gameplay.

"For my 12th birthday last year I received a Dreamcast, two controllers, a memory card, and Sonic Adventure.  This is an awesome game, one of the best adventure games I've ever played (I'm an adventure video game fan).  But the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was confusing at some points in the game.  Most of the time after a cinematic scene ended they would just leave me there with no clue what to do or where to go, except sometimes right before the scene ended the character would say, ""I've gotta follow him!"" or, ""Let's go find out!"" or something like that.

"I remember playing sonic with my old sega genensis so when I got this game  I was expecting it to be the same old game...was I wrong. This game is so  much more than the original. Yeah there are some flaws, but they aren't big  and shouldn't stop you from buying the game. I would of enjoyed seeing the  other characters get a bigger role in the game, but then it wouldn't be  ""Sonic Adventure"" now would it. I say his because I'm a big  knuckles fan and was kinda disapointed at how quickly I beat the game with  him. All in all this game is a great buy, a must have for DC owners.",4.0
"There's weird hybrids, and then there's ""The Misadventures of Tron Bonne"", which might best be described as a combination of single-player ""Mario Party"" with the inventorty and character  interaction of a ""Final Fantasy"" game.  But that description  misses two important factors: wanton plunder and CUTE LITTLE  SERVBOTS!
The goal of the game is to collect one-million zenny (a Capcom  monetary unit) to pay off the Bonne family debts.  The young,  morally-unencumbered Tron is a mechanical whiz, so she sets off in the  mighty ship Gesselschaff with its robotic crew to raise the funds the  old-fashioned way: by stealing them.
The four major modes in the title  are mini-games: two variants on dungeon-crawling, a puzzle section, and a  3-D platform shootout.  Tron, usually piloting her mechanical mobile suit,  Gustaff, is assisted by 40 cute-as-a-button ""servbots"".  The  great thing about the servbots is their absolute innocence in the service  of piracy -- it's hilarious to blow the doors off a house, send in the  servbots, and watch them run out yelling ""yay!"", their arms full  of loot.
The servbots have distinct personalities, and unique skills that  can be unlocked by giving each a unique object.  They can also improve  their core skills by playing still more mini-games aboard the ship.  And  for servbots that get lazy, there's a torture room where you're challenged  to spike, torch, and flatten naughty servbots.
It's a peculiar mix, but  open-minded gamers will love this title...",4.0
"this game is o.k., the only problem is the only species of fish advalible to catch are bass, the fish are way easy to reel in and when the computer takes over from you to land the fish the rod looks very unrelistic. the good points are that the match fishing is very competitive, the bigger bass put up better fights and in practice mode big bags are easy to obtain. for the first 20 or so minutes the game plays really well and then the bigger bass seem to disapper and your left with pounders.when you progress higher up the match fishing scale whoah are some of the lures good, the popper, straight worm and [when fished near weeds or rocks]the rubber jig. overall i would say unless you adore bass lure fishing or a person who coarse fishes save your money for the marine version.

"Ok, After reading the other customer reviews I tought i'd write a more 'Neutral' approach. This game really does bring turn based stratagy back to life. But yes the interface does get laggy. The Space Combat is Good except  for the fact it is all over after 2 turns. If you get a ship editor up eah  ships shields by 300 and you get a better result. O and the Borg, O YES THE  BORG. Overall the Designers did the best they could, as with all space  stratagys, there is one simple problem. It is not a stratagy. It is simply  a case of who sends the most ships, This game almost solves the problem. I  say well done.",4.0
"This is one of the most fun RTS I have ever played. You get to slap around your minions, torture the good guys, and pretty much have a blast being evil. The bile demons are great, and the dark mistresses laughs are creepy. This has a very good sense of dark humor, and I would not recommend it to anyone under 13, or anyone who didn't like dark humor.

We got Evil Genius because we heard it was made by the same people. Evil Genius does NOT hold a candle to this. I still play it a hell of a lot, and I still have fun with it.

The only problems I have is the fact that it tends to have problems with the videos on my computer, pretty much not playing them. And the fact you cannot get multiplayer to work. If the multiplayer worked, there would be no question about giving this game 5 stars.",4.0
"Dungeon Keeper 2 is a great game. The plot is that you build a dungeon to attract creatures to fight heroes to get portal gems to give to the Horned Reaper who collects them to get to go to the Overworld [our world]. Sadly this never happens because number 3 was canceled but the game is a hidden jewel.

  You can build all of the normal dungeon-esque rooms, eg. prisons, gladiator pits, and torture chambers. You can recruit many creatures from the usual demons and undead to the odd imps and goblins. The reason I rated the game 4 overall is because of the incompatibility between DK2 and XP. The game works on my XP for about an hour then it crashes or freezes. The patches also won't work because some goon deleted patch 1.0 to 1.3 which is what you need to get the rest all the way to 1.7. [Confusing, eh?] If you think you can have fun for an hour or get it to work then I strongly suggest you try the game. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"I really liked this game.  I played pen & pencil Dungeons & Dragons for years, so I have an appreciation of the dungeon-master concept behind this game.  Dungeon Keeper 2 is a blend of real-time strategy, base-building, and sim-developing, but the real treat is being able to play as naughty as you want--and be rewarded for it!  There are a few things that I would change about DK2, but overall, I found it quite enjoyable, even years after its initial release.

Gameplay: There are three different gameplay modes.  First, there is the campaign, which includes several mission in which you snuff out the lairs of heroes and rival keepers on your way to dominating the region.  Typically, you build a base by tunneling out rooms and finding gold, attract a legion of monster henchmen while doing so, and then take on the forces of your rival.  There is enough variation in the missions to prevent boredom, although there are a few very tough missions (especially the last two).  There is also a skirmish mode that lets you fight against 1-3 rival keepers while fighting off other interlopers. The skirmish game can be customized in various ways, although there are only about 20 maps.  Finally, there is a ""my pet dungeon"" mode for those who just want to build their subterranean masterpieces without being troubled by opposition (although you can choose to include set-piece battles against heroes). All of the gameplay modes have their appeal, though I liked the campaign and skirmish the best.  The game can be played online, but I suspect there is not much of a multiplayer community these days.

The game is fairly easy to play, once you master the controls.  You'll need certain rooms in place (lair, hatchery, blacksmith, prison, torture chamber, and library) to really get things going, along with a number of choice spells (heal, rally, make gold) that can be researched at the library.  You have limited control of your creatures, beyond being able to drag and drop them.  You can take direct control over a creature with the possession spell and even have a number of creatures follow you.  This puts the game into first-person perspective, which can be fun but not all that useful in later stages of the campaign. But again, the real joy of the game is all of the naughty things that you can do, like torture captured heroes in your custom-built torture chamber, have corpses drug to your graveyard where they might eventually attract a vampire to do your bidding, or summon the god-like Horny Devil to turn the tide of a battle.  A fully fleshed-out dungeon feels almost like a small town under your control, and you can spend hours just admiring and tinkering with your handy work (or trying to keep your minions happy).  And though a somewhat dark game, DK2 has more than its share of humor, from the Vincent Price-like narrator to the casino that gives you a ridiculously funny treat if one of your monsters hits the jackpot.  The game never comes across as cheesy or trivial, but it obviously does not take itself too serious.

Graphics: For a game that came out in the late 1990s, DK2 looks pretty good.  Models are detailed enough to be credible representations of various monsters, and animations are pretty decent.  Some models such as the enemy hero lords are used too often, but otherwise the visuals are good enough to allow the game to immerse you.

Sounds: The game does have enough sound effects to convince you that it takes place in an underground dungeon.  However, the best sounds are the voice acting, which is top-knotch all the way around.  The narrator is both sinister and hilarious, and the enemy heroes are over-the-top in their arrogant, dismissive attitudes toward evil.  The music is okay, but not particularly gripping.

Technical Issues: The game has been quite stable on my system, even though I have XP with service pack 2. Be sure to install the latest game patch before playing.

Replayability/Value: I picked this game up new for about $12 on eBay, so I certainly got my money's worth. I don't see much replay value in the campaign, though I can imagine replaying it again at least once.  The skirmish mode is decent, and there are enough maps to keep you playing for a while.  If you are looking to play online, I'm afraid you'll have a hard time finding a game.

Pros:
+great concept for a game
+terrific voice acting
+a few different gameplay modes
+the dark humor is spot on
+""it's good to be bad""

Cons:
+no online community at this point
+a few frustrating campaign missions
+no modding community to speak of",4.0
I have been playing this game since 2000 and still come back to it here and there.  I agree it can get a bit boring at the beginning but once you start you can't stop.  The interface was hard to understand at first but with more practice it get's easier to work through.,4.0
"Awesome game.  If you're into turn based games and Star Trek then this is the ultimate game for you.

The only reason I didn't give five stars was due to the ship design.  This is partially because I'm a Star Trek fanatic and so I know these things...for example.

The Galaxy Class ship is a 'short range' ship with limited sensors.  Obviously, if you know Star Trek, this is far from true.  I just feel the ship specs could've been based more on the show and still maintained a balance for the game.  However, I should point out that this can be easily remedied by downloading ship editors online, it's just alot of work.",4.0
This game is very good for Star Trek fans.  the multiplayer abilities make this game something special.  One drawback is the micromanagement and slow speed for larger galaxies.  Overall a very good strategy game.,4.0
"I received this game as a second-hand gift from a friend, who told me he was having too much trouble understanding it. I was able to figure it out, but I've played Civs 2 and 3, so I'm used to this game format. Overall, it's a fun game, though I have yet to actually win. Also, some of the technilogical advancements are pretty bland, with level increases being denoted by number (automated farms 6 as opposed to automated farms 5, etc.) Ship level increases are similarly uncreative (increased with the ""II"" denominator). Not a bad game, but I'm told it's expensive.",4.0
On a scale of 1-10 the graphics in this game are a 10. As for the AI- its a 1.they can't figure out how to go around any obstacles. There are only 20 missions-I beat the entire game in 2 nights. Its a lot of fun though. There  is a trade-off between fun and frustrating. You will probably play this game  for a long time and i reccomend getting it.,4.0
"Mechwarrior 3 is the sequel to the classic mechwarrior 2 which made me stay up almost every night. Now, I must say the graphics are beautiful. The lighting effects are shown well on my Creative Labs Savage4. Gameplay is  pretty impressive too, I use a gravis blackhawk. For keyboard users, you do  get a fold-out leaflet with all the keys, pretty intimidating at first. The  biggest problem with this game is its length and difficulty. The missions  finish way to fast and are way too easy. I beat most of the missions on the  first try. I also finished the game in less than a week. But you  multiplaying on any of those networks. I'll probably buy the expansion (I  hope its good). There arn't many new mechs too, so another disappointment  there. All in all, this is a good game, but to fully get its value, you  have to play against other people.",4.0
"Like it's predecessor Dungeon Keeper, you once again enter a world where you are the evil mastermind and face down the minions of good and rival  keepers. On the plus side this game has a much better AI, room building is  a snap compared to the original, and multiplayer mode actually works. On  the down side though, one of the best things about DK I was that all the  creatures were useful. Many of the monsters in DK II have limited use (such  as warlocks after all the research is done with). A consistantly winning  strategy is to possess a high level (8-10) Dark Angel and trash your  opponents Dungeon Heart. These are minor problems though, and overall DK II  is a fine game. I am looking forward to the next instalment in the series.",4.0
"This game is a hoot. Taking the original's over-the-top Evil to a new level in graphics and a far improved first-person engine, it basically polishes and refines the gameplay of DK1.
You control a variety of  minions (from Goblins to Dark Angels) with a variety of wants and needs,  all toward the larger purpose of wiping out the good in the world. And a  simpering, pompous sort of good it is, full of bloated speech and poseurs  who care at least as much about how good they look as they do about  fighting evil.
Much like Bullfrog's Populous: The Beginning, however,  there isn't a lot of game here. It's more of a puzzle game than a real-time  strategy game, and once you solve the puzzle, actually enacting it is  usually pretty straightforward. Like P:TB, the beginning levels are easily  won by accident, making this a good game for children if you don't mind the  ""suggestive content"". (Actually, all there is is that the Pain  Mistresses enjoy being tortured.  But we're not talking about ""Soldier  of Fortune"" violence or ""Panty Raider"" sexuality,  here.)
Anyway, the aesthetics of it, the humor, the ""My Pet  Dungeon"" feature, and the overall attention to detail make it a hoot  to explore, even if it doesn't have a lot of depth, particularly for casual  gamers with a dark sense of humor.",4.0
"We waited quite a while for Dungeon Keeper 2 to come out, and bought it immediately when it did. On one hand, it's great for a sequel. People who played DK1 will easily be able to pick up on moving units, building rooms,  lining corridors with traps.
The graphics are better in the sense that  they're more geared towards future development. Instead of pixel-based  graphics, the creatures and rooms are now drawn with polygons. While that  makes some of the monsters look clumsy, it does mean that future graphics  will be much smoother and cleaner.
Going down into your dungeon by  possessing a creature does not cause the creatures to turn into a cloud of  dots - the rooms you roam through are still crisp and easy to see. Roaming  through your own dungeons is one of the true pleasures of this game,  too!
There are only a few extra rooms - you'd have hoped for much more  from a sequel that took this long to make. The casino is neat, if only  because a jackpot-winning minion starts dancing and singing when he wins.  (Disco Inferno!)
Rooms have better graphics, though. The hen-houses in  the hatchery, the on-wall bookshelves and torture racks, everything shows a  subtle touch.
If choosing between DK1 and DK2, I'd definitely recommend  people get this game. The challenges and gameplay in DK2 are better than  DK1, and DK1 has many new extra features like Pet Dungeons.
New players  will appreciate having a well crafted game that is a fun challenge, while  experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between the old  and new version.
Don't expect a masterpiece of Sequelhood, but do expect  a fun strategy gaming experience that will last quite a while!",4.0
"Birth of Federation is a really neat strategy game set in the Star Trek theme. Like many great microprose games they did a great job with this game too.
The game is very dynamic allowing you to play either the Federation, the Klingon Empire, Romulan Star Empire, the Cardassians or the Ferengi, plus whoever you play you are able to interact with a variety of many minor races. Minor races can be won to your empire through diplomacy or conquered and in one of these two events the minor races resoures are added to your own as well as starships, and territory. The management of empire must follow through with the governments philosophy or morale will suffer. For example if you act like a Klingon while playing the Federation your people will loath you and the federation will come to grinding halt. On the other hand if you are a Klingon and remain to stable without war and dishonor your promises your empire will come to grinding halt. The game requires you to find the balance in whatever empire you play.
Space combat is great, setting you up in a ""OK"" 3D looking environment where task forces of individual ships duke it out while giving you feedback on their status during battle. Ships can range from simple science ships to the heavy escort which is the defiant class.
The only thing I found irritating about the game is when your empire is growing in size that micro managment becomes nessacary as you manage each star system's economy and production. Furthermore newly colonized planets start at the lowest technology level despite having researched higher tech levels. If that is not bad enough you have upgrade everthing one level at a time as the game becomes a constant tedious excercise of mouse clicking back and forth.
The game in my opinion as it is stands could use additional features to achieve 5 stars. More minor races, more ships classes, more variety of sound clips for each race, start new colonized planets at the current tech level and an easier management system to cut down on all the mouse clicking.",4.0

The graphics don't look cheesey like they did in 4, and the story keeps you going.  If you have ever wanted to play a Mechwarrior game, PLEASE, play this one.",4.0
"This game is a huge jump from Mechwarrior 2.  Alone with much better graphics and audio the gameplay is much improved.  All weapons are current with the theme of the MechWarrior saga (Inner Sphere and Clan).  Mechs take damage and react to various weapon damage differently. For example, you can shoot a mech in the right arm with a ER laser a few times and blow it off.  But, if you pop one in the leg with a Gause Rifle you'll cripple it and then it has problems walking.

Overall, very well written.  Could use more missions but that is what the Pirate's Moon Expansion Pak is for I guess.",4.0

"Ok people. hers teh scoop. The gameshark people make good products, yet people don't understand this. I look at teh reviews and i notice the Level is either 5 or 1. What does this mean? The instructions. YOU MUST READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING ANY GAMESHARK CONSULE! Hmmmm....i didn't spelll taht right... the main fact is taht any cheat system you need to read the instructions. PLUS, all cheat iteams are FRAGILE! You must get this. So, before you cahnge yoru mind becasue some one said ""It erased my Pokmon game"" here this. Read what the product is. If it says ""Gamshark Gamboy Color"" well darnit it means Gamboy Color, not pocket, not adavned, not orginal.

1. Read what teh GameShark is for
2. Read warnings (on this gameshark, it says it may tamper with yoru organal game!)
3. Read instructions

"Mech Warriors 3 is a game that no doubt has revolutionized the graphics industry. There is no other way to put it, the graphics are really great, surprising for an older game! The game is so fun, and I like the way you can customize the way your bot looks, moves, and fires. My friend did something that was so cool, I do it too. He took one of the heavyweights, and put on almost 100 LRM's and two gause rifles(Probably the best weapon),one on each hand. He then battled several of those tiny robots-whos name escapes me-and took em out, indian style. It was cruel, but totally awesome. I use that tactic almost every time on battle mode.
If you go to options, you can turn off the heat sensors(I hate them) and put on invincibility, which is also cool.
For kids who's parents don't like them getting violent games, probably don't want this because of how discusting it is to kill one of the people running on the ground. It reminds me of Half-life.
I think this game is worth it new or used, and recommend it to bot-lovin kids.",4.0
"The first foremost negative aspect about this game is the fact that it doesn't really have a soundtrack. It's only got two songs on the CD and this is quite a shock and disapointment since, for example, Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries had a full, awesome soundtrack. Nevertheless, the 2 songs seemlesly integrate themselves into the feeling and the repeats aren't that noticeable.

The game has a good plot, good graphics and good action. In multiplayer it's even better, but the system of finding a server could have been easier and more straight-forward. Matching is done via a Microsoft website where you can find games and chatrooms and you also need to have installed Zonematch, a small program similar to MSN Messenger. In my opinion everything should be incorporated into an in-game multiplayer interface, just like the majority of other titles out there.

You, along with other troops are sent on a mission to neutralize enemy forces occupying a planet. As you reach orbit the dropships are shot down by enemy forces. You have to fight your way through, meet up with your other lancemates that were also shot down and find a way to get off the planet alive while at the same time driving to accomplish your mission.

The game puts you in the cockpit of awesome, powerful, 80-ton humanoid warmachines with enough firepower to level a city. The array of mechs and arsenal won't disappoint. Customize your warmachine any way you want and take it to the battlefield.

I especially like the mission commentaries, video feeds and voice acting, they're very well done and really help create the overall atmosphere.

BE ADVISED! The game out of the box may have slight incompatibility issues with Windows XP especially if you have Service Pack 2 installed, so make sure you grab yourself the latest game update patch from the internet! Once patched it runs without any problems.",4.0
"I've loved all of the Mechwarrior games, they are always so easy: stand and pick other Mechs off at extreme long range. Besides graphics changes the two big changes are a nice zooming rectile, to make those long-range shots easier and a ""Mobile Field Base"" that will fix you up in the middle of a mission. All of this makes the campaign short, just 10 hours or so.
I had one glaring problem, it wouldn't install or run on Windows 2000. Maybe I could have gotten it to run if I had hunted down and hand-installed all the files. It ran without a single hitch on Windows 98SE.",4.0

"Mechwarrior 3 is an awesome game. I've seen many reviews written saying how it's better than MW2, but what if you don't own MW2? I'm writing this review as someone who has never played another Mechwarrio game. The reason for a missing fifth star is simply the system requirements. I found that after i installed MW3 several of my programs stopped working; it took some tweaking in the close program window (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) to get things working. Now I will be honest: my system is old and lacks 3D acceleration and a sound card. However, the thing that bugs me is after watching the opening movie (which displays a truly awesome 'mech battle that looks as close to real as possible on high-performance computers) I knew it was capable of producing great graphics. The actual game is a little lacking, but considering when it was made and also the fact the deigners couldn't really put much more of anything in the game since the amount of disk space it takes up is astonishing. The game itself is great. This has to be the most customizable game ever, and here's what I mean: The Mech Lab is a workshop where you decide what to put on your Mech, such as weapons, armor, engine size, heat sinks, and electronic gizmos. There are of course, weight and size restristions, but if there weren't, well, who could beat a 100-ton armored walking tank with 40 lasers and 100,000 missles? The other great option in this game is the customizeable controls. Prefer to have all controls switched so that left = right and up = down? Not recommended, but go ahead: you can do it.  The storyline of the game is for once in gaming histroy: exciting! Missions are played over adjoining terrain, and the only boundaries are natural obstacles (However, should you pass a certain line far from the mission area your superiors will assume you are bugging out or heading to McDonalds and call the mission a failure). In most cases, if you travel back far enough you'll end up in your last mission area. More and more technologies become avbailable as you salvage (yes salvage this is war and there is no Super Wal-Mart nearby selling Gauss Riflesl, i checked) Mechs and weapons from the enemy. The final battle is a little shortcoming of what the game deserves (one hint: fire first, fire at the leader, fire fast and if you're on fire please get up from your computer and call the fire department), as it is usaully over in a short amount of time.  One thing to remember is I'm sure you'll be much more impressed if you have a faster system and 3D acceleration. If you don't, make ure to go into the options and switch over to the software 3D system.  Buy this game if your into it: This is not an instant action blow everything up shooter. This game involves this osolete thing: thinking. Do you want to blow the bad guy apart in a massive explosion? Or go for one of the legs and salvage it, while putting yourself at risk? Do you go into the base the front way? Or try to jet boost over the rear wall? There's also a lot of technology and things to commit to memory: it is impossible to play (or lets say, succede) without reading at least some of the manual. I know i skipped some things, like MFB's and heat mangement, but I'm not writing a manual for people who have the game; I'm writing a review for people who don't. As always, have fun.

The play diagrams tell where the players are going, doing, and the players in play are tagged with control button icons so you know exactly whom your QB has to pass the ball.

If they just  had a button that would allow you to cut left or righ(like madden) it would  make running the ball alot easier. I play with JAX, and Fred Taylor, and  INDY and Edgerrin James and I still never average more than 2 yds a carry,  no matter what defenses are ran. Also there are too man outrageous hits,  the ones where you pick the man up and throw him down, this is not  realistic, how often does this happen in a real game. This game is still  the best football game ever, Madden2000 on the playstation cant even touch  it. Hopefully you can run the ball better in NFL2K1. I cant wait to get it.  This is still the best football game ever.",4.0
"This is a great game but has some audio bugs that are annoying (sometimes a sound 'sticks' and repeats over and over.. or the commentators who  comment on the wrong team at halftime, etc..",4.0
"This was one of the best first person type games I've played.  The plot, although derivative of so many in the genre, was interesting and creepy.  The skill advancement system was one of the first to allow you to develop your character in a first person game with the skills YOU wanted to use most including those in technical, hacking, and repair fields.  The sound effects were quite good and added immensely to the environment.  This was the first game I played that regularly startled me when I'd hear a noise from somewhere off to the side of or behind me, or open a door to be immediately face to face with an enemy.  The game does suck you into its world.  As much as I truly enjoyed the story, the gameplay, the graphics (good for its time), and the sound, about two-thirds of the way through I kept thinking I was near the end only to find the game would continue on.  It got a bit tedious, which I find common with most first perons shooters I've played.  With the difficulty towards the latter part of the game, I finally looked up some cheats on the web to make it through the final segments.  A little shorter would have been better in my opinion, but this game set a new standard for me.",4.0
"Not sure whether to give this a 3 or a 4. This is kind of like a first person shooter like half-life, only you are too weak to really get into big  fights. It has some RPG elements, but only barely. The graphics are ugly,  but i don't really care about graphics. The respawning monsters (but not  respawning ammo) are annoying, and the weapons that break after a couple of  shots are MAJORLY ANNOYING!  That alone is reason to have the author  kicked. But despite all of that, the game is actually fun to play, and the  story is somewhat interesting. You could consider Deus Ex to be System  Shock 3, since it's extremely similar only with better technology and  weapons that don't break as easily (although the ammo is still limited -  none of these are Quake kiling sprees). But SS2 is a fun game, you just got  to keep your expectations somewhat low, because there are a lot of little,  annoying things here",4.0
"I really can't say enough good things about this game.  Firstly the code  is rock-solid.  It's probably the only 3D game that's ever played on our  clunky home computer without crashing or giving us glitches.  It also has  an atmosphere that constantly sends prickles down your spine and encourages  you to do more than shoot everything in sight.
This game WILL scare you.  As you fall into the world you'll start to jump at every bump and hiss  around you... and if you hear a monkey chattering you'll probably start  trying to shoot evrtything in sight.
Another interesting aspect is that  at the start of the game you get to choose if you want to be a straight out  soldier, a psychic, or a technical minded fellow.  The skills that you  choose can allow you to slip through the many traps and dangers in the  game.
The plot is that you are a soldier who has just recieved some  cybernetic implants.  You wake up from cold-sleep not knowing quite who you  are or how you got to where you are, and only have a voice on your comm  telling you what you need to do.  You're given help in the form of  cybernetic modules that upgrade your skills and allow you to gain new ones.  You pick up weapons from fallen monsters and also gain healing  items.
But you do more than just shoot things.  You have to operate  machinery, you gather up bits of crewmembers' logs to piece together the  truth, you perform chemical analysis on alien organs to find out what they  are, and you hack into replicator systems to try and get useful  items.
There were only two annoyances in this game, firstly weappons  degraded after use at a very unrealistic rate, and the monsters kept  re-spawning even if you wiped an area clean of them.  BUT.. the developers  were kind enough to come up with a patch you can download to fix this  particular problem, so its not that big of a deal.
Usually I'm a  straight-out adventure game player and I avoid 1st person shooters, but  SSII changed my opinion of them remarcably.  It was great to actually sink  my teeth into something with plot.",4.0
"System Shock 2 follows many conventions of a role-playing game, with considerable first-person action involved.  Like ""Thief"" (whose engine was used to create ""System Shock 2""), the objective is not  necessarily to kill everything in sight, but to achieve the required goals.  You play a new recruit onboard a starship fighting against alien viruses  and the ship's evil main computer.  You start with some initial skills of  your choice and are given chances to improve your skills as the games  progresses.  The goals you need to achieve range from mundane to  complicated: locating crucial items, unlocking rooms, restore power to  equipments, hacking into terminals, scouring dead astronauts' journals for  clues, collecting chemicals from laboratories that enable you to research  on technologies that help you combat your enemies, find tools that repair  and maintain your weapons, and so on.  My favorite puzzle is finding pieces  of a secret code hidden among the numerous video screens on one of the  levels.
Unfortunately, first-person combats are not as fun as they could  be.  Monsters respawn (shudder!).  And, depending on the skills you  acquired at the start of the game, you may not be skillful enough to combat  efficiently at the beginning, and will be prone to dying over and over  again and having to keep restoring your save games (which, on my Pentium II  400 with 96MB, takes over 1 minute per restore).
Also, the  cyber-environment in System Shock, which many loved, is not in this game.",4.0
The game is simple. It is very fun and exciting because it has tons of cool wepons and very cool hand to hand fighting. The only bad thing about it is that it is a very short game. If you like endless gun fights and arcade style fighting this game is for you.,4.0
"I found this a great follow up to Civ II! It's Hot seat mode and multi-Map capabilities made it a lot of fun and makes for hours of play! The graphics are not as good as in the original Civ II and you don't get the movies for  Wonders of the World or from your advisors. But it makes up for this by  introducing a scientific and fantasy realm to play in as well as Multi-Map  game playing. I would not recomend this for first time Civ players, but for  those who love Civ and want a new challenge!",4.0
"While the graphics are not much to look at by todays standards, extremely addictive game play more than makes up for this. If you played the original Civilization, this allows you to go many steps further. Do not start  playing without someone to remind you of the time!",4.0
"its cheaper than buying a new copy of civ2 MGE and still plays the same.  If you prefer the original civ2 graphics you can just go to civ fanatics and download a mod to convert it to original, plus you can get the no limits mod if you want a bigger map.  The graphics are ok, only reason they are not as good is using the original engine and using it for animated 3d like units and terrain.  Will work fine on 32-bit windows, if you have 64-bit you can patch it.",4.0
"Years ago, my dad came home with a new game. It was one I had never heard of before. It read Civilization II: Test of Time, and came with a manual thicker than the novels I was reading at the time. Little did I know how much of an impact this little game would have on not only my future gaming habits, but my interest in the world. Thanks to this game, I ended up buying all the next Civilization games (including SMAC and X-COM), but I also felt like I could understand the world like never before. But enough with the anecdote, let me talk about the game itself. From a graphics perspective, it is much darker, but much better looking than the base Civilization II game, and the graphics, even in this day and age, serve to heighten the game's sense of wonder rather than hinder it. Maybe it's just nostalgia, but the game still has the charm it had 10+ years ago. The real thing you buy a Civilization game for, however, is the gameplay, and let's say that if you love complexity, Test of Time has got that and then some. There are many, MANY hidden variables within the game that keep track of everything, and sometimes if you don't read the entire manual or Civilopedia, you won't exactly know the effects. For example, the farther one of your cities is away from your captial, the more corruption that city will be affected by. This can range from slight losses in gold production, to the city being the first to leave in a civil war. The two scenarios (fantasy and science fiction), and the extended campaign all add longevity to the game. The game is sadly not perfect (but what in this world is?), there are some combat issues (the dreaded phalanx beating a battleship can still happen) and there are a lot of times where you have to read the civilopedia, which can hamper the pace of the game. But, for the most part, Test of Time has been through the test of time, and I feel as if it passes with flying colors.",4.0
"Test of Time was a good attempt by Atari to fill the long void between Civ2 and Civ3.  The graphics and other improvements would have made this game a much better ""Civ2"" than the actual one.  At this point, since it's out of print, unless your an avid collector of the Civilization series, I would pass then one by, but it would have been nice if Sid Meyer and Atari had kept some of the features in this game when they made Civ3.",4.0
"Hello. My name is Alex, and I'm a Civ addict.
Ever since the late, great Microprose released Sid Meier's Civilization, I have turned on my PC, plopped myself down on my  chair and played countless hours...nay, eons....with at least three versions of this very popular and highly addictive ""god game.""
We all know this game by heart, otherwise we would not be attending CivAnon today. However, I'd like to make a few comments about this Hasbro Interactive version's virtues and vices.
What I like:
1. The new animated graphics. Sure, the old icons were good for their time, but I love watching and hearing my units fight in Animated mode.
2. Multiplayer capabilities were first introduced in one of the two versions I haven't owned (CivNet), and when playing against the computer gets boring, a human adversary is most welcome.  The ""hot seat"" option is the way I've played it, since I am rarely online to play in the MSN Game Zone.
What I hate:
1. I'm not keen on the Fantasy or SF scenarios. Sure, they may be attractive to serious players who like those genres, but I am more fond of the 1996 Microprose version of Civ II and its historical scenarios.
2. Save/Load.  This option DOESN'T work. Maybe I got unlucky and got stuck with a bad disc, but whenever I want to save a game and load it for a more time-efficient method of playing, all I get is really lousy graphics...like a corrupted version of the final Civ II release by Microprose but worse.  There are lines of code on my screen and everything looks like a beta testing screen. Yuck.  So if I play this game, it takes several hours (at best) and in one sitting. This makes everyone -- my girlfriend included -- very, very unhappy.
I still don't own Civ III, so this version will have to be in my library of games till the price comes down.",4.0
"This is my first time encountering Civilization.  After reading some of the reviews, I find this game to be great.  The action is non stop.  You are constantly kept thinking to keep your society on top.  I think though if I had been on the band wagon from the beginning, I would not have purchased this version becasue of its similiarities to the first two games.  But coming where I did, new to the Civilization experience, I think its a great bargain with the three different scenarios you can play.",4.0
"I love the concept, I am addicted to any Sid Meier game. Test of time is  not as good as Civ2, Call to power or Alpha Centauri but its a nice  variation on the theme. The graphics can be kind of muddled, especially  when you get to building railroads and in forests, It can be hard to make  pieces out. Some of the scenerios are wierd and the graphics are difficult  to get use to.",4.0
"NBA 2K is not the best basketball game for the DC.  NBA 2K1 is better.  2K1, ..., you can play network games; has more players including classic players; better moves and controls; no more not catching a pass or passing the ball to someone out of bounds; no more crazy camera angle changes that sometimes cause you a turnover b/c you walked backcourt, etc.  But NBA 2K is a great game.  It's better than EA sports or anyother Bball games out there.  The graphic is excellent, controls are easy to use and simple, and playing against the computer is a good challenge.  It's quite addictive because it takes a little time to become good.  So, most likely, you will lose to the computer at first, even with the best team.  Don't get discouraged, you will become better and so will your players (really). ....",4.0
NBA2K is by far the best game graphic wise.  You can tell who a character is just by looking at his face.  The only problem I have with this game is  the stats.  I don't understand how the Portland Trail Blazers can be better  than the Western All-Stars?  I mean the western all-stars have all the good  players from the blazers and the other western teams so how are the blazers  better!  Not only that but when you create a team say you put players that  can only shoot really good on your team.  You look at your team stats and  you have poor shooting and awesome rebounding!  Drives me crazy heheheh  another thing is your NBA players in NBA2K are a little on the dumb side.  You pass them the ball it hits them in the head and  bounces clear across  the court only to land out of bounce.  Its still a great game and fun to  play.  But It could of been put together better if they hadnt been in such  a rush to put it out on the market.,4.0
"NBA2K sounds great and the graphics are so real you actuallyfeel like your in the game. The facial expressions are great. The gameplay could be alot better. And besides the graphics and the free-throw method there really isn't anything new,(I would of liked to see a slam dunk-contest mode}.But NBA is still a cool game and is the best basketball game out right now. I would advise a rent before you buy this game if your not into sports games. Peaceout",4.0

"I love gamesharks a lot, but there are people out there that post fake codes that could mess up the gameshark. If your one of those people that have a corrupted one, just follow these steps!

1: if you have two of them (or getting another one) take the working one and place it in the n64 carefully.

2: insert the corrupted one on the working one

3: insert Super mario 64, goldeneye, Zelda (one of those)

4: turn it on and it should work, i never tried it myself. but iv seen vidoes of it working, This method is called ""piggybacking""

Also, only get codes from trusted sites. Gameshark.com, Gameginie.com
Gamesharks can be corrupted easily if not carefull. and when your done with the glitch, cheat. etc. i suggest pausing the game and then shut it off. i learned that the hard way. :( anyway, just be carefull with them and i hope the tips helped :) :) :)",4.0
"This game is very entertaining for many golfers and children alike. It is a lot of fun although it is very far from reality, as in having piranha plants,chomps,etc.",4.0
"Not that many golf games in the video game industry can actually sell very, very well. Most of them use a major player's name, and suppose to have their ""skills"" in the process. Not that many of them can have a strong sense of enjoyment in the golf world, where everyone wants a more serious side in the sports world with football, and basketball. However, Nintendo seemed to hit the nail on the head with their 2000 creation.
With Mario Golf, the game consists of the start of four golfers, including Baby Mario, Peach, and a couple of others. Throughout the game, you can access the Get Character mode, which can help you challenge other characters like Mario, Bowser, and Yoshi. Once you win the character, you also need them, the harder the challenger in the round. It is also important in the Tournament mode, where you can also earn enough points toward newer golf courses and challenging holes in the process. Each course reflecting on the cute, Mario Brothers themed style, which makes it appealing to all ages old and young, where the other games don't seem to have that sense of enjoyment.
Although Nintendo stopped making games for the Nintendo 64, Mario Golf is only one of the very few sports games I highly recommend for the system. Although many people might not see the review, because of the newer game system reviews and newer games of the Gamecube, Xbox, and Playstation 2.",4.0

"This game is excellent. The replay value is infinite- there are many characters, courses, etc. available for the dedicated player to find. On  top of that, there are multiple modes for up to four players (Two or three players is usually enough though- with 4 players people usually get bored)
The graphics are adequate for the game. However, the sound is pretty abysmal. The music is absolutely terrible on almost every course- and it is recommended that you turn it off.
I also would have enjoyed a create-a-player mode. However, this game is the best fun golfing can offer with its many courses, characters, and game modes.",4.0
"I've played this game probably 50 or 60 times, and have beaten it.  It was extremely fun while doing it, but it was too quick.  With only 6 courses, it gets to be the same over and over again.  However, there's also a way to earn new characters.  You challenge them to a course, and if you beat them, you get to play as them.  The more you beat, the more power you have (in the characters)  If you manage to get birdie on every one of the 108 holes in the game courses, you can earn the best player, which is Metal Mario.  He's pretty cool, and can drive the ball a whomping 313 yards.  There are other cool characters, which you only see in this game.  Baby Mario, Maple, Sonny, Harry, and some others, as well as the old favorites, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, DK (Donkey Kong), Peach, Wario, and some others.  At the beginning of the game, you start out with one moderately easy course, and 4 characters to chose from.  You need a certain amount of points to open a new course.  Almost everything you play gives you points.  Even a fun mini golf course gives you points.  If you like the game of golf, and like Mario and his friends, you'd love this game!",4.0
Ive seen some of the reviews and this item is notorious for just dieing. well its cheap enough. it dies ill get another. it does what its supposed to do. cheat your way to victory and enjoy your old games again :) Make sure the terminals on your game are clean or it won't work.,4.0
"I have to say that Nintendo will never let me down.  This game will keep you up all night long, either unlocking course after course or a plethera  of characters.  You can play up to three friends and the trash talking can  fly... but not as much as in Mariokart.  It helps you pick a club as well  as aim for you, but you have to choose where the sweetspot is to hit and  calculate the wind as well as the slope of the green.  My main problem  though is that you have two humans to start off with, and Baby Mario and  Princess for the Marioland characters.  If you want Luigi, Mario, Yoshi or  anyone else you have to beat them in order.  You can't be Donkey Kong till  you beat a lot of charcters and then DK himself.

"I bought frogger as a arcade bundle from AOL,and love it! The old version was monophonic this 1 has support for surround sound,the old 1 had 8-bit graphics,this 1 has 3d. The 3d graphics aren't bad(worst on playstation folks),but could be more vivid. Sometimes if your graphics card is poor it will freeze or crash your pc. Single player moods are easy and fun. Multi-player modes are a bit fun for 2 people,but for 4 it's difficult. It is fun to play on a good graphics card and with a large screen moniter,but still it isn't truely ""original"" in gameplay. But still much better than before. And for those others who said it had poor graphics,adjust the video graphics to high and your screen to 8000 by 6000. Lower the brightness and boost up the contrast on your moniter to get the ""true"" 3d effects!(Please disregard if you don't have a ATI PRO video card).",4.0

"When buying a Game Shark to use with certain games you should keep a few things in mind. For one this is kind of ""cheating"" when playing a game. So if you're playing a really complicated game and you're telling people, ""Oh yeah, I beat that game in like two days."" But you were also invincible and had unlimited ammo, it's not as much to brag about as someone who used no cheats and beat it in three or four days. On the flipside video games are supposed to be entertaining (don't mix 'entertaining' up with 'ruling your life', get out of the house every now and then). Anyway, they're supposed to be entertaining and there is nothing entertaining about playing the same level 50 times in one week trying to figure out how the hell you get on the other side of this wall to flip the switch to open the door you're stuck behind and have to get through in order to get the switch and blah blah blah. You know, THAT whole bit. Using a Game Shark can let help you get through so you could later one day play the game without any cheats and when you run into a wall you can be like, ""Heh heh, BLOW IT UP!!"" or.... you know.... whatever it is you figured out with the Game Shark. It can also help make games that are too challenging for you, and make them easier for you. Different people have different ideas of entertainment. Some like a challenge and some just like to blow things up or walk into a building of about 30 or 40 people and take them all out without getting a scratch on them. Whether you love or hate them, I think everyone owns one or two at one point in their gaming phase. I know I thought they were lame and just taking the easy way out but I have one for my Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advanced. I don't have much time to play video games like I did when I was younger but when I do get the time to pick one up I want to be entertained. Some days I like a challenge and other days I just wanna fly through a few levels real quick just to pass the time and actually have gotten somewhere.

These things usually come loaded with tons of codes for games. If you have a lot of games that aren't on it you can Google the title of the game, followed by a comma (one of these things "","") and the word ""gameshark"" or ""gameshark codes."" You can also remove games from the gameshark that you'll never use. You completely control what codes are loaded into the gameshark and what codes are active.",4.0

"I traded up my original gameshark to this.  Basically It has more games, but still missing quite a few.  It will serve as great help in Goldeneye and Mario.

Walking on hot coals is more enjoyable than entering the codes manually.  They couldn't make a more painful proceedure to do that.  Once you do it, and it works it's great.  But If I pay 50 bucks for a product, I don't want to work some more to get the codes.  It should come with a cable and software to download the codes to the gameshark.

Great Dreamcast controller came brand new in original packaging. Quick delivery and prompt service. Everything is like it says in description. cheap perfect controller for a dreamcast,4.0
"The Sega Dreamcast controller is still one of the best designed and assembled game pads that I ever used. In highsight, while awkward and uncomfortable now compared to more recent designs, it was perfectly suited to the Dreamcast's 3D games while still being simple enough for people to easily grasp. It's also generally comfortable to handle for hours, making it a perfect fit for weekend long gaming marathons and is very responsive for standard gaming fare on the Dreamcast. The colorful main buttons are situated on the right side, directly opposite of the analog thumb stick and the D-pad, with the triangle 'Start' button smack dab in the middle, near the bottom. There are also single left and right index finger triggers on the underside of the controller. The overall layout make the controller intuitive and easy to learn, allowing you focus on playing the game. It also features two expansion slots to accommodate a couple of accessories like multiple `Visual Memory Units', and a single `Rumble Pack' or even a microphone, depending on how it's configured. To me, the only strange thing about the overall design of the controller is that the power cord is connected at the bottom, which is a little unorthodox. Luckily it can conveniently be secured in the tradtional forward position on the underside of the unit to accommodate gamers with old school preferences. Unfortunately, like other people have mentioned, the Sega Dreamcast controller it isn't ideal for playing fighting games. The shoulder triggers are simply placed a little to far back and feel a little bit awkward to use effectively, not without throwing a minor hitch in your mechanics in the beginning. Pulling off some of the more complicated moves in Street Fighter consistantly is next to impossible for me. So, the Dreamcast's pad is merely adequate in this particular area and takes a little time to get used to, but it isn't a deal breaker. In it's defence, no standard controller can truly replace a traditional arcade stick in handling the precise, quick and smooth movements, not to mention the 6 dedicated and responsive face buttons that Capcom and SNK brawlers practically demand. Luckily, Agetec released a stick just for the Sega Dreamcast to address these various issues and manages to bring the arcade feeling home; a definite must have for diehards. Overall, I'd still highly recommended this purchase for a person who still enjoys playing games on the best console that Sega ever made; the Dreamcast. After all, it always helps to have an extra controller handy when playing Power Stone 2, Chu Chu Rocket or numerous other classic multi-player titles from the Dreamcast library when friends drop by and are itching to get a piece of the action.",4.0
"The Dreamcast controller is similar to the XBOX controller, the only difference is XBOX has more buttons.  The triggers are pretty much the same, the analog stick is above the d-pad, so if you added Select, Black, and White buttons, and another analog stick, it'd be exactly the same as XBOX.  However, the lack of these in Dreamcast's severely limits gaming possibilities.  For most PS2 games, the right analog stick allows players to rotate the camera around their character.  Without that, if camera controls are needed in a dreamcast game the L and R triggers normally are assigned for that.  This limits the options for useable buttons.  Also, that right analog stick is sorely missed in first person shooter games, which are rare on the Dreamcast to begin with.  The games that are available invariably use the A, B, X, Y buttons for directional movement, and the analog stick for aiming.  So, when compared to Halo, which makes use of those buttons on the xbox controller for reload, jump, switching weapons, and melee attacks, they are incredibly hampered by this.

This controller is great for RPGs, like Skies of Arcadia, fighter games like Soul Calibur, and platform games like Sonic Adventure.  But don't buy Hidden and Dangerous, or Rainbow Six, or even Quake III Arena, because after playing FPS's on XBOX and PS2, shooter games on Dreamcast are really a step down.",4.0
"this controller is the most comfortable controller ever to hit the market. it allows for longer gameplay hours than sony's dual shock or nintendo's 3 pronged controller. the only problem is the lack of buttons, 4 just isn't enough, and can cause problems with game development in the future. game developers claim that the dual shock and even nintendo64's controller don't have enough buttons, and nintendo's have the most buttons out of any home gaming system, with 9 total. this gripe could be that only 8 are easily accesable. Sega already has the best controller ever, and if they remake it with at least 2 more well-placed button, it would be perfect.",4.0

"The controler layout is good overall, but the controler is a bit small for adult players.  They do make larger off brand ones, if its a big concern.",4.0
"What to say about the Dreamcast controller: well, you have to compare it to the other controllers available. It is most obviously comparable to the N64 controller, both with its shape as well as the triggers.
However, this is where I would say it falls short: with its amount of buttons. The N64 has far more buttons than the Dreamcast, and with most games it does not matter. It makes hardly any difference at all, except perhaps with future game developement.
The Playstation, a 32-bit system has far less buttons than the Dreamcast a 128-bit system, and this does not seem right to me: a more advanced system should have a more advanced controller.
Aside from these minor quibbles though, the Dreamcast controller is fantastic: 2 slots for rumble and VMU, it feels right and fits in your hands wonderfully. The triggers feel brilliant and the buttons are all in the right place. It does not feel too small and clicky like the Playstation controller.
All in all, an excellent controller. The only one better is the N64 controller.",4.0
"Frogger is what I call ""Fun, but rediculous"".  This pretty much sums up games like ""The Simpsons Hit & Run"" and ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"".  What I mean is ""Fun, butr rediculously difficult"".  Frogger isn't TOO hard, but it is a little difficult.  Like in the Cactus zone.  There's a level called ""Big Boulder Ally"".  Rediculously difficult.  How are you supposed to tell.  I definately prefer the PC version over the PS version, but still... some of the funnest levels are the ones that take place in the clouds, like ""Air-Show Antics"".  But some are also extremely unnesecary, like ""Time Flies"" and ""Frogger Goes Skiing"".

Levels, in-and-of-themselves, are very well done and a lot of fun.  I really love ""Tumbleweed Ally"" and ""Bow-Wow Revenge"".  There aren't a large range of levels, but I like this one better the Frogger 2, which went from too difficult to too easy.  But, either way, I recommend getting this game on PC.  PS is a liveable experience, but it isn't as good.  They shortened the time down and you start with less lives.  Possibly because one version was released before the other, like the PC version first, or something like that.  I recommend this and Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge.  Both are astounding.  Especially the endings.  You really should see the credits, folks.  They put something in there to actually make credits cool.",4.0
"I had to write a follow-up review now that about 3 years has passed since my last one, and two sequels to this game have been published.  Despite playing the newer games, I dusted off and fired up my old copy of Jedi Knight/Mystery of the Sith (JK/MOtS) and had a blast.  The two are obviously dated, but don't suffer as much in comparison in terms of game play as the original ""Dark Forces"" (circa 1994) had in light of JK/MOtS.  Like DF, all the games in the Jedi Knight series are first person shooters.  JK/MOtS added the lightsaber and force powers with an enhanced game engine - besides better graphics and sound, it was now possible to combine moth horizontal and vertical head movements using the mouse (DF had separate buttons for vertical looking, which made the interface feel exceedingly clunky in comparison).  Also, basic movements were more natural - you never had that feeling prevalent in DF that you were a golf cart instead of a person.
But above the improved engine, JK excelled because it was as much a SW experience as it was a game - with a tight story line, excellent level design and filmed FMV cut scenes.  (Most people hated the cut-scenes - poorly acted and not very effects laden - but I loved them; they added to the movie-like feeling and, anyway, ""Attack of the Clones"" had horrible acting and scenes that went on much longer) You never had that feeling of other shooter games where you suddenly stopped and wondered - OK, where am I, what am I looking for and why am I hitting all of these buttons.  The story returns pro-rebel mercenary Kyle Katarn to the fore.  Learning that his father was killed by an evil dark jedi named Jerec, Kyle sets off on a mission of revenge. Soon he learns more - that Jerec rules an entire faction of imperials intent on locating the lost ""Valley of the Jedi"" (also featured in ""Jedi Outcast"").  The burial place of countless jedi, the valley also holds a bottomless reservoir of their force power.  The plot has Kyle tracking a traitorous droid named 8T88 from Nar Shadaa to his father's home planet of Sulon (the droid decodes a map leading to the valley - the map is then destroyed).  Great level design makes each player map seem less a map than a place that must be navigated.  AI suffers in terms of the imperial troops - who prove bad enough before their blasters are force-grabbed away.  Balancing that out, the game is generous with boss modes - sending you up for 5 lightsaber duels with the dark jedi, including the climactic duel with Jerec.  Personally, I hated the saber duels - they always seemed to boil down to hopping and slashing with sabers.  (Jedi Outcast is most improved in that respect - there are much better looking duels, and more of them).  Your force powers are divided between generic powers (speed, jump, sight) and those specific to light (heal, persuasion) or dark (lightning) forces.  Your reliance on dark or light powers (and your ability to keep from killing various innocent by-standers) will determine whether you are a light or dark jedi.  (The consequent difference for one side or another is not that great - mostly it determines which of Jerec's evil jedi you will fight in one of the latter duels, and which cut scenes you'll watch).  Sound and graphics compare well with the newer games, and the overall plot makes you feel like you're in a Star Wars movie.
This edition also comes with ""Mysteries of the Sith"" - a companion disk that uses a slightly altered game engine and was originally released separately, but otherwise required JK be installed.  In MotS, you play Katarn for the first several missions, then assume the role of Mara Jade, a former imperial agent brought to the light (her character was introduced in the novels of Timothy Zahn).  The tight plotting of the first game is gone - replaced by looser story arcs (as Kyle, you must save a rebel base from an imperial ground assault, then destroy an orbiting asteroid the imperials are using to stage their attack; as Mara, you will infiltrate the palace of Kapa the Hutt and then, in a switch, go to work for him; you will also track down and try to retrieve a jedi holocron and save a rebel corvette from marauding pirates; eventually you will follow Kyle back to a mysterious planet of the Sith where it's dark and swampy, the locals are hostile and hungry, and your weapons don't work).  If uneven, MotS has its share of thrills and challenges.  AI is noticeably improved (with stormtroopers ready to go fisticuffs when their blasters are force-grabbed) and gameplay is much more challenging on the whole.  Should you tire of the levels provided, an entire on-line community has crafted single and multi-player levels for both games.
In short, both games are still great values and enjoyment isn't terribly undermined by your having played Jedi Outcast - though it's obviously not the mind-blowing experience of 1997 (still, it's aged better than the Spice Girls).  If you've got a P4 - it's just an excuse to turn the graphics up to excessive.  I first played this on my P200MMX computer with VoodooII graphics acceleration, and enjoyed every minute.  On my P4, I had no Windows XP problems, and was able to crank graphics to the full.",4.0
"Okay, let me start off by saying that I do love this game.  When it came out it was a landmark in terms of moving SW gaming in a good direction.  There are some big problems with it, but if you're looking for some good SW fun, they can be overlooked.
First, the good: the storyline is simply awesome.  Kyle Katarn progresses as a character very well in this game, aided by the cinematic cutscenes that feel like part of the SW movies.  These cutscenes, in fact, made me fall in love with Kyle's character, which in Dark Forces was a lot like Han Solo but now is more like a rogue-ish, bad-... Jedi.  Many of the other characters, a la the Dark Jedi, are also enjoyable.
Also, in terms of gameplay, the choice between the light side and the dark side is a great idea, and it's a lot of fun to make the choice.  The levels are well-done, and the enemies, while lacking somewhat in AI, are well-balanced.  They are true to the Star Wars universe but still vary in difficulting, and there is still that one enemy you just HATE--for me it was the dianogas in Dark Forces, and the Mailocs in Jedi Knight.
There are several problems with this game, however.  First off, it just doesn't feel entirely true to the Star Wars universe.  The Valley of the Jedi idea feels essentially like a spiritual superweapon, but a superweapon that seems to extend beyond the realm of Star Wars.  The bowcaster and thermal detonator (which is more like a bomb in ROTJ) aren't true to the movies, either.  And some of the Force powers are from the movie, but some are not, and there are some form the movie that aren't included in this game (like Obi-wan's distraction).  I especially had a problem with the invisibility-inducing Persuasion, which is supposed to way of implementing the Jedi Mind Trick, expect that it should only work on the weak-minded, not Kyle, Dark Jedi, or against other players in multi-player.  Lightning never worked very well for me either.  In short, the Force powers were a good idea but could have been implemented better.  Same for the lightsaber, which I really only used when fighting the Dark Jedi.
My biggest problem, though, is the engine.  This was a period in gaming when the Quak engine was big, mostly because from a programmer standpoint you could do things that were impossible before like true 3D maps and fluid moving characters as opposed to cartoon sprites (if that means anything to any of you).  The result, however, was that in those early days of blatantly pixeled characters the environments didn't look very realistic.  It is pretty clear Kyle Katarn and his enemies are crafted from polygons.  The original Dark Forces looks more realistic in terms of screen shots than Jedi Knight.
These problems shouldn't deter you from buying this game, though.  This is a great game, with an excellently scripted single-player and a really good multi-player platform.",4.0
"This is definitely a cool game, no doubt about it. This game  totally obsoletes the first Dark Forces (that game is pretty old!). This game truly immerses you in a 90% authentic Star Wars environment. Great graphics, unlimited movement (like Azrael's Tear), and the wonderful soundtrack from the movies. I wish this game had more ties with the movies (like having Luke, Han,  Chewie or Leia appear), but the plot of Kyle Katarn and his battle aganist the Dark Jedi is still pretty good. The movie  sequnces are my favorite for they broaden your sense of the game and bring the characters alive. My only complaint is why there needed to be so much combat and less puzzles and such? I get so sick of gunning down storm troopers. The fights with the Dark Jedi are COOL and the Force powers are really fun to use. All in all this is a great game and one of the cooler games of today that can run on lower resolution computers.",4.0

"I've always loved the board game version of ""Life"" - I played it hundreds of times with my family while I was growing up.  The computer game version stuck to the board game as closely as possible.  You spin the wheel exactly like the board game, your little car moves around just like the board game (they even copied the board almost exactly!).
It's pretty fun - I've played it a few dozen times and really enjoyed it.  I wish that when you are generating your character there were a few more options (your character choices are EXTREMELY limited), but that is the only real fault I could find with the game.
The graphics are cartoonish - but it fits!  Whenever you land on a spot, there is a short little clip showing what happened to you - these are pretty funny!  Overall, it's a cute game.  It would be perfectly acceptable for kids too - there is nothing bad in the game at all!  Since its so cheap, I definitely recommend getting it and playing around, especially if you're a fan of the board game!",4.0
"When you first start this game you can see that it is strickly fun. Each space has either a short animated movie attached to it or a pop up screen with some funny . Most spaces have a still frame that pops up that is read by a pre-recorded voice. Each frame has some funny comment. There are a few spaces that have a short computer generated video attached to it instead of a still frame.
 Each player chooses his or her character and car. The cars move across the board through a series of time periods. The game board starts in the 1950s and continues to the year 2000. Each decade is accompanied with its own theme music.
What I like best about computer generated board games (like life)is that the computer moves you game piece(I.E. car) and keeps track of your earnings.",4.0

"This game has answered a lot of Star Wars fan's prayers.  Finally you can jump into the cockpit of a ship and play against real people.

Sure it's  fun to play new missions but there is no story line and you just play them  for kicks.  Despite this, the multiplayer feature is exciting and I'd  advise buying this game if you are a Star Wars fan.",4.0
"When I read the review and it said 30 plus hours of gameplay, I hoped to get at least that, but instead I only got about 8.  Other than the game's short length, it has to be one of the best games I have ever played.  Great  cut-scenes, graphics, and voice overs.",4.0
"I played this game for the first time last night and I found that this is a fun and very beautiful game to play.  With the patch, the game play is very nice and the graphics are great.  The only problem that I have found with the game is that it seems to be too easy to shoot down enemy planes.
On my very first mission I (along with 8 or so other spitfires) attacked a German bomber formation of over 20 planes.  The excitement of seeing so many targets in the sky at once is awsome!  But, on my first pass through the german formation I was able to down 4 HE-111's which seemed way too easy.  I may have the realism settings for the weapons or the planes set too easy and this may fix the problem, but it seemed that I only had to barely hit the bomber and it would explode into 1000 pieces.  So, in my first mission I downed a total of 7 He-111's and was an ace right off the bat.
Otherwise, the excitement of the game was great and the graphics are stunning, I just need to fix the gun problem and set the target strength up higher (if I can).",4.0

The one problem is that  I've had to reload the game several times.  There's some glitch that will  suddenly shut the program down mid-game - obviously very annoying - at  which point I am unable to restart it.  I don't know whether this problem  is something unique to my particular CD or something wrong with my  computer, but it can be very frustrating, irksome and definitely detracts  somewhat from the fun (as I keep having to hope it won't suddenly  stop).
I would still recommend it highly to players of all ages despite  this problem - like I said, it might not be a rampant glitch, and the fun  does highly outweighs the frustration... although my other warning concerns  its addictive qualities...",4.0
"I've owned the CD game Risk since it came out for Windows 95. And ever since, it has worked perfectly fine through different versions of Windows. It is a very addicting game with my preference for Europe, World, etc., maps. My biggest gripe of the game, which is a deduction of 1 star from the rating, is how unfair the AI players have been. Whenever I control a continent for extra armies, one of them will put everything towards my territories and annihilate as much as it can, although it does nothing about the other sides in spite of its weaknesses. While this goes on, the other AI players don't penetrate them, hence the conspiracy. If I am one territory short of controlling the continent, I get left alone, at least for the time being. Other times, I get ganged up a lot by 2 to 4 AI players. It's no fun really and is plainly and clearly cheating. All in all, I've enjoyed Risk as long as I am not being cheated on. By the way, I made walkthrough videos of the game on YouTube; search for ""Mr. Math Expert Risk Walkthrough.""",4.0

"While not the prettiest game in regards to graphics, and the interface was a bit difficult to navigate until you learned it, this game is superior to the newer games in several respects.

You could go anywhere in the galaxy and it wasn't dependent on the lines of control that are so evident in the later games; it just took a while to get to wherever you were going.  This added to the strategy in that, since the travel wasn't almost instantaneous like in the newer games, you had to plan very carefully which planets to uncover while you went to beat up on the enemy.  Since you'd have to wait a while to see how your strategy was going, you could sit for a while, chewing your fingernails and hoping that something wouldn't screw up the strategy (even though no plan ever survives contact with the enemy and it showed up in this game in SPADES!!)...something that wargamers love, but the video game generation doesn't (it's too slow). It ALSO meant that if you received intelligence that a massive force had moved into the system where you were headed, you couldn't recall your fleets until they came out of hyperspace and had to hope that they moved on before your fleets arrived.  The Fog of War was definitely evident in this game.

The ""exploration"" in the later games isn't really all that good.  In Rebellion exploration, especially in a huge galaxy, could be a risky proposition.  You could never be sure where the enemy had set up shop but, if you were lucky, you could find out where they were and get out before you were discovered.  If your spy was discovered, you might never hear anything again from them, never know why they disappeared, nothing.  Again, the Fog of War rears its ugly head.  The space-based spies would tell you that the enemy was on the planet, but it took spies to actually go in and see what the enemy had employed, sabotage those sites on the ground, and see if you couldn't start a rebellion on the planet to tie down the enemy's forces.

All in all, I like the graphics of the newer games, but I much prefer the mystery and fog of war in this older game.",4.0
"Still one of my all-time favorite Star Wars video games. It's totally unlike any other SW game. Yes, there are a lot of clicks required to do things that sometimes could be done in a simpler manner, but enough of the simple tasks can be automated that the game is still a lot of fun to play. The 3D combat simulator is a joke. As other reviews noted, the side with the best ships will virtually always win, no matter what pointless commands are given. However, the fun and point of the game is getting the right ships to the right place at the right time.

Rebellion is one of my favorite games, and probably the most under-rated Star Wars game ever. Enjoy!",4.0
"This one is an oldy but goody, to be sure. It certainly doesn't possess the technology of today's games (one can still hold out hope of there maybe someday being an updated sequel...), but it is the only Star Wars game of it's kind. This strategy game emcompasses not just one army or one world, but the entire galaxy!

You have to use worlds with high resources to boost your supplies, use diplomacy to gain the support of more planets, and build up armies of space ships to defend your planets and conquor your opponent. The ultimate game of conquest, don't expect to complete this game quick! The first time I played it all the way through it took me a couple months, playing for an hour or so each day! The game requires patience and dedication, but if that's your cup of tea, you will be well rewarded with Rebellion!",4.0
"Star Wars: Rebellion has been around for a while, and with the neverending stream of Star Wars games being released by LucasArts, it is surely being relegated to the backwaters of Star Wars gamers' consciousness. Its graphics aren't as gorgeous as Rogue Squadron or any of its sequels, and its style (real time strategy) may not be as popular as either first-person shooters a la ""Bounty Hunter"" or even ""The Phantom Menace.""
Yet to some strategy-gamers like Yours Truly, Rebellion (known in the UK as Star Wars: Supremacy) does have its virtues. While it is a strategy game on a galactic scale, it does combine elements of roleplaying (players can send major Star Wars characters from page and film on missions)and space warfare at the tactical level (once a player has built a few fleet units, they can be sent from their territory into enemy systems to invade planets or engage opposing fleets).
Players can choose to play as either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance, choose the level of difficulty, and the amount of planetary systems that will appear in the Galactic Information Display. The tougher the level, the more systems will gravitate to the oppposite side.  The object of the game, of course, is to control as much of the Star Wars galaxy as one can, with each side having ultimate victory goals that must be achieved.  To be more precise, the Rebels must capture both Darth Vader and the Emperor, while at the same time taking and holding Coruscant.
The Empire's mission is similar but trickier.  Not only are Mon Mothma and Luke Skywalker to be in Imperial custody, but Alliance HQ must be destroyed. But unlike Coruscant, the Rebel HQ complex (it looks like Cloud City) can be moved from one Alliance controlled system to another.  (Those who find the complete Victory conditions to be too hard at first might choose the HQ-only option.)
Things I like about Rebellion:
1. The ""main title"" sequence. Most good Star Wars games pay homage to their parent media source (the films) by having the ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...."" card and the title crawl setting up the game's storyline.  Rebellion is set immediately after Episode IV, so in some ways the game can be used to imagine alternate timelines and different outcomes to those we saw in the movies.  Actual cues from the John Williams scores add that touch of genuine Star Wars atmosphere to this starting screen.
2. The use of characters from books and films.  Although Rebellion shows its age by incorporating worlds and characters mentioned in books published up to 1998, I like the fact that the game designers did not limit the cast of ""agents"" to just the canon film characters.  Fans of such Expanded Universe characters as Grand Admiral Thrawn, Talon Karrde, Borsk Fey'lya, Labria, and Pellaeon will find them included here.  The one limiting factor is that only a few major characters will have audio cues included in their mission reports (and even those get old fast if you play the game in one sitting), so don't expect to hear the famous Thrawn's musings or Chewbacca's growls.  I also like the fact that certain characters have strong Diplomacy ratings (Leia, Mon Mothma, Piett, Jerjerrod, and of course Vader and the Emperor) that only get better with each mission, while others are better at Combat and Espionage.
3. The graphics. OK. The game is not new and it's showing its age, but those fleet battles are still pretty cool.  They may not be very varied, and at times it's best to just go to the Results screen if you send, say, a Star Destroyer or two against a system defended by one X-Wing squadron....or a Mon Cal cruiser against a single TIE squadron.
What I don't like:
1. It depends too much on mouse clicks. Another reviewer called this game the Death by 1,000 Clicks (or something along those lines).  I have gotten used to this, but getting used to something doesn't mean you have to like it.
2. Team building.  Supposedly, you can make a team of various characters to accomplish missions...or send out decoys to divert the enemy. While fine in theory, either the program is faulty or I am as dense as a Kowakian monkey-lizard.  It did take me several months just to figure out the basic game, even after reading the manual, but geez...I still can't get the Team thing done.
3. Predictability on Easy level. OK. I don't enjoy pain much so I tend to avoid switching levels on PC games, but I have noticed that the Empire never attempts to build a Death Star on Easy level.  It DOES drain resources, and maybe when I play as the Rebels I don't give the AI Empire time to gather raw materials for a battle station, but c'mon...to never try?
For an older game, it is not without its bugs -- it does crash from time to time and some of its features do get annoying, but Rebellion is still entertaining and fun to play.  What more can one ask of a game designed in the late 1990s for Windows 95/98....except maybe a Prequel edition or a revamped Classic Trilogy/EU version with new graphics?",4.0
"Lucas Arts has come out with some notable fiascos over the past few years as far as games are concerned. Force Commander, X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter (which is only good in multiplayer), StarFighter, etc. This is one of thier outings that I actually would rate at 4 1/2 stars and is one of the most misunderstood and underrated games to come out of George Lucas's computer game brainchild.
  The premise is simple. You are given control of either the Empire under Emperor Palpatine or the Rebel Alliance under Mon Mothma. If you start out as the Imperials you'll get a significant advantage in technology and capital ships as well as more developed worlds...plus you have a bonafide Jedi in Darth Vader, who can detect and train Jedi Students as he discovers them, making these officers even more valuable (more on this later). The Rebels start off with 2nd rate capital ships and planets that are far flung for the most part. Thier base is moveable, and under the circumstances that's a good thing since part of the Imperials' goals is to destroy the Rebel base.
  I'll try to simplify this game, but it's not an easy task. Depending upon the size of the galaxy you have picked (Small, Medium, Huge, etc) your goal is to colonize planets and develop them, use diplomacy to introduce other cultures either into the Rebellion or the Empire, or outright conquer enemy planets. These planets can then be equipped with varying tools to make use of thier inherent commodities...for instance one planet might have multiple Shipyards for building your navy, while others might be resource sytems, used only for mining and maintaining your credit flow. Characters in the game each have inherent uses...some can do Ship Research, others can be used for Diplomacy, while others can be sent to Sabotage enemy worlds and ships. If the Character has been detected to be a Force User, then a Jedi Knight or Master can begin to train them, resulting in a Character with increased scores for thier particular specialty. In addition Characters can be places in positions of Authority, either in Fleets or on Planets. Admiral Ackbar can lead one fleet while Lando Calrissian can General it, thus resulting in your fleets doing more damage and taking less hits in battles.
  Research is a lot of fun and can be begun almost from the beginning, in one of three areas. Ship research (New ship designs, fighters, etc), Building design (New Planetary Shields, Improved Shipyards), and Troop Design (Dark Troopers, Sullastan Regiments). Typically whoever has a leg up in Research has an easier time controlling the game and it's highly recommended that if you find any NPC's (Wedge Antilles can do Ship Research, Bevel Lemelisk can do all three types)to start ASAP.
  The part everyone wants to know about though is the gigantic ship battles, and man they can get epic. There's nothing like seeing 100 Rebel ships do battle with the same number of Imperial ones, and engagements can run up to 30 minutes. The graphics of these battles are a little dated by today's standards, but still seeing a Calamari Cruiser turn sideways to exchange broadsides with a Star Destroyer is a sight to see. Fighters swarm around the whole time sniping at enemy fighters or helping engage the big capital ships. There's different options for your ships to maneuver into position for attacks, but as far as I can see they're for the most part pointless as both fleets typically run straight for the other and begin duking it out.
  Single player is fun, but gets dreary after a while, especially if you're playing as the Rebels. The Imperials generally name thier ships at the beginning, but the database for ship names must be shallow because soon after you'll start seeing such inspiring names as ""Carrack Cruiser 152"" or ""Star Destroyer 43"". And the most glaring deficiency in Single player mode is that the Imperials will *never* build a Death Star. Ever. Leading me to want to shout ""The Death Star plans are not in the main computer""!
  This game becomes sterling in multiplayer though, and if you ever wanted to play a strategy game on an almost epic level, this is definitely a game you want to check out. A human will almost invariably play by different strategies than the computer will, and oftentimes you'll find different and sometimes very unique methods employed for winning. My brother tends to build zillions of fighters on each planet he owns, making capital ship conquest almost impossible to accomplish without matching the number of fighters in your own fleet. My nephew builds heavily into Capital ships with a mixed escort screen, basically heavy on planetary bombardment. I tend to make a mixture of the two aiming for a well rounded task force. And when Turn 5000 hits and you're still grappling for control of the galaxy with your opponent, well let's say that it never wears down on you. If ever you get a chance to build a Death Star, do it. It is an incredible rush to build one secretly, moving it suddenly and unexpectedly into your opponents main manufacturing planets' orbit, and then hitting ""Destroy Planet"", watching half of his shipbuilding capability go up in a blaze of smoke and rubble.
  Unless you have a LAN at home and know someone who wants to try this gem of a game out, the only place you'll be able to play is on Gamespy and Internet Gaming Zone, but expect games to be *very* long and drawn out, sometimes lasting as much as a week, depending upon how often you have to save and reload.

"Before I bought this game, I read a lot of reviews on Rebellion. They were all so negative. I was so worried I would find a game that wasn't worth my time and effort to beat. However, me AND the review writers were wrong. This game isn't exactly like what those reviewers write. Although there are some holes here and there, this game makes you forget them. Such as the issue on the annoying droid blabbering on and on. But I did not find the droid annoying. Even when he was 'on' for advice, I could ignore him easily with my plans for galactic domination. The battles are basically what people say it's like. Slow, cheesy graphics, all that. But it's better than a 2D chess-type battle, am I wrong? If you are the person who do not like waiting for things to happen and are easily annoyed, this is not the game for you. However, if you like strategy games or/and can withstand waiting, this could be the your choice.
My final is 4.5/5.
Even though I want to give it a 5, no game can be perfect and this game isn't. The TIEs and X-Wings, fighters, move like pieces of drawing moving up and down in the tactical modes, but, planning decisive assisination missions and seeing the rebel fleet go under fire is just exiting. The waiting can be sometimes just too long. But there is always fast mode for the time. Also, playing online isn't bad at all. It may lead to more than one day of gameplay, but it's fun. I'd say, this is a great game. But about learning the game... It is long and hard to truly master the game. But until then, enjoy the immesurable surprises, defeats, and victories.",4.0
"With the release of the new MTG Online game and the ludicrous rarity of this older version of the game, you might wonder why you should even be looking for this at all.  The good and bad news is that this game was originally released without an online option, so it came with a LOT of fourth edition cards.  When it was re-released (still a few years back) with an online option (which is what this item is, the re-release), they still kept the plethora of cards intact, and the game is a lot of fun.  Unlike the nee Online version, you won't get bored too quickly and have to PAY for new cards almost right off the bat.  You get the game, the action and can build some cool decks with some old school Magic cards.
However.
The game flew so far under the radar that even if you can actually find a copy of this, you probably won't find anyone online to play with now and will have to resolve yourself to playing against the computer.  There was an expansion set that was released for this (""Spells of the Ancients""; 2 more themed sets), but it's almost as hard to find as the game itself.
In the end, you're left with a game that's GREAT for beginners of Magic (it automates all of the turns and asks your permission along the way so you get to learn the flow of the game) or for old heads who want a low-impact version of the game to put on a computer that may not be stocked with vast amounts of hardware or memory.  I played it on a pretty stripped down laptop to completely adequate effect.",4.0
"If you are a magic lover like I do, you'll basically like anything related to magic.  The encyclopedia is more comprehensive but that doesn't have Magical Shandalar which is a kiddie game that you walk around like an RPG  game... fight with playing magic card, etc... quite fun.",4.0
"This game is a game for strategists.  It takes place right after the Battle of Yavin(Episode IV: A New Hope)and allows the player to assume the command of either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire.  You can build different facilities, such as construction yards or shipyards, and a lot of the famous ships from the Star Wars movies.  You can conquer planets with troopes, train Jedi, and command key players, such as Luke Skywalker or Han Solo.  It even has cutscenes, like if the Empire loses control of Coruscant, it'll show Alliance troops landing and taking over the planet.  You can explore the Unknown Regions, or stay and conquer the known galaxy.  The main goals of the game are to capture the two main players of each side(Example: Luke and Mon Mothma for the Allaince)and the main base(The Alliance have a mobile base, while the Emperial base is permanently Coruscant).  The space battles are excellent, allowing you to control each individual ship as the battle is happening.
Although Star Wars: Rebellion does have a lot of good things, it has some bad things to.  It is not for the adventure-type gamer.  You have to be able to sit down and think about your next move.  And, most importantly:  YOU HAVE TO READ THE MANUAL, or the game won't make any sense.  And the manual is REALLY, REALLY long.  Also, the game can be long.  Actually, it is long.  But it has to be long; if it wasn't, then it wouldn't have been able to have all those neat things mentioned earlier in it.  Also, there really aren't enough players in the game, only a few of them, and because they can get captured and killed, you don't have enough of them to control the whole galaxy.
If you love strategy, get this game; its a classic Star Wars strategy.  There is still much more to the game than I can explain, it is a very complex game.  But I loved it, and I hope you love it, and thus is my review.",4.0
"Anyone ever play Privateer: Armada?  This really reminds me of that allot.  The great sweeping star wars saga has been replaced by nothing more then a third rate game of chess. The special effects are cheesy and the so-called battles take forever.  Save your money and don't buy this one.
If you want a great Star Wars game get X-Wing or X-Wing Alliance.",4.0
"Star Wars fans should be grateful for this game.
This is a 100% strategy game, and even in the galactic battles you need to double think which spaceship to send against which.
The idea of the game is simple... ""manage your economic resources wisely as well as your politics and military to gain supremacy over the other side"".
You'll need to select destinations for your mines, refineries, development labs, training facilities, etc so as to maximize output and grab the most out of them...
One thing you have to take into account is how changing the game is... in some part you can be lured to assume you'll wipe out your opponent in a couple of turns when you angrily realize he has taken control of 3 or 4 of your planets leaving you with most of your spaceyard or building facilities out!!!
Get enough patience because the game is long and pretty hard to understand, but once the effort's been made it's really worth it!",4.0
"First off id like to say that this game is decent, though people who well stink at the beginning of the game probably say this game is horrid. Though this game is actually quite fun.
As you startoff yo only have a small fleet, and a few planets that support you. But you can persuade planets to join your cause, build fleets, begin missions, and more. Though this game has controls that take some time to get used to, you will eventually you  master them. One of the coolest things in the game is the fleet engagements. Though the ships may not look that good, the commands are effective. You can send task forces to engage specific things, you can command squadrons of fighters, and even set specific manuevering points and attack procedures.
  The game also includes a long list of characters from the movies, like Han Solo, and newly created characters. You can check the character attributes to see if they're effective at diplomacy or combat.
  The few cons in this game are is the lack of action. You usually will be ssitting watching at an unchanging screen for minutes or hours. There is also no strategic command for Assaulting planets. The game will only simulate the battle.
Lets see the pros and cons laid out once more.
PROS+
Great fleet battles
Long roster of characters
Need of Strategy
Cons-
Lack of action
No assault command
Some difficult controls
  Though the lack of action may turn players away, this is still a fun game with a need of strategy.",4.0
"This is a very fun game.  There are a million rules, but you catch on quickly.  At first you'll be frusturated, but you come back again and again untill you beat it.  EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE!",4.0
"I love this game. It's very addictive, once you learn how to play it. There are some things that could be added to improve on the fun. Like having an experience rating for fighter squadrons (like Rogue Squad or the IMP 181ST), capitol ships, and other forces. Also, having more characters to start out with, as well as increasing the character lineup so there are alot more wouldn't hurt. Having to deal w/ main characters as spies that join your side would also be cool. You should also be able to combine your squadrons after taking losses. Having alist of names for ships, squadrons and other forces would be helpful for those that like to name their ships from STAR WARS databases. And for those more tactically minded Grand Admirals, better battles couldn't hurt, including: improved space battles,having planetary bombardments, and having planetary assaults. These are some of my suggestions, otherwise this is a must for all SW fans.",4.0
"First off this game is a must have for Star Wars fans.  It revolves around characters in the original trilogy and characters that have been introduced through later novels and comics, therefore for the full effect you must have a basic knowledge Star Wars.  But anyway this is a great game no  matter how you cut it but it is not perfect.  The cutscenes in the game are  great but there are only so many and I found myself looking for more.  It  is a basic game with basic graphics but it is capable of so much more.  Hopefully there will be an updated version coming out soon that will add  what this game lacks.  Firstly it needs more action; the only way to make  the game challenging is to set it on difficult but then it easily becomes  overwhelming. There is no true equilibrium either you start out winning and  you win or you start out losing and you lose; chance is limited in this  game.  Also the game needs more control over the characters their actions;  there is a point, click, and forget mentallity that can easily put you to  sleep if there is nothing else to concentrate on.  The choice of ships,  troops, and buildings also limit the games potential but there are more  than enough to keep it interesting.
Overall it is a great game as long as  your expectations are not that high.  After a month of playing it straight  it lost it's edge and was easily forgotten.  But every so often I go on a  Rebellion binge and it is all I can think of for weeks.  Don't pass this  game up if you do you'll have made a mistake.
A MUST for Star Wars fans  and a definite SHOULD have for RTS fans!",4.0

"Sweet!  I've been around since the original X-Wing, and I'm glad to see the advances!  Remember the original floppy-disk X-Wing for MS-DOS?  The ships were nothing more than  a few single-colored polygons, and the HUD  only showed a picture of the ship, not the actual moving ship.  Plus, you  had 3 ships, well, okay, 4 ships (after the B-wing expansion pack) to pick  from.  The dumb racing track took over ten minutes to go through one lap,  and the missions were close to impossible!  But we didn't mind because that  was the best a computer could offer back then.  Well, not we've got  extremely detailed ships (with moving gun turrents...wow! :) ) with 3D  accelerated graphics, over 15 ships (you use about 8 of them in the real  game, many more in multiplayer) you can fly, and new-fangled light sources!  Plus, you go into the Death Star on this one!  It isn't like that  two-colored gray surface from X-Wing!  Now it's got 16 million colors!  Unfortunately, some of the difficulty from X-Wing moved over to X-Wing  Alliance.  It's just a WEE bit hard.  Some missions will have you laughing  at the enemy, while others will make you slam your computer desk.  Fortunately, you can put it on easy mode (can't do that in X-Wing!).  Plus,  some of the mission objects may seem a bit too much to handle.  But I think  this is only a minor problem.  A few missions stand out...like one where  you jump out of hyperspace directly in front of a Super Star Destroyer!  (for the uninformed, a SSD is a BIG mutha ship that you shouldn't go  NEAR...heck, it's so bad that you'll only see one in the whole game!)  Overall, you'll find a great space combat game in this package.  Go  on...buy it!",4.0
"House of the Dead (the arcade) is the reason I bought a DreamCast. I played it at a local movie theater about 2 months ago and realized and I wanted it at home. I did a little research and found out that not only was a home version out, it was very affordable and a perfect arcade port.
This game is great on the Dream Cast if you have a light gun, if you don't this game is not good. The user interface for the game was designed for a light gun, so if you play with a controller it seems unnatural and you have a desaster almost as big as trying to play Virtual On without the twin sticks. ...
If you do not have the gun, strongly consider buying the ""Stringer Light Blaster & House Of The Dead 2 Bundle Pack"" by Pelican. ...",4.0
"first of all, let me say that the game is quite fun and entertaining, BUT the voice acting is among the WORST I have ever seen.

"The Gamepad Pro is a good choice for any gamer who is used to the layout  of the standard Playstation controller. The buttons and directional pad  have about the same feel as the original Gravis Gamepad, (There is some  room for improvement there) but for the price of the gamepad the overall  quality is excellent. I have owned mine for at least two years (I use it  frequently) and it still works like new.
Before you buy the Gravis  Gamepad Pro USB- 1. Make sure you have an open USB port! 2. If you mainly  play racing/simulation games, you should consider an analog controller.",4.0
"It's great. Works perfectly but there could be a few ways to improve it. The four buttons on the right aren't numbered and it would be so much helpful if one button would be in the back of the controller like N64's.

As a laptop user I was  thrilled with USB gamepads after having a 3 year drought, and trying the  tepid Gravis Stinger.
Buy this one! Its one of Gravis' Finest!",4.0
"I bought the Gravis GamePad Pro for use with a PlayStation emulator, since the layout is very similar to the older non-analog controllers. If you're thinking about buying this contoller for the same reason, consider the following before purchase:

1. It's lighter than the real thing, feather-light in fact. This doesn't bother me much, but I know that some people like the feel of something solid in their hands.

2. The D-pad is a little mushy, a criticism I see echoed in the other reviews here. If Gravis ever decides to revise this design, this is the first thing they should look into, because it can be a deal-breaker for some people (and the primary reason why I knocked one star from this review).

3. No analog sticks. If you really want analog sticks, you're better off buying a real Dual Shock controller and a USB converter.

All that said, I found it to be a worthy purchase. It's truly plug-and-play. Windows XP detected and configured it immediately. Worked just as well in Linux; it uses the joydev kernel module. You should have no problems hooking up a second one if you're cooking up some head-to-head action. It just works.

A word of warning: if your hands begin to hurt after extended use, that may not be the controller's fault. As with any input device, you're prone to developing a repetitive stress injury if you use this for extended periods of time without resting. Please take my word for it--I have carpal-tunnel and learned this lesson the hard way!",4.0
I enjoy everything about the control except the Z button. Instead of being a trigger style button that you push at a down angle it is a bumper that you push straight in. This is a problem because your finger will be resting on the button in a way that pushing down feels more natural than pushing in. What ends up happening is you push the button down causing it to feel like it will eventually break.,4.0

"I bought this game so that i can replay my own Dreamcast. The game worked great but i did notice that if you are using a never LCD flat screen, then the laser gun to play the game will not work. You have to use an old tube TV which i happened to have and it all worked great. My brothers and i spent the entire night playing it .I used to play this game in the arcades until my mom would literally drag me out.",4.0
"I'm unsure why many of these people disliked this product, I found it to be excellent.
I have no trouble at all with the diagonals.  I find the d-pad to be quite comfortable, and had no problems getting use to it.
The buttons are equally as good.
It doesn't have an anlog stick, which is a plus to me, since I find those things are inferior for everything but FPS.(which I rather use a mouse) And no rumble pack, again always seems to me a useless feature.
The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is because like it has been mentioned the screw in the middle is odd.  While I found no discomfort at all about it.  The screw was designed for a small joystick you can screw in(which is provided) personally I think this feature should of been left out, as it well.. sucks.  If I wanted to use a joystick, I wouldn't have use this one.
But for the price, I think this is excellent.
These people who are saying that the d-pad sucks, are either flat out liars.
Or like someone else before me mentioned, just aren't skilled gamers.
Buy this if you want a PS-clone, you will not be disappointed, I promise ;)",4.0
"This controller is very good for what it is. If you need a usb controller for NES, SNES, or Playstation emulation, this is a good one to get. I bought two of them for NES/SNES emulation and I have no major complaints.
This pad comes with a small joystick you can screw into the d-pad which is awkward and you'll never want to use. The only problem is that when you have the stick unscrewed, the center of the d-pad has a threaded metallic hole which can slightly irritate your thumb after a few hours of playing. Despite this minor flaw, while it's not the greatest controller you can buy, at this price it's an excellent value.",4.0
"i have a purple one of these (not that it makes a difference) and have had it for a year. i has worked great during that time, but recently an inner part of the z button broke off. i took it apart and super glued it, but it only worked for a few more days. all in all it is a very good PRECISION controller (i.e. the control stick is much more precise in games like mario 64).  but if you want one that lasts a long time, go with the original.",4.0
"I'll admit, the first time I played this game was nearly three years ago, and I'll also admit it was fun. The graphics were good, if you liked paper cutout dolls walking towards you and shooting. However, the gameplay was  fantastic. It was one of the first 3D adventure/action game that I had  played in my life, and it blew me away. So, if you want a good gaming  experience, and can see past the early graphics, then buy this game. If you  have to have good graphics in a game with a good storyline and all that  jazz, then get the sequal to this game, which is one of the best there is.",4.0
"I really liked this game. It reminded me a lot of the Arcade version of ""Time Crisis"" which I played a lot of in Japan. Bottom line for this game is it's action packed and even thrilling. You play the game pretty much one heart beat at a time. Especially the first time you play it. I don't have the light gun yet. But it's not that bad playing with the basic controller. The upside to playing this way is you can fire the gun and reload probably 10 times faster, down side is that you can't aim quite as easily. I recommend this game for anyone who wants to have a fun arcade style game to play when friends come over, or just to play for maybe an hour on a day off. I give this game a 4 star only because it loses in replay value after you beat it and get familiar with where the zombies attack you from. Although to it's credit it does allow you to select different ""paths"" at different points in the game. One final note is if you don't like ""gore"", or creepy ""zombies"" and other evil creatures , don't buy the game.",4.0
"One of the first games released for the Dreamcast, House of the Dead 2 is an instant classic.  The game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive Dreamcast levels, and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering.  The voice acting is pretty bad though, making the voice acting from the first Resident Evil look like Shakespearian acting, but that is overlooked by the shoot 'em up action.  A light gun is strongly recommended, but the standard DC controler works just as well, somewhat.",4.0
"The console light gun game is something of a neglected genre. In the case of the Dreamcast, that problem can easily be attributed to Sega wussing out on releasing their own gun peripheral in light of the Columbine massacre. Thankfully, a number of third-party companies were willing to pick up the slack, and, thus, by spending some extra cash, you can play this highly enjoyable frag-a-thon the way it was MEANT to be played.
House of the Dead 2 gets my vote as the best ""traditional"" (meaning you kill things) light gun game available on a home system (Namco's Point Blank series, I think, has it beat in terms of potential enjoyability, but that's another kettle of fish). It's also one of the hardest. Even on the easiest setting with maximum health and credits, blasting your way through it is no small feat. Most enemies can sustain multiple shots, and dealing with several of them at once while not getting cut or bitten or tackled or whatever will challenge all but the fastest trigger fingers. For even more of a challenge, just try nailing all of those agonizingly evasive bonus items that appear when you shoot barrels, crates, etc.
House of the Dead 2 is not content to force you down the same path every time you play. Depending on how many civillians you rescue, and which ones, you will be sent in different directions within the same stage and the bosses will vary their attacks accordingly, so it's impossible to see everything the game has to offer in one session. Of course, the civillians are typical helpless weenies, begging pathetically for mercy and cowering in corners (one guy even dies from a single kick to the rib cage if you don't save him in time...WIMP!). Their voice acting, as well as that of the heroes and villains, is unsurprisingly weak, but the B-movie quality sort of adds to the feel of the game.
Graphics are mightily impressive, and pretty atmospheric, too; the look of a gloomy European town is captured quite well.
The soundtrack, while not exactly stellar, is certainly passable.
There's also a training mode where you must accomplish tasks like blowing zombies off a moving car. It's nowhere near as fun as the main game because there's really no margin for error, but it's a nice touch nonetheless.
Pointing a gun (plastic or not) at the screen and blasting away is a wonderfully primal, visceral video game experience, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better excuse to do it than this. The high level of difficulty may turn some people off, but for those of us who can only go for so long without shooting something, it's a real treat as well as a great reason to own a Dreamcast.",4.0
Your gary or james or both and you are off to kill Goldman the one responsible for the 1998 curian case or House of the Dead 1. You will face an endless number of zombies and kill several bosses. Your goal is to stop goldman from destroying all of mankind with his secret weapon which is the final boss of the game. The game is fun for a while but eventually gets very boring. You can play arcade mode or play original. The game bases all on the arcade. You can do training mode which has several shooting events you can do until you get 5 stars on them. All different things are in this game and what ive explained is not all of it.,4.0
"Gory, fun, and entertaining!  Yes, House of the Dead 2 is all that and then some!
The graphics in this game are simply amazing; a perfect resemblance to that of the arcade game.  The animations and textures are used wonderfully.  Gameplay is pretty darn solid, and the replay value is tremendously good, especially if played multiplayer.

"I love this! It came in the mail and I was anxious to open. Its ALMOST exactly how I remember it. Makes me laugh because when you set the date it's set to 2000, which is when the blue VMU was released in the U.S. Wish I had some mini games but I'll just buy my cousins' Dreamcast and play Sonic on that. My only problem is for some reason everytime the VMU is shaken or just whenever it feels like it, it resets and makes a loud beep. It's not fun reseting the Dates and Time everyone 30 minutes. I saw that this was quite common and it was a battery issue or some jive. Anyway loving it so far can't wait to get some mini-games.

It's geared for children but people who like to stratagise things would definately like it.

Graphics:about equal (RCT is clearer but STP is actually 3D)

Ride choices: RCT has more in a single park but STP has more over all (four diffferent park themes)

Stratagey: RCT is definately more difficult

Ride the rides: STP only

Rollercoaster design: STP is definately better here (RCT has more options as far as individual parts and coasters but STP has more options in direction (place track anywere, not just four different directions), ability to tweak the track such as pitch, angle, rotation ( none of this in RCT) ,and you can actually ride the coaster.)

Performance: both are glitchy in there own way

Humor: definately STP

Help System: RCT just plain text boxes and mesages, STP anoying little dot thing that tells you everything that you are doing ""wrong"" (can be turned off)(it does tell you useful stuff though)

Addictingness: Sim Theme Park!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4.0

My only disappointment is the lack of updates.  The game is so outdated now that it will no longer run on my PC, because of Windows XP being installed.

"Sim Them Park is a good game. One of the games largest advantages over the roller coaster tycoon series is the game's simplicity in roller coaster building and it's level of detail with shops. My main problem was it's shortage of golden tickets, items that you win by achieving certain goals,which are unknown to you. The golden tickets are used to purchase secret rides which can only be bought with the tickets. The ticket problem can be easily solved though, all you have to do is to ration out the tickets and only use them on the good rides. But, in order to know which ride is good, you have buy the strategy guide, which can also tell you what the goals are in each area. So, if you only buy the good secret rides and don't buy the bad ones, you ought to have enough tickets. I reccomend this game to everyone.",4.0

As for the game itself, yeah it's not exactly modern but still looks good todat. If you get a busy park the engine can have problems keeping up - getting a bit slow/chuggy and cleaners/guards sometimes get 'confused' on where they should be etc. A good 4/5 methinks.",4.0

We're running this on XP on three different machines in our house and my mother's and haven't had ANY problems with installation or running....It's a fun game that is much easier than the Tycoon game is....Makes it's more relaxing and enjoyable. My 6 year old enjoys it as much as myself and my own mother does. Easy to figure out and fun to play. A great anti-stress game for when you just don't to track scores or deal with difficult challenges.,4.0
"This game is meant for small children,7-16. This game is very easy to use. The problem is that if you are a first time simulation user, who is a young kid, you will be confused. Well, lets start.
-First, the annoying little guy who is constantly hastling you about things may be trying to make things better, but sadly, it aint helping. There is no option to turn it off. The first time a young child hears one of his damp jokes, he/she might laugh. After that, it is blaintly annoying.
-Second, buiding pathways, making roller coasters, and making them agree with eachother is a hard task.
And the pros:
-Very simple, if I explained it to you.
-Fun. I find that it isn't as addictive as Sim City 3000 Unlimited.
Overall:
5-8 year olds= This is good.
9-15 year olds= Stick with Roller Coaster Tycoon.
16+ year old= Try Roller Coaster Tycoon and Sim City 3000 Unlimited.",4.0
"This is a fantastic game, 100% addictive! It's a ton of fun to control a park, and you can get to the tiniest things, (the amount of fat in the burgers, how much ice is in your drinks, and how salty your fries are. You can build rides, research new ones, buy shops and sideshows, and hire staff. It's a lot of fun. There are some problems, though. In all the time I've had the game, I've built ONE rollercoaster, because I can never seem to connect the track. And even if I do finish it, it ends up being SUPER EXPENSIVE!!! Which brings me to money. You start out with a whopping $50,000, but then you lose it! I'm not exactly sure why. One minute you're rolling in dough, the next you have two bucks. Then you take out a loan, but it's impossible to pay them back, especcially with interest! It's really easy to go bankrupt, which is a pain. Graduating to new levels is awesome, but it's pretty hard! Winning your first Golden Ticket is easy, (you need GTs to get Golden Keys so you can open new parks), and so is your second one, but after that, it's very difficult. The advisor is really annoying, but unfortunately there's no way around that. He just keeps repeating things over and over and over and over and over and... you get the point. Overall, even though it could do with some touching up, the game is a ton of fun. And it's cool to have such total control over your Theme Park!!",4.0

"A Diamond In The Rough...

I can't believe I forgot to review this!  I've actually had this game for ages, and I even reviewed it's horrible sequel, Jade Cocoon 2, but I somehow forgot to actually write a review for this one.  Well, anyway, I'll get on with it.  Firstly, I should note that if you are a Studio Ghibli fan, this game should feel oddly familiar.  The art style is (from what I understand) either directly inspired by Ghibli - or the art design was actually worked on by Studio Ghibil members (not totally sure which).  The story, too, also feels pretty Ghibli-esque (but more on that later).  The only other thing I'll mention before I get into the category breakdown is that this game strangely comes in one of those double-CD cases, but only actually has one disc.  It's a pretty short game, so I have no idea what's going on with that.  Maybe the marketing department was trying to fool people into thinking the game was longer?  I have no idea...  Oh well, on with the review!

Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics are decent for their time (this game came out a couple years after Final Fantasy VII).  The cutscenes are anime-style, which is lovely because such animation  pretty much never ages.  The in-game background graphics are pretty good - they are quite detailed.  The only problem is that sometimes the backgrounds are too detailed - it can be hard to see items on the ground or to determine what is, and is not, a pathway.  The character models are kind of blocky like you'd expect for an old PS1 game, but there are in-game character portraits during dialogue, which is nice.

Music (score 7/10): The music itself is pretty average for an RPG.  It's decent, but not astoundingly good or anything.  What is of note, though, is the voice acting.  Yes, there is voice acting, which is unusual for a PS1 game.  Not just that, but the voice acting is pretty good.  I've heard better voice acting on more modern games, but for a PS1-era game, it's pretty darn good.  Believe me, I've heard much worse (Grandia comes to mind), so kudos to the developers for hiring some decent voice actors.

Characters (score 8/10):  Sigh, I really like this game, but it commits one of my most disliked offenses - it has a silent protagonist.  Levant never speaks and doesn't possess any sort of personality.  Thankfully, the other characters make up for it since they actually do have personalities.  All the characters have fairly restrained and normal personalities (versus some of the exaggerated and wacky characters you can get with a lot of RPGS), which feels pretty realistic for the setting.  Despite their demure personalities, you really start to feel sympathetic for Levant and his wife Mahbu as the game goes on.  Having an emotional investment in the characters is a hallmark of a good RPG, and Jade Cocoon succeeds on this front.

Story (score 8/10): This game can be described as light on plot but heavy on thematic elements and setting.  It relies more on it's atmosphere and themes to carry the narrative than on plot twists or an intricate storyline.  In fact, the actual plot itself is fairly simple.  A small village that has always been protected from forest monsters suddenly gets attacked one day and several villagers fall into a sleeping-sickness.  It's up to Levant and Mahbu (his newly married wife) to obtain a rare herb from the dangerous forest in order to save them.  Even though that sounds pretty simple, the actual themes are mature and thought-provoking.  Remember in the introduction  how I said this game reminds me of Studio Ghibli's works?  Jade Cocoon reminds me most of Princess Mononoke since they both have a lot of the same themes.  It literally feels like you are playing through a mythological tale or a fable of some type - in fact, the very opening of the game features a creation myth (complete with a frightening capricious deity) before the game sets you up in a more mundane human village.  The cultural setting of the game is radically different from a Western one; the people inhabiting this tiny village are very much bound up in the rigors of tradition and responsibility is put before personal feelings.  It's pretty much the opposite in theme to your typical RPG, which is all about running around the world having exciting adventures.  Instead of that sense of freedom, Jade Cocoon makes you feel the oppressiveness of this cultural tradition and the sad and weighty responsibilities put upon the young protagonists.  In fact, there are a lot of interesting concepts explored in this game, including arranged marriages, superstition and mythology, religion and creation stories, harmony and balance between humans and nature, prejudice, and morality.  The great thing about this game is that it doesn't really answer any of the moral questions it raises for you - it's up to the player to ponder themselves...

Battle System (score 7/10): The battle system is a turn-based system that will be instantly understandable to any person who's got a vested interest in RPGs.  What's different about this game is that Levant is the only character you get to fight with, and he's actually a pretty weak fighter.  You'll spend most of your time summoning monsters to fight for you.  Yes, Jade Cocoon is a bit of a monster-raising sim.  You can capture monsters of various elements (earth, fire, water, wind) to fight in battle for you.  You can also merge two of them together to improve their stats - and their appearance changes!  That's really the biggest selling point of the monster-related gameplay.  Based on what you choose to merge, you can make a monster look however you want it to.  Unfortunately, you'll usually be merging solely for stat boosts or to get certain abilities, which can sometimes produce a very fugly monster.  Still, it's an interesting mechanic to play around with.  My only complaint with the battle system itself is that the battles can feel a bit slow due to slow animations.  Speaking of which, the capturing animations are a bit too long for my taste, and even though the menu has an ""off"" option, I can't tell any difference between on and off.  Go figure.

Gameplay (score 5/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Sigh, this is where this game takes it in the rear-end.  Jade Cocoon has the worst movement system of any RPG I've ever played.  Remember those old tank-like controls that infested early Resident Evil games?  Jade Cocoon has these!  Why?!  Basically, Levant slowly pivots left and right, and pushing ""up"" goes forward no matter what direction he's facing in.  It's a good thing the battles are turn-based or this would really be a problem.  It is, however, a bit of a problem in the forests because there are on-screen enemies that are very hard to dodge with these controls.  If you hold down the Triangle button Levant will run straight forward.  Once you get used to this you can hold down Triangle and sort of steer him left and right, but it always feels awkward.  In addition to those problems, the actual button layout is irritatingly non-standard.  The Circle button opens the main menu and the Triangle button backs out of the menu.  If you've played many Final Fantasies (as well as many other RPGs), you expect that to be the opposite.  Aside from the button scheme, the actual menus used to do anything are not terribly intuitive and are more convoluted than necessary.  For example, if you go to the shop, first you have to listen to the shopkeeper make random chit chat, then you got to a buy/sell/exit menu, then you can select buy to get something.  Sounds simple enough, but no.  If you select an item, you then have to put in an extra ""yes I'm sure"" confirmation.  Then when you want to leave the shop, you can't just hit Triangle to back out, you have to select ""Exit"" and then listen to the shopkeeper give you some farewell chatting.  This problem is especially bad when you are talking to Mahbu (Levant's wife) who basically manages your monsters for you.  Whenever you need to do something with her, there's a bunch of confirmations to jump through.  This isn't a huge deal breaker of a problem, but these little extra confirmations are everywhere and they slow down the gameplay.  It just makes the game feel unpolished and for a monster-raising sim, such a slow management system is unacceptable.  On top of all the things previously mentioned, the gameplay is a bit repetitive in that there's a very simple village-forest, village-forest, village-forest pattern and you don't every get to go anywhere else.  This isn't too bad though because the game is pretty short; so it ends before the repetition drives you mad.  All things considered, what keeps this game from being fantastic are purely all these gameplay issues.

Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  It's a real shame that this game is held back by so many gameplay issues; otherwise it would've been excellent.  The whole game really feels like a diamond in the rough.  If you are an RPG enthusiast and can overlook this game's rough edges, then I still suggest you pick up Jade Cocoon.  It's worth a look if only for its unique story and atmosphere.",4.0
I'm very much enjoying this game. The graphics are grate for a PS1 game and the story line is interesting. Moving the character around is a bit awkward but it's only a minor inconvenience. I definitely suggest this game (and it's sequel) to those who want a simple monster capture and combining RPG.,4.0
this game is really cool because unlike pokemon you can merge the monsters together and if you do it in different order you will get different monsters. so if you want to get a playstation game get jade cocoon,4.0
"Don't get me wrong, this is a good game, but I would recomend renting it before you buy it. The game gives it its all, and it really tries hard to be original, but it has its drawbacks.
It IS over too quick. The monsters are sometimes very creative, butt after a while, you begin to realise that the ""150 base minions"" are just the same, with four different elements (water, wind, earth and fire). The story line is original, but you can see the end coming a million miles away.
 You will probably complete it in under twenty hours, but it would take you a long time to catch all 150 minions! If you are looking for something new, give it a try: it is an original game.",4.0

"Let me start by saying that I love this game.  It is so much like the TV game it's amazing.  There are a few problems though.  First, if you play this game 2 or more times a week by yourself you will find that categories begin repeating after 2 weeks or so.  This can really ruin the fun when you get your friends together to play and categories keep coming up that you have already played by yourself.  Second, The ""buzz in"" keys don't all have the same response time.  The player with the Ctrl key always gets in before the player with the space bar, However I was still able to win using the space bar.  Third, sometimes the audio does not come through and you end up wondering what player 3 said.  And lastly, Alex does not always ask you to be more specific when you provide just part of the question such as ""what is a bee"" instead of ""what is a honey bee"" and you will told your response is incorrect.  Having said all this I really love this game and just purchased the 2nd edition. Pete",4.0
"This game is for anyone that really likes to watch Jeopardy and wants learn something new.  I pre-qualified for the ""real"" Jeopardy.  I was never on the show however.  The question are not outrageously hard.  However, if you feel the questions are too hard ... keep playing at the same skill level.  You will have repeated categories ... that will be your test.  How good is your memory?  It is a lot of fun if you play to learn instead of play to win!
I read other reviews about the ""ring in"" keys.  The three ring in keys are, Control for player 1, Space Bar for player 2, and Shift Key for player 3.  My experience with the game is, player 1 has an advantage over 2, and players 1 & 2 have an advantage over player 3.  In another review, the writer stated that the shift key had a big disadvantage over the other two players.  I find this totally untrue on my keyboard.  So, the ""flaw"" in the game is not necessarily the same for all keyboards.
Don't let this stop you from buying the game.  For my family, the fun is more in the knowledge received from playing.  Even if you are at a disadvantage it is still fun.  And, we change seats for each game.  So, if you have the shift key (slowest ring in)for the first game you will have the control key (fastest ring in) for the second game.

"this shakes so much, at times it seems hard to stay in control of your games.  The design is smaller than what I expected, it has quite a kick, and the strength that it shakes at seems appropriate for what you hit.  it provides that extra oomph that is not provided when you don't have a jump pak or tremor pak or that Mad Catz pak.  It shakes the most when you cause rapid rumbles or when you are hit in a game.  I would have given it 4 and a half stars, but that was not available, so I put it down to 4 stars.

"Almost every Dreamcast game supports the jump pack feature.  This is because the feedback mechanism adds an extra dimension of fun and interactivity to games.  If you are wondering if it is worth the [price] to add this to your controller - yes it is.
My only complaint is that the jump pack should have been built into the original controller.  This feature is near standard in all games and it seems like a crass money grab by Sega to force you to buy a second device.
I have not tried all of the jump pack devices.  However, I have tried the TremorPak and the Dreamcast device.  I can't really tell a difference other than that the TremorPak seems to vibrate a little stronger than the Dreamcast device.  As far as compatibility is concerned, it has worked in all of my games...it has my vote.",4.0

ok, why did i give it only 4 stars ?
because after the patch to 1.1.1 and then 1.1.2 - the final comprehensive patch - freeman would still get stuck on lifts and elevators and die.
when he gets stuck you can't move him, or make him jump, and he takes damage and gets crunched.  i don't know why the patches never resolved this problem.

"I loved this game when I was a kid and wanted to play the same game again, but was worried about it not working on my Windows 7 computer. Much to my relief, it works fine! I had to do a little bit of messing around to get it to work (had to find the game application, go to compatibility and set operating system to Windows 98, and check disable visual themes, disable desktop composition, and run this program as administrator) but once I did that, it installed, started up, and runs just fine. Occasionally, while scrolling over the park, the game will freeze up a bit, but beyond that, I haven't had any issues.

As for the game itself, it's fun. It's what you want it to be--if you want to think, plan, and create the perfect park in order to beat the goals, then you can do that. If you want to cause chaos and destruction to the hapless guests at your park, you can do that, too. There's also not really an ""end"" to the game, necessarily. Even after you reach all the goals, you can keep improving (or start destroying) your parks.

There are a few small issues with the game--first off, it didn't come with a manual, but that's not THAT big of a deal since you can find instructions for the game on most gaming websites. As for the game itself, there are some issues with the visuals. Not necessarily the graphics--if you keep in mind that the game was made in the late 90s, then they're fine--but the angles make doing some things a bit awkward, especially once the park gets crowded. The controls take a bit getting used to, but the learning curve isn't so bad.

The ""funness"" of the game mostly comes from how addicting it is. It's not particularly thrilling and while it can be amusing, it's not necessarily funny, either. I don't like it as much as an adult quite as much as I liked it as a kid, but it's still a game I'm glad to have in my collection.",4.0

I think the story was the best part of the game.  Despite my personal views this really is a must have for any pc gamer as it really is the top game in its field.",4.0
"A must-kill for dedicated fans of single-player ""first person shooter"".  HL takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience.  You play Gordon Freeman, who works in the bowels of an ultra-secret, underground research facility called ""The Black Mesa"".  (Having played the game yet I'm still not sure what's supposed to be going on in BM - it's The Aftermath that matters.)  Oozing high-tech, the facility is host to the denizens of another dimension when you/Freeman accidentally...do something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own - allowing beings from that other world to enter ours.

Now, if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering cross-dimensional love, or that your fellow human beings will enter the Black Mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world, or at least to rescue you - I'm afraid you've picked up the wrong game entirely.  For in the bowels of ""Black Mesa"" you'll confront howling dog things, flying crabs, alien-zombified versions of your colleagues, gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists, aliens that hang from ceilings (and entrap their victims using these vine-looking things) and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves - including you.  If the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence, I should warn you to look elsewhere - for in ""Half Life"", you'll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a 9mm automatic, a submachine gun, grenades and (most regrettably of all) a nasty crowbar; you'll make few friends and find yourself (for the most part) alone and (not infrequently) exiled to ventilation ducts (again with the ducts!!) to avoid getting shot at by humans, or burned, bitten, bolted or tongue-bathed by aliens.

Complex problem solving skills (as much as marksmanship or bullet-saving) are crucial in this game - in which your enemies have above-average levels of AI.  There are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific mission-goal, but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them, yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve.  The game's settings are fantastic - from the vast to claustrophobic.  The game is long - uncommitted gamers may find it tedious - but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with it.

I ran this game on an XP-equipped P4, with a 64MB AGP card, and had no problems (other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans).

Also, I ahve had some issues with 3rd party mods and Steam compatability. But enough bad stuff. Half life is possibly the best shooter ever made, and even if you're not into single player gameplay, this is most likely the most modded game in history. paintball? it's there. Matrix style stunts and slo-mo stuff? they've got it out there. then there's what is the most over-rated, over-played game ever, counterstrike. Not my cuppa tea, but if it floats your boat, fine. Half life is an awesome FPS that actually has plot. This is also the only game i've ever played that has me leaning away from my monitor, and sometimes even cringing to brace myself for what happens next. It's an awesome mix of shooting, puzzle, strategy, and pure terror that it's simply amazing to play.

And lets not forget that if you get bored, you can build roller coasters to no where that send people flying to their explosive deaths. Could this game be any greater for a grade school kid?

Playing this game years later is entertaining, even addictive.  The objectives of the game usually revolve around obtaining a certain park rating and a certain number of guests. Often time, these objectives can be completed with a lot of time to spare, and it can be pretty boring to just sit around waiting out the clock.

One thing that is sometimes annoying about this game is that you MUST use the CD while playing the game. This wouldn't be a big deal, but sometimes as you're playing the game, you will start scrolling to another part of a game level and the game will momentarily freeze. It will freeze for 5 seconds or so while the CD spins up and provides the necessary information. I wish the CD rom would just load all of the necessary files onto my hard drive so I wouldn't have to deal with delays. But it is a minor issue, and the game is still enjoyable.

For some added fun, you can look up cheats for the game online. Many of them involve re-naming guests in the amusement parks and they will do certain things, including waving, painting, taking pictures, etc. Some cheats will even make the go-karts drive faster.

If you're looking for a game to take you back to your younger days or you simply want to instill the capitalistic values in your child/spouse/video game playing pet Roller Coaster Tycoon is the way to go.",4.0
I played this game already so i know its fun but i never recieved it from the mail.,4.0
"This game is a very fun and challenging game. A MUSTHAVE for 1st person players. There is strategy involved, so it's not just a ""KILL KILL KILL EVERY ONE!"" kind of game.one thing I didn't like that much was that u r a scientist whose experiment turned the surounding desert into a alien,marine, & special ops battle feild. But ur just a scientist, how would he know how to scale clifs, operate weapons from a scifi movie, and save the world with just a PHD in Theoretical physics. Like I think some one once said,""Your PHD won't save you now, doctor(Freeman)""",4.0
Very easy game to play. Build your own rides or use the ones available.,4.0
Its fun and all but STILL NO COASTER CAM!!!! i wonder why? but the game is still fun. I like the gameplay and i like the fact that it is NOT HARD!!! and the game is not boring. Graphics are goooood and not blockey if you are a roller coaster tycoon fan ther is a web site calld roller coaster tycoon . com and you can look at stuff for the game. And i like the way you make rides the game makes makeing roller coasters fun and makeing your park fun . So by thes fun and NOT hard game now you will love it!!!.,4.0
"Roller Coaster Tycoon is a game that is focusing on building an entertainment park. You can build your own themed park, rollercoaster, go-kart track, and many more. This game is released years ago and now the price has been dropped. Being low-priced doesn't always mean bad games. I played this game for months a few years ago. It has free mode where you can build your own dream entertainment park. Or you can play in mission mode in which you have to meet the requirements for each level.

The sounds in this game is pretty good, making you feel as if you are in the middle of an entertainment park. You can hear the screaming of people on the roller coaster, the tune of the Merry-go-Round, the noise of the crowd, and so on.

If you have good PCs with great graphic card, you may want to try Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 with 3D graphics with better gameplay, graphics, and sounds.

Overall, this is still a great game and really worthy. With only a few bucks, you can have another entertainment source in your PC for your weekend. :-)",4.0
"This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys jigsaw puzzles, slide puzzles, 3d puzzles, etc. without the mess or worry of lost pieces.  The picture and art are beautifully rendered and the puzzle challenge progresses at a  satisfying pace.  The best game is the focus game which could only happen  on a pc.  My only complaint (and it's a minor one) is that ""image  hole"" is nothing more than annoying and that the game with the many  magnifying glasses (can't remember the name) can be beat in about 2 minutes  even at the toughest level making it quite boring.  Luckily thats only 2 of  the 10 puzzle types.  The rest are great.  I finally completed the quest by  solving only 180 of the puzzles but look forward to working the others and  to reworking the old puzzles trying to improve my best times.  Highly  recommended",4.0
"My sister gave me Pandora's Box for Christmas, and I find solving the puzzles just like a bag of potato chips-- you can't solve just one and stop. The puzzles are nicely varied (although they are all  spatial-relationship puzzles), so you don't feel stuck doing the same  things over and over. I'm not so good at puzzles, so I may never get past  Level 3, but even that will have provided hours of entertainment. My only  gripe? The HINTS are not well done. When you need a hint, you want some  strategic advice, not to slide piece A to the left.",4.0
"This is a very good game. I used to play this game for hours on end. It's a lot of fun. The best part about it is that you don't need to have a supercomputer to play it. For those of you who's computers can't handle RCT 3, buy this game. Do Not get RCT 2, it's not worth the money to buy a slightly worse carbon copy of a great game.",4.0
the only problem was the story was a tiny bit hard to follow till you  think it over after you beat it and the ending wasn't at good as it could  have been but this game is great wait wondering which game im talkin about  in this set lol? im talkin about number 2 a puzzle of flesh i haven't gotten  to play my copy of number 1 yet hehe.the game is great curtis craig is the  man and this game rocks go get it if you can still find it! extremley gory  and scarey!,4.0
"Ever wanted to be a scientist, but never had the aptitude for it? Ever wanted to join the Army or the Marines, but couldn't because you were flat-footed? Well, you can rejoice now, because Half-Life will solve both those problems with one blow. You start off as an intelligent scientist named Gordon Freeman. You work at a place called Black Mesa, which is like Area 51. After an informative train-ride, you get off, have some chit-chat with the guards and get your suit. I was very impressed with how professional the level looked. Security guards, retina scanners, the works. This ain't your local bank. After getting your suit, you go to a room where an experiment is about to take place. You're a crucial part of it. But wait, the scientists are sounding as if something might go wrong. And then you push the specimen into the beam and . . . and shortly after that you'll be experiencing one of the finest moments in video game history. Remember that nice-looking level I was telling you about? Now visualize it with HEAVY damage, dead or dying scientists and guards and aliens popping out of thin air. AND YOU HAVE NO WEAPON! This is no Quake cake-walk with John Wayne heroics. You'll be CRAWLING in FEAR for most of the game.  I think one of the main things that made this game popular was this: It touched on the common fear of going into the unknown and feeling ill-prepared for what lies ahead. Sure, you might have 200 rounds on the MP5, a rocket launcher, and whatever else, but believe me, it won't last long (especially on hard mode).  Another thing that this game touched on was this: The fear of small spidery-creatures and large, ugly, T-Rex things that can run faster than you. Believe me when I say you'll jump when you stick your head in a tunnel and a snark or headcrab jumps out at you. After a while you manage to arm yourself and try and make it to the surface . . . only to find that Marines are attacking Black Mesa in an effort to cover up the severe accident! So now we have this ugly Bermuda Triangle of Marines, Aliens, and You. The Aliens are just plain bad.  You're just trying to get your innocent rear-end out of there. And the Marines are just following orders. Makes for one whopper of a story and a game.  But not all is run-and-gun. MANY times you'll be jumping like Mario, making well-timed decisions, and solving puzzles. But besides all that, there are three other things about this game that I like: 1)A flashlight. It's ABOUT TIME someone did something to light those dark levels. 2)Humor. Guards goof around with experimental technology--with disastrous results. 3)Well-lighted levels overall. The only FPS I've seen with more light is Serious Sam. Very rarely will you be squinting your eyes in this game.  To wrap things up, my favorite levels are the beginning one and the one entitled Surface Tension. Despite some wonderful level design in this game, I really hated the alien levels. Sure, they LOOKED nice, but when you start playing them it's a different story. Also, the two endings are too short and unsatisfactory. But overall this is a GREAT game, worth getting even now (especially if you haven't played it before), despite the fact that Return to Castle Wolfenstein (and other FPS's) are around the corner.",4.0
This game is will go great with the add ons. But i love this game with Gordon and all the other civilians and scientists and security.... But this game has very cool weapons and very cool monsters. But this game is not reccomended for young users because of major violence and gore. And Multiplayer is a blast. BUT DONT EVER GIVE AWAY YOUR CD KEY IF YOU DO YOU MAY NEVER PLAY HALF LIFE MULTIPLAYER AGIAN! Dont even copy the cd for your friends. But this game has everything i expected with excellent graphics. Everyone will enjoy this game im sure. But 4 stars is my rating because i cant give anything 5 stars unless its AWESOME AND HAS NOTHING WRONG.,4.0
"Rollercoaster Tycoon takes in the path of all simulation games but adds more to it. First of all this game is highly addictive. I played for 5 hours straight without noticing the time. Next, It is hard to beat some levels but, that shouldn't be a problem. Last, I reccomend the 2nd one more than this. Thanks for reading!",4.0
"""Roller Coaster Tycoon"" is a really fun game where kids can design their own amusement park complete with rides, food stalls, souvenier stands, and much more! You start off by choosing where you want your park to be. Some choices include Bumbly Beach, Forest Frontiers, Diamond Heights, Dynamite Dunes, and many more. (at the beginning you start off woth five choices for your amusement park setting) Each setting has a goal. For example, you may have to have 650 guests in your park by October, year 3, with a park rating of at least 600. You can name your park, charge admission fees, pick rides (as you progress more choices are available), put footpaths and sidewalks, hire staff, and put food stalls and rest rooms. But beware- you only start off with ten thousand dollars! To earn more money you need to depend on guests and profits from the food and rides! The more successful your park is, the more new rides and attractions are available for you! After you meet your goal, new scenery is available for your park. My only problem with the game is that it's WAY too realistic. One time one of my roller coasters actually crashed, causing deaths of everyone who was on the ride! Another time I built a ride over the water and forgot to put a path leading from the exit, so guests actually drowned! (stupid me!) Plus, your staff dosn't always listen to you. (Not to mention you need to pay them every month!) I once spent nearly an hour trying to get one of my mechanics to fix a ferris wheel! Overall, Roller Coaster Tycoon is a wonderful game, and very fun to play, but the realism is a little too real!",4.0
"This game is a good game for those who are into the Sim games such as Sim Mania, Sim Golf, etc.  It has a wide variety of features to make the game more realistic.  These features include a selection of various scenarios to play, researching rides and attractions, design and build your own ride, ride break downs, vandalism, litter, and financial graphs and information.  One thing that I do not like about the game is the fact that you are unable to ride the rides you create like you are able to do in Sim Theme Park.  This game does not take up many system resources and comes with all the required software that is needed to play.  Overall, I gave Roller Coaster Tycoon four out of five stars.",4.0
"Great game. Challenging, beautiful graphics.
Don't know why they never made another version.
Could have been a great series.",4.0
Good arrangement of puzzles made to get the brain working.  Gets addicting after a while.  All around fun and challenging.,4.0
"Ok , just like everyone sez, this IS one of the best games ever made and you SHOULD buy it immediately.  But it does have some flaws.
 First of all, a lot of the weopons in this game i don't like. There is only one machine gun ...only one shotgun ..one pistol , etc.  Cmon, wheres the variety??
Second, the Team Fortress add on that comes with this game really sucks. It is no where near as good as counterstrike.
Anyways,  Buy Half Life and download Counterstrike for free of the net.",4.0
"I have to say that even a long time after it's release, this game still keeps me entertained. The graphics are great, the atmosphere is amazing, the AI is incredible! Altogether one excellent game. There are loads of different puzzles, and there isn't any faffing around with end of level bosses.
There are few downpoints though, even in a game of this standard. The direct x graphics mode is terrible, and the open GL is not compatible with my card, even though open GL works fine with my card in other games. More general pitfalls are that it takes time to get going - there's no way to skip the intro which isn't that relevant to what's going on anyway. The first few levels provide little entertainment. 3/4 of the way through, you get thrown into some alien planet, which almost stops the game dead. It sometimes feels a bit linear as well.
However, enough moans coz the good outwieghs the bad by a long shot. This contains all the elements that SiN should've had.",4.0
"First of all, let me say that I truly loved Half-Life. It was the very first game that my husband and I bought for our first computer and it was wonderful! The graphics were truly amazing, the storyline was great, and the progression was very good also. It was well worth the 40 dollars I paid for it.
However, there were a few problems. Because the game is so layered, multidimensional and realistic, I felt it was necessary to have the guide book to walk me through it.  For me, the game was impossible to play with out it. The other thing I didn't like was the ending of the story.  I won't spoil it for any one but I will say that I felt the creators just sort of gave up at the end. The last few levels and especially the way it ends are very abrupt. I thought it would be a lot better than it was. So--in some ways it was a let down.
But--overall this is a truly great game. It was definitly worth the money and the time! I would definitly recommend it!",4.0
"This game has it's ups and it has it's downs.
UPS: It is so much fun. Me and my brother play it all the time. I just bought the Loopy Landscape 1 and it has a whole new twist 2 it. It has a park where you have unlimited cash. If you haven't bought this game, you r crazy!
DOWNS: It takes 2 long for the people to create the rides. In the unlimited cash 1, my guest will get all mad because i have boring rides and i'm like ""Just hold on while people make better rides you little ...!
Besides all of that, this game is good. You should buy it.",4.0
This is a good game and my 11 year old son loves to play it.  This game can be installed on a PC running Windows XP Home Edition and will run fine but you can get better performance if you use the Windows Compatibility Wizard.,4.0
"The script to this game comes from a movie screenplay writer, and the plot is actually interesting in this game and it really set standards for what first person shooters have to be in the future to be any good. Its VERY easy to get addicted to Team Fortress Classic, part of this game's release, and one of the most challenging computer games I've ever played online is Counterstrike, a very detailed version of Team Fort, which is a downloadable MOD for the Half-Life engine. Whether playing Half-Life alone, or playing the multi-player online versions, this game shines through as a definite must have for any action computer gamer.",4.0
"Boy this is a tough one to write about. How can I fairly review a game  that has resided on my hard drive since the very day it was released? For  the technical minded, Half-Life (H-L) is based on a modified Quake 2  engine, but the modifications simply blow Quake away in almost every  aspect. Valve made an excellent move with this choice. It is well known in  the gaming community that Quake's engine has some of the most stable  networking code in the business. Too bad the video compatibility is a  little odd. For the gamer at heart, this game may have a . . . half life  longer than Quake itself. Valve made a good move allowing the gaming  community to have the WorldCraft level editor and other SDK software. What  this means to the average player is that a simple jaunt to a good web page,  will yield every manner of new levels, characters, and baddies to download  and install to their hearts content. And with Valve's Op-for expansion  pack, this game will take up a large amount of space on a lot of hooked  players' computers.
One of the most notable modifications to Half Life is  the apparently intelligent enemies. Shoot the ""dogs"" and they'll  run for cover and regroup with their pals. Let the marines see or hear you  and they'll drop a hand grenade on your head. Ninja's don't just run into  you, they jump over your head and land behind you. Crabs pop up at the most  inconvenient times. A well designed level and a poorly designed level is  differentiated by the ""intelligence"" of the enemies. Although the  modifications are great, they are certainly predictable to an extent. Play  the game enough and you'll eventually spot patterns to the enemies  ""thinking"".
So of course, after defeating the game forward and  backwards it would be time to test the Quake engine network code. Needless  to say, a 56k modem is NOT recommended. Even though with my experience the  network game play is better than the Unreal engine, the modem does this  game sad justice. Hopping up to anything better than a 56k modem really  makes this game shine. Valve has multi-player levels packed right in with  this game, nice big areas with lots of weapons make this game a fun  ""frag-fest"". The levels don't have that disgusting  ""dark"" feel to them. Underground levels have suitable colors and  lighting. Out door levels have an expansive feeling (although no where near  the ""out door"" feeling that Unreal does so well). Too bad that  H-L has compatibility problems with various video cards.
It's really not  so much compatibility problems it's really more that valve's default  settings for the are usually not the correct settings. (The voodoo video  family suffers the worst from this.) By default the video gamma is far too  bright for the voodoo 2 card. The decals have the incorrect value. Lighting  don't appear correctly. And SLI seems to have an odd effect on the game.  Most cards have their unique set of problems, and all of these adjustments  have to be done at the command level. Not something to be done by the  average gamer.
And this game screams to be played by all gamers. With  many advanced gamers using the enclosed Software Developer's Kit (SDK) and  WorldCraft to make new levels, and in some cases, completely new games.  Valve guaranteed H-L's place in the gaming community. Even if the average  player has no idea how to use the software to create new levels, they can  still go to numerous web sites and download any number of home made levels.  The  Opposing Force expansion pack and the upcoming Gunman game are direct  descendants of users and their Valve's SDK That are purchasable in the  store while hot downloads like They Hunger and D.S.S. Darkstar add free  life to the game.
This leads up to the final gripe with H-L, though not a  major one. I have the Team Fortress Classic (TFC) expansion, the Opposing  Force pack and numerous ""user made"" levels and my directory  continues to grow. Currently the space taken by H-L and the various packs,  levels, and extras has reached 912 MB of space. In contrast Diablo 2 (Full  installation) is 1.10 GB, while Diablo 1 is only 10.1 MB! The game's are  growing guys and gals, so the PC requirements should be followed like a  bible.
All in all I would have given more than five stars if the system  would have allowed me to do so. But I admit I had to take at least one star  away, I did this to force a point onto most people who wish to own a copy  of H-L. The game can be played right of the box but to get the full effect  of the game, you're going to need to edit the auto start and configuration  files. Voodoo 2 owners used to have the H-L Voodoo Doctor but alas, I have  not seen his web page in months. H-L really does not like the Voodoo card.  ATI Rage Fury does a little better, but you'll get a bizarre  ""ghost"" on occasion. The TNT family does the best out of the  bunch with the default values. I understand Valve is working on this issue  in H-L 2 (TFC 2?)  but we'll have to wait and see. Congrats Valve, this  game shoved Quake, Quake 2, Unreal, and Duke Nukem 3D permanently off of my  drive. I've since gotten a dual 13 GB drive configuration (26 GB total),  I've never even bothered to dust off those games. With the purchase of  Bungee software by Microsoft (Please God, Don't let Halo and Oni be X-Box  only games.) , the Multi-Player nature of Quake 3, and Duke Nukem (with the  Unreal engine) on a perpetual release date, H-L will be a tough game to  knock off the ""Game of the Year"" throne. Has H-L cursed the first  person shooter genre? Are developers afraid to knock the king out of the  ring? It may look that way.",4.0
"We finally found a computer game my daughter likes!  It's way too old for her (she's 7), and we actually bought it for me.  But the kids got so excited watching me play that they have dived in themselves.  The game includes some built in ""cheats"" (if you solve some puzzles, you win a token that will give you hints or even solve a puzzle you are having trouble with) so it doesn't get too frustrating for the younger players.  And the underlying stories are fascinating for them -- they want to find more trickster stories about Anansi and other folk tale characters in the program.  I don't think my kids would have had the attention span to stick with it until they saw me spending time on it and solving the puzzles, however.",4.0
"At first I was slightly annoyed that all the puzzles were purely graphic-- I was hoping that there would be brain teasers and logic games and such as well. But the puzzles are gorgeous, addictive, and incredibly calming. Whenever I get stressed out, I like to play this game. A few puzzle types got a little redundant, but overall it's a pretty addictive program.",4.0
"Sick of violent games? Tired of Solitaire? Myst got you down? Then Pandora's Box is for you.  A game geared toward the thinking man (or woman), there is no violence or sexist images, just thought provoling games, riddles and brain teasers.",4.0
"This game had great graphics, effects and sound for a puzzle game! The puzzles were pretty interesting, and fun to do, though in the higher stages, I felt that luck had a lot more to do with winning than thinking  about it, but hey it's a game. A great way to pass the time!",4.0
I really enjoy each type of puzzle. Then seeing what the picture is when the puzzle is complete.  I also liked the fact that after the puzzles are complete they each tell something about the picture and that the pictures  are something located in the city that you are in.  I think that the  instructions are very good and I would recommend this to my friends.,4.0
"This is a thoroughly addictive game. The graphics are great, and the puzzles are neither too easy nor too difficult. But it does get progessively harder and more complex the more puzzles one solves... One  drawback (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that I have to completely  exit each and every application running at the time, even those in the  background (that's right: CTRL-ALT-DEL and close everything in the list  except for Explorer and Systray) before I can play Pandora. This also  happens on my other computer system. It sure ties up resources, but other  than that: intriguing, and it has the power to keep you at your PC all  night (no kidding!).",4.0
"Pandora's Box is a engrossing, entertaining puzzle game. It kept me occupied for hours, and made time flow at twice the regular rate (or so it seemed). The puzzle types were unique, original, and for the most part fun.  Here are some pros and cons:
PROS:
  * Puzzles are presented in a  game format.  There is always a larger reason to finish a puzzle - to  progress through the levels.
  * Levels become more challenging.  It  took me almost three hours to finish the final level.
  * Hints and  Free Puzzles are plentiful.  If you don't like a puzzle type, you don't  have to do it.  If your stuck, you can use a hint.
  * The 3D aspect  of the puzzles was really neat-o.
  * When you are done, there are  still puzzles left to do.  The game includes 350 puzzles, and I still had  125 left when I was done.  The fun continues.
  CONS:
  *  Perhaps this was just my video card, but some of the puzzles seemed dark -  so dark that I couldn't see where I was placing puzzle pieces.
  *  Some of the puzzles rotate, and require fine mouse movements to complete.  If you have a physical impairment, you may have trouble.
  * I thought  a few (2) of the ten puzzle types were rather lame.  All luck and little  thought.  But that may be just me.
  All in all, this is a great game  for all puzzle fans.  I definitely recommend it - if you have time you want  to lose.",4.0
"Since I purchased this game a couple of months ago I have played it almost every single day.  This game is FUN.  The multiplayer is just as exciting now as it was when I first started playing.  The single player, on the  other hand, is not as enjoyable.  It is ok, but not as addictive as the  multiplayer.  In fact, I have yet to play through the entire single player  game yet.  I am only about half way through.
Team Fortress Classic is an  amazingly fun game.  They were geniuses to include the game with this  edition.  This game brings a whole new life to multiplayer, it goes so far  beyond the standard deathmatch-kill-everything-you-see.  It brings actual  strategy and the need for cooperation between teammates.  I can't wait for  Team Fortress 2.",4.0
"This game is great.  It has the same basis as Sim City only you control all aspects of an amusement park.  You are given objectives for each level that you must complete in order to unlock more levels.  Once you have completed all the levels, you gain the right to build your own amusement park with no restrictions.  The best part of this game is the fact that you build the rides individually.  You can create your version of the best roller coaster ever, and see if the guests like it as much as you do.  This game does get repetitive after a while though, as every Sim City type game does.",4.0
"This game enables you to design your own rollercoasters. From very little to the corkscrew you can design your coaster anyway you'd like. Also have to manage your park higher custodians,mechanics,and animals to keep your costomers happy. Do advertisments to attract people to your park with coupons.  Build refreshment stands to keep your costomers in your park.",4.0
"I am normally not a real big fan of ""sim"" type games, so I waited a while to buy this one.  I didn't like it all that much at first, but after picking it up I really got to like it.  This game is very precise and fairly realistic, which makes it hard to learn, but also a lot of fun to play once you have.
The animation and sound in this game are spectacular.  You build all sorts of amusement park attractions for your guests, and then you watch them walk around your park like little ants.  All of the sounds of a theme park are there.  The clickety-clack of the roller coaster chains, the screams of the riders as the coaster plunges down the hill, and the laughs of the children and yes.  The programmers even included the cheesy music that they play for the bumper cars.
Anything that moves can be clicked on and examined.  The level of precision and the amount of choices that you have in this game are fantastic, and sometimes overwhelming.  The game consists of twenty-some scenarios that gradually get harder.  Each time that you finish one, you get a new challenge, which keeps the game from getting too easy as you become more proficient.
The roller coasters have realistic physics.  This is both good and bad.  The good part -- if you are a roller coaster enthusiast, then you will love being able to design a working coaster.  You control everything, from the height of the first drop to the colors of the trains.  The bad part - designing even a mediocre coaster can get very tedious and expensive.  One big coaster will chew up all of your cash, and if you are playing a short scenario, you probably won't be able to build another one.  In addition, coasters take up a lot of space, and because of this, your park usually runs out of it.  I have played almost all of the scenarios, and I have never really gotten to build the ""ultimate"" mega-coaster.
The one aspect of this game that I found to be annoying was the tendency of kids to get sick from your rides.  This aspect of the game was BADLY overdone (maybe the writers thought it was supposed to be cute).  Even if they don't get sick, a lot of them will be afraid to ride it.  The park customers are total wimps.  You can build a 120-foot tall standup roller coaster with 3 inversions and nobody will ride it, because it is too ""intense"" (whatever that means).  The roller-coaster physics might be realistic, but the customer behavior definitely is not.  This is one of a few examples of questionable AI in this game.  Still, as a roller-coaster enthusiast, I thoroughly enjoyed this game.",4.0
"Looking for a good, clean game that will get you hooked for hours? Maybe you're a parent and are looking for a non-violent game to let your youngsters play... This is a great non-violent game that is fun, because it allows us to do what we like to do in real life... go to an amusement park!
In this game, you will manage an amusement park, and be responsible for all operations of that park. You must hire staff, set prices, build attractions, and keep your guests happy. Sounds easy? Not so... this game is difficult enough to keep it interesting for the older players and simple enough to be enjoyable to younger players.
This game grows as you grow. Each time you beat a park, the game unlocks a new park that is more difficult than the last one. Don't think you just move straight through though... You can continue in your park for as long as you like...
The graphics in this game are pretty good on machines running Windows ME and 98, but not so great on XP. You can still play the game, you will just need to deal with some older looking graphics. The interface is simple and easy to use, you just need to drag track wherever you want it laid, and the rules are simple... You have nearly complete customization over your park, so you can truly make this your park, if you don't like the way something looks all you need to do is change it...
This simple game, is very fun and will have everyone hooked for hours! Try it, you will like it!",4.0

It's definitely a great game, although the graphics aren't quite up to snuff with today's technology, but you get over that.  It definitely has challenges, too, so don't think you can just breeze through the scenarios.  A definite buy for your family gamer.",4.0

"Especially the three newer machines('76, Haunted House, & Pool Table Pinball).

Accurate stereo sound follows action on each table.  The wife thinks there's a real pinball machine in the room I use as my office. LOL!

One caveat:  Video rendering on Vista & later may not be perfect.  MS Pinball arcade was from the pre-widescreen days and does not adjust itself to 4:3 on widscreen displays.  Suggestion: Use Low or Medium graphics option for best compromise of viewable playing table.

Aside from that, MS Pinball Arcade is a gem and a must for any home with kids or a retro arcade fanatic in residence.  Give the kids a break from the bullets, blood, and car-wrecks of modern video games!  Put them in front of the PC & keyboard and let them at this Pinball collection!  :)",4.0
"If you love pinball, GET THIS while you still can!! It's the closest you'll ever come to actually PLAYING (let alone OWNING) some of the old-school pinball games - and by ""old-school"", I mean some of the VERY FIRST pinball games ever created! ""AMAZE YOUR FRIENDS"" with these old games, and enjoy the 3 NEWER games, too, which are worth the price of this package all by themselves. Trust me - the graphics, sound effects, mechanical response, and overall look and feel of these games is BY FAR the most realistic I've ever experienced since playing the actual games themselves. If only Microsoft had taken the time to re-create more pinball games!! :(",4.0
"I miss pinball.  I'm old now, but loved these old games as a kid growing up in the 70's and 80's... many an afternoon and many a quarter dropped on the boardwalk arcade and motel game rooms down the Jersey shore.  Well, real pinball machines range from around $700 to 5-7 thousand and take up a lot of space.  A bit impractical (though I've been tempted...)  The next best thing is this old sim game from Microsoft.  They did a masterful job, really, recreating the old Gottlieb games but they also screwed up a bit.  The concept was to give the history of pinball from the 30's on up, so the offerings are sequential.  But that means there simply are too many old games that aren't much fun to play.  Microsoft should have skipped the first few - the first doesn't even have flippers, and included more classic games from the 60's and 70's.  All the games are Gottlieb, which is fine, it would have been really nice if Bally, Stern, or Williams games were included but Gottlieb made many a fine table.  Microsoft really did a super job with its use of actual bitmap graphics from the genuine classic pinball tables and they also used the real game sounds.  I've played other, newer PC and game system pinball - and they're fine, but rely on 3D graphics, not actual bitmaps and the games are ""made up"" by the game designers - not actual pinball tables. Ball physics are fine, maybe a little jittery on infrequent occasions, but excellent overall.  This is the only game (to my knowledge) that recreates the classic games of old.  I had this on an old system  the long ago gave up the ghost, and repurchased it for an XP box recently because I missed not having it installed to get a quick pinball and nostalgia fix. This game is so old (late 90's) that XP isn't listed as an OS option.  You have to right-click on the installation exe, click compatibility, select Windows NT in the drop-down box, click the ""apply"" button before installation and it will run fine on XP... probably Windows 7 and (yecch) Vista too.  Bottom line, there are other PC pinball games.  But this is the only one that gives you a genuine recreation of actual tables.  I only wish the oldest games included -  Baffle Ball, Humpty Dumpty, and Knock Out were replaced with better games.  But Spirit of 76, Haunted House, and Cue Ball Wizard are really fun to play, with Spirit of 76 being my favorite.",4.0

"First off understand this, if you are looking for flash which most of the people who wrote negative reviews here were, skip this.  However, if you want a really good trip into retro pinball land then this package is a sure winner and a great value.  Lets face it, I can't go down to my corner drugstore and play Knockout or Slick Chick or any of the other oldies.  What is wonderful about this package is I can sit home in my underwear in front of my PC and experience pinball the way 2 generations before me did.  On my first few plays on Humpty Dumpty I was like, ""this is dumb"", the ball just drains, no flippers at the bottom.  But spend some real time with this game and you see why Microsoft choose to include it in the package.  My thoughts are that the 1st five games are totally retro and I enjoyed them immensely, however, the last 2, Haunted House and Cue Ball could of been left out and I wouldn't of cared, hence the 4 stars.",4.0
"This game is very very good, because it has the real-life thinking, it runs on slow computers, like mine, it doesn't that that much space up, and it's fun too. The only probalm with this game is the money, there isn't any free-for-all levels, which makes it less-addidive, there are lots of things to do, completing parks takes too long, and too hard though. (The money)
There is hunger, Thirst, Happyness, Nausa, and Bathroom, I like to rise the money for bathroom a lot, so people after it hits really high, they have to go. The downside to this game is, even if you make a great park, if your people have to pay everytime they go on a ride, they get broke, and leave, or get mad, trying to find there way out (This happened to me) so just make park enternce 60 dollars, and everything free. (even food) What my 2nd favorite thing to do in the game is, make roller costers that stack on each other, you can make a roller by just ONE land by.... Rising the land first, not too high though, then get a roller coster picked, the put the first roller coster path on the high land you made, and build on! You can make lots of stuff, in a small area! Graphics, ok, this is good, but nothing like what today is, plus, people can get stuck on Water Rides, for no reasons, and it isn't perceft on making a good life like roller coster because parts show on and off, Graphics:4/10 Fun, this game is the MOST addidive game ever! Fun:9.5/10 Gameplay, this can last you, like 100+ hours Gameplay:10/10 Sound, this is a bad thing in the game, like only the sound of kids and roller costers, needs SOUND:5/10 Overall, this game is great, if you like fun games, get this:8/10 which is Great, and 4 stars goes to Roller Coster Tycoon!",4.0

"So here's a game that every RTS player should have, or have played by now. StarCraft is the quintessential entry in every PC gamer's library. If it wasn't for the hyper-success of this game Blizzard might never have become the giant that it is today. I bought this about two months ago, gearing myself up for the latest StarCraft 2 expansion (which will, at last, complete the StarCraft 2 saga) and to replace a copy of the game that barely worked, probably won't, ever again with its surface so badly marred, and lacked Brood War the SC expansion.

What's there to say that hasn't already been said? After finishing the first campaign (Terran) I can safely say this game still rocks.

The story is decent but I won't spoil that for those rare few who haven't tried it. Suffice to say the StarCraft galaxy is a place of war, aliens, betrayal and politics.

The graphics aren't much to look at but, then again, this game is almost 20 years old! For its time the cartoonish images were astounding. Now they're plastic. On that note, if you're playing StarCraft on Windows 7 or later you're going to have a hard time getting it to not look a hippie drug-trip. For some reason updating StarCraft to its final version (done by connecting to battlenet and letting it auto-patch) breaks some sort of compatibility with Windows. There's a couple ways to get it running and looking as it should. An internet search will provide you with the answers you seek. For me, it involves booting up the game, closing WindowsExplorer then alt+tab back to game. Fixed my color distortion instantly but might not for you. Never fear there are other ways.

The sound is one area where this game still gets a glowing recommendation. I can't tell you how awesome it is to hear the Tank go into Siege Mode. If you line up five or more at the head of an enemy rush they will unleash an barrage that's as memorable for its effect as it is for the sound. When the computer says, ""Nuclear Launch Detected"" your heart skips a beat as you frantically try to find the Ghost whose painted some part of your base for obliteration. And of course there's the witty chatter each type of unit has, a staple of Blizzard RTS-games. Click on any unit enough and it'll start on its own unique dialogue. And this is just the Terran sounds, Zerg are a bit less human a bit more... Zerg. And the Protoss, well you'll have to play it.

Gameplay is where the game shows a bit more age. Tactically speaking your units can be stupid. There are no battle formations to speak of. Your troops, if not specifically ordered or controlled (you form squads by Ctrl+#, up to 10), will rush as one mass into enemy fire. Where do you think the term Zerg Rush came from? That being said, the real fun comes when you master each unit and learn how to command them in chaotic battles. The diversity of the units in StarCraft remains, to this day, the bar for all RTS. Every unit fulfills a specific role, each has a certain attack speed, movement speed, armor rating, and some have special abilities. And because there are no real hero units you have to rely on everything instead of just one big guy backed up by cannon fodder. You might get lucky in the Campaign, just throwing heaps of troops at the enemy. But this is ineffective and hideously expensive (All units cost Minerals and Vespian Gas). In the end you don't feel like you've done much, either. Cunning tactics trump mindless ones. This is especially true in Brood War where what StarCraft was missing, the Brood made up for.

The Legacy of StarCraft is one that impacted nearly every RTS which came after it. Where before units were largely the same, some often just a reskin of what another faction had (some not even a reskin; just a straight copy), afterwards they all had to be different. They even had to cost different. (A basic troop for Terran is different from a basic troop for Zerg or the Protoss in every way.) They all had to be multi-task able. And they needed some darn personality.

It's a legacy that I'm enjoying just as much as I did the first I played. The sum of its parts is greater than each part by itself and I highly recommend this game.",4.0

"This game is more of a story than a game.  As an RPG game, it is quite linear in plot.  There are not as many subplots and/or different endings as other role playing type games.  However, there is a tight story being told throughout the game.
Fans of the fantasy book series this game is based on will find many things familiar here, as well as see some places more fully explored.  Also, in the Feist style, the characters you see are gripping and memorable.

"Age of empires came out in 1997 and is still a exiting game to play anytime. It is a game that never gets old but can get tedius sometimes.
1. The sound in age of empires is good for its time but now you can notice it is outdated but thats not that big of a deal because its old of course. Some sound is good such as lions growling in the distance but some sounds are obviously canned which is heard in cartoons etc. 2. The graphics are solid for a 10 year old game and the citizen modles are 3-d and have good textures. The tedius part of the graphics is when citizens are close to each other or if they are near trees and the end of the map they will get stuck and will not get to their destination. 3. There is good value in AOE but the population limit is only 50 but the positive thing about the pop limit is that every other nation has the same thing. There are good game modes for random map like wonder victory but conqest is a little tedius because in order to win you have to destroy every unit instead to destroy a town center. The campiegns are fun and there are many of them but even on easiest they are kinda hard and frustraiting but still have more options than a random map. Creating a scenario is most fun because you can have more than 50 people. For scenario creator you can have a 500 millitary fight on each side and can be very fun and exieting.
Overall AOE is a very good game and I would recommend it to anybody who likes real time stategy game or anybody who likes older history games.",4.0

"Every 'Age of Empires' edition has been great, and now with II and III's enhanced gameplay, graphics and campaigns, it is easy for people to forget the landmark game that started it all - Age of Empires I.

There are plenty of historical campaigns to try and complete, you can play randoms maps, death matches(pretty much the same as random map,)and you can create and play scenarios and campaigns(my favourite part of the game).

There are plenty of 'hero' characters as they are called, these are just people that lived back then(Hector, Jason, Hannibal etc.) And to accompany these you can create different types of soldiers that can be advanced as you advance through time.

This is a challenging game, especially when the difficulty level is set to anything over 'normal'.
The control over economy, farming resource management, castle building and military design is wonderful. The graphics are good for a game of its age as do the sounds.
Military battles are reminiscant of Warcraft controls.
It has run very successfully on my Windows XP box and sounds beter than ever through Audigy.

"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked this game up. At first I was struck as to how much it resembles WARCRAFT (ORCS VS. HUMANS). Most of the level advancing, character animation and general game play is almost identical. At then end of the day, the purpose is to beat your enemy by advancing through civilizations and either conquering them, retrieving artifacts or constructing a wonder. The game is addictive, especially at the higher levels. If you can, try the multiplayer versions. There's nothing quite like playing against someone else. There are a few annoying little things. You can lose your people behind buildings and, in some cases, they get lost if sent on a roundabout route to their destinations. However, still a fun game and highly recommended.",4.0
"This is a great game, for the first month-and-a-half I was totally addicted.  The game has you thinking about every aspect of the park.  The rides, yor financial state, your employees, even the people themselves.  you can actually click on a single person and see how hungry they are, if they fell sick, if they have to go to the bathroom, and what ride intensity they prefer.  There are only two reasons that it did not recieve a five star rating from me.  Number one, when you build a roller coaster you must be extreemly carefull not to make the ride too intense or too nauseating, or else nobody will want to ride it.  Nuber two, after a while I found myself becoming board of the game, however it was probobally because I played it for so long without playing anything else.  So I suggest if tou find yourself frustrated or board with the game, stop playing it and do something else for a week or two.  I promise that when you pick it up again you will be perfectly hapy with it once again.",4.0

"So I got this because I used to play it way back when. And have fond memories of it. I feel like I got back in a bad relationship. After playing Rise of Nations or Age of Empires, this game really shows its age. It is an exercise in tedium. Its not the game's fault its still a decent RTS, I guess I'm used to not having to micro my producer units so much, and I had forgotten that you can only select 6 to 8 units at a time. So I give the game 4 stars because its still a good game, its my fault for having looked back through rose colored glasses. But I gave 2 stars for fun factor, since it's not really all that fun anymore.

I played through about half of each of the races and have been playing Rise of Nations since. But hey, for $10 I'll live.",4.0

Amazon says this game will work on a Mac or a PC, which is true, but only to an extent.  On a Mac, you can play the full campaign and the multiplayer, but you can't use the map editor.

"I've enjoyed StarCraft ever since it came out. I loved it, and even to this day, I enjoy playing it. StarCraft is just one of those games that I've continued playing over the years. It has everything a great game needs: good graphics and sounds, compelling story, well-developed characters, and balanced, interesting units. If you're interested in getting StarCraft 2, but have never played this, do yourself a favor: skip out on StarCraft 2 and buy this instead.

For the most part, I play StarCraft for the single player campaign. Not only is it fun, but the characters actually make you care about them. For me, the characters are the most compelling aspect of the single player campaign.

Gameplay-wise, I can't really say that StarCraft is much of an innovator. Nevertheless, the three races are well balanced and packed with interesting units. There are only two resources, but the resources themselves actually managed to be fairly interesting to me for a while. The single player campaign has well over 40 missions (with StarCraft and BroodWar combined). There are also a few cutscenes for each race.

The voice acting is fantastic. The characters end up being well developed, and like I said before, they make you care about them. The voice actors really made their characters come to life. The unit sounds are also very well done, and are fairly distinct.

As far as video game plots go, StarCraft's is pretty good. There's nothing really amazing in there, but it still manages to be interesting.

The graphics are pretty good; they bring the dark, gritty universe of StarCraft to life.

Good as it is, StarCraft still has its share of problems. For starters, you can only select 12 units at a time. This ends up being fairly irritating, as more often then not, the player will have a large force but will be unable to select all his or her units, which can be a pain if you're in the middle of a large battle. The unit pathing isn't that great, either. The units in StarCraft can't take care of themselves very well. Total Annihilation's pathing is quite a lot better, and you can select more then 12 units at a time.

Those two problems are my only real gripes with StarCraft. The units are interesting, the characters (and voice-acting) are fantastic, and the three races are very well-balanced. There's a reason that StarCraft is one of the most celebrated RTS games of all time; essentially everything about it is almost pure excellence aside from a few issues.",4.0

"This is a retro game - no way around it.

However, I actually enjoy retro games.  I actually just got done playing Another World and Fallout 1 & 2 on my laptop.

Having been playing alot of Desktop Tower Defense games lately, I thought I would upgrade to a true RTS game.  Starcraft kept coming up high on everyone's favorite list, so I thought I'd give it a try.

The Good:
- This really is a fun game.  I'm only on level 9 (out of 30) on the original, but it's fun.  Level 8 took me about 4 hrs to finally beat.  But some of this is because there's no instructions in the game (see The Bad).  After reading the strategy guide for the level I finally figured out what I needed to do.  However, I had fun playing the whole time without getting discouraged.
- The graphics aren't all that bad.  I was expecting much worse.  Though they're not bad, they're not great either.  About the same as Fallout 1.  I am surprised they haven't been improved by a patch.
- No Easy/Medium/Hard setting.  I actually prefer to NOT have an Easy/Medium/Hard setting.  On some games my first instinct is to pick Medium, but then I will often get stuck or find it's too easy.  And then I wish I had picked something different.  This game, you have to really be strategic.  Some levels may be too easy and some may be pretty darn hard.  If they're hard simply refer to the guide.  Which brings up another point.  you don't have to keep playing a level until you demolish the CPU.  You just need to win.  I tried out Middle Earth RTS and your people carry over.  I got a few levels in and couldn't beat the level.  After hitting a forum, I found out it's impossible to win if you didn't max out your army from the previous levels.

The Bad:
-  Video.  I run this on my laptop and the screen turns black and the game starts in the upper left part of the window consuming only about 25% of my widescreen laptop.  The rest of the screen is black.  It's pefectly playable, but awefully small.  However, I noticed that when I put my laptop in my docking station connected to an external monitor it goes full-screen.  Of course full-screen on a 24"" widescreen monitor is not good for this game either.  No amount of tweaking to the shortcut seemed to help.  The only option is to change the desktop resolution to 800x600 before starting the game which is a major pain.  Some Googling and it seems most everyone with a widescreen laptop experiences this.  They all refer to a freeware download that let's you run Starcraft in a window.  This actually works VERY nice, and was surprised at how much I liked it compared to the smaller screen in the upper left.  However, there's comments from some users that after using the program, some people have been banned from Battle. Net since it saw they were using a 3rd party program with Starcraft.  I'm not interested in playing SC on Battle.net so that's not a huge deal for me.  But really, if you're going to actively sell a game at the game shops, you would think this would be fixed by Blizzard.  It's one thing if I found this at a used/discount store, but I didn't.  Also, I'm surprised Blizzard hasn't released a patch to smooth out the graphics a bit.  It's not horrible, but it's hard to imagine that it would be too hard to fix it up a little better with a patch.  Many other games have patches that improve the graphics.  Doom, Quake to name a couple.
- No instructions.  Really.  No instructions.  The strategy guide helps, and the first levels help give you a feel for the game, but really?  No instructions?  This is part of what hurt me on level 8.  I wanted to beat it without having to read the strategy guide.  In the end, the guide told me what units I should have before I attack, and some of them I had never used, let alone knew HOW to use.

End rating:  4 stars.  I'm having fun, and that's what counts for a retro game.  Minus 1 star since I have to use 3rd party freeware to get it to run in a window or proportioned correctly on my laptop.",4.0
"I remember when Starcraft first came out originally. I was thrilled to play each scenario and finally, after many hours of play, I conquered the final level of each race. I replayed the game so much I ruined the original disk and couldn't reinstall after a computer crash. It's been a few years and true, the animation is a little old school but I found to my delight after purchasing the Starcraft Battle Chest that as soon as I started to play it, the enjoyment began once more. I'd have to say that even if it's your first time playing Starcraft, you'll enjoy figuring out the strategy to win each level,as I did. Two alien race levels give a different perspective than playing the human scenarios, for many more hours of play<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/StarCraft-Battle-Chest/dp/B00001IVRD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">StarCraft Battle Chest</a>.",4.0

"We bought this one and WoW at the same time.  This seems to be more kid-friendly with doable quests.  I have seen him playing with several of his friends andd they all seem to enjoy it.  Not overly graphic in the violence, and the instructions are very clear.  This is just a review of observation, I haven't played the game, I just watched them playing and no one seemed bored or frustrated, which is the goal as far as I'm concerned.",4.0
"Star craft is one of the all time best real time strategy games. even though it is lacking in graphics by todays standards the advantages such as only needing two resources needed to build anything and customizable maps are a major plus. The only disadvantage of the game is the races are not completely balanced. in my opinion, the protos are much superior than the terran. this is a great LAN game because of the minimal requirements, any recent computer will be able to run it.",4.0
"This game wasn't very challenging, but fun nevertheless.  The idea is to build a roller coaster park, which may also include thrill rides, gentle rides, and water rides.  The people, whom you can see in your park even as you build, roam your park.  You can spy on each one's thoughts.  You need to keep them from getting thirsty or hungry and provide bathrooms.  You need to make sure they don't vomit often and clean it up when they do.  You can build any roller coaster yourself, or choose from preset designs.  Building roller coasters is a bit of a challenge, since it can be hard to connect the end to the beginning, but they can fit the given space more easily than preset ones.  It's important to balance your budget and keep track of prices.  This game is easy to win, but takes a long time to play.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a laid back simulation and for people who want to build the ultimate roller coaster.",4.0
Great game no matter what anyone says. A little dated but solid story and game to match.,4.0
"This should be consider one of the classics games in the game world. It has been the top 10 games for a couple of years and it is still widely played today. This package contains the original and expansion pack with strategy guides which is really good deal. This game is a strategy game which has a very awesome story line for its campaign. And if you want to get out of the RPG/MMORPG craze Starcraft is a the best strategy game to go back on. If you are debating between Starcraft and Warcraft, I have to say Starcraft would be a better choice. Starcraft requires more skill and it open lots more opportunity than warcraft with its massive number in army and units.",4.0
"The product I purchased from this online store is definatly a good choice for a game product. I would have to say it is a tad overpriced for the certain product i bought. the game itself has a tendency to be repetitive and can be even boring at time, still its a good buy. As far as getting a better price I would have to say ""good luck"" because it is currently a sellers market which means that despite your idea of getting what you wanted technically your getting what they decide and if you don't like it well then they will just take your business elseware. Which really comesw to one conclusion that you get what you can,when you can.",4.0
"It is usually hard to find good games for cheap prices. This is such a good game because you can build unbelieveable Roller coasters, see what your customers are thinking, and make a very sucessful theme park.

"This is the first ""Gabriel Knight"" game that I've played, and I'm definitely looking forward to playing more games in the series. ""GKIII: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned"" had its moments of brilliance.
The characters were well developed, with distinct personalities. The voice acting, however, ranged from decent to shame-on-you bad. Case in point: Tim Curry as Gabe Knight. His accent seemed to shift wildly from Southern to...something unidentified. Hall of shame nominee: Scottish thugs proclaiming: ""We're Scots, God help ye!"".
The graphics were generally detailed, but pixellated. 3D models had a tendency to cut in and out of the screen.
There were plenty of places to explore in the chateau, museum, church, and town of Rennes-le-Chateau, and in the surrounding countryside. The puzzles were often difficult, and I frequently found myself backtracking for missed items. Also, there is a lot of downtime in some of the timeblocks so I found myself wandering around for a while trying to kill time.
The storyline was genuinely unlike anything I've ever played before. Although the initial premise is that of a vampire cult kidnapping a child, the ending drastically reinvented the story of Jesus, which is sure to offend many. I *still* don't understand half of the cutscenes and ending months after playing it.
There was a lot of dialogue to sort through, and many locations that I had to backtrack through, so this game kept me busy for quite a long time. ""GKIII"" is not for everyone's tastes, hence the M rating. It deals with vampirism and a reinvention of the death of Jesus. It was definitely thought provoking and entertaining, and if you're a fan of mystery and the supernatural then ""Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned"" is worth a look.",4.0
"I finally got around to playing the entire Gabriel Knight series. For the rest of you who haven't, you're missing out. These are positively the best 3rd person adventure games ever made.
It's hard to review GK3 on its own merits without comparing it to GK1 and GK2. First off, going directly from GK2 to GK3 was a shock, as the former is done entirely in FMV and the latter used 3-d CG technology. When GK3 was made, this was fairly new and not as polished as it is today. The environments are well done, but I had a hard time with the characters. They didn't look quite right, and a lot of their movements were stylized and unrealistic. I got used to this as the game progressed. However, I still find that I relate better to 2-D characters (as in _The Longest Journey_ or GK1) than I do to 3-D representations that are trying so hard to be human and not quite making it.
The script and voice acting were often not quite what I had come to expect. I particularly was not fond of Tim Curry's portrayal of the title character, a fact which struck me as odd, as I loved his work as Gabriel in GK1. But in GK3 I thought he had a little too much tendancy to go over the top, particularly with Gabriel's wisecracks, which sometimes seemed more suited to Beavis and Butthead. Gabriel as a character grows and changes a lot over the course of the games, and I don't think Curry's portrayal was true to that fact. I was also puzzled and irritated at Gabriel's sudden inability to pronounce French. He had a beautiful accent when French terms came up in GK1; what happened to it? Whether this was due to the actor or the director, it was a poor choice and it bothered me.
However, Gabriel Knight 3 is still a great game. Like the others in the series, it is quite long and takes a lot of thought and a lot of close attention to detail. I liked that the NPC's had lives of their own and moved through the game in ways that were unpredictable. By keeping close track of them, sometimes stumbling on interactions and conversations, you can get a much larger picture of what's going on. I thought this added a lot to the realism of the game. You don't have to see everything to complete the game, but attempting to do so both makes the game last longer and makes it very replayable.
Every Gabriel Knight game pushes the limits of the genre by utilizing special interfaces. In Gabriel Knight 3 the special interface is a computer within the game. In addition to being vital to solving one of the main puzzles, this internal computer offers a wealth of information on a variety of subjects. You can spend hours just searching the database and reading the entires. I thought this was very cool.
The puzzles in GK3 are generally a mix of standard inventory-based, timed activity, and arcade.  Often you have to wander around a lot to figure out what you need to do next.  One particular puzzle stands out as one of the best thought-out and most complex puzzles I've ever come across in gaming.  In it you must solve a riddle by analyzing and linking various inventory items.  It's a very long puzzle and some people might find it frustrating, but it was the thing that really caught and held my interest. If all I have to do is talk to people and find inventory items, I don't feel like I've really done anything. There's plenty of that in GK3, but you also have to stretch your brain.
I really enjoyed John DeLancie's performance as the villain. I also enjoyed the depth of interaction between the main characters, and I am very impressed with the amount of research into esoterica that Jane Jensen put into this and the other games in the series. If you are at all of a mystic bent, or have any interest in what might be termed the occult, you will like this game.
You can play GK3 without playing the other games in the series, but I think it wouldn't be as enjoyable, as the background information gives so much insight into the characters and their relationships. Still, if you're looking for a great story and challenging puzzles, don't pass up Gabriel Knight 3!",4.0
Enjoyable game but definitely nowhere near the fun of the Beast Within. I would reccommend this game but you may want to sell it afterward on Amazon...,4.0
"I had seen this game sitting on the shelves of software stores for months.  When the price finally lowered I decided to buy it.  It was well worth my money.  The game is absolutely stunning.
The first thing to note is the graphics.  The textures aren't really that detailed, but that doesn't stop them from preforming.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful.  Playing the game makes me want to visit Rennes le Chateau for real.
The next good thing is the soundtrack.  It is perfect.  Every scene has a unique track.  Sometimes I have the character just stand around doing nothing so I can enjoy the music.
Lastly the story is fabulous.  It has some great supernatural influence, as well as classic detective work.
I take away one star because some of the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult expecially if you don't understand what you're supposed to be doing, but don't let that stop you.  If you really need to you can always find a walkthru.",4.0
"This is THE best game for computers in the entire world.  I spend hours a day playing this and trying to build the ultimate amusement park.  Once you get the add-ons - Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes, the fun really begins.  So, Go. Buy. Now.",4.0
"I have to admit that my copy of Gabriel Knight 3 sat on my shelf for over a year before I felt like playing it all the way through.  This was because I did not like the 3-D graphics this time around; after all, some of the ""movies"" on Gabriel Knight 2 were superb and you just can't get that with 3-D.  I still don't like the 3-D graphics, but once I started playing this game seriously I was hooked again.  The historical background stuff is always fascinating to me and any game in which a tube of Preparation H plays a part is always going to impress me.  I hate to think what sort of individual could play this game without resorting to hints and cheats, although they would have to be somebody with a lot more time on their hands than I am.  There is always some point where I need some help finding out what I missed out on that prevents me from advancing to the next time block (I didn't pick up the glass in the hallway and now I can't listen in on conversations going on in the rooms.  Sigh).  I like Tim Curry as much as the next person, but it doesn't sound like him so his return is not a big deal for me (I liked the guy in GK2).  What's more important here is the wry sense of humor: Can't get somebody to talk?  Try the gun icon, see what happens.  I have to assume most people who play ""Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned"" come to the game through one if not both of the first two Gabriel Knight adventures.  In that case I certainly do not think you will be more than mildly disappointed with episode 3.
I hear than this particular type of computer game, the Gabriel Knight/Phantasmagoria type, is on its way out because it takes too long to put together and does not sell as well as the bloodier arcade type games.  That is not good news, because these are the only type I play.  After I finish I'm going to have to go back and play again and try out some of the variations.  Note: It can be very useful to save the game at different points and go back and do some variations.  Getting caught snooping around can be also be fun.  Bottom Line: For most of Gabriel Knight 2 with its Wagner and Werewolves has been the highpoint of the series to date.  But I am more than willing to give anything Jane Jensen wants to do a try.",4.0
"This is a fun game, and easy to play even if you don't know the warcraft-style control format.  The story is a little cheesier that warcraft, and the screen is much smaller, leading to lots of squinting and difficult targeting of enemies.  The progression of missions, though, is intriguing.  I'll bet that Warcraft 3 turns out to be more fun, however.",4.0
"This game is one of the best out there. You don't need a supercomputer. In fact this is one game where the requierments will let it run just fine. Pros: very addictive, fun, realistic, low requierments. Cons: very easy, time consuming(there are time limits, but you need to wait until the time expiers-very annoying). Overall this game is well worth the money, expesaly if you buy loopy landscapes (the expainsion)",4.0
"First things first--in my opinion, those who complain about the lack of ""real"" vampires missed the point.  The GK series has always been about monsters, sure, but on several levels.  It's about the darkness and evil within the villains that turns them into the ""monsters"" you battle (the second installment *was* called ""The Beast Within).  If this game had been just some garlic-waving, stakepounding action game, it would not have been a true Gabriel Knight game.
The storyline is engaging and intelligent, although anyone who has read about alternative theories for the legend of the Holy Grail will have it figured out pretty quickly.  This doesn't take away from the gameplay, though.
What does take away from the gameplay is the clunkiness of the game itself.  Although my PC met (and exceeded) all of the game's system requirements, I experienced frequent crashes, and the game's response time would sometimes slow down at critical moments when timing was very important, making what would have been otherwise simple tasks take multiple attempts.  Also, the camera would sometimes get stuck in a corner when I needed to be looking somewhere else, and this got pretty frustrating.  And though I was glad to hear Tim Curry again as the voice of Gabriel, I *really* disliked the 3D animation.  It was just--fake.
Still, it was enjoyable enough to make me stick with it despite the technical difficulties, and for me to hope that Sierra reevaluates their apparent decision to abandon the Gabriel Knight series.  I would like to see a GK4 someday.",4.0
"The third in the mystery-solving series, GKIII not only improves on the series but on the genre itself!
For those who enjoy games that involve more thinking and amazing storylines, this game is definate buy. It was the first Gabriel Knight game I had ever played, and when I was finished I wanted more. The plot alone is so deep and enriching that you'll want to play just to see what happens next.
My only problem involved the difficulty of some of the puzzles. It's not that they were too hard, but that they seemed a little ridiculous. Some seemed to beg for the purchase of a walkthrough, and I admit I did some ""walkthrough"" searches on the net, but it was worth it to see the ending.
I thought the graphics were great, especially the detailed scenery which is an almost exact duplicate of the real French town of Rennes-Les-Chateau. One of the high points in the game was Robert Holmes soundtrack, which relied mostly on creepy, atmospheric piano pieces. It really added to the experiance.
Anyone who enjoys puzzle-based suspense games should give this one a try... ... it's more than worth it.",4.0
"Gabriel Knight 3 (GK3) is a challenging and entertaining game that is both aesthetically and technically pleasing, proving to be an all round triumph by game designer Jane Jenson and Sierra Studios. The player is immersed in a compelling, convoluted murder-mystery in a remote French village, gets to play as two characters and gradually unravels a complicated web of mysteries, suspects and, the key ingredient, vampires. The aforementioned aspects of GK3 make this 50-hour, 3 CD extravaganza a true delight to play; however, one may find that the plot is a little too complicated, which proves detrimental to the pace of the game.
  The player assumes the roles of Gabriel Knight and Grace Nakimura, both private investigators, in a small village called Rennes-Le-Chateau. The village is steeped in history due it being the suspected locality of the Holy Grail. Gabriel has been assigned a mission by Prince James, a wealthy businessman, whose son had been kidnapped whilst in the vicinity of the area. As Gabriel gradually uncovers more about the mystery of the kidnapped child, he concomitantly delves into a turbulent, violent world of treasure hunting, vampires, religion, riddles, shady characters and murder. It is a real pleasure to witness this fantastic story unfold, despite it being rather slow in unraveling.
  The marvelous, although slow moving, plot is incorporated into a fully interactive, 3D environment, which the player is able to investigate thoroughly due to a camera that is able to be manipulated. The player can move the camera around much like the camera in a 1st person shooter, allowing investigation of intricate spots such as under a desk or inside a dumb waiter shaft. What makes this locale-investigation so delightful is that each of the environments looks absolutely gorgeous, barring the occasional obviously 2-D tree or clearly polygonal hill.
  The sound is pretty good: the character(s) can eavesdrop on conversations and engage in conversations with striking clarity, to name but a few features. Although the voices come out crystal clear, the actual sound of the voices is quite terrible. Tim Curry (of Rocky Horror fame) is the voice of Gabriel Knight, and his feigned southern drawl quickly becomes irritating. Grace's voice is average, as are some of the other characters, and the script can sometimes be quite terrible. None of the characters, despite how life-threatening the predicament, seem to realise just how endangered they are. Gabriel even goes so far as to wisecrack when a razor-sharp pendulum is about to chop his head off.
  But despite the minor problems with voices or a rather sluggish plot, GK3's good points far outweigh the bad. It is full of challenging problems and provides hours of great fun and excitement, which is exactly what a game should do. GK3 amalgamates innovation with traditional murder-mystery storytelling, so if you're looking for an adventure game triumph, then look no further than Gabriel Knight 3: it's a real winner.",4.0
"The Gabriel Knight series continues to impress me.  The story lines are always impressive, as is the character development.  The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible.
I have been with this series since the beginning and it is great to see it continue to change and grow.  We've come along way from 2D images and 16 colors. The Gabriel Knight series is nice because you can tell that a lot of research always goes into the planning of the game and story.  In this, the third installment, Gabriel is finally getting the hang of being the shatennjaeger (Shadow hunter).  This time he's up against vampires (in previous games it was werewolves and voodoo).
The one complaint I have is that there isn't a lot of freedom of movement within the game.  By this I mean that you have to do a certain set of things in pretty much a set order for the game to advance.  I sort of wosh that you could take different paths and still have the game work.  Maybe this will be an element of the the next Gabriel Knight (of which I really hope there is one).
All I can say is that I look forward to the continued adventures of Gabriel, Grace, and Mosely.",4.0
"All of the reviews I've read seem to come from longtime players of this game rather then new players who actually bought the Battlechest. One of the first things you need to know about this addition that there is NO MANUAL. I was pretty surprised to discover this. But wait, you say, there are two official strategy guides. Yes there are. But they won't teach you how to play the game. They don't include basic stats on all of the units; they don't include all short cut commands; they don't include technology trees; they don't explain the concept of real time strategy games. They offers hints, observations and walk throughs of all of the missions which are handy, but not a substitute for a manual. The only help the game itself offers is a list of some of the keyboard short cuts, hints and one training mission which will be of little use unless you are familiar with real time strategy games.
I've recently discovered and fallen in love with real time strategy games and having recently begun playing Age of the Empires II and Empire Earth, I found the basic concepts similar and could figure you out in general what I was supposed to do. But I found myself struggling to understand the specifics of the game and how to best use the units to win the missions, with such incomplete information. Fortunately at battlenet.com, the official StarCraft website, I discovered extensive documentation. Still it's hardly as convenient as having a manual to refer to while playing.
Armed with a link to the battlenet documentation, I have played through half of the Terran Missions and have found them to be very entertaining. The missions are varied and gradually introduce you to new units and concepts. Hints are offered along the way. So far that are quite easy (once you actually understand what the units do) but for completely mastery of the game there is a huge amount of information to learn. Even though the graphics are not as snazzy as newer releases the attention to detail is outstanding. The cut scenes are excellent and the storyline is far more involved then other similar games. There is an amazing amount of strategic possibilities in this game.
In addition to the missions there are a bunches of ready made scenarios and maps in the Custom Scenario section ready to play. I suspect these were not in the original version, but since I don't have any documentation, I can't say for sure.
So if you have played more recent titles and are wondering if this will seem dated, rest assured that on the fun factor scale it compares very favorably to newer titles. But if you have never played this type of game, you may want to consider another title first unless you have a friend to help you out or are willing to invest the time needed to figure it out on your own.",4.0
"First point: The original Starcraft is excellent.  If you are the kind of person who doesn't care much for the plot of a video game, and only want to play, play, play, then this game is for you.  If you are the kind of person who enjoys the plot as much as the game, then this game is for you.  It combines a good plot with a fun game.
Second Point: StarCraft: Broodwars is just as great as the first one.  Its plot is more indepth, and the game is not a sequel, but an add-on, so it acts as if it has the difficulty of a higher level, and it is much more challenging.
Third Point: The Starcraft strategy guide works so well.  If your stuck on a level, then take it out and it'll tell you how many of each unit to make, where to stratiegicly place them, and so on.
Fourth Point: Sad to say that the Brood War strategy guide is not one of the best guides out there.  It's more there to give you hints, not to walk you through the level.
Fifth Point: THIS CHEST ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4.0
"The first Gabriel Knight game was about a voodoo cult in New Orleans, the second was about a werewolf murder in Germany, and the third is about  vampires.  In this episode Gabriel sets out to solve the abduction of a  man's child and crack the mystery behind an age old Vampire cult.
The  pros of the game are the graphics and controls.  It's really great to be  able to pike the camera at whatever angle you want and examine things.  Everything is rendered so the screen is more than just a backdrop that you  can't peek behind.  Almost everything is something you can examine  closer.
The puzzles are also logical.  They make sence instead of being  wild things like ripping the leaves off a plant and combing them with a  rubber duckie or some other hair-brained idea.  I also loved the animation.  For polygon rendered people and buildings they were impressively  handled.
There were only two things about this game that I have any sort  of beef with.  Firstly the character of Gabriel seemed to have lost a bit  of his tact and charm.  In the first game Gabriel could charm the pants off  of just about anyone he met and could smooth talk his way just about  anywhere he pleased.  Although the voice actor was the same man as the  first GK game he seems to have forgoten Gabriel's smooth cajun accent for a  horribly sounding southern drawl.
And also the game didn't seem to like  my ATI graphics card, so although I had the game for a couple of months I  wasn't able to play it until I upgraded my card to something else.
But  that aside, I'd still reccomend it to any adventure game fan in a  heartbeat!",4.0
"We started out buying the simpler Starcraft game, but discovered that this one is much more complete, with more options for just $10 more-- well worth the difference.
I don't play video games. I'm reviewing this as a parent of  12 and 18 year old sons. I've observed countless games.
My just-turning 12 son first encountered Starcraft this summer at overnight camp. When we came to visit, the game was one of the first things he wanted to show us, not the water activities, skateboard park, recording studio, craft areas, playing fields, etc.
He was already hooked on it. I found the game to be intellectually stimulating and challenging, requiring planning and learning of strategies, rather than these shoot-em-up as you go through a maze games that seem so prevalent.
There is combat, but it is not one human smashing or killing another. It involves battle cruisers and other weapons generally.
Also, it is an on-line game that can involve playing other real, live players, or a computer opponent or both. it is not uncommon for my son to be on-line using one phone line and on the phone with his friend who is playing on-line in the same game from his house. The point is, the game encourages him to learn to play cooperatively, to build team cohesion and maintain alliances, since anyone can un-ally and then attack a former ally any time.
I'd give this a five rating if it weren't for the fact that it is SOOO addicting. I have a hard time getting my younger son to do anything else since he got Battle Chest for Christmas. Also, there have been one or two times when some of the kids on-line who were playing my son used very foul language. I'm no prude, but I didn't see the need for my, at the time, 11 year old son to be exposed to such crudities. I complained to the company and their reply was this was aimed at older kids in their teens. This is a liability, since the game is easily handled by kids under 13 who are bright. It would be nice to create a gaming zone for that age which would protect them from older teens almost natural proclivity for ""testing the limits"" of the language.
The bottom line is this is a game which is intellectually stimulating, rather than some of the mind numbing ones out there, but some supervision of the chat on the on-line version may be necessary.",4.0
"Roller Coaster Tycoon is quite the little game, and one that is certainly  suitable for the whole family.  For the enthusiast of constuction-style  games, however, there are several glaring flaws.
The game's scenarios go  from too simple to simply obnoxious; it seems like the game designers felt  a powerful need to have theme parks constructed in all kinds of bizarre  locations.
Once one overcomes the irritation of the terrain (ex. decides  not to care how stupid a park built entirely on water looks) the conditions  for winning a scenario are far, far too simple.  When the goal is to have x  guests in the park by year three, and by the opening of year two the player  has already far surpassed that goal, perhaps an option should exist to win  prematurely and move on to a more interesting park, no?  On the enjoyable  maps, this is never an issue; there's always a new joy to add to the park.  However, there are maps that I personally would choose not to play at all,  except that in order to unlock further maps, one HAS to.
The other big  problem with this game, from my perspective, is the poor pathing of the  guests.  The best way to illustrate the problem is this: download one of  the ""actual park"" maps at the RCT website.  Play it for five  minutes.  Watch all of the people scream at how lost they are and how badly  they want to go home.  This isn't a problem in very small parks, but when  parks start to grow, a player has to be very Spartan with pathing  options.
When all is said and done, I would definitely buy this game if I  didn't already own it, as the joys of simply building the coasters and  waterslides make it all worth it.",4.0
"I have been playing this game for over 3 years and it still is not boring. Battle.net (multiplayer) is so much fun and their are so many different types of games. Starcraft has so many strategies and uses of its units that I am still learning today! This is a must buy, trust me you will not regret it.",4.0
"I immediately purchased GK3 when it reached the stores since I had so much fun playing the first two games in the series.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game with one notable exception, the character of Gabriel.  His dialog was  obnoxious and Tim Curry's voice acting was nothing short of terrible.  But,  as per usual with the GK series, the story was compelling, the characters  were interesting, the game play time was long enough  and the puzzles made  sense.  I liked the addition of the 3D engine and didn't mind them going  back to animated characters.  I sincerely hope there will be a GK4 as I  would definitely buy it.  My only wish is that they do NOT hire Tim Curry  to play Gabriel again and might also consider toning down Gabriel's rude  comments.",4.0
"I really wanted to love this game the way I loved the first and second in the series, but...in the end, I just don't. It's a great mystery marred by a lack of truly interesting characters (pretty much only Gabe, Grace, and  Mose are interesting) and by a rotten pacing. The tension never really  starts to build until it's almost too late, and even then it's not up to  the kind of delicious tension and suspense the first two games displayed.  Is it a good game? Oh yes. The gameplay is marvellous, it's so neat to  explore a fully 3D world in an adventure game and to be able to view things  from any given angle, but...it's not the equal of the first two in story,  pacing, suspense, or character. The mystery is very well done, but the  story around it could've been a lot better. STill worth playing if you're a  fan!",4.0
"I thought the sotry of the game was very good.  As with the other GK games, there's a lot of history to wade through, however I found it very fun.  The only thing I didn't like was the graphics.  I think they could  have spent more time on that.  The movies in between some of the chapters  were the same polygonic 3D images from the game instead of realistic  movies.  There is also a lot of religion in the game (many different  types), but it's not telling you what's right or wrong.
It's worth the  money, buy the 3D is sometimes annoying.",4.0
"I've found this game less fun than the GK2:the beast within. Graphics are OK, but I prefer movies, like the other one. The plot is quite interesting, and Grace is the perfect couple for Gabe. Enjoy it and let's hope Sierra and Jane Jensen continue this saga.",4.0
"I'm no rollercoaster fan, but even I got a sense of hairraising fun when I built my first coaster and heard the car moving on the tracks and the screams of the riders. The game really brings the sense of joy in an  amusement park to the PC.
The interface is generally slick, and there are  two things that keep this from being five stars: the rollercoaster design  interface is a bit clunky, and it would be nice if the game started with an  ""open scenario"" or scenario editor, instead of the scenarios  packaged in the game",4.0
"Starting, building, and refining your city can easily use up a Saturday afternoon and evening.  My only complaint is in the difficulty of the scenarios with battles.  Eventually, an enemy will show up that's twice as  strong as your forces, and once their routed, you might as well quit the  game because nothing can save your city.  Building cities in peaceful areas  is much more fun.",4.0
"Starcraft is excellent. Brood War is better, put them together and they are dynamite! Really Starcraft is getting a tad old now, but its a brilliant game even now, it may be out of fashion, but it is really good. With the strategy guides you can get online and play SC or BW right away with confidence, you may even beat me (I have a recond of 214 wins to 7 losses :-) Annyway, if you want a very good RTS game, buy this, you won't be dissapointed, the best thing about this is that with both packs, the story blends seamlessly, and the guides get newbies fighting with competence in no time. The only downsides are that the game is a bit old (but still a classic), and that there are  not huge numbers of units, for instance in TA (another game I warmly reccomend), but its simple, its beautiful, and if you avoid money maps, a really excellent way to invest your gamer cash. Just don't play me on battle.net until you have won a few ladder matches. Abyss",4.0
"This is a terrific, nonviolent, constructive (so to speak) game.  It's great fun, and when I got it on a Thursday, I played it for a few hours that night, then a few more hours Friday night, and then all day Saturday  and Sunday.
Since then, I still play it, but not with the same  feverishness as before.  It's still fun, but the beginning scenarios have  started to look the same.  Pump up the research, but food courts, make the  park smaller by breaking up paths, etc.  I expect that some of the later  scenarios will get more difficult, but right now, the game isn't too  hard.
It's pretty and neat to look at it, but be warned that it may not  be as addictive as made out to be by other reviews.",4.0
"You know, when i first saw this i thought it looked like Sim City, which i think is a ok game but it gets so boring and after a while it gets dumb. But I went over to my neighbor's house and saw Roller Coaster Tycoon for  the first time. Its awesome. I'm Going to probably have to force myself to  stop playing it though because its so addicting. You just always want to  add more on to your park and get more guests. In the game your given  levels. Each level has a challenge. They give you a certain amount of  money, (sometimes you can add on loans), and a certain amount of time to  get so many guests and have a certain rating for your park. In the ride  department you can choose from either pre-packaged things or build your own  roller coaster's, trains, monorails, log flumes, and more. You can also add  restaurants and mostly anything you can have in a theme park. Also, if you  keep a level for a certain amount of time you get more attractions and  rides and restaurants. The roller coasters range from regular wooden, to  steel, to one support steel, and any roller coaster you can think of, its  awesome. It may be a strategy game, But its better than any shooter or RPG  that i've ever played. BUY IT!",4.0
"Roller Coaster Tycoon is a delightful game.  It combines two aspects of theme-park building-architectural planning and financial management-and somehow makes it fun.  You will spend hours double checking to see how many  french fries were sold in stall #1, and you'll LIKE it.  While you can  always put a ride into the game with just a few clicks, virtually every  ride is customizable; some of them (such as the roller coasters and log  flumes) can suck up hours of time, if you let them.
There are problems  with the game.  Since you cannot design while the game is paused, often you  will be distracted from the all-important task of designing the Great  American Coaster by such piddling issues as lost customers or complaints on  cleanliness.  The lack of such staples as arcades and skee-ball is  lamentable.  Also, the victory conditions from the scenarios do not allow  you to win early; in other words, it will say something like ""Get a park  value of 1200 by year 4.""  If you get the park rating in the middle of year  2, you still have to wait out the extra year and a half in order to win.  Since winning a scenario makes other available, this sometimes led to  periods of tedium while I waited out the ending.
These flaws do detract  from the enjoyability of the game, but it is still one of the most  delightful games on the market.  Definitely not to be missed!",4.0
"I was so excited about this game that I played it for 15 hours straight... and completede it. The game is great and tons of fun, but it's just to easy. The enemy AI is too predictable, and it's all too easy to win the  battles. But if you want the greatst grafics ever on a PC, buy this game.",4.0
"A Game that is still in my library with its sequel..  Yeah I like it that much, found it addictive and imaginative as well.  It is date by today's standards and likely the online play is dead as it was when I attempted to play there.  Not to mention those out there playing online are usually hardcore and own any new people as well which was a major frustration when I finished first person a long time ago and attempted to go online haha.  This game was fun with its story and is one I consider reloading at times after so many disappointments with newer games that just don't satisfy someone who has played for so many years nor someone who wants to spend so much for so little these days.  Today's game are pretty much knock offs, level racing, mindless hack and slash, limited originality, limited character uniqueness and profit versus gamer motivated today as well.  If you want to give it a try I'd say it is worth the ten bucks..  If you really like it the sequel is good as well.  Space Command and Conquer is a good way to think of this game with a mobile mother ship for game play though it is more multi-directional that c and c..  Control might take a little to get use to but who expects a game to practically play itself lol..",4.0
I loved this game back in the 90's but it wouldn't play when I upgraded by PC.  So far this CD plays just fine on my Windows 7.,4.0
"This game takes me back. I love the games grandness, for the day that it was made and released, it was pretty cutting edge. That said, once you install the game you will that it is an older game. once you get past that I think you will love this game. Picture it, you're a group of lost humans trying to find your way home...Earth. The mechanics is like most game you send out collectors to gather space materials to build up you fleet. if you want to play through the story line give it a try I am not one for story lines play but I do love the story line for the Homeworld.",4.0

"I played this game many years ago and never fiished it.  I lost the disks in a a home fire and recently decided to see if I could find it again.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I really enjoy this game and the variety of ways I can approach the strategy of ""winning"".  Highly recommended fun and the seller was super great-quick and reliable.",4.0
"This is an awesome space strategy game with full 3D effects.  The units you finish a mission with are the ones you get at the start of the next mission.  The story is excellent and the music is worth the price of the game alone.  Every now and then the camera will anger me, but no other complaints.  Works well with windows XP.",4.0
"This game got me interested in the RTS genre all over again. It is  wonderful: full three dimensions of movement, a camera that's easy to use,  beautifully-rendered ships and an engrossing storyline. The only strikes  against it, in my view, are the near-identical ships of the playable races,  and the lack of variety in Homeworld multiplayer missions.
Still, this  game is the first of the 3D RTS genre (or at least, the first to do it with  any real style) and the yardstick by which all future comers will be  measured - it's still a wonderful game.",4.0
"This game is so intricate that the most simplistic things can and will take affect on your theme park. It allows extreme room for creativity, but is very time consuming initially, and will only get gradually worse as time  goes by. I expect therapy groups to be formed in the near future to help  those trying to wean themselves off this game.",4.0
"At first glance, Homeworld is one of the greatest games of all time.  It gives you the rare opportunity to command vast fleets of various ships, in full 3D.  The controls work like a dream.  The graphics are among the best  around, and it will be a long time before anyone does a game more visually  stunning. But (there's always a 'but') the effort spent on graphics seems  to have come at the expense of gameplay.  Apart from being 3D in space, the  game does little out of the ordinary.  The research section is very basic.  The campaign is completely linear, and it's the same no matter which of the  two races you choose.  In fact, there isn't much difference between the  races at all.  Being in space, there isn't much you can do in terms of  terrain, and there's no base-building at all.  Homeworld would have  benifitted from something else.  Asteroids and planets, for example, that  aren't just part of the scenery, and customizeable units (a la Warzone  2100).  As it stands, Homeworld is fun for a while, but after a month or  so, you'll yearn for something more involved.",4.0
"Homeworld has a great mix of gameplay and graphics that redefines 3d gaming strategy. The maps are mostly huge and of course 3d. This creates long missions, making it long to even finish a skirmish. Even with it's  great graphics and gameplay, Homeworld lacks a good storyline for both  races. The movies in the games are poorly done. The soundtrack has some  nice songs but not a lot. The songs soon get quite repetitive.  Even  with these tiny flaws the gameplay is what brings Homeworld up. Homeworld  creates an intriguing interface with complex systems and research  development. The manual even looks like an engineers manual. Homeworld is  reccomended for those people who look for hardcore strategy gameplay and  are willing to have a lot intelligence and patience",4.0
"For those of you who are real time game enthusiasts, Homeworld is sure to increase your heartbeat by at least 50%. Unlike most other real time games (ala Command and Conquer Series, Myth Series, and Warcraft/Starcraft  Series), Homeworld uses a true 3D Engine. You can fight in almost any angle  imaginable, the whole 360 degrees.
The ships available are extraudinary,  the graphics, well, the screenshots speak for themselves. The storyline is  also very engrossing, updating you about your position during the missions  itself.
Do NOT let the fact that this game has two different races fool  you. You might think, oh, that's twice the gaming time. But you're wrong  there. The storyline is exactly the same for both the races, and there is  only the difference of two units between the two. Despite that, all the  units of both the races look different from each other.
You truly feel  you're in space combat, at least science fiction space combat. The physics  are no way realistic, but I'd rather have a fun game, which makes its own  laws of physics, than have a VERY realistic game, and have no gameplay.",4.0
"When I first started playing this game, I was awestruck by the amazing graphics.  I installed it, everything ran smoothly, and even though the tutorial level was extremely long, I didn't tire of it simply because  everything was so impressive looking, even at the meager 640x480 res I  started at.
I played the campaign next, and although it was pretty cool  that you had the same resources and ships from level to level, the levels  themselves were extremely easy (I know that because I suck at RTS games and  I didn't have to reload once on this one).  It also was boring having to  collect every last scrap of resources at the end of the levels in order to  support your fleet through the next threat.
Even through all of this, I  thought it was a very fun, addictive, game, but when I started playing  multiplayer it dawned on me where this game really lacks -- there's not  enough variety.  The ships aren't varied enough, and even though it's 3D,  there's only one terrain type -- space.  There's just not enough variety  for it not to get boring after too long.
So even with the stunning  graphics, compelling music, and simple but effective cutscenes, the  un-intuitive gameplay and the sameness of it all brought this still very  good game down to only 4 stars.",4.0
"Homeworld is a very good game and it is fun to devise strategy's to defeat your enemies and then watch the battles play out in real time. However, I did encounter a couple of problems. First of all , I couldn't get the game  to work with my Voodoo 2 card, so I had to run it in software, which  fortunately still looks very good. Also, I haven't been able to get the  multiplayer to work yet, but that might be because of my slow connection.  Anyway, most people don't seem to have these problems, so if you want a  gripping strategy game with great graphics, Homeworld is the current number  one choice.",4.0
"I'm not an RTS (real time strategy) fanatic by any stretch of the imagination -- but I was eager for this game.  This game plays extremely well as a single player game -- complete with new twists to the real-time  genre: no buildings, you keep your fleet with you from scenario to  scenario, full 3D space (with intuitive controls).
Homeworld takes the  basic tenants of a real time strategy and slows the pace down a bit to  provide fleet action that reminds you of scenes from your favorite sci-fi  movies and TV shows.
The story is extremely well done with scripted  in-game sequences and good storyboard artwork that makes the story  compelling and interesting rather than ""fluff"" added at the  end.
It's a solid multiplayer game - but only against other humans.  Much  like Total Annhilation, the AI simply isn't up to the task of taking on  multiple, allied humans, even if you give it the benefit of  numbers.
Overall - it's a great game. If the multiplayer AI were more  vicious you'd see 5 stars from me.",4.0
"I've been a somewhat lukewarm fan of RTS games over the past few years in that I've played them, and enjoyed them more than most other genres, but never really felt compelled to complete them when I ran into  difficulties.
This game is different.
It's at least as hard to get  through as any other RTS I've ever played, but it's so involving that I'm  willing to go back over and over again to complete the mission and go on to  the next episode in the story. It's gritty, yet beautiful.
The interface  is not the easiest thing in the world to master, and I could suggest some  improvements. Movement of ships over long distances can be a hassle. I  didn't have too many problems with camera management, but in the chaos of  battle I used the Pause function many times to try and sort out my forces.  Playing this game does require some eye-hand-mouse coordination, more so  than a lot of RTSs I've played.
But I think the gameplay and storyline  make it well worth those small few glitches.",4.0
"Wow. 'Nuff said. Hands-down one of the best games of all time. If you've ever played Warcraft, you won't be very surprised, as the game-play is very similar. As a stand-alone, the game is enjoyable for hours upon end... But  add the Brood Wars expansion, and you'll be hooked for life.",4.0
"If you just want to shoot planes out of the sky this is not the game for you (but then again maybe flight simulation is not your thing anyway). However, if you want to experience what real fighter combat is like, this  game is as real as it gets without leaving the ground. I would have given  this game 5 stars, but since it will undoubtedly be purchased by non-flying  enthusiasts I gave it 4. Test your flying and combat skills by playing the  game online at Microsoft's Gaming Zone against other human players. It's  probably not as intense as other action games, but it is definately more  challenging. Shooting down an experienced pilot can be a real rush. But be  warned. Getting mercilessly shot out of the sky can be extremely  frustrating as well. The game also offers several challenging missions and  campaigns which can be flown as a fighter with the USAF, RAF, or Luftwaffe.  If you just want to play a game, try Quake or HalfLife. If you want to  experience Fighter Combat, this is the game you've been waiting for.",4.0
"This game is a great game for people who enjoy basic ""blast the bad  guys into oblivion"" setup.  The levels are intriguing and all very  unique, but some can get very boring after a while of running around trying  to find some hidden door that does nothing other than allow you to get to  the next level.  But there are good aspects to the game such as --i think--  9 different types of weapons to choose from, along with great and funny  sounds to go along with them.  Buy it if you like, but beware, there are a  lot of time wasting stages to go through, so if you are buying for pure  enjoyment and not time wasting, be careful--get some cheats to let you skip  levels or something..",4.0

I really like being able to fly for the USAF, RAF or Luftwaffe.  The training missions are good if you're new to flight sims but otherwise don't waste your time.  The instructor is very annoying.  Overall this is a very good flight sim.  I apologize for the misleading review I gave.",4.0
"Just so you know, I am only going to discuss single-player version because I never tried multi-player.
You have Warcraft, you have Diablo, and then you have Starcraft.  Diablo and Warcraft have gone off to have #2 (and in Warcraft's case, #3) but Starcraft has nothing but a Brood War expansion.  I can't see why.
Starcraft is fantastic.  You have three different races that are unique in their own way.  Different buildings, different units, different ways of evolving... heck, just about everything is different between each race.  I think that is pretty cool.
I, personally, like the custom scenarios.  I also like a really cool scenario that is kind of like a arcade game where you try to protect your nexus (protoss main building) from oncoming enemies.  and get 'galactic heroes' if you survive.
I found the actual campaign a bit too difficult for me, with some missions seeming just plain impossible.  It also takes a while to master each race (I like the protoss, but the Zerg are, in my opinion, the easiest to fight with)  But it is still fun and I really like some of the heroes, especially the Protoss heroes.
Finally, I like making my own scenarios.  It seemed difficult and a little confusing at first, but I eventually got the hang of it.
Go out and buy this game!",4.0
"If you are a World War II buff and love flight simulators, Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator - WWII Europe Series is for you.
Using the same attention to detail as in its Flight Simulator series - indeed, you can import ""worlds"" from the civilian game to this war one - Combat Flight Simulator allows you to fly in two Campaigns, The Battle of Britain and The Battle for Europe, as a pilot in the RAF, Luftwaffe, or USAAF (U.S. Army Air Forces).
Combat Flight Simulator - Europe lets you fly many of the famous fighters in service in those three air forces. If you fly as a British pilot, you can expect to be at the controls of a Hawker Hurricane Mk. (Mark) I, a Supermarine Spitfire Mk. I, or a later variant, the Mk. IX.  As a German pilot, you'll fly either the Messerchmitt Bf 109E or the Focke-Wulf Fw. 190A fighters.  Finally, as a Yank in the USAAF, you'll man either the sturdy P-47D Thunderbolt or the sleek P-51 Mustang.  All of these planes have their strengths and weaknesses, so try to read the manual (or the Help files) and do a bit of research before you hook up the joystick and take flight.  Particularly challenging are the ammunition load limits to each plane; each plane has its own ammo load capacity, and players more familiar with fighter jet simulations (such as Microprose's famous F-15 Strike Eagle series) may find themselves shooting away all their ammo at one plane (if they choose realistic presets) and then being unable to shoot at anyone else because they have no bullets.  I would advise rookie pilots to use Unlimited Ammo settings until they have had enough practice to shoot down enemy bombers and fighters without wasting precious rounds.
The simulation not only has the two Campaigns I mentioned earlier, but it has Free Flight, Quick Combat, Single Mission, and Training modes.  Quick Combat, particularly, is good for players who like both flight simulations and arcade games.  This option lets you choose what and how many enemy planes you can face off against, where the fight takes place, what weather conditions are like, time of day, and tactical situation.  The enemy comes at you in waves, like in an arcade game, and as soon as you dispatch one wave, another appears.  The challenge here is to shoot down as many planes as you can before you either run out of gas or are shot down. (Unlimited Ammo should be your choice in this sort of game no mater how good you are, unless you can shoot down one plane with one bullet.  Here, skills learned in a jet fighter simulation will not help you!)
For players weaned on jet fighter games, it would be advisable to use the non-1940s HUD (Heads Up Display) view option.  I (since I am new to this game myself) still use it in the Campaign mode since the ""Cockpit"" view option, while more realistic, is still a bit overwhelming to me.  Purists and/or experienced pilots can set realism to 100% to their heart's content, but casual players or rookies should start out easy then gradually increase the realism settings.
The graphics are excellent, even for a 1998-era game.  Being a Microsoft game it runs on most Windows platforms except 3.1, and I am sure no one reading this review still has that operating system.  I particularly like the ""worlds"" depicted: you actually get a sense of flying over 1940s Europe.  The sound is also good, and you can even hear your fellow pilots' radio calls. (Like the more advanced flight simulations, the Single Mission and Campaign games are very realistic in that you fly with a squadron, something I never experienced in F-15 Strike Eagles I-III.  I did once own Microprose's F-14 Fleet Defender, a game that had AI wingmen, but I could never get it to run on any of my machines!)
Microsoft also offers a Pacific series counterpart, which I am hoping to get soon.  Check to see if they have expansion kits.  Many simulations ranging from flight to Star Wars starfighter games have them, and I believe Combat Flight Simulator is no exception.
Oh, yes. Good luck, happy landings, and good hunting!",4.0
"Yes, we all know of the famous Starcraft. It's been hailed as one of the greatest RTS's of all time; and if you talk to almost any gamer in the world, they'll know of it. This game is wonderful; it has a great plot and allows you to play three different campaigns. All three of which you'll fight against as another one of the races. Plus, each race has it's own advantage, so no matter what you're playing a different game each time.
However, there are downsides to this same game. The game is incredibly boring after the first couple of missions because they're all the same. Destroy a base, or escort a convoy... basiclly destroy everything on the entire map you're on. This game play gets horribly boring after a few times, and you'll find yourself clicking the same places over and over with your mouse. All you do is build troops up, rush, and slaughter. There's no real strategy to this game at all.
Pros:
Wonderful RTS
Good Plot
Each Campaign has different advantage and disadvantages.
Cons:
Same-old Missions

"A police officer I knew got me into this game.  I didn't think much of it because it was essentially the same game design as the venerable DUNE and War Craft games.  One Age of Empires, as originally designed, was never meant to be the huge slug fest that it ultimately turned into.  The icons on the map were meant to be just that; icons representing single armies.  But the players demanded more, and a patch was released allowing multiple units to be manifested on the map.  Result, that icon that was supposed to represent an army suddenly became a single unit in the army.

So, instead of a game where you see elements of civilization compete and clash, as was the intent, new users essentially got another massive army combat game.  Not a big deal.  It was fun all the same.  I was befriended by some guys on the old MS Gaming Zone, and we'd have a blast after work or school, going late at it late at night.  And then on the weekends we'd have marathon games in the morning.

Great fun, lots of fond memories.  I'll never forget my Age of Empire days.

I think the game's well past its peak, but even as a solo effort it's slightly amusing.

Enjoy.",4.0

"It is with great pleasure that I reveal the last two years of being apart of the Combat Flight Simulator WWII Europe Series. The Games and battles are more than I ever expected for PC computer realiztic action. The major problem is with the Windows 2000 program. Either I am to damn dumb to operate this program or there are no realistic upgrades to the older combat CD's. What is the answer? Do we fold the old and purchase the new? Or do we keep plugging away at the promised upgrades? Would like to know...

"I have played back-and-forth with this sim in the little-over-a-year since I've had it.  It is still fun, still good and durable.  The graphics are fine on my P800 with GFORCE 2MX200 card.  The single missions, the quick combat and free flight are all good.  In fact, Quick Combat is an excellent way to blow off stress after work...load up a Spitfire IX with unlimited ammo and blow away any Axis interloper that dares transgress the borders of Mother England.  The earning rank and decorations in the campaigns are good too.  I'm still hoping for my RAF Group Captain with Victoria Cross.
However - and this is where the game loses a star - the training missions are bloody awful, for one reason: the annoying ""instructor"".  Rarely does ""he"" give you any kind of help.  For example, on the ""Basic Flight"" in a P-47, I must have tried for an hour to drop 1,000 feet and level off at 200 kts...according to my gauges I had done just that but he kept repeating that command in the same annoying voice.  I finally chucked the training missions.  It would have been far better to have a Harvard for a trainer.
Advice: unless you're completely clueless on flying, ignore these training missions.  Play through the single missions on Rookie, Veteran and Ace settings before hitting the campaigns (nothing like learning by doing) and hone your skills with Free Flight and Quick Combat.  Jack in the training missions and that annoying voice completely.
I just got CFS2 and have just started toying with it, so we'll see how that goes!",4.0
"Back in the ancient DOS days, a WWII sim called SWOTL [Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe]  satisfied a long-standing wish to fly historic aircraft.  Bf109s, Spitfires, Hurricanes and the  mighty B-17 engaged in mortal combat.  Combat Flight Simulator has successfully updated  those early attempts at recreating the air war in Europe.  The aircraft in this simulation are  distinct - you aren't flying the same airplane with modified panels.  The Bf109, FW190,  Spitfires and Hurris all react uniquely to your handling.  Low level combat has you in the dirt  if you push after a target too earnestly.  High level attacks must be performed with an eye to  throttle as the aircraft response becomes realistically mushy at altitude.
You need to understand how to fly in this simulation.  The aircraft are unforgiving to the  ham-handed and you must keep an eye on both your enemies and friends.  Mid-air collisions  can occur.  Be especially careful when landing in a group - some of those clowns will plow  into you if you don't get off the runway.  Watch your gear lights - especially if you have  messaging turned off!  Wheels-up landings are possible, but you'd better know how to  perform that feat.
Keep your eye on the fuel gauges.  In either Campaign phase you will spend a lot of time  judging how fast to fly over long distances.  Bf109 escort missions or flying the Jug deep into  Europe can consume  a lot of fuel.  It's not difficult to run dry on the way home.  On the other  hand, the speed limit warnings given in the manual for gear or flap extension are  meaningless.  That's a pity since you can perform pretty hairy approaches without fear.  Damage is realistic up to a point.  You can't observe wing damage, but if your flaps or  ailerons are damaged, you'll have to adjust your handling.  Overall, this is a fine simulation  and well worth the price for the experience.",4.0
When I first loading this game there was many graphics problems and hanging up on my computers part.  I have a relatively new computer compared to when this game came out in 1998.  This is a good game but make sure before you buy it that you have the best graphics card possible or else you'll run into the same problems I did.,4.0

"This is the best game ever. Single Player is ok, but the movies are terrible. This has an ok plot, but you should get Brood War right after you get this. Get ready for some Sci-Fi action that will entertain you for years!",4.0
Starcraft is also a must buy for a strategy game lover. Although Sc is not as great graphic wise as Age of Empired II the game certainly makes up for it's graphics in other ways. Such as it's three seperate races that are nothing alike. Each race have different abilities and different units. Then you have ladder when u play ladder you get a rating and you can check your placement within that area of the world. Then you can play the regular game of melee in which you build up and fight to destroy enemies. Only one problem with the game is that if you happen to play online most of the users bought the expansion Starcraft Brood War. Which means you cannot play with those users. Yet Starcraft is still a great game and a must!,4.0

"I own all three of these flight sims now, and I can't get enough! The missions are a little weak, but the views of the planes in flight more than makes up for it. Go buy this one!",4.0
If you are looking for the most realistic combat simulator this one is  close. The flight behavior is what you have come to expect form Microsoft.  The missions are good but the timesaver button makes it a little to easy.  If you like flight sims with some action this one is good for a few hours  of your time.,4.0
"Agreat game! The game features a good realism factor, goodgraphics although it is belittled by the CFS 2 screenshots , and some great missions, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT is the ability to use millions of planes off of the web plus import FS 98 a/c directly into the game. Great your thinking, but the area that it falls short is the campaigns, the only good one from an emersion point of view is the Battle of britain from the luftwaffe point, but the best one for fun is the Bttl of europe from the luftwaffe, This problem is remidied by the fact that there hundreds of better ones on the internet, plus some of the planes on the web are better too.
Every thing about the game is great, just fly the single mission ""clobber college"" against ace pilots Just over a hundred planes allied and axis of all sorts wheeling about the skies. Ahhh i love the smell of burning messerschmitt in the morning!
One other problem is that in most of the missions though it is just you and your wingman, possibly up to eight in the campaigns.
in short BUY IT NOW...",4.0
"Starcraft is one of my favorite games ever. It completely introduced me in the Real-Time-Strategy genre, but even now, years after its release, goes further than most games out there. Not only is the game fun to play, but the storyline regarding the clash between the three races was so complex and so interesting I couldn't stop playing to see what happened next. It's like reading a book! Actually, there are novels based on the world of Starcraft. It's no surprise to me.
The only drawback of the game it's its poor waypoint system, which can be a little frustrating. Also, in the end, almost every strategy can be beaten by great numbers, unlike some other games of the genre.
But in spite of all that, this is still a great game. A classic worth having.",4.0
"Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator is a combat including variant of the Flight Simulator line.  The product plays on the strengths of Microsoft's flight simulation experience but falls down in the attempt to simulate air  warfare in which games like Red Baron and companies like Dynamix are far  ahead of Microsoft.
The graphics are far in advance of Flight Simulator  98.  Although still bitmapped, the photorealistic terrain resolves into  hedgerows, farms, and fields.  The effect is especially stunning at high  altitude.  The flying models are just like ones in the civilian flight sim  versions.  However, since the models are ""accurate"", you'll find  they don't bank and roll in combat like other games' aircraft which can be  frustrating.
Unfortunatley, Combat Flight Simulator falls down in the  actual mechanics of its combat area.  Campaigns are simply collections of  about 16 missions which are otherwise totally unrelated.  They're simply  linked so your pilot garners promotions and medals but there is no  continuity.  It is wildly simplistic, nowhere near the campaign mode in  games such as Red Baron II.
AI combat skills are definatley lacking  and the enemy resorts to the tried and true method of ramming into you  (obvious when they aren't even firing their guns) to bring you down.  Your  wingmen aren't much better and will wander around the area of battle, and  more often out of it, taking the occasional half-hearted potshot at the  enemy.  Usually, your wingmen just crash or get shot down, you can't rely  on them.  Don't worry about having a greedy wingman fly in front of you to  steal a kill from you, it doesn't happen in this game.  Another huge  problem is that the AI seems to love ramming its planes into the ground.  I've chased numerous enemy planes only to have them crash into the ground  or run into mountains.
However, this game does have one huge  advantage over its rivals, its fanbase.  Like Microsoft Flight Simulator,  there are literally hundreds of files waiting to be downloaded.  You can  import any Flight Simulator 98 or earlier scenery into the game as well as  aircraft.  You can bring in jet aircraft to fight with (although you must  tweak the weapons a bit because you aren't going to shoot down a Mig29 with  an F-15 with .303 machine guns).  The expansion capability of the game is  enormous.
Basically, hardcore air combat gamers might want to preview  this game before they buy it.  Fans of Microsoft Flight Simulator will want  to get ahold of it as soon as possible.  As an add-on that gives you the  ability to fight with your aviation creations (both scenery and aircraft),  it is an unparalleled product!",4.0
"This game is a wonderful Flight Sim. You get 8 planes, from WWII. What makes this game great is it's online community; on the internet gaming zone. There are thousand of fast paced, high action dogfights to WWII bomber runs. Finally,you can get every plane from snoopy's dog house to a  F-22 raptor fighter from sights.",4.0
"Microsoft has given all other WW2 simulators a challenge. This game has great graphics and gameplay and at times good cinemas, but not the greatest.  It's hard to play without a joystick and a good system, if your  speed is not a Pentium 2 or higher it could be a little slow. It's still  fun though. The missions are fun and fast paced, although it takes a while  to get used to and be able to handle the plane. Also in battle it's  sometimes hard to get the other planes, but the bombers you'll probably get  on your first try but it still takes a while to get the others. There are a  number of different aircrafts, but only a couple available in each mission.  It is a challenging and fun game, I reccomend it to people who like air  combat and flight games.",4.0
"To simplistic in the multiplayer.  The single player game is fun, and provides alot of entertainment, but the gameplay of the multiplayer is too simplistic.

This is one of the best games ever made. But one thing. It is additing. I think if u by this only play it on vactions or if you don't have work for a week or two. With this game my grades went down to c's and D's. I am not saying don't buy it just don't let it get out of hand.,4.0
"This was a really fun game to me. I enjoy challenges and puzzles and this game offers many of each. They got the sarcastic one liners of Indy down pretty well, though it would have been a lot cooler if Harrison Ford voiced it. The game has an intriguing story, though somewhat far fetched, but its a game. The graphics were a bit on the mediocre side for the requirements, but it didn't take away from the game play. The controls are good, but I find sometimes they don't respond like they should. My only real complaint is how linear the game is. There is only one way to go and that doesn't make the puzzle solving the most fun sometimes. Good game overall.",4.0
"Pure Action, Pure Adventure, Pure Indy. The tagline says it all: this is a 100% pure action/adventure game worthy of the Indiana Jones franchise. A classic for its time, but a tad clunky by today's standards, Infernal Machine steps outside typical Indiana Jones adventures by placing you in 1947, removes the Nazi threat, and replaces it with Communist Russians. The story is passable--Indy must find the pieces to an ancient Babylonian machine before scientist Pudovkin can use them for evil. The thrills are pretty heavy here, ranging from a Jeep Trek to a Mine Cart ride, but some levels have a tendency to drag on with sometimes hair-tugging puzzles. These puzzles are far and few between however, making the rest of the game rather enjoyable. The downside to all of this isn't anything to do with the game, but the compatability issues with the game and Windows XP or higher---once there was a patch for these issues, but it no longer resides on the internet. My advice? Avoid using any weapons more powerful than the auto pistol and save often. The game is a solid buy for classic gaming fans despite compatability issues, and is worthy of carrying the title Indiana Jones.",4.0
"Wow! This game is so fun! I've just taken a break from playing it(I'm still only about halfway through!) to express my feelings.
This is my first Indy game, so I really didn't know what to expect.  I do remember hating tomb raider so I figured The Infernal Machine couldn't be that bad.
Like I said, I'm still in the middle of playing, but I've managed to piece together a list of pros and cons I've encountered so far:
Pros- 1) Good original storyline.
  2) The whip. 'Nuff said.
  3) Your ability to find hidden treasures on the levels.
  4) Indy's voice.  Not quite the same, but almost.
  5) The level cinematics are awesome!
  6) Hair-raising trap after hair-raising trap.
Cons- 1) Lots of confusing puzzles that can take hours to solve.
  2) Somewhat annoying aiming system for your guns,
  though you kinda get used to it.
  As you can see, I heavily favour the pros of this game.  Indiana Jones and The Infernal Machine is a definate buy for Indy fans and anyone who craves action and seeks adventure.",4.0
"I had big worries about this game.  I used to play the old point and click adventures of indy and I was worried that, like its predisecors this would be insanley difficult.  Thankfully it is not.  I am a bad puzzle solver and luckily, (With the exception of the pyramid of the sun dial puzzle) none of the puzzles are that hard.  The graphics are quite nice and the levels are gigantic and tempt lots of exploration.  All of the characters are well done and interesting.  The music is nice and you have a lot of neat weapons to choose from.  However this game does have some flaws.  First off, sometimes you will be walking around wondering what the heck you are supposed to be doing.  Second, some of the enviorments are way too big.  The third and biggest flaw is that the last levels are way out of place.  The 2nd to last is strange but acceptable, but the last level is wayyyy out of place.  The last flaw is that the ending is really dissapointing.  Overall this is a fun game that will take up a lot of your time and is definatly one of the better Lucasarts titles.",4.0
"If you like Indy, you are automatically going to like this game.  It has lots of action and puzzles in it.  This game was a challange.  The graphics were amazing but the only flaw in the game would have to be it gets stuck  sometimes between a wall and a rock or something.  The characters were  developed very well and it gave you only a little of the plot at a time.  The way the story comes together makes you hungry for more.  Can't wait for  the next Indy game if it is like this.  Most games I beat i toss aside but  I have played this one three times over.  A must for all adventure fans.",4.0
"Yes, I'll admit that this game has some problems.  The engine is dated, there are a lot of bugs, the controls could be better, the dialogue is tedious (Indy: Wow!  Look at that little one (GEAR) go!) and the plot as a  whole is pretty darn unrealistic.  I recommend you forget all that, though,  because this is frankly the best bloody action game ever.  There are 17  levels that are huge, beautiful, and full of tough puzzles and challenging  enemies, and a few vehicles that are easy to control, except for the raft.  The puzzles range from startlingly easy to  Tear-Out-Your-Hair-And-Throw-The-Computer-Against-A-Wall difficult, but  they're all seemlessly incorporated into the game's atmosphere.  The bosses  are dangerous supernatural foes against whom conventional weaponry is  useless, and which you must use your wits and manuvering abilities to  defeat.  The lava guardian, for example, is one tough ol' bugger who lives  in a vast cavern of lava that you must jump across, while he throws flaming  embers and rises to block your path.  Battling these guys is tough, but not  impossible, just what I look for from bosses.  The other enemies, which  range from scorpions to bronze robots to huge muscle-bound Commies, are  well positioned and can have their endurance altered by the difficulty  mode.  One great features are the treasures, which you pick up to purchase  ammo, health, and the map to a bonus level.  Another is the ability to run  over Russians in both a jeep and a mine cart(with the jeep, you get to hear  both the soldier's yell and a blare of the horn).  The action is fantastic,  with Soviets firing bazookas at you, spikes popping out of walls, bridges  collapsing, barrels blowing up, lava caverns flooding, jeeps flying over  cliffs, and one or two huge boulders thundering after you as you run off  with a precious idol.  Another great move is the ability to roll, which I  find myself fervently wishing for while playing Dark Forces.  One final  note, the plot.  While this is a bit outlandish, I find it interesting and  it makes me really want to play on to find out what happens next.  Ask  yourself: does Tomb Raider even HAVE a plot of any decent quality?  No?  I  thought not.  So overlook the errors (most can be fixed with a patch) and  buy this game for the thrilling story, great moves, and fantastic levels.  The man with the hat is back!",4.0
"Even though I haven't finished the game yet, I'm far enough into it to attempt a review.  This is the first action-type adventure game I've attempted playing and it's been a real hoot! I guess it's best that I've  never played Tomb Raider as this feels fresh and new to me.  The plot feels  true to Indy and I love the locales, especially.  It's been a challenge to  use the controls but not too difficult.  I don't enjoy the combat much but  all the leaping, swimming, and puzzles are proving much fun.  I have the  hint book and I admit to using it once or twice being inexperienced but the  game is overall not too difficult to figure out what to do next.  The only  thing is, I'm exhausted after an evening of playing! I recommend this game  to both action AND adventure game fans!",4.0
"As I said, This is a good game, Acctually it's a great game. One of the best strategy games i have played(Along with Age of Empires 2 and The Sims).  I have always liked another game, age of empires as whell(I reccomend you check that out too), But this is a little bit different.  Unlike in AoE, were you just control humans, in this you control one of three species. The Zerg, The Protoss or the Terran(Human).Each with there own special units and abilitys.  The Graphics are acctually pretty good, Though some looks a little to cartoony(Not cartoony, i mean to much like animated stough).  You have 3 campiangs to play.(Duh, one for each Race/Species).  The one problem with it is its map editer.  I had always liked creating my own maps and scenarios in Aoe and was looking forward to creating maps on this game, but was dissapionted.  You can decide on the terrain and were resurces are and where you start, but thats about it.  It has this stupid dfault thing were evan if you ""DO"" put units, They just put your town center/Conrl center/Nexus, etc, and four worker units.  There is suppose to be some thing you type in in the propertis box to change this but it never works no matter what I do.  Despite this problem, its a good game.  Buy it",4.0
"This game is great, and it is a great game overall in order for LucasArts to strike back at Eidos's Tomb Raider for trying to take away Indy's title of the greatest adventure dude out there.  The game is one of the best I  have played, but if you do the wrong thing, the game crashes.  MOST of  these problems can be fixed by downloading patches at lucasarts.com, but I  really hate the hassle this causes.  Make sure you know how to get a patch  if you get this game.",4.0
"I bought Indiana Jones for my kids for Christmas but now I am hooked on it myself.  The major pros are that the graphics, content, and situations are fun and involving.  The major cons are that the game controls are difficult  to use, and sometimes you have to be positioned just right to make an  action happen.  Often, I've been at the right place at the right time but  action did not occur because Indy's feet were just not lined up perfectly  (remember this when you get to the raft). Lot of time wasted before I  figured this out.
Regarding controls, if you use a keyboard you have to  remember which key activates a gun, which one activates a whip...etc.  A  lot of thinking to do when a snake comes after you.  I am using a joystick  which controls movement, but still need to go to the keyboard to draw  weapons.  Painful.
Despite the drawbacks, I find myself playing the game  every night after work. I am a big fan of Myst...and this is not Myst.  Myst wears you out mentally and the physical stuff is just ok.  Indy is  much more physical.  The mental part is pretty straightforward.  Bottom-line:  a good balance between thinking/action that is keeping me  engrossed.",4.0
"Sometimes it's the little things that make a good game great.  This happened to me when I was playing the Jeep level and hit my first Communist doing 70 mph.  I laughed for about 15 minutes when I heard the excited yell  of the soldier as he flew up into the air, but this was not what I think  made the game great, it was the quick honk of the horn before the fatal  moment.
This, simply said, is a wonderful game; the art is superb, the  action is well-balanced along with the puzzles, and there's actually a  plot!  Something which is usually overlooked in a shoot-em-up game, but  prevalent in Lucasart's games (also in Redstorm's ""Rainbow 6""  series).
The only problem with this game is the weapons, which don't  really help with fighting.  For instance, the whip may be able to take  weapons from enemies' hands, but by the time you whip them, they've already  either killed you or wounded you to the point of death.  Also, I shot a guy  a point blanc range with the shotgun, and he didn't die.  This is a tad  unrealistic.
Also, it should be noted that whoever is the resident  archaeologist at Lucasarts is certainly doing his work; the art styles of  each region (although most artwork is fictional) corresponds very well with  the styles at the time.
In short, if you're an Indy fan. this is the  game for you...hell, even if you're not, it still is.
And watch out for  that bloody Quetzacoatl; Lord, I hate snakes.",4.0
"I am not an experienced gamer, in fact this is the first real computer game I have bought and so far I am loving it!  It feels 100% Indiana Jones and the story thus far (I'm not done yet!) has been entertaining.  Some people have complained that there are a lot of different keys to learn for  different movements.  However, after warming up on the first level you  pretty much have all of the important ones down.  I highly recommend this  game to anyone who likes Indiana Jones and wants a crack at solving an Indy  mystery on their own! (I would have given this 4.5 stars if possible!)",4.0
"I was worried about this one.  Would it have a good Indy-style story?  Would it make you feel like you were really controlling Indiana Jones?  Would it be something besides a different-looking Tomb Raider?  And most of  all, could it possibly have that Indiana Jones feel without Harrison Ford  being somehow a part of it?  The answer is yes to all of the above.  The  story is incredibly engaging for one thing.  Unlike the Phantom Menace  game, the story didn't lull just to accomadate frustrating jumping puzzles  (those are kept to a mininum in this game).  Although there is a slight bit  of things that will get you stuck and clueless, it's never so extreme  you'll want to quit the game.  I'm not quite finished yet because I'm  savoring every moment!  Are there any downsides?  Well, yes.  The music  (great in most LucasArts games) is almost nonexistent here.  When it comes  in though, it's high quality.  The graphics aren't incredible either,  especially in the character  and animations.  I loved the characters  anyway though.  Overall: This game just feels like Indy.  A beautiful love  interest, lots of twists, a supernatural edge, and of course the whole  Communist/Nazi thing.  4 stars.",4.0
Well I just recently completed this game and I must say I was very pleased.  I have a short attention span and hate to get hung up on a part of a game which I can't get around witout cheating.  This game while  sometime difficult kept the puzzles easy enough for me to keep playing.  I  had never played a tomb raider game either so I didn't have a lot of  knowledge of such games.  The levels were laid out nicely and the graphics  were good enough to make a couple screenshots worth while.  I can only say  this is a must have for any Indy fan and a good buy for a true gamer.,4.0
"Blizzard have always been a respectable computer game company, with good titles such as Diablo 1 and 2, Warcraft, and others, but Starcraft somehow manages to put all other computer games in the background as surely the greatest and most enjoyable Strategy game of all time.
It is very hard to explain what makes Starcraft such a good game, it just is. I think the easiest feature to notice is the incredibly balance in the game. All the sides are perfectly balanced, yet extremely different. While newbies may feel that one of the races is unfairly strong, or that another is far to weak, when used right, all can be equally devastating.
In Starcraft there are three sides, Terran (futuristic Humans who have been separated from Earth), Zerg (genetically stimulated super creatures) and Protoss (technologically advanced Psychics). Blizzard have done an outstanding job in creating a host of incredible units, with a mass of technologies and special abilities. Starcraft actually uses a very similar control style to Age of Empires 1 and 2, but despite them both being good games, it puts them both, and any of the Command and Conquer series to shame.
The construction sequence and technological research tree is perfect, with many interesting twists in game play if certain abilities are used together. The units are all entirely different, and even the way units are produced works in a different way for the Zerg Army. TO top it all off, Starcraft has the most extensive background story line and historical detail I've ever seen in a Strategy Game. The Manual comes with over ten pages of background info, and the three ten mission campaigns take hours to complete and continue along a compelling story arc. Finally, the game comes with an incredibly powerful campaign editor, even better than those of the two Age of Empires games, and any one of the missions in the actual campaigns can be made in the editor using triggers and events. You can even make your own fully animated briefings.
Starcraft is an absolute must for any Strategy Game fan, even if your thinking about purchasing some of the newer strategy games, such as Earth 2150, Red Alert 2 or Emperor Battle for Dune, get Starcraft first. As it's an old game, you can get it from amazon...(I'm not being paid to do this) and the expansion pack (which I also strongly recommend)...

"Great uncomplicated game with decent graphics and just the right amount of ""spookiness"".  I loved the puzzles which weren't overly difficult to solve and the HINT system was very very good in helping me get over one or two puzzles which did not seem to make sense.  The marble-in-the-hole game was a little irritating but all other puzzles were solvable even on a trial and error basis.  This game is probably not for people who like complex plots and puzzles but as a game novice I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed when the game ended (a little abruptly!).",4.0

After numerous tries, sometimes reloading and backtracking, the game would respond.  That was somewhat frustrating.  But overall, it was a lot of fun.  Just long enough, but the ending was a bit abrupt.",4.0

"This was a great series. The first One was by far the best (It got even better when Serria remade the first game). I only wished Serria gave you the chance to customize your own character type to go with the fighter/magic-user/thief classes. I did that purely by accident and it really brought a something unique to the character. Also, I wish the theif character was able to upgrade their weapon to a short sword instead of just being able to wield only a dagger. It was a good series, I just feel that Serria could've gone further with this series.
But hey, If you can grab this series, grab it. It's good.",4.0
"The first three months or so I played StarCraft, I loved it.  It seemed that nothing was wrong with this surprisingly bug free game.  However, the more you play it, the more you will realise its huge flaws.
Basically, it  is an RTS, which means you start from scratch and build an empire.  There  are three races to choose from: the Terrans, whose strength is in special  abilities like the nukes or Yamato guns but otherwise balanced between  firepower and cost; the Zerg, whose advantage lies in its cheap units and  their ability to build up a quick force; and the Protoss, whose units are  far more advanced and expensive.  The best race depends only on your  playing style.
Things go wrong however, when you realise that whoever can  build up a force of their best unit wins every game.  It is not a  world-class general that wins, it is number of units.  Too bad for me I am  a slow builder and lose every game I play.
Bottom line, the game's  lightning fast pace may not be suitable for some gamers, in which case they  should turn to the Age of Empires series.",4.0

This is an excellent game if you like the Real time strategy games, like AOE (age of empires).

The story is not the most amazing one i've ever seen, but is a  pretty good one.

"I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth out of Starcraft, because I've wasted several weeks of my life glued to the computer, playing it.  It's relatively easy to play, and a lot of fun learning the ins and outs of  the three different species.  Actually, it can be deceptively  addictive.
The unfortunate part is that the program running the game  makes the troops you command, regardless of the race, extremely foolish and  accident prone.  A lot of their behaviour defies explanation - just when  you've ordered all of your troops to hold position, your aircraft will fly  into enemy air defenses, ground troops will scatter, and when you're in an  enemy base, half your troops will be attacking buildings instead of  shooting back at the enemy.  It would be a great game if you didn't have to  constantly micromanage every single unit you have.
As it is, it is a very  good game.  I'd recommend it, but I would advise players to save the game  frequently, because it's annoying to have your careful strategy ruined by  limitations of the gaming engine.",4.0
"This game introduced me at a young age to communial development planning, and money management. This game is, I guess you could say, one to grow with, it takes time and it helps one to learn along the way. I'd also like  to add that it helps, especially a younger mind, to experience freedom with  their money allowing them to spend it as they choose. If he/she spends it  unwisely (go bankrupt) that person will know to become better managers of  their money the next time.",4.0

"Like most people, my kids would love to have complete control over their world.  Perhaps that explains the enjoyment they get from SimCity, even though the graphics on this version are outdated, and the onscreen movement is slow.
  While I know part of the appeal for my kids involves the ability to blow up cities with which they are not happy, they do stay with it, learning from the mistakes of the failed cities.  Along the way, they are gaining an understanding of the real apsects of city development--power grids, economy, education, controlled growth and government.  The terminology involved in basic civics classes is introduced in a way even grade school kids can understand.
  While placing limits on any video entertainment is a good idea,  I don't mind so much when they are playing Sim, saying yes when they ask, ""Can we just play a little longer?""",4.0
Sim City 2000 is good family fun and at the right price!  Everyone in our family from age 5 and up play the game and have a great time building and re-building the cities.  The game is easy to play and provides hours of fun.  If you have ever wanted to play city planner this is the game for you!,4.0
I've had fun with this game for hours and hours.  The gameplay is god.  The only 2 bad things is the graphic aren't that great and flood can't wide the city off the face of the earth.  It's worth the buy!,4.0
"I bought this game because it was on sale for about $10 at Staples. I  don't regret buying it, but after a while it gets boring. They don't have  many things to build with and the people are always complaining about  everything. Sometimes i just flood the place and build a new city. The  abandoned buildings are an eyesore so I usually end up deystroying them.  Then when you go to clean up the ashes, it costs like $1 per little square.  They only start you with $20,000 on the easy level. I would suggest going  into the urban city rebuilder and building your city there and then  importing it to the game. You save a lot of money that way and you can  design the land to be a valley or a hill without all the expense. All in  all, a good game.",4.0
"Wow I just remembered after how many years after visiting my grandma's house. I was able to find this in here copy of Windows HOme Essential 98 and was ecstatic. My cousins and I used to play this all the time at grandma's house when we had family get together's. We would all take turns playing the different levels in Flinty Flush, Jewel Chase, Rat Poker, Spring Weekend and more. Our favorites were Jewel Chase and Rat Poker. It was so much fun. We would literally spend hours on this. The games as a child were challenging to us but now playing it as an adult on my older computer still running Windows 98 it was somewhat easy but still fun and addicting. It's a great time killer. Maybe even for one of those long road trips. It could be something you could play on your laptop and it would probably keep your children occupied for awhile.",4.0
"This is good game. it has 20 cool trucks and a variety of neat, unique tracks. Graphics are so-so, and the weather options are great. It's okay but could be way better. their were no animals, or spraying mud. I recommend you get, but only if you are a casual player. This is no game for hardcore players.",4.0
"I have played all Monster Truck Maddness games since the original beta of the first for computer. There are several features that are not in the original game, such as headlights and truck damage. You can Play several new tracks that are meant only for multiplayer, which is very good. I don't why I didn't give this game a five star rating. It has tons of new trucks, courses, and the graphics are great. It is also great for a fan of Monster Truck racing. There are many cars that are used in real races, including the extremely famous Bigfoot. This game is also made by Microsoft, a great company making games such as AOE and AOK, two of my all time favorite games. I highly suggest this game.",4.0
"This was my first flight sim game that I rally enjoyed to play for hours at a time. It is much more fun than than MS flight sim 98 because I could fly NOW and have fun doing it instead of getting bogged down in so many details that I either got bored or frustrated. The graphics are okay but the game is so much fun that I forget about the graphics and have fun instead. One thing that I like a lot that I miss in other flight sims is that I can change the views (or perspectives) in ways that I cannot change in others. Such as... I can view like a chase plane and have the horizon change with the plane OR have the horizon stay flat and only have the plane change OR have the horizon change a second after the plane changes OR have your own plane fly past you and this gives a very vivid feel to flying that I love. I wish MS WW II combat simulator had that feature! I can also view my plane from the enemies perspective and that comes in very handy. I also like the fact that you have to be a real flyer in order to survive because you need to keep in mind the limitations of these old crates...dive and pull the stick up too fast and your wing breaks off!!!!just like the real ones. Keeping these limitations in mind makes you a much more precision flyer. There is also a distinct feeling of differing performance between planes. You have to play with your settings to get the best graphics. I just set mine until I can follow clearly the path of my bullets when I fire.  In later models (WW II) flight sims and later, you can do almost any maneuver and the plane stays together without coming apart, you are only limited by how many G's your body can take before you pass out. I have a semi old computer (400 mghz motherboard, 64M ram, voodoo 3000 graphics card) and it works great, good sound and interesting flight assignments. It is a great first flight sim and very forgiving. I also like biplanes a lot so I am biased. I have had the game over a year plus and still have not discovered all of its capabilities. I play with this more than my James WWII fighters and MS WWII combat flight sim. Priced right and a blast to play with. I have yet to fly on the web with others but I will soon. Improved terrain and graphics detail would make this game the hottest of hot among any flight sim. Buy it! I has been the most entertainment I have ever had for twenty bucks!",4.0
"Fantastic! But let me give you a warning first. I received this as a Christmas gift two years ago when I had a P133 with 48m of RAM and 4X CD-ROM. According to the system requirements on the box, I satisfied the  MINIMUM requirements. Upon loading the game, I experienced extremely  lengthy load times for missions,  jerkiness,  and jitter during combat (an  enemy would be in my sights one second and then up above me the next  second).  Missions with over 4 planes in the air brought my machine to a  near stand still and the time compression feature was useless as it would  take sometimes ten to fifteen minutes to reach a waypoint or target, even  with time compress set to 16X. These experiences occurred with the graphics  settings set to their minimum.  I even tried it on a P166 with little  improvement. Frankly it was not very fun and I was relegated to the ""Fly  Now"" missions only. Later I took advantage of the Red Baron 3D upgrade and  rebate offer hoping for some operational improvement, but there was none.  After several weeks I shelved the game and forgot about it thinking that  I  would soon upgrade my computer.
Well that time came two days ago. I  upgraded to a P600 with 128M RAM and a 40X CD-ROM. I pulled Red-Baron 3D  off the shelf, loaded it up, and the improvement is AMAZING!. At the  highest graphics setting I have difficulty finding any flaws in  performance. The frame rate is smooth, time compression is tremendously  improved, the planes handle well, and the graphics are pretty sharp even  without the 3DFX chip required for the 3D enhanced graphics (I'm running a  16m RIVA TNT, which is not supported for this game.)
The campaigns are  very immersive although sometimes the AI seems to get a little stupid. I  was able to shoot down Manfred Von Richthoven on my first mission! He was  very passive, making no attempts to get away or to turn and attack me.  Flying against him in the ""Single Mission"" scenarios he is very aggressive  and difficult to pull into a turning duel. I would expect that same level  of difficulty when meeting him in a campaign mission.
One of the things  I love is the little touches included in the missions. During one combat I  shot down an enemy plane and watched it hit the ground. As I circled the  downed planes neighboring air field, an ambulance came out of one of the  hangars and I was able to watch it go to the site where the plane crashed.  Incredible! Little things like this really pull you into this game.
As it  is, it is one of the most engrossing flight sims I have played and  I don't  see any chance of sleep for the next several nights. I recommend the game  but only if you have at least a P300 with 64m RAM and a high speed CD-ROM.  When game manufacturers determine minimum requiremnts I would like to think  that this is a minimum requirement by which the game can still be enjoyed.  So purchase wisely.",4.0
"Ok if you are new to flight sims like i was get this game as your first flight sim. you will get the hang of it and buy other flight sims. anyway with the game the graphis are great and you can be a german, french,  american, or british pilot.

Some of the new  monsters are quite challenging.  There's a new ""dungeon"" that  pops up in the field outside of town filled with some seriously nasty bugs.  I did a lot of saving and reloading.
If you're a big fan of the game, I  think this addition is worth every penny.",4.0
I loved diablo one and two but lets face it the online community for diablo one is dead very rarely will you see anyone playing it online and playing it single player is not that great either because you can only play in normal mode but with this expansion you can play it in single player on normal nightmare or hell difficultys and you get a new class items and two new dungeons its worth it if your a diablo fan.,4.0
"Diablo is the game that changed everything.  I had high hopes for this expansion.  This expansion was published by Sierra not Blizzard, and it shows.  The install insists on installing bloatware.  The Monk is added to the playable characters, but is not well thought out.  A monk should be a hand fighter, but instead it uses the staff like a wizard.  The special ability, to locate treasure is nice, but because the ""search"" skill can be learned in a book it is not unique like the trap finding of the rouge, or the smithing skill of the warrior.  The monk is a disappointment.  There are a lot of new items, mostly traps.  Because it adds items, the player does not find as many good items, as it raises the probability of finding them.  I did not find any new quests.  This is a very old game, and while fun, it won't run in Windows 7.  I had to dig out a very old XP computer before I could play it.  I am glad that Blizzard has not allowed other publishers to create expansions since.  I am glad to have played this expansion, but I don't think it was worth the price.  The seller however was wonderful.  I would recommend him.",4.0
"You'll have to create a COMMAND.TXT folder & place ""multitest cowquest theoquest bardtest barbariantest"" to unlock some of this stuff.

Not having played Diablo without the expansion, I can't say what else is new, but I DO like that this game has the SAVE ANYWHERE feature than many games after it neglected. There are an aweful lot of different dungeon maps, so I suppose some were added, as well as armor, weapons, monsters, extra difficulty. On the negative side, it didn't add better voice acting.....",4.0

"When this came out everyone went crazy because it was new and the games were on discs. Which is much eaiser and handier to keep clean and take places. Most people had a N64 before this and even at the same time, so they were used to the cartridges which were big and bulky and somewhat annoying. It has two memory card slots and two controller slots, and it can play compact dics so you can listen to music when your bored on your tv with your own cds. Most games on this console had good graphics back then so people thought it was amazing. They became highly addicting and very fun to play. This became the most popular system in the USA and almost everyone had one back then. Many games get scratched and broken as time goes on since they are old but try to keep them in their own cases they came in so they will play better and much longer with out the annoying freezing and skipping of the game. I am saying this because many games will not play or work anymore because of the lost case so they were just thrown around in the closet untill i finally put them in a computer case way back when....now i am more protective of the games because it is very dissapointing to find that your favorite game will not work anymore and you have to go through the trouble to buy them online because stores do not keep or sell them anymore.

"The controller I received when I ordered this wasn't quite the one pictured. It was a Super Nintendo-COMPATIBLE controller by a company called the CKLA Group. It didn't have the colored buttons (which was good, as I wanted it to look more my existing controller, anyway), had lesser-quality colors, and was only marked ""Super Pad"" at the top center.
Aesthetics aside, it's slightly more lightweight than the original controller and the arrow pad seems a bit harder to move (though this may just be due to the years of use that I've given my current SNES controller - loosening it up through wear and tear.) Therefore, if you're a stickler for more sensitive controls, you may want to look to find a controller actually manufactured by Nintendo. If you can't, however, I think this one serves as a perfectly adequate replacement.",4.0
"Right up front, you need to know that this is not an easy game.  Video jocks who play all those fast paced (and basically brainless) real time strategy games will probably not go for this one.  However, thoughtfull  players with some tactical skill who like a real challenge will find this  game very rewarding.
The heart of the game is its tactical combat system,  which is by far the best that I've seen in any fantasy game.  Maneuver  plays a big part in it:  Using your faster units to circle around and hit  your opponent's archers.  Using your slower melee units to screen your  archers from his troops.  Using the terrain to set up ""kill  zones"" that you can lure your opponent into.  It will take a little  getting used to, so expect to loose your first few battles until you figure  out how things work.
The game has an interesting variety of units and  spells, and a particularly nice selection of artifacts that you can find in  dungeons and such.
The strategic level is good but not great. You collect  resources, you build things, you research spells, same as in most games.  One nice addition is the ability of high level characters to train new  units, letting them start off with some experience.  This solves the  problem that occurs in so many games of this type, where new units starting  late in the game are basically hopeless.
The two real weaknesses in the  game are  1.  A very limited diplomatic engine.  There are a total of eight  powers in the game, but your options for peacefull interaction with the  other seven are pretty limited. 2.  Weak AI players, at least on the  strategic levels.  Some of the computer players do absolutely suicidal  things, like walking their undefended leader up to one of your strongholds.  Even the toughest, Balkoth Lord of Death, isn't nearly as aggressive as he  should be.
Overall, this is a challenging but very interesting game that  players with some tactical skill will really enjoy.
Oh, and one fast note  for new players: The hardest part of the game is the opening.  To maximize  your survival chances, make your starting character a wizard of life, then  on your first four turns, attack four level one dungeons.  Then use all  your resources to hire mercenaries and attack the great temple.
Good  luck!",4.0
Yes alot of old games do not have the great graphics like modern games but this game does have a certain appeal to it and has some fun if you are willing to give it a try.

It has amazing music, art-work, and you can really tell that the makers spent hundreds of hours making sure everything was seamless.

"This game was one of my all time favorites on any platform.

It is uniquely challenging and rewarding. It is not a game that can normally be played in a few minutes, so it does take some patience and practice, which may frustrate some people who are used to modern games that take little patience or deep thought.

As a rebuttal to those who perhaps gave this game a less than favorable review, I noticed many of those were based on percieved difficulty, particularly in the Player vs computer mode.

The Death computer DOES start with at least one extra hero, I believe two extra heros on the highest difficulty setting, but that is because Balkoth has the most enemies, and he's supposed to be over powered. It balances out though.

If you find that the computer has a much larger army than you, its only because you haven't properly balanced economy, military and exploraton. In short, try again.

I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has never played it.

Some tips to anyone who recently bought it and perhaps struggling, or a new customer.

1) Never use autocalculate unless there is no chance whatsoever of losing the fight. Never autocalculate vs an enemy's main hero even if you think there is no chance of losing. Balkoth will murder you on Autocalculate, especially on high difficulty.

2)You MUST micro and manually fight most main enemy hero parties or you will simply lose too many units. You may get lucky sometimes with autocalculate, but in general you'll lose so much stuff over several battles that Balkoth, or some other enemy hero, will end up too far ahead of you. Manual is definitely to your advantage.

3) When you get ready to fight Balkoth, do not just use one or two battalions, especially if the game has gone on long and he is max level. Balkoth is almost strictly better than any other hero in the game, so there is no such thing as a ""fair"" fight against his main party.

Conquer several cities and Macro up a couple dozen battalions. Then, play hit and run, killing as many of his supporting battalions and outlying towns as possible, while avoiding Balkoth himsef. After this, corner Balkoth's main party somewhere on the map. Next, send wave after wave of ""expendable"" battalions to weaken him. Once most of his army is dead, send in your main hero's party to finish him off.

4) After you win the game on easy or normal, play through the game a time or two AS Death so you learn more about their strengths and weaknesses. This will be a cakewalk compared to playing vs Death, but it will help you tremendously on the highest difficulty setting because it will help you learn what they can and can't get away with.",4.0
This is an old favorite that I cannot leave behind even though graphics and sound are dated. Gameplay is quite addicting and guess what? It runs smoothly on Windows XP even though it was created ages ago. Most oldies I like to replay I have to run on my old Windows98 machine that I keep around just for this purpose.

"I first encountered Lords of Magic as a demo and immediately fell in love with this engaging, difficult, sometimes maddening but eminently addictive game.  Even in the relatively spartan demo game LOM's strong points were irrisistible:  the classic theme of pure good vs. pure evil, the picturesque maps, the enchanting and absolutely gorgeous music (probably the best of any game I've encountered), the multifaceted tactical combat system, and last but not least the game's superb replayability.
Naturally, when I got my hands on the full game I was hopelessly spellbound.  My wife might say ""hexed""!  Be warned:  if you do buy this game, be aware you will be investing not only hard-earned cash (though not much--the price is a steal), but huge pockets of your time.  This is not only because LOM is great fun, but because it's exceptionally difficult as well.  Beating this game is not easy.  Be prepared to take your lumps and go through a lot of frustration (albeit fun frustration!) before you finally win the day.
The game itself is strategy-based, and runs on turns during which each of the eight paths--called ""faiths""--that populate the world of Urak make their moves.  Though the turn system is convenient and offers your character many choices of action, each turn does take a while.  Healing and resource accumulation are based on the passage of time, so after a tough battle you will have to sit passively through a few turns to recuperate.  Moreover, the map of Urak over which your character moves is pretty big, and it can take several turns just to get from A to B, during which time you may be attacked by wandering monsters or see one of your fortresses sacked by raiding parties.  To put it mildy, LOM is not for the impatient!
LOM follows a straightforward fantasy formula:  the world of Urak is being overrun by the armies of Death itself, led by Balkoth the Destroyer, a diabolical necromancer who commands huge armies both living and dead and a powerful arsenal of black magic.  You the player must choose a champion from one of eight different faiths (Order, Water, Air, Chaos, Fire, Earth, Life, or for those who have beaten the game at some point possibly even Death)and take on Balkoth and his seemingly limitless hordes on as either a Warrior, Mage, or Thief.  (I personally usually choose to be a Warrior of Order, since that allows me to fulfill a lifelong dream of being a Paladin or Knight.) Each class of character is different from faith to faith, so the possible characterizations are many and varied.  Whichever type of hero you choose, your character starts out weak and unknown and must slowly, painstakingly build himself up in terms of experience, magic, artifacts, fame, money, and military might.  This means liberating besieged dungeons and forts and defeating enemy troops or marauding monsters, or bartering with friendly neighbors (of which there aren't many).  Battle resolution is fun and plays in real time so there's a lot of variety.  Battles do feature a ""pause"" option if you want to reconsider things and there's also an ""autocalculate"" button if you want the computer to determine the battle's outcome for you, though it seems the computer often underestimates the player's strength.  If things go badly, the ""restart"" option lets you give it another go, and you may want to save your game often. If--and I do mean if--you meet and defeat Balkoth head-to-head, you win!
Lords of Magic probably isn't for everyone.  The slow pace will aggravate those more inclined towards fast arcade-style games, and the fact that you may have to play for several days on end is an understandable turn-off for others.  Moreover, the game can get repetitious at times, as you're likely to have to conquer and reconquer the same territory several times and spend an awful lot of game time simply convalescing.  And then there's the simple fact that LOM is a very difficult game.  Merely staying alive can be a problem, especially if you're ambitious, and actually killing Balkoth may seem like an impossible dream after you've just given your 53rd character the last rites.
But you can win, if you've got the time, patience, and energy it takes.  If you do, then I heartily recommend Lords of Magic to you. When you finally finally kill the Arch-Demon of Death, it will all be worth it!",4.0
"Sins of the Fathers (first game): While primitive-looking by today's  standards, this is a surprisngly deep and compelling game.  The characters  convey actual personality (from Gabriel's machismo to Grace's waspishness),  and you can't help but be swept up in this story of voodoo and destiny.  Even the midi music is pretty cool, though it might drive you insane if you  stay in one area too long....
 Beast Within (second game): A  full-motion-video game that shows you just how good the format can be.  While I didn't care so much for the guy who played Gabriel, everyone else  (especially Grace!) did an incredible job.  In this game Gabriel has  accepted his heritage, to a point, but won't accept help from Grace.  Not  that that stops Grace (little does).  In this game, you switch between the  two, as they work on the case from both ends (I found myself enjoying  Grace's detective work more than Gabriel's good ol' boy attempts at  sleuthing--though both are fun). Werewolves, missing Wagnerian operas, and  dead Bavarian kings all combine in an enthralling story that sweeps you  along, impatient for the next video clip.  And the music...both the opera  itself and the incidental music set the mood, and immerse you fully in this  epic.",4.0
"Ahhh, Gabriel Knight! What can I say? Probably one of the best adventure series to date. This Limited Edition package includes games GK1 and GK2  along with the sound track, a graphic booklet to GK3, GK1 novelization, and  little this and a little that.
I would say that this limited edition is  worth purchasing, but more so if you are new to the series. The biggest  thing in this edition is probably the soundtrack. The rest that is has to  offer (such as the games themselves) most fans already have. There is the  novelization of book of GK1 (not including GK2), but if you don't have it,  you can purchase both books here at Amazon.com. The limited edition also  has a prologue GK3 graphic booklet, but if you purchase GK3, the same  graphic booklet is included. There might be bug fixes in the limited  edition versions of GK 1&2, but if you have problems with your earlier  releases of the games, you can always download patches directly from  Sierra.com.
The soundtrack was slightly dissapointing.  Most of the  tracks are from GK2 and minimum from GK1 and GK3 (but GK3 wasn't out yet at  the time of this release).
If you are new to GK and want to see what it's  all about, I suggest getting this purchase instead of hunting for these  games seperately.",4.0

"Several reviews mentioned the sensitivity issue related to the directional pad.  It is true that the directional keys aren't as sensitive as the original SNES controllers were, but they do work reliably and the rest of the controller is great.  For the price, these controllers are just great.",4.0
"Lords of Magic is a very ambitious game.  It has great graphics and sound, and it is quite different from all of the Warcraft clones out there.
Unfortunately, the game has many problems.  The AI is seriously flawed in combat, and when bartering with computer players.  Also, the game is just too easy.  It may take a while to biuld up your forces, but you can win the game without ever encountering serious opposition.  Sure, the marauding parties are a constant nuisance, but they usually never accomplish more than taking over a brewery for a day or two before you eliminate them.
Despite its flaws I really like what the game tries to accomplish.  With a little more variety and much better AI the next Lords of Magic could be the best fantasy-strategy game available.",4.0
"I needed a new controller for my SNES and I got this. It was cheap. It works with my SNES 2. The buttons aren't quite as responsive as my 10+ year old, high use, official controllers, but it gets the job done for cheap.",4.0
Great product... 4.95 with shipping VIA prime.. cannot really beat that.. everything worked great with the controller and even the weight felt right.. the only issue and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the cord for the controller is only like 3 feet long... the orginal SNES controllers are 6 foot... it's a big difference,4.0
"I got this controller for my RetroN3 and it works fine. This is however my 2nd clone SNES controller becouse my first one thats about two years old stop working.

"This is a great basic SNES controller. Aside from lacking the Nintendo logo across the top, it's nearly indistinguishable from my OEM controller. The cord is probably a bit over a foot shorter than the OEM controller's, but it's still plenty long. The buttons also feel a little bit stiffer but I suspect as another reviewer mentioned that it's the difference between being broken in and being brand new. I was pleased to find there was absolutely no effect on gameplay. The controller feels good and works perfectly.",4.0

"I'm not a hardcore gamer or anything, but I've been using this as a second controller for Super Mario World, Donkey Kong Country, and Street Fighter II. The pad works fine, diagonals and all, and the buttons are just as responsive as the Nintendo-brand SuperPad that came with my SNES. No problems. Can't beat the price.",4.0
"These are not the original controllers, but for the price, they're all right. The ""up"" button sticks sometimes, but only on one (I bought two) and that could easily be because my toddler got a hold of it. All in all, I'd recommend this",4.0
"Item arrived faster than an item I purchase at the same time time even though the delivery date for this one was supposed to be a day later at least haha. This would be 5 stars if it didn't look poorly made. Small chunk missing in lower right part of the 4 button set up and the R button can be tricky, you just have to know where to push it to get it to work right =P works perfect with my computer!  Haven't tested it with an actual SNES system but if it works for my computer I see no reason to doubt its performance on the SNES.  Cord is definitely longer than most the controllers I've seen on Amazon.  I'd say almost 6 feet.  I'm 5'9"" last I checked a few years ago and it reaches a little above me from the ground.

I'd definitely recommend this over the other controllers that are on Amazon if you're not looking for an original SNES controller, which I'll say, are TERRIBLY DIFFICULT to find.",4.0

"i found that this game was really difficult, i mean its so hard to hit ANYTHING, even if you lead them.  I guess its realistic though, so points on that note.  if you like flight games, then i reccomend this title, if  you dont, then you will find that it gets slow quickly",4.0
"Despite not being a fan of other Jane's Fighters games, I enjoyed this entry.  The premise is obvious - fly missions in Europe's war-ton skies in the famous fighters of the day.  The format of the sim is similar to that of other Jane's fighters titles - you have a flight panel that's more for show than functional; you have separate pop-up windows for your instruments or to spot and range the enemy; you can click on individual targets and handy steering cues point the way to the enemy.  That said, WW2F is graphically a more modern generation of sim than those like USNF or ATF.  Graphics are more realistically defined, and are more immersive than those games.  The planes (instantly recognizable to any mil/av buff) look so realistic, you half expect to see your reflection in their chrome finish.  Atmospheric effects are clearly superior to the first CFS (which roughly coincided with this game) - including clouds, AAA fire and smoke effects from wounded aircraft.  Flight is difficult even at nominal settings - aircraft here are unstable, and may fly apart if overstressed, or simply fall out of the sky if load-factor isn't watched.  AI is somewhat impressive (I mean, I routinely got shot out of the sky, but I'm normally a horrible pilot), though must be compromised to an extent to fit a game where everybody in fighters will fight each other.  (Case in point being Me-262 jets, which will remain in prolonged combat with prop fighters like the Mustang, even though there principal quarry was the box formations of allied bombers; their acceleration and turning capabilities made them unsuited for dogfighting.)  For its great atmospheric effects, nothing seems to cover up an unconvincing attempt to model the terrain of Europe - although most of your work will be up high.  The campaign mode isn't quite dynamic, but it's not as canned as the one on CFS.

In short, this is as solid WW2 sim - perfect for those intimidated by the hardcore realism (and hardware requirements) of IL-2, but left hungry by CFS.

I ran this on a Pentium 4, with XP and a 64MB GF3 card.",4.0

the game is extremely fun and challenging. also the game has the best cheats. BUT the game doesnt have the cheats I want and also some games are just to hard and long.that is why i gave it four stars.,4.0
"If you have ever played the regular game of Starcraft, you probably have enjoyed it.  If you did enjoy it, you will enjoy it even more as there are new landscapes, objects, and units.
Protoss - Level 1 - The protoss race contains a dark templar which will allow you to mind control other players units.  Mind control is simply this: once you click the mind control button and then another players unit, you will control their unit.  The dark templar is very useful as you can build all three races (if you mind control another player's drone or SCV and build a hatchery or Command Center).  This race also includes an anti-air air craft which is not as significant, but it can put some kind of shield around anti-air ground units (such as the creep colony thing and the turret).
Terran - Level 2 - Terran also includes an anti-air air craft which is not very significant (I think it can do the same thing as the protoss one can).  The significant unit that has been added is the medic.  The medic can heal your units and other units (must not be mechanic e.g. goliath), very useful.
Zerg - Level 3 - The Zerg race contains a new unit called the lurker.  The lurker works like a sunken colony, yet, the enemy units cannot see the lurker (as it can only be burrowed in order to hurt other units) thus making it very effective.  The lurkers can only be seen with a detector of some sort.
The above reviewed are only the things I have noticed, there are probably much more.  Also the landscapes include landscapes such as snow, etc.
Now, those of you who have never played starcraft before may be thinking that this review is not helpful at all.  Well I am now getting to you...
Starcraft is a game basically for teens (as it is rated).  The reason?  The Terran race (at least in Starcraft original) swears in the movies.  I'm not sure if you want your kids to experience this.  They are the only race that swears and their are very few movies, that can be skipped if you click your mouse button.  This game is very complicated and I suggest you buy the original game and play it first (you need the original game in order to play the expansion anyways) as it contains the tutorials.  Once you are familiar with all the races, then go ahead and get the expansion (or install it if you get the battle chest) and play it.  Also, after you are familiar it is not complicated at all.  The expansion is much more fun, and addictive.
This game also allows you to play online for free (must have internet access) with other players.  Online is also very fun as people create maps that are not missions (use map settings games) and are just to have fun with.

This game is great. I have a new computer and I still am able to go back  to Broodwar/Starcraft even though it may seem outdated. It just shows that  a game is built off of more than graphics and more on replay value and  gameplay.,4.0
"An amazing expansion to an amazing game.  The new troops were clever and fun to use.  I did find that they 'equalled' the races out a bit too much though.  Were each race was different in it's own respect before, now they  had either a similar troop or a great counter against it.  Also, due to  patches to the online play, the Zerg were seriously crippled for online  play (they slowed their creation from the hive to a crawl).  As a result, I  found too many weakness in all the other races, aside from  Protoss.
Still, when you have a hit game like that and all the fans want  more maps more troops and more scenarios...how can you go wrong?",4.0
"For those unfamiliar with the Quest for Glory series, you are allowed to choose between playing a fighter, a magician, or a thief.. also if you are a dilligent player of the series you can import a character from a previous  game which gives you access to the Paladin.  (Or if you know where to look  on the internet, you can download a paladin elsewhere easily)  Your goal is  to win the rites of leadership over a land whose king was murdered and find  out the truth behind his death.  For whatever character type you play the  means for solving the puzzles and finding the answers are different.  As an  added bonus, there are also numerous side quests for the various character  types to complete which can double the length of the game, or you can  ignore them and get to the meat of the issue if you'd rather.
Quest for  Glory V is done in polygons and has multiplayer capability (if you download  a patch from the Sierra website).  You can choose the fighting and game  difficulty in the menu screen if you want to focus more on fighting or on  adventuring.
If there is any one thing I would nitpick about it would be  the character movements, they're stiff and a bit unrealistic... but that  can be easily cast aside once you begin to get into the game.  Quest for  Glory in its first four incarnations was a game played with sprites, so  polygons add a whole new depth to it.
For someone that wants to play a  fantasy adventure game this would be one of the games I reccomend.  Since  there are different quests for different character types you can also play  this game more than once to see how things would go if you decided to be a  Paladin or a thief instead of a wizard which gives it good replayability as  well.",4.0
The game was somewhat enjoyable. The soulutions to the puzzles were to hard to think of (who would think of a gondola as a hot air balloon basket?). The worst thing about this game would have to be the terrible puns. They nearly drove me out of my mind. Not one of them was even mildly funny. I think this game was worth the money but not exactly a terrific deal.,4.0
"The Quest for Glory series is the best series of computer games there is, in my opinion.  Although not my favorite of the series, (QG2, Trial by Fire is), the graphics and music are really good.

"I love this game but it is old, old, old.  So please Sid make a new version!  Keep the notion of the different factions.  They are still timely (maybe moreso nowadays) and also rather cathartic - Bummed by the latest real-life ecological disaster?  Play the green faction and run A. Centauri your way.  Keep the rich world where one small thing (a terraform, a new tech, a society tweak) can effect so many other aspects of the game.  Keep the mind worms because they are cute, slimy and deadly.  Keep the great (and/or crazy) quotes as they really give the feeling of a new civilization built on an old one.  Keep the wheeling and dealing and the planetary politics.  But the game needs new graphics, more native life and plants (even more than in Alien Crossfire), new updated tech/secret projects, more detailed cultural aspect of the game (options beside hologram theatres and recreation commons), better AI (no overlapping base grids!), and probably real-time play rather than turn based for more excitement (but I'm flexible :)).

"I really liked playing this game. Even though it was made about 10 years ago, the graphics don't take away from the great gameplay and concepts. I really suggest getting this game if you like scifi and turn-based games",4.0
"I've owned this game for many years.. so long I don't even remember .. pre-2000. To the best of my memory, this game occurred when Sid and the Civ people were having a bit of falling out.. so Sid moved to Fireaxis and produced this game which built into it many of the ""improvements"" that he forsaw for Civ.. it was in some ways a ""pointer"" to CIV III and some of the changes to occur there.

Being a 1999 game it has ""primitive"" graphics.. no 3D etc as in today's games, but I still think they're decent. Also, like Civ II, this is not a half-hour game.. it can go on for some time.. but at least you can save it and pick it up later.

It does occur ""beyond Civ"".. after the launch of the spaceship and colonization of space.. and involves a new set of ""races"" and a new tech tree. Some call the tech tree ""too foreign"" or hard to understand.. but I don't really think so.. the techs may seem ""artificial"" or ""invented"" while the Civ tech's seem ""real"".. that is techs based on things we are familiar with. To me they are just a ladder to climb to more advanced capabilities.. wonders (called ""special projects), social options, units, etc.

The game can be won through diplomacy, conquest, transcendence (sort of a human-evolution event), economics, cooperative.. and many rules can be turned ""on/off"" and ""iron man"" mode.

Further there is major flexibility in choosing not only governments, but also economics, military, education, environment (big factor in this game), research, health, etc. And you can take ""stances"" ruthless, moderate, or idealistic for military interactions.  Trade still can play a big role too.

This is not a war game (though it can be played that way).. instead it is an influence and strategy game.. Without being too longwinded, I think its strong points are (relative to Civ II)
* You can use the ""governor"" much better including customizing it to your own rules.. as opposed to the governor in Civ which I don't know anyone who uses.. (including unit automations) These are especially useful in  to reduce the tedium in the ICS (Infinite City Sprawl) and ""pop-booming"" strategies often employed where there may be MANY MANY cities.
* Strategic deallings with other civ's are crucial to a successful game.
* Boundaries (or areas of influence) are introduced.. these help ""manage"" war/peace and some of the really annoying situations in Civ II.
* You can set ingame ""slants"" on the governor as you progress through appropriate ""play styles"" of explore, discover, build and conquer.. you have to be prepared to play any of them depending on game circumstances.
* There are MAJOR improvements in automation beyond just the governor and ""slants"" such as using queue's for building, and ""group"" commands like ""build road to"" instead of having to go tile by tile to do it. The GOTO command is improved too complete with mod's like ""avoid enemies"" etc
* Instead of a lot of units, the units instead are basic, but EXTENSIVE mods can be researched and added to basic units to form new capabilities. This helps avoid the ""warrior vs machinegun syndrome""
* All units can be upgraded for a fee.. this is more realistic than the ""throwaways"" or needing ""Leo's Workshop"" wonder.
* Materials don't have to be in the city to use it.. they can be ""teleported"" to other cities from one city or from a distant location if you can control the land.

Well you get the idea.. its just a lot of new stuff.. :)

I DON'T particularly like the huge differences among the races.. some of which have such constraints that they are virtually impossible to win a game with.. only 4 or so really lend themselves to playable games. But I don't think this is a ""game stopper"".. just a constraint.. It would be nice if some of the traits could be modified to more balance the game, but I truly think they were created to be a foil to the human player. As you play, you can use the ""social engineering"" for some balancing.

The game is richly complex with numerous ""in-play"" options, mod's and social structures, etc that can give play variations.

All in all I find it to be a game offering many enjoyable hours.. though it is hard to ""FORCE IT"" to play your play style.. you instead have to probe for play styles that fit the nature of the challenges of your particular game. I still find myself playing this now and then even 10 years after it's release.

It can be purchased now for the $10-15 range including shipping. I'd say its a definite option at those prices.",4.0
I bought this game at a EB store. It was one of the most interesting civ games I have ever played. It had verry good game concpts and I played for hours on end. And that was about 7 to 10 years ago. I still remeber playing it. But then again I like all civ games. It got 4 stars over all. But I only got 3 stars of fun out of it. I finaly got burnt out on it and traded it. And I have nothing but good memories from playing it. Planting forest and reaserching biomorphic fugi. And the wierd mind worms which took the place of barbains. Differnt factions such as chairman yang of the hive and more cool stuff.,4.0
"In 1991, Microprose release Sid Meier's Civilization, a game like no other the world had ever played.  It's innovative take on developing technology and advancing a civilization took the world by storm.  It won Game of the Year in 1992 (Computer Gaming World) and Best Consumer Entertainment Program in 1991 (Software Publishers Association).  This was only the beginning of its success.

 850,000 copies later, it has entered game history.  Few computer gamers haven't played it, and it's legacy is going strong.

 In 1996, Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs, and Brian Reynolds banded together to form Firaxis games (named after a musical piece by Jeff Briggs).  Why the sudden break with Microprose?  I haven't heard an official story, and I wouldn't dream of promoting rumors . . .

 The fact remains that Sid Meiers left, without Civilization.  The first release Firaxis had was Sid Meier's Gettysburg.  Now, Alpha Centauri is the second release.

 This game continues the old tradition of Civilization and Civilization II.  You build cities, develop technologies and form strategic pacts, all in the old familiar fashion.  But does it do justice to it's presitgious lineage?  Drum roll please . . .

 Yes.

 That is not a resounding yes, but a yes nevertheless.  I enjoyed this game immensely.  I did tired of it more quickly than it's predecessors, however.  I couldn't say whether that has to do with the quality of the game, or if it's just because I've done all this before.  Needless to say, I haven't met my goal of winning it every way possible on the hardest level.  I'm sure I`ll never meet the goal of winning with every faction.

 So what is the game like?

 We'll its just like all the others.  You don't see the buildings being build on you city display, but you can set up ques of buildings.  You can also set three different governers, allowing you to set a governer with the same priorities as technology.  Want to go to war?  Set all of your governers to Conquest.  Want to spread out?  Set them to Explore.  Want to build?  You guessed it.  Set them to Build.

 In most of the games in the past, I'd rather hammer a nail through my hand than use their governers.  Alpha Centauri is the first on the really won me over.  The stupid things they do a rare enough to cause less headache than doing all the work myself.

 The game looks much like it's predecessors.  The graphics are better, but that's to be expected.  Game play is essentially the same.

 This game has a lot of fun moments.  The story line to the plot (it does have a story line), is interesting, if not compellingly presented.  Each new achievement give a quote, some of them pretty funny.  My favorite is the Recycling Tanks: ""It is every citizen's final duty, to go into the tanks . . .""  Soylent Green anyone?  A close second is the blatantly Microsoft based add with the tag line ""Where do you want your node today?""

 To get the full impact of this game, win by transcendence.  Only in this way, will you see the storyline played out to conclusion.

 Bottom line?  I liked it.  You will too, if your not looking for something different.  It doesn't matter how many innovations went into the technology, the game concept was not particularly innovative.  I've seen people who loved it and people who got sick of it in ten minutes, because they had played so many hours on it's predecessors.  You'll have to decide which kind of person you are.",4.0
"This is a good space simulator.  It allows you to control many different aspects of your people, including socio/economic model, resources, transportation, security, etc.  It also allows you to design your own units based on what technologies you have researched.  It is also a good macroscopic military strategy game.  It is turn-based, so if you play only RTS don't play this.  If you don't mind turn-based games, though, and you like space-based strategy games, you should play this.  The graphics are second-rate, but that is just because it is old.",4.0
"Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit is surely one of the best games for PC. There are many cars to choose from, and if you don't like any car from the list, you can download a new one from the internet!

In this game you can race against a second human player. Another good feature is that you don't have to be the racer; you could be the police! You have your radar to detect speeding cars and can stop them with spike strips, roadblocks, and many other things.
If you like challenging games, I think this is the game for you. You won't find a better one.",4.0

"Alpha Centauri is a turn-based, city-building strategy, a great follow-on but not a sequel to Civilization II. The game adds a lot of diplomacy features although I usually try to wipe the other players out. Alpha Centauri has automation features too: City governors who decide what to build, although sometimes they would try to build something they shouldn't such as the `Build' governor making military units. Overall a classic, recommended for most and a must have for Civilization fans.",4.0
"Civilization II was a good interm game and was one of the most addictive  of 1996, but it was limited where it could go.  Civilization III, unless it  had intense graphics, would not add anything (other than a few new  civs/technologies) over the second one.
So Sid Meier took the natural  step and went to Alpha Centauri.  It takes place after humans' take their  first step into the unknown.  However, the pod taking the pioneers breaks  up and splits into several pieces, hence several factions are born, all  with different abilities/talents and philosophies.  However, all want to  dominate the planet.
The factions are unique and contrived at the same  time.  To have them all completely different is alittle too convenient.  However, it makes it easier to tell them apart.  The game play is similar  to CIV II, but there are more units, more technologies and more of  everything.  You can make over 60 different units, all with different  strengths/weaknesses as well as cultivate the local alien creatures.
There are also a lot more technologies one can create, although there is  no more direct control of which technologies you can create.
However, the  best feature of the game is that once your empire gets big, you don't have  to spend all this time micromanaging your empire.
  Firstly, you can quene a long production line of up to 8 creations, so  instead of creating a Recreation Commons and then coming back to create a  Tree Farm, you can preprogram a colony to do it automatically.
  Secondly, you can annoint a governor to control what goes on in an  individual city.  They will build stuff based on what criteria you set for  that city.  If you set it on build, it will build certain things, if you  set it on conquer, it will build war machines, etc....
All in all another  addicting game from the Meier camp...Rating: B",4.0
"I am a huge fan of Sid Meier's products, and I enjoy AC very much.  This  game is largely Civ2 in space, with a couple of distinct changes that  greatly improve the game play.  First, the planet Chiron (or  ""Planet,"" as it is called) is much more of a character in the  game than Earth is in Civ and Civ2.  Your increased industrial development  may result in environmental damage.  Where Civ and Civ2 punish haphazard  development with pollution, Planet strikes back.  Xenofungus, the  ubiquitous red-pink substance that covers much of Planet's surface, will  wipe out your environmental improvements.  Also, global warming may cause  the oceans to rise, wiping out your coastal cities.  In Civ and Civ2, your  only responses to pollution are to build certain city improvements and use  your settlers to eliminate pollution.  In AC, you may build improvements,  or you may also change your society's philosophy to ""Green"" to be  more in tune with Planet.  Also, you may change your geographic  improvements from Mines and Solar Collectors to the more eco-friendly  Forest, or you may plant more Fungus.  Second, choices of various Social  Engineering choices are more varied in AC, allowing for greater variety of  societies.  Third, the production queue and Governor function automate some  of the more tedious aspects of the game.  And the graphics for the units,  the cities (each faction's cities look different), the Design Shop, and  Planet's characteristics are a big stride over Civ and Civ2.
That being  said, AC leaves something to be desired.  Despite the changes and the  multiple paths to victory, the game still gets a bit dull in the latter  third when you've pulled away from your rivals.  Resource management  becomes paramount, and communication and interaction less so. There is a  plot device in the prologue (the murder of the mission commander on the  Unity) that goes nowhere in the game.  It's also doubtful that some of the  factions would be so aggressive militarily so early in the game: you've  just landed on a new hostile planet, and you want to go to war over 50  energy credits?  The AI also periodically places your initial units in a  position where you have no chance whatsoever to survive 50 turns, let alone  win the game, so rebooting is an occasional necessity.  Unlike Civ2, the  progression of the knowledge tree is a bit haphazard (but that's to be  expected of a game predicting future technological advances).
The  factions are very balanced, as demonstrated by the other reviews saying  ""I always win with X faction . . .""  The movies for the Secret  Projects and cut-scenes are wonderful, and the music and sound effects are  first-rate (although there should be much more variety in the combat sounds  -- there are two).

"Having played more games of Civ II than I care to remember, I was really looking forward to this game. Initially I had thought it was just more of the same and I should have saved my money and kept playing Civ II. Dozens  of games later I can honestly say this game was well worth the 49$ I had  paid and at the current price of 19.99$ it's a real deal. The game isn't a  departure from Civ II in anyway and may fall short of other's expectations  when they are anticipating Civ III but with any amount of game play they  will be pleased. Is it the same game? Basically yes. Are there THAT many  improvements? No. Is it better than Civ II? Yes. Just the little things  like unit customization, new techs, new races, improved network play, etc.  make it worth it in my book. I've had the game since it was released and  still play on occasion and most likely will still play a year from now. If  you approach this game not expecting it to be a huge breakthrough in the  Civ series, then you won't be disappointed.",4.0
"I am a long time fan of Sid Meier's games since the moment I played the first Civilization in 1991.  From then on, I mostly bought all of Sid's games.  I recently got Alpha Centauri and man is it incredible.  The  gameplay is good, the graphics are great, and overall the game is  excellent.  The only thing I don't like about the game is that I finshed in  two days and now there is nothing more to discover about the game.  Other  than that, I loved this one from Sid.  If you have played any of the other  Civs or even any other game from Sid Meier, you will love this one!",4.0
"The game is Civ2 in a new world (so I guess we could also call it Civ2: After our rocket landed). The interface is pretty much the same, if we neglect optical changes. From 30 nations we got 7 factions, which are  specialized (in Civ2 there were no special abilities), so you have to know  from the beginning, to which type you are most suited. Automation is by my  opinion not very helpful, the most helpful thing is building queue, which  enables you to forget many smaller cities until they grow to size 4 or 5  (then you must check every such city or bigger ones regularly, if you want  to make enough progress). Great bonuses can be won from the seas (not  usable in Civ2) and City improvements and Wonders are little more numerous  than in Civ2. The whole scene is almost too dark and morbid (Alpha Centauri  is a sun, therefore a planet could at least have a little light!), it runs  very slowly (units travel as they would take sedatives all time) and the  diplomacy is very limited (as is perhaps in real life, but every faction  leader is tremendously aggressive). Therefore best start for you is even  more essential than in Civ2, if you fall back at the beginning, it will be  very hard for you to gain back what you missed. The terrain is extremely  unpleasant and it can also be of great importance, where you land. I had  best experience with the science faction (Zakharov), because I was able to  overcome my opponents through technology. The game is very uneven from the  beginning (if you don't get a good draw, you are soon in trouble) and it  could run much faster. That took away one star for her. Otherwise - if you  like Civ2 and if you don't mind too much about this lacks, it's no question  - buy it. If you expect another revolution form Sid, lean back, play  another Civ 2 and wait for part 3.",4.0
"Alpha Centauri, though not technically a sequel, extends and broadens the Civ series.  The graphics are good and--this being a Sid Meier game--the gameplay is almost perfect.  Centauri is a tremendously addictive game,  with action, adventure, and a sci-fi backstory that will keep you in your  chair until you lose the feeling in your legs.
But it's missing an  important element, one that made the Civilization series so successfull:  The ability to change real-world history, to wonder 'what if?'  The Alpha  Centauri world is fake, fictional in the truest sense, and all the cool  technologies and compelling writing in the world can't stop a player from  noticing.
Still, the game is well worth your money.",4.0
"This is easily my favorite computer game of all time, and I have logged the countless hours to prove it.  What I find so compelling are the defining differences between this and other resource-based war games. 1)war  is incidental, as in the real world, and not the sole raison d'etre; 2)the  philosophical orientations of the factions, which have individual strengths  and weaknesses based on their core behaviors; 3)the technological advances  and terraforming are very thoughtfully constructed, forming a cohesive  continuum that is as plausible as any advanced in science fiction  literature or theory; 4)you can allow your bases and units to be computer  ""governed"", or micromanage on an almost SimCity scale; I could go  on but you're probably getting bored... I did not give the game five stars  because 1)the gameplay gets bogged down as you proceed (although I don't  know how the designers could have done a better job); and 2)at least on my  computer, the game gets ""hiccups"" sometimes, especially in the  sound (I have an AMD version of the Pentium MMX microprocessor and 32 MB  DRAM). Overall, I love it! I can't wait to get the sequal ""Alien  Crossfire!""",4.0

The design of the tracks are very imaginative.  And the racing crafts are equally beautiful.  However my only problem with the game is the controls, while  overall they are good it gets a little hard to control the craft in the real tight courses.

"I bought this collection for one reason only and that was it contained the fabulous murder mystery Colonel's Bequest - a true lost treasure.
Laura Bow accompanies her friend Lillian to her grandfather's estate in a  Southern bayou for a weekend where all her relatives discuss her  grandfather's will. Of course the first night is riddled with murder and  your job is to find out who is killing the guests.
The game has no  ""point"" system in it which makes it hard to play and to complete  the notebook at the end. But this will keep you playing. You won't believe  one bayou has so many secrets. Play this game at night for maximum effect  like I did. I also believe the early VGA graphics add to the errie  atmosphere. A must play for a cold lonely night!",4.0
"I love the Laura Bow Dagger of Amon Ra game that came with the King's Quest Package! I only expeirenced one problem with it, it wouldn't finish, until I downloaded the bug fixer from Sierra and before you enter the last chapter Rex Takes a Bite Out of Crime, you must turn off the dialoge so you will see speech bubbles instead. I have done this many times and it has always worked for me now, you may turn the dialoge back on when you are climbing up the tunnel in the furnace room. Hope this helps all of you dying to see the ending! :)",4.0
"King's Quest was Sierra's milestone maker from the 80s up through the early 90s. King's Quest 1 was the first computer game with color graphics, King's Quest 4 was the first game with digital music, and King's Quest 5 was the first game with complete voice actors, and King's Quest 6 was the first game exclusively on compact disc.
But besides all that, the games themselves are practically masterpieces in their own right. That is, except for game 7. I'm not sure if that was made before or after Sierra was bought out by  Cendant, but it would certainly explain some things. In any case, the mediocrity of it doesn't detract from the rest. However, you should note that King's Quest 1-4 and the Laura Bow games are made for DOS and may not work properly under new versions of Windows. They do work for me under Windows 2000 with VDMSound, though.",4.0

It was great to be able to play The Dagger of Amon Ra on a new, faster computer than the one I had five years ago when I bought the game originally.  But beware - you can't finish the game.  There is an explanation with the game that they couldn't fully convert it to work on today's computers, and you completely forget about it until the killer begins to chase you at the end, and you realize that the game freezes and you can't do anything.  It is very disappointing.  I wish they would revamp it and make it work for today's computers - it's such a good game.  Otherwise the set is great - and it is hilarious to see the primitive graphics that we used to think were so cool.  :)",4.0
"I've been a huge fan of King's Quest for a long time(I think it was the  first game I played that actually had better than monochrome graphics on my  286x)
The first three games are the best (which is odd, 'cause their  graphics are the worst by today's standards), four and five are pretty  cool. Six and Seven had cartoon-like graphics, but didn't seem to have the  adventurous feel of the others. The first one is still the most fun, and  they even added both the old, classic version and a newer version with  better graphics!
If you've played either Space Quest, or Police Quest...  you'll get an instant feel for this one!",4.0
"The Kings Quest series are probably the most memorable adventure games in  existance.  They appeal to children, adults, men, and women alike.  The  games are serious, slapstick, romantic, dashing, and so many other things  all rolled into one.  I really loved this series and I'm glad that someone  decided to package them.
Each game follows a member of the Daventry  family in one manner or another.  As an added bonys, girls.. sometimes the  hero is actually a heroine!  As the series progress you can watch the  Daventry family grow, have children, and suffer tradgedy through at least  three generations.
The only thing that might be a problem is that as some  of these games are old they might not work on newer machines.  Make sure  that you have all the patches from Sierra and read the documentation  thoroughly in case the games don't function your first try.  With a little  bit of computer coaxing you should get them going again, but you also might  decide it's not worth the trouble.",4.0
"I've been a fan of Civilization for years.  In fact, I play almost no other game.  Call to Power's graphics are greatly enhanced beyond those in CivII.  The animations and sounds are really cool.  This game offers many  new units, city improvements, and wonders to build.
Call to Power adds  the ability to establish production queues in each city and to maximize the  exploitation of each city's resources at the touch of a button.
You now  have the ability to build terrain improvements using a ""Public  Works"" tax based on your total production.  You no longer have to use  settlers or engineers for this function.
You can now ""stack""  units for movement and battle.  A battle window pops up with close-up  animation of the battle scene.  This is pretty cool, with the animation and  sounds.
The interface takes a while to get used to, however.  If you're  not paying attention, you can send a unit off on a long trek across the  map.
I have a 400 MHz PC and have to turn off some of the animation  features later in the game to keep the graphics from getting too sluggish.  I can only imagine how the game would play on a slower machine.
Overall,  though, this is a really fun game.  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys  Civilization.",4.0
"This video game system is great, and even though it isn't very noticeable right now, it will be a major competitor for the Game Boy Color system, and is very compareable. The two systems are the same size, only the Neo Geo Pocket is horizontal instead of vertical. The system also has a bigger screen with sharper and more colorful graphics. The joystick is a bit hard to use, but you will get used to it. The one major gripe I have with this system is the fact that there aren't really any standout games right now. I do like the fighting games and I have Neo Turf Masters, Sonic Pocket Adventures, and Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999 which are all good games, but they aren't very noticeable. Still, I'd buy this system and make these games noticeable, because the games and system deserve it.",4.0

"It seems some people don't like Call to Power because it's not Sid Meir's Civilzation, but that's exactly the point: It's a different game. This game is kind of a hybrid between Sid Meir's Civilization and Age of Kings. I think the AI intelligence is right up there with Civilization by Sid Meir. Also, the graphics are pretty good too. (This game is ""old"", so it may not be up to some people's standards.) Also, I like the huge maps and the lots of advances, city improvements, and units. Quite frankly, I like Call to Power's space-age military units better than Civilization's. If you're looking for a Sid Meir clone, don't buy this. But if you're looking for a fun alternative, this could be for you.",4.0
"I reviewed this game at the same time Civ3 was out (which I have not played.)  I find CivCTP to be just as addicting as any of the earlier versions.  I have to agree with other reviewers that some of the gameplay is slow, but this was not a serious complaint from me.  I appreciated how many object attributes can be seen through a 'right click'.  City Management seems easier if you know how to set up the screen views.
At the time of review, the product was deeply discounted, making this a very good value.  If you get the value (jewel) version, the manual will be very minimal (with no or minimal strategies explained.)  However, the game was pretty much easy to learn without a manual, esp. if you are already familiar with Civ, and strategies can also be gained through simple trial and error, so I did not find any need to seek the full manual or a strategy guide.",4.0
"Let me start out by saying I waited some time until purchasing this software because of the bad reviews.  I'm a huge fan of the first two games but decided to hold off on this one until the price dropped.  (Something about not having Sid Meier's name in the title.)
I have to tell you though I was impressed by what I saw.  Perhaps it was because I was expecting a terrible sequel but Call to Power (Civ 3) is a better surprise compared to Civilization 2.  There are more changes and the game is more complex.  As a matter of fact, I find this game more challenging than the previous two.
Now don't let this review get you enthusiastic about the game because on the same token, you might be disappointed with the sequel.  There are gameplay problems such as a new macro economy that doesn't seem to have been well planned out by the designers, no scenarios or predesigned maps (specifically, the world map), a combat system that leaves you in disbelief when your M-16 soldiers are wiped out by cowboys, etc...  I was also disappointed by the new wonders (I'm not sure how the copyright worked out with the new company, but I felt the old wonders were more logical.  An example is the sphinx instead of the pyramids.) that seemed to disappear quick (as far as their effects) because technology is obtained so easilly.
If an overhaul of the game was in store, I feel that the designers could have put more technologies into the game as well as a better variety of attack/defense units considering it covers so much time.  (2000BC - 3000AD?)
But the price is right for this game at this time.  Now that the Call to Power sequel is out, I would recommend this game to see if you enjoy the new format.",4.0
"Civilization: Call to Power makes some needed changes to the ""Civ"" line.  The previous games were very well done, and nicely balanced.  But they were more like games.  The addition of the ""dirty  tricks"" units is a reflection of the history of empire building and  technological advancement.
Take for instance the slaver unit.  The  slaver unit can travel to other cities and steal the population from them,  giving their civilzation more manpower.  If the victim civilisation is not  careful, they will be crippled from the outset.  Just like the Portrugese  (and others) in Africa.  Historicaly whole african empires were decimated.  However, those that use slaves in the game must be careful.  If someone  creates the abolitionist, it is pretty much all over for the slave using  nation economicly.  Just like Portugal.  So CTP reflects the fact that some  civilizations in the real world did not get far due to another's dirty  tricks.
As militray units go, combined mixed forces have always fared  better then more technologicly advanced units.  And just because a unit is  more advanced than another does not mean that it will always win.  Look at  the Native Americans.  Look at the Scottish fighting under William Wallace.  Look at the Philipenos durring the 16th century.  CTP mirrors this fact  quite well.  Greater numbers employing several modes of attack will always  destroy lesser numbers employing one method of attack.  And then there is  also random chance.  I thought that the terrain defence modifiers were very  accurate.  A city built on a mountain, with walls and three phalanxes is  almost impossible for anyone to take!
As for the graphics, I think CTP  is a great improvement.  The interface is much easier to use on the  management level.  However the tactical level can be a little squirly if  you get to tired.  The designers have made it so that nothing happens if  you right click.  This will get you out of the messed up path that may have  been created.  Still if you do not know this secret, the game can get  annoying at times.  This will cost a half star.
The improvement system is  better now than with the old settler based system.  Improvements are a  result of empire and wealth.  Irrigation and mines  as we know them today  were not arround until someone had money and power.  Before that ore was  either picked up off the ground in chuncks (as it was in the bronze age),  or quarried for.  Besides, no one ever separated a large segment of a  city's population to build irrigation and roads.  Those people and their  production were always considered part of the city.
One thing I did not  like was the fact that you cannot move populations arround like you did in  CivII.  No longer can a settler join a city. (at least I think, i was kind  of tired when I tried this)  This ignores the entire idea of human  migrations.  So minus half a star for this.
Another improvment is the  tech tree.  No longer do muskets come before cannon.  (It was always the  other way arround)  In civII there were a lot of problems with the tech  tree.  For one communism came with the industrialisation and philosophy.  Communism is not a result of industrialisation but rather trade and wealth.  Also democracy was arround long before what CivII calls invention.  And  why did medicine give you the ability to build shakespeare's theater?  Would that not be more associated with Writing and Philosphy?  What they  have done is made the tech tree more accurate in a historical perspective.
Also they have made the game more easily customisable.  Changes are  easier to make in the tech tree by just editing a file.  The player can now  change what units are allowed and also in what era you begin.
All in all  I think that CTP is an accurate representaion of the factors that dictate  historical development.  If you are looking for a game that is all about  conquering and starting even with everyone else, look elsewhere.  Civilzation: Call to Power is historical simulation.  And in history not  everyone wins easily and with the same formula.  In CTP you may take the  world by storm, or you may never get started and be crushed by civilzations  with more advancements.",4.0
"I loved Civ I & II, but like this better, since it has a little more uncertainty.  With CIV II you can beat the computer absolutely every time almost without trying & that got boring!",4.0
"If you were debating on whether to get Call to Power or Alpha Centuri, I would recommend Call to Power.  After playing each game I found that in order to build basic structurs in Alpha Centuri, you had to learn a whole new language, like food modual, energy pod, and a new crazy unit of  measurement!  The ships' and units' names have no meaning, it is hard to  see both names and tell what is a better ship!  Call to Power was much  easier to play if you have already played CivII.
If I hadn't been robbed,  I'd probably be playing Call to Power right now.",4.0
"AFD has great graphics and a good selection of aircraft; once you get it to load.  For some reason my 4 month old Dreamcast has trouble recognizing AFD as a game. It sometimes locks-up loading levels, also (I found a little jiggle to the DC unit while loading actually helps - a practice I don't really like doing).  Personally I'd like the replay to allow me to choose the perspective(s), but that's minor.  Overall, it's a great game (although after beating it it seems a little repetitious; I'm still trying to see if it'll unlock more aircraft on more difficult levels)!",4.0
"This is Konami's attempt at ripping off Namco's Ace Combat series.  Plain and simple.  Whoever was expecting Microsoft Flight Simulator really needs to buy a clue.  The Dreamcast is a game CONSOLE, people... not a PC.  There is simply no way to replicate the dozens of keyboard commands required to produce a realistic flight simulation.
What does the Dreamcast do best?  Correct: arcade games.  This is an arcade attempt at a flying game.  No take-offs, no landings, no aileron tweaks, no altimeter factoring, it is a plain, easy to understand, straightforward shoot-em-up in the sky.  Are the controls sluggish?  Yes.  Do the different planes really matter?  Not really.  Will you get any mileage out of the machine guns?  Probably not.  But this is all par for the course for the kind of game this is.
Sky Odyssey for PS2 is a much more fun and active flying game than this, but this is by no means chopped liver.  The graphics are often impressive, and the game does put up a fight in the later stages.  But as long as you aren't dumb enough to expect a NASA flight replicator, you might very well enjoy this little romp through the un-friendly skies.  Who knew terrorists would have the $$$ to own more jet fighters than most industrialized nations?

"HASBRO the licencee for the MW3 series just came out DEC 3rd with their second installment of MW3, PIRATE'S MOON. This was supposed to be a series of three games but decided to close two plants and all the staff including  support for the MW3 series. HASBRO fired 2200 people 4 days after releasing  PIRATE'S MOON and will not be able to produce the third game, nor offer any  support. ZIPPER actually made the game for HASBRO and has stated they will  no longer work with them on the project. The game is however a good piece  of work and uses AI better than any other of the MECH WARRIOR series. It  also has some great multi player functions, new weapons and new MECHS to  the MW3 series. The LAG in this version seems to be greater than the last,  you really need a good fast computer and alot of mem to go up against the  players that already have it. A cable or dsl will be helpful too, if you  play against others, and you don't have the goods, your toast ! If you like  UA games then get a couple of THUNDERBOLTS and have at it, then the lag  won't make much difference. DF_XIBIOUS_VR",4.0
"The game is a valuable addition to the original MechWarrior3 release.  The colors are great; the tribal theme music sets the perfect mood, and the additional features and fixes are welcomed.  In addition, the large maps  are filled with details and good hiding spots.  The non-elemental enemies  will now actually use their Jump Jets.  A couple of nifty multi-player  scenarios have been added (like protecting and destroying team bases),  giving online folks more options to consider that the usual ""Who can  circle around the enemy and avoid being hit the longest"" shtick.  Players will find that they will really want to take the new Mech's  available in this game back to Tranquil, but will be frustrated that they  cannot do so.  On the downside, the Mech's torso-twist has a softer, less  tactile feel.  The UAC20's weapon range has been reduced to 260 meters,  which is a bummer for those who play online.  It seems that the armor and  heat management rules have been slightly tweaked.  Watch out when you lose  a right or left torso; when this happens now, the weapons are gone in those  areas as well; an oversight in the original game that has been addressed  here.  The new weapons are valuable, but only effective in those scenarios  where employing them makes sense.  There is no introductory cinema, and  instead of receiving your mission objectives from the MFB's, you are  instead forced to accept the role of an existing pilot whose voice is  apparently your own.  I found this to be unnatural, but of course it does  not hinder game play.  Salvage allocation management is still tedious, and  I always feel like I'm at work doing an actual job at this point.  The  story line is interesting and has a political twist.  But overall, this is  the game to own if first person shooter games and immersion in the  futuristic BattleTech universe is your niche.  One last thought: some of  the campaign missions are much more challenging than those in the original  game, and will require some real skill to complete.  Those who'll want to  get to the end of it quickly will likely need to do so on the easy setting.  One can always increase the difficulty level later once the scenarios are  better understood.",4.0
"I think Bushmaster the other reviewer is crazy.  Mechwarrior is a great game.  It has good graphics, superb level design, and lots of weapons, levels, and enemies.  And Mechwarrior 3:Expansion definetely lives up to  Mechwarrior 3's great gaming prowess.",4.0
"Um Jammer Lammy is in many ways a much better game than Parappa the Rapper 2, though it precedes it by several years.  The story is funny and believable without being overly childish or simplistic.  The gameplay is definitely a step up in difficulty than Parappa, but the music produced by Lammy's guitar makes the increased difficulty worth it.  The dynamic graphics that change as Lammy's (your) playing ability gets better or worse was really well done, especially on the airplane stage and final concert stage.
This game would have gotten 5 stars without any trouble, in my opinion, but there are at least two things that make me hesitate giving it such a high rating.
The first is the hospital stage.  I don't see anything wrong with the song itself, but the nurse constantly throwing up was just dumb.  There wasn't any reason for it, and it made that level almost unbearable.  The song was good, though.
The second problem is much more serious.  On a PS2, Um Jammer Lammy can't save game status.  It doesn't detect the memory card, so the game must be restarted from the beginning every time the machine is turned off.  Obviously, the game was designed for the PS1 and that could be the reason the game doesn't know how to save, but Sony could have figured a way to let Lammy access the PS2 memory card.  Without a memory save ability, the only way to play the game is to play straight through.  This is not an easy nor short task with the game being as difficult as it is.
If you have the time, you can probably make it through this game in a few hours.  The game is great and much better than Parappa, which plays like molasses now.
I definitely recommend this game with 5 stars to PS1 owners, but have reservations recommending it to PS2 owners because of the memory card problem.",4.0
"This game, while difficult, is really fun and quite a challenge for people. The sound is good, the graphics are good, the lyrics seem.... slightly half-assed, but still good.

  I bought this brand new, and it did come with everything, including the wrapping that new games came in. It did have a small scratch on the front of the casing, but I assume that was from it shipping here. Either way, if I had to, I would by from who I did again, and I recommend you to get this game as well. 5/5 delivery.

  As for the game-play, it is fun, although it's really challenging. Some parts of it, it feels like the song is going to fast, or there's too many notes on one line, and it takes a really long time to get past a stage. Going back to Parappa the Rapper, it seems much easier after playing this, seeing how it basically made you think faster and react faster. Either way, it's fun and challenging, at some parts too challenging. 4/5.

  Now, the graphics this time around are much better than that of Parappa the Rapper's graphics. The 3D cutscenes are much better looking, although it still holds that strange way the characters move from Parappa. The cutscenes are pre-rendered, in FMV, which was popular with PS1 developers at the time. The graphics for the stages do still look like they do in Parappa's, except there's more elaborate stages that the characters are on, more elaborate movements from the characters, and a generally more elaborate game. To conclude, the graphics are much nicer than that of Parappa the Rapper's graphics. 4/5

  Multiplayer games in this are a lot like the game's singleplayer campaign. Basically, two players (Lammy, the main protagonist, and Rammy, Lammy's basic opposite.) go through a stage, competing for the most points. The stage doesn't change. except for the ending, in which the winner, or wiener, as in the game, is declared. The multiplayer is fun, but there's not much different in the stage besides the fact that there are two characters on the stage at a time. 3/5

  All in all, this game is really good, despite being very hard in many stages. It makes you think faster, even if you don't notice it. It tests your reaction skills, and strains them until they are pushed to their max. Really good game, and I recommend that anyone interested should buy it, seeing how it's really cheep for a brand new copy. This game gets a 4/5. Thank you for reading.

"Good game, incredibly short as was parappa 1 and 2. But for the price and the nostalgia feel, very worth it. Only complaint is that this is the edited american version so they change all the lines involving hell or the devil. But it was fun for an hour or 2. My sister loved it.",4.0

"I have never been a great fan of first person shooters, because I always found them shallow and scrappy. I was lent this game by a relative and after ten minutes of play I was hooked. The actual quality of gameplay was  excellent and the graphics were to die for! The three- way character plot  was well thought out, and the various weapons and different views made the  game not only visually mind-blowing, but also spine-chillingly scary.  Something always happens to make you jump! But I have one criticism of the  game, because it lacked enough in-game movies to keep you aware of what was  going on. I think that it could have been better, but altogether not a bad  piece of action gaming! Well done Fox Interactive!",4.0
"Alien VS Predator is the best ""Alien"" game released to date (I was actually fond of Alien Trilogy) and has a lot going for it. You can play as a marine, alien or predator. Playing as the Alien is the easiest  and is pretty difficult to master as first. You will need to climb on  walls, learn to pounce, and sneak up on your targets. As the Predator, you  will need to use your fast arsenal of weapons, visions and invisibility  features to win. The scariest and most fun character is the marine. You  will need to collect weapons, health and watch your back at all times. You  never know when an Alien is around the corner. And if you see or hear a  face hugger, you better start shooting or run for your life. If one gets  you, you WILL jump from your seat! The only drawbacks is that the save game  feature is lame (if you download the patch, otherwise, there isn't a save  game feature,) and the game will give you extra levels at the end, ONLY if  you beat the game at a higher difficulty. Other than that, if you like the  Alien movies, get this! I give this title a B+.",4.0
"I love this game! Very catchy themes, fun gameplay that is easy to pick up and play, and an awesome two-player mode. However, even with all the extra options, it is still apparent this game is too short.

Although it far outlasts it's predacessor Parappa in replay value, it is still short. However, the difficulty may make it last longer for less expirenced players. But at the price Amazon is offering it for, it's well worth it!

Overall...I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes a fun pick-up-and-play game, doesn't mind a little frustration, and prefers quality over quantity.",4.0
"All the fun of Parappa the Rappa with some weird, fun guitar licks. It's definitely not an easy game, making you mash buttons rhythmically while attempting to add your own stylings to get better ratings.  But if you like the idea of Guitar Hero with a good variety of rock genres, very trippy storyline, and way more room for freestyle shredding (even if it is with a standard controller), this is the right game to get.  Not a lot of levels, but you can go head to head in co-op mode with a buddy or cpu.  The songs are catchy, and it's well worth the price for several hours of entertainment.",4.0

"Vigilante 8 is a lot like Twisted Metal, but lacks, of course, the updated graphics in the more recent TM games.  However, the 4 player head to head game is the one we always play when we have guests over.  The learning curve isn't too steep, the physics are reliable,  and overall it makes it competitive and fun for everyone.  Also, the cooperative play is a joy.  If I bought this game as an indvidual I would give it a so-so rating.  But, for me, it's always been hard to find a solidly performing, fun multi-player game that your friends can get into.  And, for me, I haven't found a better one than Vigilante 8.",4.0
"This game is fun if you like destruction. The graphics are prety good and the gameplay and frame rate is smooth. There is also a wide range of weapons, Each character has his or hers own unique  special weapon, Kinda like Twisted metal 123and4 but better graphics and gameplay.

"The variety of monsters and weapons is very cool and the story is fun. THe controls for combat are good, but your character does seem to plod around. It's a very good game.",4.0
"If you were expecting a horror game when you saw this you were mistaken. This game has a horror theme but nothing about it is scary. Most of this game is just traveling around the island, fighting monsters, and trying to solve puzzles. There are quite a few cool weapons and some of the boss battles are just plain awesome. The game also has some bloody moments but overall nothing really bad. The graphics are pretty good but the joints of the people don't quite fit together right. When the people speak their words don't match up with their mouths moving. Some of the weapons are pretty much useless and some of the camera angles are bad.
With all that being said it is still a good game and very enjoyable. It isn't too horribly long, if you are a good gamer you should be able to beat it in 10 hours or less, but it is quite a ride.",4.0
"Overview: It's a good thing Blue Stinger is a launch title, because had it been released later, closer to Capcom's Resident Evil: Code Veronica, it would have been drowned in the torrent of comparison. Developed by Climax Graphics (of Shining Force, Landstalker and Dark Savior fame), and published stateside by Activision, Blue Stinger, with its cliched portrayals and B-movie voice acting, is an adequate, if underwhelming entry into the ever-expanding genre of survival horror.
Graphics: 8.5  Clean. Very clean. That's the most appropriate way to describe the visuals in Blue Stinger. The high-resolution texture maps and relatively high-polygon models are what you'd expect from a next-generation console, and the developers made sure to add liberal amounts of lighting, particle and translucency effects. Boss encounters are another notable, as they really show off the abilities of Sega's machine. The only area in which Blue Stinger does not stack up is a big one: animation. No motion-capture here. The characters animate quite stiffly, creating a rather slow and goofy-looking gait, and while this is not totally damning, it takes a while to get used to.

Sound: 7.5  Well, this is a CD-based machine, so the music is high quality. Some of it seems a bit out of place for a survival horror game, but it's not bad. This actually works in some places, such as the town/market area, where the Christmas atmosphere and music creates an atmosphere eerily reminiscent of the original Gremlins film. Voice acting is another thing entirely. While I don't think it is quite as bad as most of the professional magazines have made it out to be, it's definitely of the B-movie variety, perhaps a bit better than the original Resident Evil's. Maybe.
Control: 5.5  This is Blue Stinger's weakest point. Analog control is too loose for precision movement, while digital simply isn't responsive enough. The result is a game that's difficult to play at times when precision movement is critical (such as swimming). Luckily, this isn't a platformer, so these are few and far between. What really makes the control so lacking is the camera, which while far improved over the ""cinematic"" one found in the Japanese version (thanks to some noticeable tweaking by Activision), still manages to get itself in, shall we say, less than advantageous positions (usually they're experienced while in water or in tight corridors). While these are minimal, there are more than enough of them to annoy all but the most hardcore gamers.
Gameplay/Theme: 8.0  Yes, Blue Stinger has it's problems, but it is fun. As with any game of this nature, part of the fun comes with blasting enemies with high-powered weapons. In this area, BS delivers. Ranging from the usual shotguns and rocket launchers, to more exotic weapons such as ray swords (a lightsaber rip-off) and railguns. Each character has their own unique arsenal of weapons, which are either found or bought from numerous vending machines located throughout Dinosaur Island. Needless exploration and a few vague puzzles can dampen the fun for you (remember the passcode 1224, you'll need it), if you stick with it, the experience can be rewarding.
Overall: 7.5  Like many launch titles, Blue Stinger is a flawed first effort, perhaps moreso than many of the others. That said, it does have its good points, which are far more numerous than the gaming press is willing to let on, and while not for every gamer, if you like blasting baddies, adventuring and a decent story, and are willing to work past the flaws, Blue Stinger might just be worth a few of your hard-earned dollars.",4.0

Blue Stinger I think is a must own for anyone with a Dreamcast this game is an action game and a survival horror game the first time you complete this game is the best you can complete it many times but you already know whats going to happen Some bad things about this game are their is some annoying music you have to put up with and you end up killing the same mosters over and over again Their is so much more to say about this game but I'll let you figure them out buy this game,4.0
"Blue Stinger is at first kinda stupid and boring becuase you don't have any weapons except your bare hands.  But once you get farther into the game and have a weapon (a gun) it is pretty fun.  For example some of the weapons you can have are: naplam guns, bow guns, bazookas, etc.,  So if at first you are getting bored and feel that this game is stupid, just keep on playing and it will get better and better!",4.0

"As the title says, if you have the patience, you will get plenty of mileage out of this game.  You get to take over nearly every aspect of flying the famed B-17 Flying Fortress in strategic bombing missions over Europe.  You can let your 'Fort pretty much run itself, or you can manually take control of any of its 10 crewmbers, from the Bombardier, to the Pilot, to the Tail Gunner.  Whenever you're not in manual control, the plane ""flies itself"" although your input can greatly affect the outcome of the mission.  As the campaign progresses, your crew gains experience and they are more able to do their respective jobs.  The famous Norden bombsight is included in the game, designed with the help of an actual World War II bombardier who used the Norden to bomb Japan.  It's as close to the real thing as you can get with a computer, and you'll feel like a champ once you figure out how to use it properly and are able to drop your 6,000 lb bomb load exactly where you want it to be from 25,000 feet up in the air.  It's quite a feeling to watch your bombs drop one by one out of the bomb bay and hit the target.  First you see the massive train of explosions wreaking havoc to your chosen target, followed 10 seconds later by the deafening roar.  The flak is done to perfection as well.  It's a bit terrifying to fly through heavy flak and watch your plane getting shot to shreds and not be able to do anything about it.  It's like flying through a bunch of grenades, and when you're inside the plane you can hear the shrapnel plinking off of the airframe.  You can name your crewmembers after anyone you like, you can even design your own nose art with the help of a mod.  If you're really ambitious, you can be a Squadron Commander and be in total command of 12 bombers, and are able to name all 12 of them along with their 120 crewmembers.  You can request reconnaisance film and intelligence information on any of the hundreds of in-game targets, and then choose which ones to target on the next mission.  I've learned more about the geography of Europe from playing this game than from all the history classes I've had in my life.  I could go on and on about the great times I've had on this game, but I wouldn't be fair to anyone who reads this if I don't mention the #1 pitfall of this game: the crashes.  Depending on your operating system and hardware, you could have a hard time running this game without it crashing.  I fought it for a month before I realized that the game didn't like my integrated sound card, and once I replaced it with a PCI card, everything was fine.  Some people run the game without any difficulties whatsoever.  For the $20 or so that it costs these days, if you're interested at all in flight sims or the B-17, and are willing to learn the massive amount of controls, then by all means buy this game.  It's one of those games that you can play incessantly for a few months, put it down for a year or so, and then fall in love with all over again for a few more months.  I don't see this game coming off of my shelf for a long long time.",4.0
"This is still a great game in it's own right.  It has been superseded by it's sequel and I would recommend newcomers go for that game because of its extra features.

"My husband brought this game home because he was trying to find a Playstation game I would like. (I don't like the shoot-em-up games that he does.) It was cute! The movies are a little cheesy, but they did make us laugh. We played over and over again, just trying to land on new spaces so we could see the movies. The games gives you two ways to play -- the traditional way, where you collect Life tiles throughout the game; and an enhanced way, where you play little mini-games for money when you land on certain tiles. Both ways are fun, although the traditional way makes the end a little more interesting -- you're not sure who is going to win. A good family game, easy for even the technically-illiterate to understand.",4.0

"I had another B-17 game some years ago. This one is significantly different. This is a real challenge! First, the instrumentation and interior graphics are very good.
They could be improved by allowing the flyer to operate the flight deck controls with the mouse, but that is nitpicking. The exterior graphics are not state-of-the-art,
but they are plenty good enough to really experience the game. The sound is good and realistic.

I had better identify my equipment so that you can judge my viewpoint. I have a 1.8 MHz Pentium 4 with a half-gig of RAM and my OS is Microsoft Windows ME.
Video is ATI. I use a CH Flightstick Pro USB and CH Pro Pedals USB with Control Manager. (The brakes do not work with this simulation.

Everything else works fine and the loading was easy.

As to my experience, I'm in my mid-seventies and made my first solo in the mid '40s. I've flown a variety of single engine aircraft over the years, but have little
multi-engine experience, and that only as air crew, except on the computer. I've also built and flown a variety of radio-controlled aircraft. I have flown just about
every decent simulator on the market since 1989, but my specialty is WWII aircraft since that is my generation. I'm partial to the Pacific Theater, and particularly
love the F6F ""Hellcat"" as a fighter plane--it accounted for nearly 80 percent of all the Japanese aircraft shot down in air-to-air combat in the Pacific, and had a 19-1
kill ratio. Not bad. It also made more aces than any other allied single-engine fighter plane.

I mostly fly fighters. I think the best combat flight sim (for graphics and flight characteristics) currently on the market is IL-2 Sturmovik. Jane's WWII Fighters and
and Microsoft's Combat Flight Sim 2 are neck-and-neck for second place, and I'm looking at MS Combat Flight Sim 3 with high
hopes.

This is a good sim. It is very realistic in the flight characteristics of a large multi-engine prop driven aircraft. The sounds are very realistic as well, and for those who
think it is a difficult game--it is! But then, so is actually flying such an aircraft, but it can be learned. Practice, practice, practice!

The ability to move from one crew position to the next easily is not realistic, but it is great fun! One thing I appreciate is the very thing that bugs many; the fact that
you can spend hours on a single mission--in fact, you can spend several minutes stacked up, orbiting your own airfield just waiting to land after a mission. Oh, you
can avoid it by speeding things up to 8X time, but of course the actual aircrews were simply stuck with it. That's just the way it was!

In real life, it was hours, weeks, sometimes months of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror. ""Hurry up and wait"" was as typical of WWII as ""Kilroy
was here.""

But, do you want to get a feel for how it really was (without the gut-wrenching fear, of course) or do you just want to play another game? One thing about the
boredom of hours of droning engines--it lulled the crew, so that when the action suddenly started when a Bf-109 or FW-190 or (God help us!) an ME-162
suddenly bounced you out of the sun, it was all the more unexpected.

This is of course not like being at war. Not even close. The people who really flew in these ships actually died, as you know. More than 50,000 men from the 8th
died over Europe. That's the entire crew of 5,000 different aircraft. Losses were high. It was hard to get through the 25 missions required, alive. For the Luftwaffe, it
was, if anything, worse! There was no limit to the number of their missions. They flew until they were killed or the war ended, whichever came first.

I recommend this game if you have the patience and the equipment tofly it properly. If you are simply looking for something that will allow you to shoot down lots of
""enemy"" quickly, this is probably not for you.

Wish that the 100th Bomb Group had been included in this game. I was in the 100th Bomb Wing, 8th Air Force in 1957 and had read the history of the Wing during WWI in England.

"When Quake 2 originally hit the PC, it's unabashed violence and surprisingly addictive gameplay not only outshined it's predecessor, it killed it before it hit the ground.  The PS1 and N64 conversions took much longer than expected to be released, and fans of the PC game anxiously awaiting the home versions were a little worried about the quality of the home system versions.  When Quake 2 hit the PS1, those fears were dead in the dirt.  Activision, Hammerhead, and Id all did a fantastic job bringing Quake 2 to the PS1 while keeping a surprisingly smooth frame rate (although the graphics aren't as good as its PC counterpart, but that was expected) and the unabashed violent addictive gameplay remains intact.  The game makes excellent use of the PS1's Dual Shock controller; the controls are easy and every button is to be used.  While some parts can be frustrating and the game has a rather steep learning curve, Quake 2 is still undeniably fun.  Those still holding on to they're PS1's can find this bad boy at a rather cheap price and have a great time with this near classic FPS.",4.0

Maybe I'm just spoiled a little by playing it later than when it had came out and games have gotten longer over time.  BUt that's why I can't give it a 5.,4.0
"I went through my old Video games, weeding out those destined for trade in at Bookman's.  I saw this one and remembered liking it, so I threw it back in and played it through.  I forgot how much fun this game was and highly recommend a re-try to those FPS freak out there.  I mean, you can get this game dirt cheap now, and it is a total blast!!!

My only beef is, you have to play it through in order to use the cheat available and many of us play a game once and that's it.

Other than that, not a single complaint.  This game freaking rocks!  Tons of different monsters/foes, tons of cool weapons, level upon level of varying backgrounds.  Too me back to the old days of all the Doom games.

So, if you're feeling nostalgic and want to play an FSP that doesn't require you to evolve three extra fingers on each hand, dig this one back up or buy it dirt cheap here on Amazon.  You won't regret it.",4.0
"Yes, Quake II, the game PC owners have been enjoying for a long time, has finally made it to the PlayStation. Being a fan of PC first-person shooters, I was less than excited. I mean, I've already played the single-player to death on the PC, and multiplayer FPS games on a console are usually quite pathetic. The N64 version was pretty good, provided that you could look past the flaws that most fans of the PC version would notice in the first 20 seconds. The PlayStation version has many of these same flaws, but given the PlayStation's rapidly aging hardware, it's easier to overlook these flaws. While you may not remain interested in the single-player mission to see it to its completion, the four-player multiplayer in Quake II will make you glad you had picked up a multitap and three extra Dual Shocks. The storyline is your typical hostile alien sort of thing. You, as a space marine, land on the planet of Stroggos with the intention of blowing up everything in sight. Unfortunately, you get separated from the rest of the marines and are forced to go it alone. So now you must run all over this planet, collecting keys, opening doors, taking elevators, and wiping out various alien monsters before they tear you in half. To wipe out these aliens, you'll have to find weapons - your wimpy default blaster simply won't cut it. You'll find a couple shotguns, two types of machine guns, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and two types of energy weapons - one of which is the almighty BFG, a gun that spits out a huge power ball and wipes out just about anything that gets near the blast. You'll also find a great deal of ammo, armor, and health scattered about the levels. A game like this really requires a good control scheme to succeed. Thanks to excellent use of the Dual Shock controller, it has one. In the default setup, you use the left stick to look around and the four buttons on the front of the pad to move in any of four directions. You can also configure the right analog stick so you can use it in much the same way. The R buttons handle firing and jumping, and the L buttons let you cycle through your weaponry. You can play the game on a standard controller, but trust me - you wouldn't want to. The game also supports the PlayStation mouse, but if you're already used to using a mouse to control your first-person shooters, then you probably have a PC and you've been playing the PC version of Quake II for ages, making this game mostly useless. Graphically, the PlayStation really does a decent job. The textures may look a little washed-out, a few models may have been simplified, and a few frames of animation may have been chopped here and there, but overall, the game runs at a very playable speed. The tradeoff is that the game has much more frequent loads. Most of the level modification between the PC and PlayStation versions is in the addition of many more small, closed-off hallways that serve as little loading areas. At first it's not a big deal, but when you've got to go back and forth between different parts of a level to accomplish various tasks, loading every 20-30 seconds is enough to make you crazy. The game's sound effects and music are taken directly from the PC version, and overall, the sound is great.
The multiplayer mode is where this title picks up most of its value points. Sure, a few of the multiplayer levels are a little on the weak side, but there are enough good ones that it doesn't really matter. The three modes in the game are standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, and versus. Versus mode is a last-man-standing affair, where you and up to three friends duke it out until only one of you remains. The coolest multiplayer option is the gravity slider, which lets you turn gravity way down for some really high-flying action, or turn it way up to keep people from hopping around like lunatics. Sure, it's not as versatile as being able to program your own modifications to the game, but it's a nice touch, and it manages to breathe a bit of life into the game. In the end, the PlayStation version of Quake II falls under the same disclaimers as most other PC-to-console first-person shooters - if you own the PC version, don't waste your time. But if you're looking for some good split-screen shooting action with a decent single-player mode to back it up, this version will make your day.",4.0
"Got the colection, when I ordered the expantion, but it installed still, and plays great.",4.0
"This is an expansion pack to Baldur's Gate, it is an add-in, and it does not expand the original plot. There are three new areas that your party can explore. The experience point cap is also up to 161.000 in this game, making it possible to gain 1 or 2 more levels, depending on your class.
The three add-in areas are: Ulgoth's Beard, a small town north of Baldur's Gate where more or less all the expansion adventures take their start from, an...island(trying not to reveal too much), and Durlag's Tower. Of these Durlag's Tower is the most challenging and interesting. Durlag's tower is the biggest dungeon in the entire game, and can be a challenge for even experienced parties. The other areas, offer some interesting information, but are less exiting to play through. All in all it is an interesting expansion, although not an expansion in the true sense of the word. But since you can sometimes find both Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast in one package at a good price there is no excuse not to get it.",4.0
"I'm surprised at the number of reviewers who found this game disappointing.  I found it to be a challenging expansion pack that significantly raises the difficulty level over that of the original.  No, Tales of the Sword Coast doesn't extend the story line of BG, and, no, the story line doesn't even FIT comfortably within the original BG plot.  And yes, Tales IS basically  an add-on that simply allows your characters to increase their experience points and find new items in the process.
Still, I think it is a fault to criticize the game too much (as many customer reviewers have) on issues of story line.  If you want a great, involved story, well, buy Planescape: Torment (my vote for greatest RPG title ever).  Even though Tales of the Sword Coast's game objectives may seem completely out of whack with the BG main plot, think back to BG and I think you'll recall LOTS of areas that didn't have anything to do with the iron shortage or Saverok  For instance, did the Firewine Dungeon ""really"" play a crucial role in terms of story line?  Did helping Drizzt fight off those hordes of baddies really advance the plot?  How about all the random quests?
In other words, I think one should evaluate TOSC using one simple maxim as a guide: namely, are the new areas fun to play?  In my opinion, the new areas in TOSC are both challenging and enjoyable.  One of the levels (***BEWARE, SPOILERS HERE***), the ice island is a throwaway, but the other two, Werewolf Island and Durlag's Tower, are impressive.  Werewolf Island does have a captivating plot, and although it's size in terms of area isn't large, the battles are numerous and semi-difficult.  Durlag's Tower provides players with something that BG kind of lacked:  a decent dungeon crawl.  I found Durlag's Tower very involving and moderately difficult.  Unlike the ridiculous monster count and borderline unplayability (in terms of difficulty) of Icewind Dale's dungeons, Durlag's Tower strikes a nice balance between being difficult but not too difficult; it knows how to challenge players without forcing them to die, reload, die, reolad, die reload, ad infinitum.
Lastly, I found this game a decent value in terms of length.  TOSC is now a bargain bin purchase, and although some customers here like to brag (lie???) about how the game only took them 10 hours to complete, Tales took me betwen 1 and 2 weeks to finish.  I admit that I may not be a master AD&D player, yet I did successfully complete BG and felt that my party was very much up to the challenge of the expansion pack.
This game does get docked a notch, however, for some small problems: 1) Pathfinding is still troublesome.  2) Inventory juggling is still a nightmare.  I truly believe that about 50% of Baldur's Gate (and this expansion) is spent juggling inventory items.  3) The puzzle element introduced in Durlag's Tower is more annoying than fun.  4) The next-to-final battle against a monster summoned with Durlag's Blade is insanely difficult and convoluted.  But basically, if you enjoyed the original you should probably enjoy this expansion.",4.0
"In this expansion pack you basically get three main subquests, two of  which are long and difficult.  You get to raise your characters to level 9,  and 10 for your thief(You will need a thief to disarm traps and pick locks  so make sure you keep a thief for this expansion set).  My main dislike of  this game is how poorly it ties in with the orginal Balder's gate.  The  story lines do not connect at all.  If you imported your character from the  main balder's gate the expansion pack drops you off in a new town just  before the epic battle with Saverok.  But in the subquests you do come  across many different villains, puzzles, and creatures to kill.  Plus you  will be able to equip your party members with fancy armor and powerful  weapons.  If your number one reason in liking the orginal Balder's gate  was to follow the storyline than I do not recommend Tales of the Sword  Coast. However, if you loved killing exotic monsters and boosting the  strength of your character's than this is the perfect set for you.  Your  characters will become much stronger and gain more spells, and weapons.  Interplay did a great job in creating a chance for players to boost up  their characters, however the storyline is weak and doesn't connect too  well (or not at all) with the orginal Game.",4.0
"I rented this game for a few days and I enjoyed it.  I own Vigilante 8, and I love it so I thought this game would be cool too.  And it was, except it was so much like the first one that it was much too simple and the only thing different was the car and arena selections.  When I returned the game I sat down and played the first Vigilante 8 and enjoyed it much more than the second.  I guess it's just me because I'm used to the first one so much.  I recommend this game for anyone to rent because it is an excellent car-combat game, just like it's prequel.  Try them both, you'll have a great time.",4.0
"Well, I am in Guatemala C.A. and I know the Vigilante8:2nd Offense is not available here and I want to buy it. So how can I get that game? thanks.",4.0
What can I say about this great game? Well I can say a lot about it but I'm going to keep it short. Well lets take a look at the game concept. Well the Fallout 2 takes place after the hero of the first Fallout has saved  everyone from the muntanes(can't spell it). Well anyways it's been awhile  and you start off as a descanted from the hero of the first one. Well you  have get a this kit to save your tribe. Of course the plot thickens and you  have all those fun side quest. Well what makes this game better then the  first one is that the map is much bigger and more places and quests you can  go to. Plus you get a car. You have different type of weapons and the same  old ones. There are NPCs you can work with so that another plus. There are  many more postive things about the game. But I have how some complaints the  engine of the game wasn't very good it was the same engine as the first  one. I mean come on I want to see bullets hitting the wall and stuff like  that. They could of made it when you used the aim shot and you aim for the  leg you see the guy grap his leg. They could have done so much more. Well  that's my mind on the game.,4.0
I was thourly pleased with the game but the instalation was hard I had to download it on a different computer the transfer it to this one. but over all it was a good game and worth what I went through,4.0
"I downloaded Fallout 2 for my laptop which uses Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit).  The download was quick over DSL, and the game took about 600MB of space.  Despite reading reports to the contrary, I did not experience the rainbow colors glitch when launching the game from the Fallout 2 folder.  The game and movies played flawlessly.  However, I did experience some color distortion when launching the game from a desktop shortcut or from a shortcut in the games folder.

The game is a classic.  It does feel somewhat dated, but I still enjoy the humor and nostalgia of playing the game one more time.",4.0
"I would have given this game 5 stars were it not so blatantly hateful of Republicans. The last portion of the game gave the character no option but to spew venom, hate, and lies about Republicans. I only finished the game anyway because I had already bought it and thrown away the receipt. Otherwise, I would have returned it.

In the future, with regards to the rumoured upcoming Fallout 3, I will keep the receipt and do internet research about that game before deciding to keep it for good.

While fatally flawed by its undisguised bias, the game, in its time, was excellent. The mixture of realistic weapon, sex, graphic violence, post apocalyptic storyline, and rpg elements make this an almost great game.

The graphics were quite dated and the sound effects often cut out, but this was not the game's fault. I bought this game long after its time. Unsurprisingly, the intervening years since the game's first release saw graphics and sound standards rise dramatically. My soundcard also was not supported for by the game. Again, not surprising and not at all the game's fault.",4.0
"Oh, how I love this game, one of the most underrated RTS games I've played. Underrated because the original version of the game had major problems, and because the second game in the series seals the series' doom (it isn't very good).

I haven't played the original MechCommander (non-Gold) game. Apparently, complaints were aimed mostly at the interface and the fact that it was too hard, and there were no artillery strikes. As artillery strikes are my favorite single aspect of the game, I would recommend that you avoid the original and only get MechCommander Gold, but be warned: This is a hard game! Winnable, but hard. One reason is that there is no in-game saveability. Like the original Rainbow Six game, you play through from one scenario to the next with no way to save mid-game. However, there are some strategic tools you can use that most games don't afford. One is pausing the game. You can view different parts of the map, issue commands to 'Mechs and even send artillery strikes, all while the game is paused. You'll need to use this. Another strategic ace is the refit truck. If you have a refit truck available and it's a hard level, you'll do fine. The ability to restore damaged 'Mechs in-game with a refit truck is as close to cheating as you can get.

Some of the highpoints of the game:

Strategy. There is actual thought and timing required to win, whether it's scouting with a light, jump-able 'Mech with long range radar or just rolling through en masse, or burning your way through a forest to avoid bad guys. This is pure combat, no resource gathering and such like most RTS games where the economics are far more important in determining the winner than military might. Don't get me wrong, I love the economic side of RTS games, but MechCommander is a nice departure from that. Also, the look of the game is terrific. It's nice to look at. This game is two-dimensional with an isometric view. The second MechCommander is three-dimensional and looks like crud. Rise of Nations, while it has some three-dimensional elements, is two-dimesional and isometric. Please let that be the trend. Even Warcraft III, while three-dimensional, keeps a steady, non-rotating view of the landscape. This is the correct way to do it. The sound is pretty good, although you do get tired of hearing the same messages of acknowledgement and the fact that the MechWarriors have something on their radar. You kind of get used to it and ignore it. At least the voices are all different so you can usually distinguish who's talking.

It's a blast to customize the mechs with whatever weapons you find, and even better to salvage enemy mechs, which always have a slight advantage in firepower and speed. There's nothing quite like mousing over a storage bin and seeing the context-sensitive cursor change into a pair of pliers (or whatever they are, indicating that there's something to get in there).

Oh, and jump-jets are just plain cool! Man, I love this game! Plus, the cinematics at the beginning feature the same guy who starred in a fairly recent snowmobile commercial featuring the automatic jerky-extruder. The acting on both occasions is hilarious. A little bonus tidbit of trivia there.",4.0
"Fallout II, while falling short of the original Fallout, or the squad based Fallout Tactics, is still a fantastic game, definitely worth a look. It plays similar to the first installment, but boasts better graphics and richer character dialogues (The two things going for it.) I recommend purchasing the dual package, which contains both Fallout I & Fallout II. It is worht the price for the first alone, and the second is a nice bonus. Four stars, highly recommended.",4.0
"This game is the sequel to the first fallout released in 97'.  This game connects the 2 storys together great.  The post-apocalyptic storyline after wwIII is great along with the character creation and all the NPCs in the  game make it a sure hit. I also love the invintory in the game with the  nice picture as well as the description. I also love the fact that some of  the weapons in the game are real. Such as the FN-FAL, Desert eagle,  Thompson M1 tommy gun, FMJ ammo and much more. The level up system is also  great. This is  an excellent sequel to the first and a great game for RPG  fans. Even if your not into RPG games you be sure to like this one.  And  for the price now its very much worth it.",4.0
"Yes, Fallout 2 is one of the best RPG games out there, especially considering the fact that there are no futuristic RPG's in the current market.  However, this game requires way to much search and talk.

I had a flamethrower within one hour of playing that made me nearly  invincible.  I mean, come on.  Unless you are going to play this game  without accepting help from NPC's, this really proves no challenge and  damages the fun factor.  At least the price is right.",4.0

"I fell in love with this game because of its simple interface.  Memorize a few button presses and you can be putting songs together in no time.  Pick from hundreds of melodies, bass lines, drum parts,  sound effects, and percussion samples and paste them together to make a song.  It's that easy.  You can even create your own riff if you've got the patience for it.  Then you can even create your own music video to along with your song.
  This game did not recieve as much attention as it should have, but I strongly reccomend it.  The only two flaws are the slowdown that occurs from time to time, especially during the video editing, and the songs take up an enormous amount of space on your memory cards.",4.0

I am going to explain what i did with this ""game"", and how far you can actually go with it.
At first i thought this game was a corny way to make dance music, electronic, etc.. But when a good friend of mine showed me what you could do to manipulate the tones provided. i.e., changing the sample rate and tweaking with the reverb and delay parameters to produce wholey unique sounds. I was hooked because i found a way to express myself in a unique way. The cool thing about all of the tweaking of sounds available is that you can meld it into the construction of the ""songs"", you produce in real time. When i discovered these things it was like going down the rabbit hole, in many cases i was tripping on substantial ammounts of psilocybin mushrooms during these sound experiments, but lots of times i wasn't and it was still super engrossing. I haven't played with this ""game in over a decade almost, so i may sound kind  of dumb trying explain what i was doing all that time ago..

A good friend of mine had recently purchased it on PC, and after playing it at his house I quicklsy saw what the folks at EGM were so excited about.
  This game is just brilliant.  It's a turn-based strategy game in which two, three or four teams of worms wage a war on eachother on an unlimited supply of randomly generated terrain, and annihilate eachother using a wide array of clever and unique weapons.  The gameplay doesn't get much funnier than in this game.

"This is a terrific game for children who love the Toy Story films.  All the regular characters make appearances and it's just too fun controlling Buzz Lightyear!  I only wish the graphics, sound and control were a bit more polished.  The dificulty comes mainly from a constantly moving camera (but you can fix it when needed) and a bit too loose control.  For the younger gamers though these drawbacks won't matter much as it's fun just wondering around the levels and finding your friends.  You get to explore Andy's house, Al's Toy Barn and an airport among others.  Older and more experienced gamers will probably want to pass on this due to the laskluster graphics and unsophicated gameplay.

"I stopped by my local Goodwill store today in hopes of finding some PlayStation games. And I did find quite a few, but Q*bert was my best find.
As I walked up to my place at the register, the cashier eyed my games I found. ""I remember this game! I loved it"". This was interedting, being that she was a woman. They typically don't play games. ""If you didn't notice, theres a huge stack of Super Nintendo games over there"". She seemed neat. ""Oh yeah,"" I replie. ""I love those"". ""Me too, I grew up on the Atari"".
Walking out, she left me the sense this was a good game. I had seen it on top ten lists before.

She was right.
I put in my PlayStation 2 and was loving it! First off, you can pick two styles, classic graphics versus new 3D graphics. Personally, the new ones are not that great and I prefer what I remember. Next, we have multiplayer and story modes. Yes, there is a story mode now actually named Challenge mode. For those of you who just like to pick up and play, there is also classic mode.

The one thing that made this a four star review are the controls, which you will have to tweak. You can use analog or the Directional Pad. The Analog sometimes does not register, and the DPad gets uncomfortable afger a few minutes. There are changes to be made in the settings however, and they fixed it just fine.

This game was great, and I love games that push consoles to its limits video wise at least. The catchphrase on the front of the boxart states, 'He's Back!'

Go out and add this to your PlayStation collection now!",4.0
"This is a great game to play with a friend or two or more. It's still fun to play it by yourself but it's definately better as a multiplayer game. This game is pretty addicting, so if you have alot of time to kill this is the perfect game for you. Hopefully there will be an upgraded version for this on the Playstation 3 but I highly recommend this game.",4.0
"Remember Monopoly? Remember setting up the Chance and Community Chest cards in the middle of the board? Remember handling all those tiny houses and hotels? Remember rolling the dice and knocking all the little houses and hotels and cards all over the table and floor? My family loves Monopoly -- until it comes time to set everything up. So this game was great for us. The game recognizes that everyone has their own Monopoly rules and allows you to customize the game to fit your traditions. (My family, for example, plays that you get double your money when you land on Go and that you collect all the fines from the game when you land on Free Parking.) I disagree with the statement in the ""professional"" review above about not being able to see what property your opponents' own -- there is a grid on each players' icon that lights up with the properties you own and if you want to see more details, you can just go into the trading area of the screen. Anyway, we find ourselves playing Monopoly WAY more than we did when we had to drag out the board, set it all up, etc. It IS Monopoly -- we find it takes about 2 hours to play a long game. The only complaint we have: it seems to get a little buggy when you play with the Thimble token. Maybe it's just our game, but whenever we play with that token, it makes errors like not paying people when they pass Go, paying too much rent and sometimes it says someone has won the game when they actually went Bankrupt. Overall, a good game, though if you're a Monopoly fan.",4.0
Already has all the elements that will make bg series such an absolute game. To play preferably using bg 2 engine or wait for the bg enhanced edition. Pure role playing. Try it if you esp if you like the genre.,4.0
"The game I got from Amazon seems to be the Euro version, which contains one DVD and NO manual. The printing on the DVD is black and white, so ugly... It claims to work in windows vista, but it doesn't work well in my windows 7...I ended up installing it in windows XP... but for the game itself, it's really a great game.",4.0
"Very fun game. It is not as nearly as fun as Balders Gate 2, but it does great on getting you ready for part 2. Lets you in on the storyline and teaches you how to play. Baulders Gate 2 is the best game I have ever played hands down.",4.0
"A lot of fun for RPG players. The graphics are  a little dated, but that doesn't really detract from the total story of the game. In fact, story is the key point of the game and it has a lot of it, enough to keep any player busy for hours. Overall its a lot of fun, especially on older computers which can run more modern games, but with games like Baldur's Gate who needs modern games anyway...",4.0
"Well...I must say that this game is just that: it's not the best game ever, but it is really fun and you'll play it a lot supposing you like D&D/AD&D or RPG's.  That being said, allow me to get to the nitpicky stuff.
One major gripe with this game that I have is teh experience system.  It divides up the experience rather then give each party member an exact copy of the amount recieved.  Another problem is the amount of ""Cosmetic"" strikes and how you miss a lot.  I guess that is for ""realism"" but it just annoys me. Also, sometimes the game is REALLY non-linear so you have to get a guide or talk to EVERYONE in a place to see where you need to go.
Other than that, this game is really good and will keep you playing it forever.  The story is really good and the rest of the game is good, I will not spill details, although most of you have already gotten the game and beaten it.  Well i must go, hope you enjoyed the review...",4.0
"This game is loooong. I really enjoy long games but this a bit much for me. Of course if I could play more than two or three hours a week.... Things I didn't like: not escaping though cutscenes, not automatically reloading the last quicksave and less 'reputation' comments from your NPCs-  Highly recommended and a 'must have' for any RPG fan.",4.0
"I bought Baldur's Gate after 2 friends kept telling me how great it was. I'm not a big RPG player, however I did find this to be a truly great game.

Positive features of the game: Visually, the game is quite well done, especially the scenary and spell effects.  The atmosphere can get quite spooky in underground caverns and during thunderstorms.  There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to character creation, and one is even allowed to double-class and choose their character's appearance.  The NPCs can be quite engaging, and party members (you can have up to 6) actually interact with each other verbally in often humorous dialogue.  The storyline is interesting and generally linear, though there are many sub-quests that one can choose to pursue.

  Regarding the down side of the game: By the time the game got to chapter 6 (there are 7), I was ready for it to end.  And the ending itself is a bit anticlimactic.  My party got up to only 7th level, and thus had rather limited abilities.  Comparing this game to Morrowind (which I am now playing), BG could have been a bit more open-ended and expansive in size, which would have enhanced its replayability.  After 12 intense days of playing to the end, I promptly auctioned it on Ebay.

  For those interested in a well-told, gorgeously rendered D&D-style adventure, with a well-defined main plot and credible monsters and NPCs, BG is a good buy.

Rating: 4.5 stars",4.0
"Baldur's Gate was the game that mannaged to blow new life into computer roleplaying games. For those of you not familiar with roleplaying games or the AD&D rules, here is a short introduction. You start out with creating your character, selecting a race(dwarf, human, halfling, gnome, elf and half-elf)and a profession(Fighter, mage, cleric(priest), ranger etc, etc). Then you roll up your ability scores each representing one physical or mental ability (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma). After creating your character you start the game in Candlekeep, a keep located on the swordcoast famous for its library. You are an orphan raised by your ward Gorion. The start of the game is easy and not very challenging, but it does give you time to get into the game mechanics and there are several tutors in Candlekeep that can give you advice on the game. I will avoid going into any further detail about the game plot as it will ruin the joy of the game.
The game itself features a linear story line, but with a lot of subquests, some minor and some larger. There are plenty of areas for your party to explore, but beware, some of the areas might prove more than you can handle in the lower levels! As the plot thickens and you find out more about your background and the powers working against you it becomes more interesting, and you find yourself working towards the grand finale.
The graphics are fine, considering the game isn't new anymore. This is truly an entertaining game with only a few flaws(flaws that I only noticed after playing Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn). The character interaction in the group is almost non-existant, and it would have been nice with a little more in-groub dialogue. There are plenty of characters that you can have join your group...almost too many. Sometimes you are really have doubts about who you want since you are limited to a total of 6 members(including yourself). Even with the limited NPC(NonPlayerCharacter) interaction most NPC's are still very different and have good developed personalities.
The main plot is really good, intrigue based, although it seems that at some point you find yourself a bit ""lost"" in all the subquests and explorable areas there are, that you almost lose sight of the ""real"" goal of the game.
That said, it is still a great game. Most importantly it mannages to get the AD&D ""feeling"" to the computer, almost like the real thing. The AI does not always work as it should though, and you might find your characters blocking your path, so you are suddenly ""stuck"" in a small area and need to reload. This can be annoying, but knowing the danger of this happening can help you avoid it.
A note, this game is very different from games like Diablo and Diablo II, none of which were true roleplaying games. If you are looking for a way to hack and slash your way to glory this is not the game for you. There is a need to interact with other people during the game, and the way you behave and answer them will affect their reaction towards you, unlike Diablo where everything is a monologue. If you ever played and enjoyed tabletop AD&D, this will almost certainly entertain you. If you never tried AD&D this might just get you introduced.
I propably would have given this game 5 stars, but since I played Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, I have chosen to limit myself to 4 stars, as there are a lot of things that are enhanced in SoA.",4.0
"This game is wonderful. Customizing my character was very entertaining (and one of things I enjoy the most about RPGs, and the small side quests are numerous and interesting. There any many areas that serve no particular purpose other than to gain some XP doing quests. This, I think, is a weakness of the succeeding games in the BG series: there are not enough exploration options available. The possibilites of your party are nearly endless, since there are many NPCs, all of whom have their own strengths. However, there is little NPC interaction, which is disappointing. There are some annoying aspects of gameplay (which is what caused me to downgrade this game slightly), such as the fact that the characters are excruciatingly slow, and have a poor pathfinder feature, which leaves them w/ a tendency to go places other than where you planned. You will be challenged from the first shocking event to the final show-down...and you will enjoy it the entire way.",4.0
"HI, i just had to write a comment. Although the game is getting old, it is the (in my opinion) best story-based singleplayer (multiplay is allowed, but i think the game is more suited for singleplay) ever next to Planescape:Torment. The story is exiting and very nicely made. When you start as a level one character, you fell like experiencing the game fully. There are lots of classes, races and aligments for one to pick, so the roleplaying is superiously splendid. As already expressed, the game is HUGE too, with five CDs.
Baldurs Gate 2 and its expansion is out now. They are very nice, but BG 1 gives an unique experience, and for 20 dollars, it is a very cheap experience too. If you don't like it, remember that it is not a new game. Instead, it is historical.

"Baldurs Gate, is probably one of the better role playing games on the market today. It has some good characters, along with a riviting story line that will keep you hooked as you play it. The music is great, and the graphics are very good for a computer game. There is a wide list of characters and NPC's that will help your character on their quest. And the best part of this game, is that the controls are actually easy to use, so you aren't stressing yourself out to looking for the right buttons to use in your battles. I rate this game at 4 stars because it could be a little longer, and a little better, but for 19.99 it is definately a game worth buying.",4.0

"This game is worth it! Graphics are great story is great, but it needs more characters! And definitely more classes (Ex: Fighter or a Mage) But otherwise this game is great for all RPG (Fantasy) Fans. The only thing to that sets this back from a perfect score...is it's installation. It is way to much for my computer, and it went way to slow that I had a hard time getting through battles with out dying! I don't recommend this game if you have little RAM and Computer Space. Otherwise, this game is for all!",4.0

"this game, just annoys me to the point i don't want to play it. the term Metroidvania doesn't do it justice if anything it insults the Metroid name because everything in Metroid is about exploration and everything is deliberate. SotN just teases you in the first part of the game and annoys you all together. so, at the start you play as Richter Belmont, picking up from Rondo of Blood, or Dracula X in the west. you reach Dracula and enters chessy voice acting. so your like oh ok, i can dig this, but you're already fighting dracula so what else is there to fight? fast forward a couple of years and now enters Alucard, running through the forest and jumps the gate. awesome scene, now your in control and this guy has a powerful weapon and armor. so everything just dies in one hit! yeah! just as powerful as Richter. then its taken away from you. that. is. so. not. cool. why the big tease?? where in development they thought was a good idea to show players Alucard's powerful equipment then have it taken away??  then the sense of direction. oh my god, after that big tease you follow the path and then after a while you explore but you can't because you need a relic to open blue door, but you need to find the relic, but you don't know where to find it! you find those relics laying around only that they supposed to be in the game already! not a fudging relic to show enemies names or the damage! its cryptic and its not known where to go. then the spells, its never told that you can cast spells to gain small health and summon a spirit. however! moving away from the negatives i will say that the soundtrack is amazing, and the graphics have aged well. its an ok title, much like Simon's Quest this game isn't for everyone and i'm almost done playing the game and i feel i've wasted so much time getting lost i just want to fight Dracula and get it over with! that's the point isn't? to get lost, waste time, get powerful, and then comes the endgame boss, your pretty powerful already, so you'll be disappointed on how the boss fight came out.

overall, its an ok title, but to me its just more annoying than fun, i'm already level 21 and majority of the boss fights are becoming easy, but i'm nearly done with the game, so i have to beat it now. its a game that just wastes you time, all games are, but this one and simon's quest just literally wastes your time like no other. the portable games of Castlevania follow this formula now, which is disappointing. just try this game out for 5 minutes then you'll see what i'm taking about. its also an XBLA title so you can find it pretty easy or pay for a PS1 title.",4.0
"The Good: Fast fun gameplay, nice graphical style, some of the best video game music ever created, long, good story

The Bad: Extreme difficulty can really turn some people away, the age here shows quite a bit

I never played this game before until now. I was too young at the time to really understand the game. Now that I've played it I understand why it got it's praise and I don't understand at the same time. What really makes me not like this game as much as other people is the extreme difficulty. Either that or I just suck at the game. I'm not really good at 2D platformers to begin with but this game does deliver on all accounts.

It has a great story, great graphics, fast fun gameplay, you can equip stuff on every body part you have (ahem), you can buy things! While I'm not a huge Castlevania fan to begin with (first CV ever was Lament of Innocence (PS2). I'm not saying this game is terrible but for me the difficulty was way too hard for me. I just couldn't get past the third stage.",4.0
"This Game is without a doubt the best RPG of its time. Unfortunately, that time has already passed.  Every good bit of praise you've heard about this game is probably true. It's great fun, and the story and game are flexible enough to play through it more than once, if you choose to do so. If you are used to the 3rd edition D&D rules, you may get a bit frustrated, but it's a more-or-less faithful rendition of the 2nd edition game. The graphics are everything they're cracked up to be, and the sounds are pretty nifty, too. Most of the game's shortcomings can be made up for by free unofficial 3rd party downloads. Not only are cheats, item editors, spell editors, etc. available, you'll also be able to find custom items, voice sets, and portraits for your characters with a minimum of fuss.  If you are used to Baldur's Gate 2, and try to play this one you'll probably get annoyed. You'll quickly notice the changes they made and understand why they made them. Still, it's probably worth the [money], unless you're short on cash. If you are short on cash, save for Baldur's Gate 2, it's by far the superior game.",4.0
"I'll state from the outset that my background in RPGs is limited.  Sure, I had friends who would gather together on Friday or Saturday nights to play pen and paper D&D, but I was never among them.  Occasionally, however, I did enjoy playing computer-based Role-playing games (the three Bard's Tale adventures).
I say all this in an effort to convince non-AD&D people or non-RPG players out there to give Baldur's Gate a chance.  Yes, AD&D rules are numerous and complicated (I have no idea, for instance, what 6D+4 means), but don't worry too much because the computer takes care of all this for you.  Essentially, you'll encounter enemies, you'll push your spacebar (to pause the action) and point and click, directing your party members how and whom to attack.  The computer calculates all the die-rolling stuff.  You just sit back and watch the blood fly.  This is not to say, however, that BG is a brainless game.  In fact, you'll learn quickly that ""Fools Rush In"" if you don't think about battle strategy.  Put simply, Baldur's Gate achieves a perfect balance: it both satisfies hardcore D&D folk who have long clamored for an accurate PC RPG experience while also not scaring away newbies.
This is not to say that BG doesn't take some learning.  The manual is thick and at times confusing (particularly in how to memorize spells).  There are lots of options in BG, so you'll have to become familiar with the game interface and inventory system.  Be prepared to spend several hours just getting comfortable with how the game operates.  Also be prepared to die a lot in the beginning.
Once you've mastered the controls, this game gets addictive, and fast!  BG is now an older title, and with BGII having been out now for over half a year, the original is currently a bargain bin purchase.  I bought my copy through an online auction for eight bucks.  Those eight dollars provided me with six weeks of constant gameplaying.  Most action games can be completed in less than a week, but BG was vast and involving.  The world is huge and sprawling, side quests are seemingly infinite, and replay value is a bonus.
So why four stars?  Well, like many people, I have my subjective, nit-picky problems.  First, the pathfinding is pretty weak.  It's mostly okay when you're out in the open, but in dungeons, the pathfinding is flat-out horrible.  I barely escaped the Firewine dungeon alive because whenever I'd get into a battle and order my commands, my party members would then stupidly go off in six separate and unexpected directions.  Second, although the world is huge, it does get tedious trudging across the BG map.  At times, the game can feel like a chore to explore that unnamed wilderness section that's located leagues away from where you truly need to go only because, well, you feel there might be something interesting there.  Third, going up levels takes a long time.  Don't get me wrong, I realize that going up levels shouldn't be too easy to accomplish, but it's kind of disheartening to only be a level seven fighter at the end of the game (because there's an experience point cap of 89,000) with thirty-odd hit points.  Either raise the cap or make level limits a bit lower.  Lastly, although hardcore gamers may love the myriad spells, weapons, and potions, I felt there were too many.  Your party members don't have many slots for carrying items, and all those items you find during your travels (potions in particular) become annoying (should I use such-and-such potion immediately? should I save it for a big battle? should I sell it and make money? should I simply leave it behind).
Still, despite the quirks, I've never been so deeply involved in a PC game, and I'm looking forward to my next purchases: Icewind Dale and BGII.",4.0
"After this game I played Diablo. Diablo is not a bad game,but Baldur's Gate makes it look like Pong. This is the best AD&D game iv've ever played (and I play a lot).
Baldur's Gate is about a kid (played by you) who grows up in Candle keep,under the kind tutelage of his foster father,Gorion. After a couple of years growing up,Gorion wants to move away. You don't know why. In about 20 minutes into the game (that's how long it took me)Gorion gets killed in a horrid battle by mercenaries. You must avenge him. But,after traveling and making friends (and making enemies),you find out your dark secret.
Very addictive game. Yet the computer was going through hell. That's the only problem.

"The game turned me on to the Castlevania series.  You think you're done when you beat the game, but you are NOT.  It will take a hundred hours to unlock the game to its core: finding all of the hidden items, extra characters, secret passages, and familiar helpers.  My only complaint is that once your character collected a certain couple of hidden items, the boss of the game (the real one) seemed too easy.
However, don't let this deter you from one of the most visually stunning 2D platformers ever. Music is elegant and haunting, and a myriad of monsters and bosses roam the absolutely gigantic castle.  An excellant buy!",4.0
"""Symphony of the Night"" is considered the pinnacle of the Castlevania series, and with good reason.  At a time when side-scrollers were falling to full 3-D games, Konami proved that there was still room for a good 2-D game in the gaming industry.
""Symphony"" boasts impressive environments, huge bosses, multiple endings, creepy music, and more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at.  My only problem is that it's just too much for me to remember--when I'm being mauled by Beezlebub is not the time to look up the ""Dark Metamorphosis"" spell.  If you take the time to learn all your spells, as well as the ins-and-outs of all the Familiars, though, you won't have that big a problem.
I have just a few picks about the game:
1.) As stated before, the inventory/spell system is HUGE and can be intimidating.
2.) Voice acting.  Aughh.  Wish there was an option to turn the original Japanese voice acting on, like you can in ""Lament of Innocence.""
3.) Bosses.  Bosses are typically easy, provided you have enough health-restore items.  However, I frequntly found myself being turned into a bloody pulp (literally) by the sheer numbers and strength of ordinary enemies--isn't it suppossed to be the BOSSES who kill you over and over again?
Don't get me wrong, ""Symphony"" is one of the best Castlevania titles to date--but if you're looking for a more user-friendly Castlevania game, I suggest ""Aria of Sorrow"" for the Game Boy Advance.",4.0
"Where should I start , the superb music , the sharp 2d graphics the creative weapons and enemies hell they are all top notch. The game is great there is an rpg element that allows you to gain levels: attack, defence ect... The most superb music, all very erie with it's orcastra. The amount of weapons you will get is an incredible amount of swords, plus youll get shields, and capes . The bosses are incredibly huge some take up the whole screen .

"Hey, I remember the old gold-laden boxes for the first AD&D games by  SSI back when the C64 was still a great computer, and I'm here to tell you,  this is a vast improvment! Overall the game is well drawn with decent sound  and standard voice acting.  Many elements of the pencil and paper game a  found here, with some annoying omissions that will be fixed in the next  installment.  These were the low experience cap and inability to distribute  weapon slots towards two-weapon style, to name a couple.  At any rate, the  game is LOADED with sub-quests and days of good solid gameplay.  Black Isle  is on a roll.",4.0
"Baldur's Gate is the first great AD&D game for the computer to come along since the Gold Box games from SSI. (I didn't really enjoy the Eye of  the Beholder series.) This translation to the world of computer gaming is  the most faithful yet, disallowing such Gold Box quirks as spellcasting  while armored. Fortunately, Bioware did make some changes in the interest  of gameplay balance. For example, Cure Light Wounds always heals 8 hp, not  just d8 -- a boon since you begin at level 1 and have many battles to get  through.
The emphasis is definitely on adventuring and combat; the story  is acceptable at best. (The ending is particularly non-spectacular.) With  respect to combat, some abilities do seem overpowered. In particular,  Baldur's Gate imposes none of the penalties on archery that a good DM  would: you can continue to rain arrows upon an enemy engaged in melee with  you, and you can fire into melees without ever hitting anyone besides your  intended target. A friend of mine used the Sanctuary spell to disgusting  effect: while the enemies stand around pointedly ""ignoring"" the  enchanted priest, the other party members rain death upon them. Also  somewhat jarring are the NPCs who initiate conversations with you even  while invisible or hidden (to prevent the player from ""breaking""  the plot).
But playing Baldur's Gate can be an immensely fun experience.  Frankly, this is what AD&D is meant to be, translated on to your  computer screen. You explore, meet deadly monsters and quirky NPCs, gain in  power and magic, find neat magical weaponry and people to join your  party.
Some advice: - Don't get hung up on ""maxing"" out your  characters. Unless you enjoy being a munchkin, just have fun and do what  your character would do. I found myself trying too hard to win battles  without using any of my wand charges or potions, adding to my frustration  and leaving me with unused wands and potions at the end of the game. - You  don't need to keep all the letters and notes you find. The important ones  end with, ""(This looks important. You should hang on to it.)""  This is important because a single letter or gem takes the same amount of  space as a suit of plate mail or an Ankheg carcass. - Summoned monsters are  very useful, and don't feel as cheap as exploiting Sanctuary or archery. -  If you're having trouble with the Warrior Skeletons (heh), the newest patch  purports to weaken them a bit.",4.0
"There's no other way to put it, there has been no other game I've ever played in my life where I've wanted to play the game from the beginning over and over as I did with Castlevania:SOTN. Sure, I beat it countless times, but from beginning to end is just so much fun it's unbelieveable. The game is SUPER DEEP, you'll never use EVERY special trick no matter how long and how many times you play this game. The graphics are spectacular for 2D, the music is the best of any game I've ever played (why no soundtrack available??)
So why not 5 stars? It hurts me to not give it 5 stars but I have to be honest, the games kinda easy, sure it's super long, but back in the day of the old castlevania games, they were just so challenging in terms of obstacles and amount of enemies. But with this game, with all the save spots, free extra health and lack of extremely hard obstacles it's kinda hard to die. Although, if it had been that hard then I probably wouldnt be playing it over and over again. Let's say 4.5 stars.
One more thing, if you go through the entire castle and beat Belmont, don't think you're done yet, you've still got a whole other castle to conquer.",4.0
"I loved the story and the looks of this game.  The only flaw I've found is that it is a VERY hard game when you start out.  Once you get up a level or two, though it evens out and becomes a very engaging game.",4.0
"It's  nice, but you have to earn ALOT of experience to go up just one level and the monster don't give you much.  You don't get alot of money.  You get alot of party memebers really fast, they're helpful but die really  fast.  It's okay.",4.0
"One of the things that always made D&D annoying for me to play was that the GM could rarely be completely cold and fair in regards to die rolls.  sometimes the GM would pick a favorite class or a favorite PC and  they'd always come out better than others.  Well, in Baldur's Gate the GM  is the computer so everything is fair and impartial.
On the singleplayer  aspect the game is fun.  You can be whatever type of person you want to be  and do whatever you want.  You can be a noble paladin ot a scoundrel  thief... it's up to you.  As you progress through the game you gain  experience and abilities and learn more and more about why people are  hunting you.
On multiplayer it can be fun if you have the right group.  The story is the same as it is in singleplayer except one member of your  party is the main character while the rest of the group are backups.  If  you have a group with enough imagination you can have a game that lives up  to any tabletop D&D game.
In actual gameplay, a lot of what you do is  travel from place to place and quest.  Sometimes you encounter people who  want to talk to you and sometimes you run into a pack of monsters to kill.  The interface reminds me a bit of Diablo, but the games are not clones of  each other, I assure you.
Although the game is slightly buggy that  cleared right up with a patch.  I also like the ability to customize your  character portraits and sounds, it makes the roleplaying aspect all the  more real.",4.0
"I loved the game. I started playing it on a slower processor and found it very plodding. Once i loaded it on to a faster machine, the game got moving. Its challenging enough, but not untill you've got experience  playing the game. You can save it pretty easily so if you make a mistake  (which the game will punish you for) if you were smart, you won't have to  redo much if any. If you also have Sword Coast, it will take care of some  of the quirks of Baldurs Gate. Also, to make it easy for you, try for a  full install. This way you don't have to be switching cd's. You just put in  #1 and go from their. If you are any kind of Forgetten Realms fan or just  an RPG fan, this is a must. It is trully the fix that you need.",4.0
"If you like the original Tetris, but you also want something new and interesting, you'll probably like this game a lot. You get to choose between Classic Tetris and The Next Tetris, and the soundtrack and graphics are pretty nice. The game play in both modes, as well as the Next Tetris choices, are quite fast-paced. Probably the only thing I can even remotely find fault with is the block wobble option (I found it a bit distracting), but since you can shut it off under the 'Options' screen it's no big deal.",4.0
"Kingpin: Life of crime.  I had heard alot about this new game by Xatrix where you played as a thick necked overweight thug trying to make it to the top in a gritty dark world where gangs rule the streets. I had also heard  alot about the language and how obusive it was.  Well I got the game, and  thirty minutes later I was the one cussing like crazy because the game was  still installing ist sinful 570 MB.  When this little ordeal was over and  the game started, I had to sit and wait five more minutes for the game to  load the first episode, which seemed surprisingly small for such a long  loading time.  When it finally loaded, I was forced to watch a lame intro  movie with which the F word was gratuitously overused. The Enviroments are  highly detailed however and the gamelay is exceptionally good.  The AI is  superb.  Enemies run and duck and jump - even through windows to the  streets and alleys below if it means staying alive! You can meet other  local drunks and thugs, hire em for money and they'll follow you anywhere,  wasting those that get in your way.  You can command them to wait in a  place and regain health when they're severely injured. You can talk to  people however you want from ""smack to cool."" However as you get  farther and farther into the game it seems more and more rushed, and the  boss at the end of the game, the Kingpin and his woman is a very unreal  fight.  You can deal absolutly no damage to his b*tch and he himself is not  hard to kill. But overall the games only real weakness is loading, loading  and loading.  Other then that, its great.  Definately a buy if you got at  least a pentium 233.  Though the game did slow down even on a p-3 with 450  mghz, when there was alot of stuff going on on the screen.",4.0
"Graphically beautiful Kingpin is set in a parallel world where prohibition never ended and the `gangstas' took control the country. In this hideous industrialised world people will happily kill you merely for looking at  their girl.  Kingpin's character animation is state of the art, with each  character displaying a complete set of `streetwise' body language and an  attitude to match. One glaring omission is the lack of character lip  synching done so well in Half Life. The backgrounds well drawn and are  suitably dark and brooding, this is not a happy place.
You won't last  long unless you're well tooled up. The weapons are meaty and well balanced,  especially impressive are the flame effects when using the flame  thrower.
On the down side women are mostly portrayed in a sordid way they  are almost always hookers or b*tches. Another bad point is that in this  game every second word is a swear word. I fact if you removed the word  `mother' from the game most people would have minimal amounts to say.
The game is unbelievably violent and makes other first person shooters  seem like an episode of the Muppet Show by comparison. You have the ability  to blow off heads, arms, legs and reduce opponents to a pile of gibbed  puree. You'll need a strong stomach to play this game, definitely not for  the under 13s.
On the whole a good game for adults, let down by the later  levels which start to be come less interesting and a bit repetitive. Not  really in the same league as Half life but then again what is?",4.0
"1. Profanity: If you don't like profane language, don't buy this game. Also don't go into any inner city ghetto, don't join the US Navy or more important the marine corps where they actually insert profanity inside other words. guarran-...-tee it.
2. Bleeding: Enemies don't bleed per se but when they run away having been shot they leave blood trails to follow.
3. Gangs: In the single player you can only hire 2 guys at a time and in one episode once one of two guys in a bar is hired the other won't work for ya. [even if ya got room]
In the multiplayer there is free for all [everyone for they selves] and bagman [2 gangs] and ya don't really hire them they just join ya. safe's can sdtore your loot until another gang rips you off.
4. Maps: Multiplayer version has many arenas available, and even stategies like 'the sniper' up in a high place while your opponents blindly walk below you. [note you have to download lots of maps or design your own (game includes a map design tool)
5. Rats: if you're beaten pretty bad and hiding 1 point of health can hurt more than just healthy exploring a warehouse.
6. Trains: you heard about the train? well there's an episode wher you have to dodge trains - worse than the guys shooting at you. almost as bad as avoiding molten steel pits, and be sure not to drown in the water...but sometime you need to dive in to get stuff.
7. Gullible: You can hire a guy to come with you, lead them away to nowhere and the off them [boy, are they shocked!]. And if you search their corpse, you can get the money you paid to hire them back! [great for gratuitous violence]
8. Postal: you can keep on shooting people [blow their legs off] of course if you shott their corpse all away, anything they might have been carrying is gone - so be careful before going postal.
9. Ladies: The single player version is a man's world and all the women tend to be a ...well, ""..."". The multiplayer version allows the player to be runt or thug [male] or ... [female] many skins for all are available. i like the cheerleader and homer simpson goon. hey if profanity, nudity, and violence aren't your cup of tea, then don't buy it, don't play it, and don't even think about making a popular movie these days.
my favoite maps [not supplied, but available]:
chinatownbrawl
goldeneye
old desert dog
[forget name off hand but it was a prison]
pirate ship
cemetary and church
many others are available
the only disappointment was when looking over files in the demo, lamont's woman has two phrases she never uses in demo or retail.. ""Could you gimme [money] for my hormone shot?"" and ""Why thank you very much. You so sweet"" both in a 'different voice'
I truly wanted to get her to say that. she only talks about lamont and lenny until ya attack lamont, then she just curses you and tries to kill you.  also note her to search the dog's carcass.
i suppose a mapping function would have been nice, but in this environment, real men don't use a map. they don't ask for directions either.",4.0
"Kingpin: Life of Crime is a dark fps with a great gameplay set in the real bad world. You play a unnamed guy just called Thug. The game opens with thug badly beaten up and left in an ally by Nick's men, Nick works for the kingpin, Thug vows to get revenge, but he does not have anything besides a small pipe, so he has to kill people for money, he kills people takes their money and weapons, buys more weapons, hires goons, rides on a stolen bike, jumps into a moving train, finally he takes on the kingpin, kills him and he becomes the kingpin. The single player gameplay is a different and great experience, no boss levels, all the villans are humans but their weapons and toughness changes. Besides shooting the baddies you have to talk and get advise from people in night clubs, visit the pawn o matic, hire goons ect. The level design is fantastic, From a dark ally, a steel mill, railroad, bad streets ect. They are very fun and very enjoyable to get through. The level are huge and are in hub layout. The weapons are good, There is a pistol, shotgun, tommygun, grenade launcher, bazzoka and a flame thrower. The flame thrower looks as good as it is in rtcw, This same company did rtcw.
Kingpin is built on the heavily modified quake2 engine. I play it on the default OpenGL video mode and the game runs very smooth. The graphics are fantastic, look great even today. The charecter animation is good but thier flesh moves as if they do not have any skeleton. Sound is very good, weapon sounds and the music is great. The voice acting is averange and almost all the male charecters sound the same. The art direction for each levels is superb, artists who did it should get an award for their contribution, kingpin has the best art direction in a computer game even today. Wow! fantastic environments look real and the atmosphere is superb. Kingpin is a very violent game, you could see arms and limbs comming off, baddies injured and running away will leave a trail of blood. the level of violace and langauge make games like sof look like a kids game, you can reduce them by installing the pg-13 version. There are lots of bad words you will hear the f-word hundred times in the first level itself. The AI is quite good, villans react well in situation. Kingpin is a very good game, If you do not mind games with heavy violance and bad words then you will surely like it. It is one of the realistic and coolest fps i have ever played.",4.0
"The first Zork game done by Activision was Return to Zork, which looked cheap in many spots and although had some innovations it wasn't very impressive.  Next was Zork: Nemesis, which was worlds better but also very  dark and serious.  The only thing that made it a 'Zork' game were a few  familiar names and locations thrown around.  It lacked the humor of a true  Zork game.
Grand Inquisitor is both high quality and a true Zork game.  The humor is there, familiar locations are there, and the mood is most  assuredly Zork.  From a Brogmoid eating rocks to shoving a river raft in a  dragon's nose to getting a house drunk... the game is pure Zork  humor.
The visuals are from first person perspective much like Myst and  Riven, with video of various characters (CGI and live action) interspersed  throughout.  It's a 2 CD game with one Cd devoted to being above ground and  the other below.  As an added bonus, you can also play ZGI in multiplayer.  As far as I know this is the only multiplayer first person adventure game  in existance.
The premise is that magic has been banned by the Grand  Inquisitor and the head wizard has been trapped in a lantern.  Said lantern  makes interesting wisecracks as you play (""Your sword is blowing glue!  I mean.. er... glowing blue!"") and helps keep a light edge to it  all.
If you like the humor of Monkey Island and are a fan of zork you'll  enjoy this game, or even if you just want to play an adventure game with a  light mood and good quality graphics.",4.0
"One misses the smell of the 'real'money!  I remember seeing a bit of the original version and quite liked the artists impression of the properties as you landed on them, missing in this version.  There's alot of  information on the screen, especially when trading or checking status and  think I may need magnifying glasses.  However, thoroughly enjoying games  with the family that don't involve leaving a boardgame lying around the  floor for days...can we simulate money smells please?",4.0
"Is the new version of Monopoly worth it?  In a word, Yes!  Though I do miss the animations that were in the original Monopoly, this version not only has the new player pieces, but comes with 10 different city boards and  allows you to make your own as well!  The interface is user friendly and I  would recommend this to any board game fan.",4.0
"This Zork game follows in the grand tradition of the text-only Zork games.  Overall, the graphics are good, the plot interesting and funny, and the gameplay fun.  Though a bit harder to navigate if you are used to the  text-only games where you can ask lots of questions, for the most part it  is pretty fun to play.  It is very similar to Myst because there is no  fighting or other movement.  There is 360 degree scanning so you can search  all around the landscape but for the most part you are stuck in one place  that the computer places you in.  The humor is funny which makes it a good  game to play and it is cleverly done, so I recommend this game to anyone  who likes strategy role-playing games.  I also definitely recommend this to  fans of the text-based Zork games.",4.0
The monopoly game would not load in our computer,4.0
"Earlier version better as it included board editor where you could create your own street names.  Otherwise, still a very enjoyable game.",4.0
"The Monopoly software really enhances the game.  It is full of creative animations and also allows you to play on many different boards based on different cities (I like this feature), and also allows you to design your own board and play on it.  However, Mr. Monopoly's commentary becomes annoying after a while, especially his usually stupid comments about what number you rolled.  (You can turn this off though.)  Also, the board on the screen spontaneously rotates in full 3D.  This gets me dizzy much of the time.  So if you like Monopoly the board game and don't have motion sickness, you should play this.",4.0
"I agree with all the other review, I would have liked to seen the orginal PC version, to see the actual propertys.
My bug was that the opening sequence seemed to run in ultra slow motion; I called Hasbro on this and they gave me a bunch of gobbledy-gook, too.  If this happens to you, hit the spacebar or escape key until you get to the main menu.  Then you'll be OK and enjoy.
About the game play, it is really good translation from the original.  For the modern PC/Cd rom; a great improvement from the DOS version I had for my IBM P/S2 Model 25 AT/XT (720 kb)",4.0
"I noticed a previous reviewer said you really need a fast system to play BZ2. Well I am playing on a 300mhz pent2, 160 megs ram, Voodoo3 3000, and with a 40kbs internet connection speed and it is smooth as silk with every  feature turned up and using 800X600 res. He must have alot of stuff running  in the background. Well enough of that. The single player game has great  graphics and good strategy gameplay. I find the storyline a bit weak  though. The multiplayer portion needs some work. Ping times are extremely  high and it is hard to get into a low(sub 400) ping room. They really need  to fix that portion. While I am not quite as impressed as with the first,  BZ2 is still a good game to keep you glued to your monitor for hours.",4.0
"Although being a fan of Wu-Tang makes me a little biased, this game is actually a really fun Fighter! The arena style 3-D map fighting engine is quite nice as is the life points system. With an original Wu-Tang soundtrack (which can be gotten by putting the game in your computer's disc drive), awesome art, and 12 unique characters; this game is worth the money. Each of the nine original members are featured characters, each with his own martial art style; also have a clone character as well as a secondary costume. There are also three other unique characters which are from the game's story mode. The story mode is excellent with fun unlockables and quite a few multiplayer maps. Multiplayer is 2-4 players and is quite fun, and each character's unique fatalities are really funny and bad-ass.

Although this is a psone game, it works on my Ps2 slim fine. I'm not sure if it works on the PS3 or PS2 fat, however.

Also for people who don't like to see blood and guts, there is a parental violence lock that makes it completely tame.

And as an added bonus, Ghostface Killa was a major designer on the game!",4.0
"Great classic game, so many characters and moves that it takes great care to master them all. Overall challenging and fun.",4.0
"This game is beyond fun! The original nine members of the Wu go on a quest to save RZA's mentor from the hands of a demonic nemesis... each member has a difernt style of martial arts madness: ODB is a drunken boxer (what else), GZA has a mic attached to a chain with a blade (his fatalities are great!) Ghostface is a grappler with Iron gloves, Raekwon is a shadowboxer (fast as hell), Deck uses his fingertips to strike pressure points, Masta Killa is a faceless ninja, RZA has massive swords, U-God has some kind of obnoxious Muy-Thai kick boxing style, and Meth has a gargantuan hammer (with teh world's easiest 11-hit combo).

The characters aren't so well rounded out. Some easily overpower others. Meth and RZA can win just about any encounter, even if played by a novice. Deck and Raekwon are more finesse characters. There is a nice practice mode where you can slowly learn the individual attacks and combos of each cahracter- using whomever you choose as your punching bag (usually it's U-God in my home).

The fatalities are great and bloody- when they're not that they're just plain funny (such as when raekwon tosses his defeated foe into a massive green cauldron and pulls from it a bottle of Wu-Brew). Each character has 4 different fatalities.

OK, the story is kinda lame and at times it's almost impossible to win with certain characters. The graphics aren't top-notch, even by the standards of the game's release ('99 I think). And the music/beats get a tad repetitive. So what!?! Just kill the background music in the options and dig out that copy of Liquid Swords, son! You get a bunch of red-blooded guys in the room with chips n drink and this game- hours of fun will ensue. God only knows how much time I wasted in college playing this with my flatmates.

Alll in all, cheap copies of this are out there and if you like bloody games and dig on hip-hop- if you are a fan of any caliber of the Wu- get this!",4.0
"What are you prepared to do?
Pros:
Very enjoyable game
Pretty good graphics(despite eyes are white)
5 fatalities a pop, more than mortal combat
Very good rap tracks
good voice acting in FMVs
Devistating combos that can dish out mad damage
Rage meter definitly helps
Suprisingly good for a game that didn't get much praise from sites
Cons:
Story mode (especially in China) gets real repetitive
Some fatalities stink(like decks first fatalitiy)
Ghost, and Masta don't support their voices
I never herd of this game, until my brother brought it over, and I was hooked.  I got everything for him, and yet he didn't even let me borrow the game(One stingy brother)  But I got it not far after, and now I'm still enjoying it from time to time.  If you love mortal Combat, or like wu-tang, this is sure not to dissapoint.
Final Words:This game is definitly a game that lives up to not only the wu-tang name, but a mortal kombat, with a Tekken style looking game.  And that's what also cought my eye as well.

"space invaders for the n64 does a great job of taking something old and making it new again. the game is good and but it still only provides little variance on the space invaders formula. if you like space invaders though, this game gives further depth to the original. i would recommend this game to anyone familiar with the original. if not don't bother.",4.0
"WarCraft 2 is a legendary game made by Blizzard, a big gaming company as of now.  The game when it came out had everything and was a start of a brand new kind of game play.  Now with THIS edition though you can play on  the internet, which was something many people wanted for some time.  The  races of 2 arn't nearly as strategic as StarCraft, its following great  achiever, due to the facts that the Orcs and Humans in the game play are  almost identical.  The only real difference is the spells, and the way the  units look.
There is 2 reasons that I think you should buy this over  StarCraft... One is that it has two GREAT previews of the upcoming game  WarCraft 3 and the game Diablo 2.  The other reason is that not everyone  can afford computers that are incredibly fast.  So if you can not play  StarCraft very quickly and it goes slow on b.net for you, then WarCraft2 is  something you must buy because it will work much more effectively.",4.0
"Let's face it... WarCraft isn't StarCraft.  Think of it as StarCraft's successful, retired grandpa.  The graphics aren't nearly as detailed and the gameplay isn't quite as challenging or in depth as it's successor, but  for the price, WarCraft is a nice pickup, especially for those who aren't  familiar with the series.  The new package includes the Tides of Darkness  and the Beyond the Dark Portal single-player missions, as well as access to  Blizzard's sweet multiplayer website.",4.0
"This was one of the first strategy games I ever tried, and wasn't disappointed. It has an interesting storyline, seemingly based on Tolkien's books. You have a choice of being either controller of the orcs (who have  several troll, ogre, and other alliances) or the humans (who have several  elf, dwarf, and other alliances). The different races have different  technologies, but are similar in most ways. You usually decide your race by  personal preference. When you start a campaign, upgrades are few, but as  the game progresses, they get more advanced, and thus makes the game more  interesting. I gave this game four stars, because though it is a good game,  the mouse is hard to control, you can only select nine units at a time, and  the units aren't as varied as say, ""Age of Empires"".",4.0
