"I've read this book already and I've got plans for using it in future projects.  I'm DELIGHTED with the patterns in it and the advice and suggestions are just as good as you would expect from Melissa Leapman.  I'm so glad that I bought this.  As a lifelong and addicted knitter, this has been a valuable addition to my already good sized book collection.  Thanks Melissa for this very special knitting treat.",5.0
Nicely written directions.,5.0
"Good additional knitting reference to have available in an electronic format.  I like that it is easy to jump from one bit of information to another, since I was not sure if all the links to topics would be available in a Kindle format.",5.0
"A gazillion pattern stitches, lucidly explained. Illustrations for each one on the same page as its instructions. A very thorough guide to basic techniques in an appendix. You won't get full patterns here, but the stitches are easily adapted to straightforward knitting projects on both straight and circular needles. A very useful book.",5.0

Thank you  very much.",5.0

Love all the patterns in this book.  Made a scarf with one of the patterns.,5.0
"Super useful for designers.
I felt it complemented the Vogue Stitchionary well by having a lot in here that isn't in those volumes.  I actually like this even one better overall.",5.0
Loved it. Different than the usual squares.,5.0
Awesome book!!! A must have!,5.0
Lots of stitches.,5.0
"Easy to follow along, well written and written from the perspective of the knitter not the author.",5.0
"I'm a fairly experienced knitter of the one-color or color block intarsia vein, rather than a Fair Isle maestro, and what I loved best about this stitch guide is the multitude of reversible stitch patterns offered and shown reverse and obverse. If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.

This gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.

This also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.
Here, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!
One of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.

This is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.
While I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.

Until that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.

This is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.",5.0
Love this- I use it all the time.,5.0
Arrived as promised.,5.0
"I already own a few paper books with stitching patterns, but they all suck so hard I am desperate enough to turn to digital books here. This one is really good. Instructions are pretty clear, there are charts and written instructions both, and the patterns are beautiful. I was trying to knit a sweater for my cat (he gets cold often and is not against wearing something warm), but I am a beginner knitter and before purchasing this book I completely butchered 4 patterns, just couldn't either understand the over-complicated (or not detailed) enough instructions from other books, so the patterns went wrong. Then I used Melissa's book, and knitted the sweater with not one, but two beautiful patterns! Now I feel like this book is gonna be my go-to for knitting patterns for a long while :)",5.0
"The Knit Stitch Pattern Handbook is an excellent stitch dictionary, but it is more. I have other stitch dictionaries, but this is the first one I've bought that shows both the public side and the private side of many of the stitch patterns. Melissa has provided both text and chart representations of the stitch patterns. I don't buy very many craft e-books because I find them to be cumbersome and inconvenient to work from; however, the author provides links to PDFs of each of the stitch patterns individually so that the knitter can print the paper version out to work from. Yes, I agree that some of the patterns are common to many stitch dictionaries, but a good many are unique to this book. The appendices to this book are very helpful. I like this book very much.",5.0
Very beautifully done book.  Wonderful photos of each stitch.  Great instructions.  Lots of fun to see all of those great patterns.,5.0
Great book for beginners and experts.,5.0
This book is great! It does not have as much lace as I'd like but it is otherwise superb.,5.0
A book with traditional and new knitting stitch patterns for the budding knitwear designer or professional.,5.0
Love it!,5.0
I just love Melissa Leapman.  I have all her books and that is just another good one.,5.0
"Great book.  I am really glad I got this.  Lots of great stiches with very clear instructions.  I recommend this for anyone who knits.  It's my ""go to"" book.",5.0
"I can't believe how many patterns are in this book that I have never seen before, and believe me, I have been buying lots of knitting books in the last five years ever since I learned to knit. I don't know what pattern to make first!",5.0
Great book.,5.0
"This book is just what the doctor ordered my wife loves it as it has given Margaret clear and easy instruction to knitting pattens.

  We have it as a hard back and also as a eBook which fantastic.

  All of you knitters out there enjoy!",5.0
Great addition to any knitter's library!,5.0
"Well organized, helpful headings, clear directions, good illustrations",5.0
"Oh my goodness, you will not be disappointed when you get this book home.  So many varieties of stitches!  This handbook puts the stitches into categories, then within the category the stitches are arranged in order of difficulty (easiest listed first, followed by the ones that require a bit more concentration.  Jam packed with useful information and tips, as well.  I consider this pattern handbook a great addition to my ever growing collection of 'knittery' books.",5.0
This is a fine workshop manual.  Get the needles and work each new stitch and technique.  You will accomplish magic.,5.0
"There are a lot of stitch dictionaries out there, and every serious knitter ought to have several -- including this one.

Leapman has chosen a wide variety of stitches, simple to complex, from old favorites to exciting new ones, and has set them out both in line-by-line instruction and in charts with good-quality color photographs of each stitch.

What makes ""The Knit Stitch"" a must-have is that many of the pattern photos show both the ""right side"" and ""wrong side"" of the finished work. Anyone who makes scarves, blankets, or other items in which both sides of the knitting are routinely displayed when it's in use will find this an absolute godsend in designing.

The only quibble I have with the book is that I would have preferred the charts to be bigger. However, like many knitters, I prefer to work from a photocopy in order to save my original from wear and tear, so a quick enlargement of the charts resolves that issue nicely.

Good investment for the beginning knitter and nice addition to the experienced knitter's reference collection. Well worth the price.",5.0
It has motifs and inventive stitches involving crotchet in tandem with knitting stitches I have ever come across. Truly inspiring.,5.0
this stitch library does not disappoint!! you had me at 2 color cables!!! thrilled to add this amazing book to my library!!,5.0
"Very well laid out and very easy to read.

This book is also a nice size, not too big, but larger enough to use and see what is being presented.
Fair price for the product.",5.0
"It's been years since I've gotten excited about a stitch dictionary, but when I opened this today WOW.  I have 5 or 6 and many of them have the same stitches over and over (and over), but this one has many I've never seen before (of course, doesn't mean they're new, just not in any of the books I already have).  And even better, many I really love and want to try.  I've been in a bit of a knitting funk for the last month, (tired of  knitting because I'm tired of being cold maybe?) but now I'm totally inspired to do something I've never done before - swatch, swatch, swatch.  Maybe enough to wind up with a nice lap warmer for next winter.  And I really, really love that Ms. Leapman included instructions on how to shape in pattern - seems pretty easy from her explanation and I might even try designing one for next fall/winter.

Can't wait to get started - thank you, Ms. Leapman for bringing back my knitting mojo!",5.0
"The thing I most like about this collection of stitches is that there's little duplication with another stitch collection I have. The pictures are clear and the instructions well-written.

If brief usage descriptions for the patterns were included, this would be ideal. But that doesn't detract from the book's overall usefulness.

I've already started a project based on one of the stitches in the book. I'm sure I'll be making more as I progress. I use a Knook hook to knit and there are limited pattern books for this, so I really like the useful stitches I've found here.",5.0
I think this book is brilliant I absolutely love.  I think it is the most interesting knitting pattern book I have ever had.  There are so many new and interesting stitches in there.,5.0
Melissa Leapman shows knitters multiple stitch designs in clear pictures of the knitted pattern and easy to use charts for every design.,5.0
"Do not hesitate to buy this book. I have been knitting for 25 years and have collected stitch pattern dictionaries from the beginning. Even so, this book contains many new and beautiful stitch patterns which I had not seen before. I am so pleased with it. I design a lot of my own socks and this book has many, many new patterns which are going to be perfect for that.",5.0
"Beginning her career as a freelance knitter, Melissa Leapman has designed her own collection of wonderful stitch patterns. Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don't make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.

All patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, ""how to do basic stitches,"" taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.

If you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts. I am not being solicited in any way and  believe me, I can slam with the best of them.

Enjoy and get out the highlighter and notes. You're going to need them.",5.0
"This is a terrific stitch handbook (and I have a few). What sets it apart from it's competitors:

1. Shows which patterns are good on both sides including pictures of both sides
2. Pictures are in color and show good detail
3. Better descriptions, many include how much ""ease"" or ""give"", especially useful to sock knitters.
4. Written instructions AND charts for every pattern and a good explanation of how to use charts.

I have the 365 calendar (good pictures, no charts, no description of fabric characteristics) and an aged copy of the Mon Tricot and various adds to pattern and instruction books but this is far superior to anything I've accumulated before.",5.0
"When I received the book and looked at the cover I thought it looked intresting BUT then opening it and started to read
and look at the patterns ,it is really a fabulous book ,I have a lot of stitch pattern books , But this is the best I have ,I hope
Mellissa will bring out a few more .THANK YOU  wendy r pearce",5.0
The knitting book is excellent for planning different sweaters and scarves etc. Love this book. Most useful book I have.,5.0
"This is one of those books that you savor every page and can't wait to try the amazing patterns. There are some amazing cable patterns. And I especially love the ""awareness ribbon"" and the ""x marks the spot""",5.0
"I really am enjoying this book! I like the size of the book itself, I love the patterns which are providing new grist for the creativity mill. The instructions, both charted and written are clear and well thought out. I like that you can see both the right side as well as the wrong side. I guess that I like everything about this book.

I'd love to see the same format with more 'regular' stitch works. I'm so pleased that I happened upon this book thanks to an Amazon recommendation in my email!",5.0
"Great patterns, and I love that the book is available for my Kindle library.  I recommend the book for those inexperienced knitters or those who are looking for new stitches.",5.0
I really love this book.  Knitting is not my favorite pastime but with these new stitches it certainly is gaining on my crocheting,5.0
"Just received this book and looked over it cover to cover. Each pattern has written and charted instructions and the photos are lovely.  The book contains Textured Knit and Purl Patterns, Lace and Openwork Patterns, Cables and Crossed Stitch Patterns, Slip Stitch Patterns, and Novelty Stitch Patterns.  There is also information on shaping knits within pattern stitches, designing projects worked in the round and other basic design info at the front of the book.  In the back of the book there are illustrations and instructions for knitting techniques, the abbreviations/symbols.  There are 288 pages total, but the book isn't so big that it shouldn't fit into your knitting bag.  While there are some stitch patterns I have seen before, there are enough 'new to me' stitches to make this worth the purchase.  I am very happy with it, and can't wait to start swatching.",5.0
"I have purchased several of these books about various topics and have been pleased with each one.  I like the fact that a lot of pictures are included as well as the explanation, since I am mainly a visual learner.  This book will be used later as a reference book.

I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to increase their confidence in sewing.",5.0
"I've been sewing quite a bit for the past 15 years or so...much of this has been self-taught.  So, this book has been great to fill in the gaps and the ""whys"" for what I've been doing.",5.0
"This is a easy to use guide to sewing. I haven't been sewing long but thought I knew alot, but this book has many pointers.",5.0
"I credit this book with teaching me not only to sew, but in helping me recognize that I am a visual learner. Previous to finding this jewel I had read other sewing books, many highly recommended, and felt only frustration and confusion by the terminology (even in so-called ""beginner"" books.) For instance, I read the description/meaning of ""selvedge"" over and over, but it didn't actually click for me until I had this book. Here a simple glance at a photo told me everything I needed to know to identify WHAT the heck it was so I could get on with the actual sewing. No more wasting hours trying to decipher text on how to position fabric for a particular action, once again clear and large photos clarify the matter. I refer to this book constantly and I find it's well-organized, with a complete index.

If you find yourself stumped or frustrated by other ""beginner"" books, you may find that you comprehend and learn far faster from a tutorial with lots of photographs (step by step demonstrations) than endless paragraphs of text. I know it works for me and I have several wonderful completed projects now to show for it. I even added some ""advanced"" touches to my beginner projects thanks to this helpful guide. Kudos to Ms. Colgrove and the publisher for recognizing that visual learners need different tools.",5.0
"This was a gift for my daughter-in-law, who had never sewed before.  The visual style of teaching was great for her and she loved the book.",5.0
"This works great for me.  I can get more out of seeing what something should look rather than reading instructions.  I'm thrilled to have this book, it's a real time saver and helps me remember things I learned a long time ago.  Highly recommend.",5.0
These books are wonderful it's like having someone standing next to you showing you step by step how to do something. These are great..,5.0
"It is a book that has been proven as great learning tool for my granddaughter with her new experiences in sewing....and it is often used as a reminder of those things I already know, but with the years might not remember at the moment.  I bought this in conjunction with Sewing Visual Quick Tips and would recommend both highly.",5.0
Pictures are clear.  Most subjects you will encounter through intermediate knitting are covered.  Book is well organized.  this books sits on my knitting shelf where I can get at it quickly,5.0
"Excellent starter book, even for Guys! Learn the basics of sewing. Become knowledgable both in machine and hand sewing. Learn about purchasing and selecting fabric. Lots of pictures and illustrations.",5.0
This book was in great condition. It has many great tips and instruccions on sewing. I will be purshasing two more to share with other people.,5.0
"I am very much a novice seamstress. I used to participate in a Civil War

I am very much a novice seamstress. I used to participate in a Civil War Reenactment troupe, resulting in me needing to learn how to create period-correct clothing (or pay the exorbitant fees for clothes from specialty vendors). After buying a sewing machine (see the review for my current machine here), I have primarily learned how to sew through trial and error.

In an attempt to earn extra cash, I decided to make doll clothes to sell at the county fair. After breaking out my sewing machine, acquiring cloth, notions, and various embellishments, I made a doll skirt. At that point I realized just how rusty I was- I don't think I could've made a more crooked seam if I tried. I immediately logged onto Amazon and made use of my Amazon Prime membership: within two days I held my copy of Teach Yourself Visually Sewing.

Allow me to explain the reason behind my purchase. I am very much a visual learner; reading a paragraph of instructions without pictures (or even minimal pictures that may not necessarily cover every step) renders me down to the learning function of a monkey attempting calculus.

After reading other customer's praise for this book, I clicked the button to purchase it.

I cannot begin to explain adequately just how great this book is. I learned more about sewing within a half hour of reading than I learned over the past six years.

Debbie Colgrove's writing style is very informative while remaining simplistic (a sewing pun!). This is not to say that she writes as though the reader is an idiot, rather, she takes the time to explain concepts without cluttering up the book with sewing terminology. Too many other teaching books make the assumption that people know the ""lingo"" for their topic; Ms. Colgrove will only do this after she has defined each word she introduces.

The pictures within the book are also excellent. For each lesson, there are step-by-step photographs which clearly show what you should be doing with your fabric. The accompanying sentences for each picture are concise and well-written, which enabled me to learn new sewing techniques quickly and easily.

In addition to providing step-by-step instructions for various sewing techniques (basting, flat-felled seams, French seams, & etc.), Teach Yourself Visually Sewing also explains what I term your craft-specific ""knowledge base"". What this means is she takes the time to show the reader how to read patterns, how to properly cut cloth, the difference between types of cloth and thread, and much, much more. In short, this is like explaining the why for a what. Not only do I now know which needle to use for heavier fabrics, I also know why you need to use that needle. By teaching the reader the ""why's"" for everything, you will be more likely to retain what you have read.

The book also includes several projects that you can attempt, ranging from a novice skill level to much more advanced. The patterns include things such as a hostess apron, pillows, a receiving blanket, a table runner, and more. Each project is also illustrated to ensure that you are completing each step successfully.

The Final Word

Teach Yourself Visually Sewing is an indispensable tool for any skill level. The information contained within this book will have you sewing straighter seams, cutting cleaner lines, and more, within a matter of hours. I will even go so far as to say that every sewing aficionado should have this book in their arsenal as a reference material (again with the sewing puns!); I feel that there may be no equal.

This book, to my opinion, is better than even the ""Idiot's Guide"" and ""For Dummies"" line of books. With those series, there are not many pictures and simply a lot of text trying to teach you [sometimes] really complicated concepts. Teach Yourself Visually Sewing provides clear, full-color photographs and wonderful written explanations for each.

In short, if you are serious about learning to sew, have sewing as a hobby, or only sew when you need to replace a button, this book is a must-have. Like me, you will find yourself consulting the book frequently to ensure that you are doing everything correctly, or to brush up on a step. This book is simply the best value for your money!",5.0
Very good book with illustrations for a beginner and someone who has a bit of sewing expertise. I give it four stars.,5.0
"Easy to learn sewing with this book.  It has great pictures, you do not need to read, just look at the pictures and you will be sewing in no time.",5.0
I am very happy with this book. It has a lot of details about sewing and it has plenty of illustrations. The book is very helpful for beginner to the art of sewing.,5.0
I'm a beginner and this book explains everything perfectly. The pictures are REALLY helpful. I would recommend this book to anybody interested in sewing.,5.0
"We love love love these little maze books!  My daughter is a maze fanatic, and these are great because she can work on them at home, or take them anywhere with her because they are on the small side.  She is 5 years old, and they are difficult enough to keep her engaged and challenged, but not so difficult that she becomes discouraged.  A great buy.",5.0
Son and grandson and I do these together.  Nice family time.,5.0
My son loves mazes. He loved this book for Easter. They are mazes on his level. He is 6 years old.,5.0
"Great stocking stuffers for my grand children. I find these types of books to expand their thinking, and promote learning. They just think that they are fun books.",5.0
"smaller than I thought, but good mazes and the book is well made. Perfect for car trips or taking in for doctor appointments, etc.",5.0
This books are great for traveling and handy for keeping the children busy. They fit everywhere.  They have been useful too for my mother who has Alzheimer's and this helps her as well.,5.0

"We love these little activity books and love how small they are. Perfect for little hands, pockets, purses and backpacks. Good to have on hand. Great quality.",5.0
granddaughter loves it,5.0
This book is the perfect size to carry in your purse or diaper bag. My son loves the mazes which gives him a break from his coloring books. The answers are in the back if the child is having a little trouble completing the maze.,5.0
Great value for such a little book. I brought this in my travel pack for my toddler on the plane since he loves mazes. It would be great for a restaurant or doctors wait too! These would also make fabulous party supplies.  I will prob purchase another one for our next trip. It's small but thick and full of pages to last a few hours.,5.0
"We bought several of these for a very long road trip. My children are ages 6, 4, and 3. The 4 year old is addicted to mazes and he really enjoyed the varying difficulties and themes of these mazes. All the pages are in black and white, so when he got tired of doing the mazes (which did take a while), he colored everything in. My six year old was through the book fairly quickly, but it was still enjoyable for her. These are the perfect little books to have on hand for car trips, doctor's offices, and church pews. They're small enough not to draw a lot of attention from others and they fit well in the hands of young children. All you need is a pencil or crayon and you've got some pretty entertaining and mind-bending fun for children!

The quality of the book is what you would expect - it's all lightweight paper, stapled together. The illustrations are cute. The mazes simply drawn but challenging for young minds. I'd get more from this line.",5.0
My Granddaughter loves these.,5.0
"Excellent value, and can keep young children entertained for a few minutes.

Now these books are small--but that's kind of the point of these book, I think. They're portable, easy to throw in a briefcase or purse or back of the car, and handy to give to children at the doctor's office waiting room, or in an airport, or on a car trip, or at a restaurant waiting for food, or really, just anywhere where you want to have a short educational (or semi-educational) activity.

And I gotta admit, I like that this is an ""un-plugged"" option. Not on a phone or tablet or screen--just a good old-fashioned book with simple activities, vivid illustrations, and things to *do*--that is, an active, tactile experience--even if the activities are quite simple (like peeling stickers).

We don't leave home without a few of these. (Just be prepared, if you haven't ordered these before, for a small booklet, not a *book* book.)",5.0
great for kids,5.0
granddaughter loves it,5.0
My son is 4.5 and recently has been really interested in doing mazes. I keep slews of these around in case we have a car ride that's semi long or if I want to have something cheap to give his little friends to take home. The price is phenomenal!,5.0
"All of these little activity books are great. My 3 year old takes them along with us on long trips, grocery shopping, Church, etc. The books are small enough to fit in a small purse. My 8 year old also loves them.",5.0
Love these little books! You can't beat it for the price. Our daughter had poor fine motor skills and her handwriting is suffering because of it. I bought these to help build the motor skills so prepare her better for 1st grade.,5.0
Fun and simple. Easy to carry around for a boredom emergency.,5.0
This is the perfect sized activity book to bring with you.  Fits great in a purse without taking up all the room.  My kids enjoy doing the mazes.,5.0

"I bought this stained glass animal coloring book as part of a gift for a 10 year-old girl.  The gift included various coloring books and a colored pencil set.  This book was the first one she went for.  The ""stained glass"" effect works quite well, actually.",5.0
I enjoy the realistic look of the animals in this book. my grandchildren love the pages and we love to tell stories about the animals in this book,5.0
"If, like us, you have hundreds of ""drawings"" around the house these are a nice change. When colored, you can hang them in the window.",5.0
I would recommend this book to anybody that likes wild animals as there are very nicely done pictures to use for many different projects.,5.0
"These are some really beautiful pictures of wild animals I have seen.  It has been a fantastic tool to have, also.  My daughter was doing a report for school on giraffes, and this fit perfectly.  I have been very pleased with this book and intend to buy more stained glass coloring books in the future.",5.0
"This coloring book is a fabulous way for my children and I to do something fun and constructive, ""together""  It also allows us to relax as we use our imaginations, yet trying to keep our coloring and blending of colors as close to the real paintings as possible.  My children are young, 9 and 7, and I truly feel that this coloring book, aswell as other coloring books of its kind, help them ""appreciate"" art in a whole new way.  And what could be more rewarding for them than to be able to display their final product in a window for everyone to see!

"The best foil origami paper I have come across (having shopped for foil paper in China, US and UK). Each sheet is delightfully very square. Also, it is the only foil paper I know of that does not wrinkle at creases, and flattens out again very cleanly, so it is easy to create 3D origami. It is very good value for reasonable price.",5.0
"I find the paper quality excellent, it's like the japanese foil that I use normally. It's easy to fold and the colours are beautiful. The price is good too, it's less expensive than in the online origami paper shop where I generally do my shopping.",5.0
"bought this for my sister she loved the colors and the size of it. but she mostly loved the
fact it was shiny. great product for little kids.",5.0
"I have a 9 yr. old son that is really into Origami, I have a hard time finding him the right kind of paper here were we live.  Amazon has tons of choices on paper and he loves this foil paper the best!  This is also an excellent value.",5.0
"Great paper for folding, foil stays on the paper even after a few creases or folds, it doesnt release from the paper as some do.",5.0
"Origami foil paper

First of all, this is not a book, it's a collection of 18 sheets of foil backed with white paper, for use in folding origami models. The foil is reasonably good quality and does not crack when you make a sharp fold as some do. The range of colours is quite good though as always in a multi pack like this there are some you may not want to use. The sheets are cut very accurately and the papers work well for folding complex models as the foil is very thin.

I regard the cost as being the one thing against this product, there is no need for all the extra packaging and the paper could easily have been sold in its cellophane wrapping only with just a tab at the top or a cardboard insert with the publisher information, and then it could have cost far less. However it's difficult to find good quality origami foil, this is similar in feel to Japan foil so seasoned folders will be pleased to have an easily available supply.",5.0
Excellent book for those to like to knit/ing.  Lot of interesting reading and patterns.  Not for the novice Knitter.  Good book.,5.0
"I've been in awe of knitted counterpanes/bedspreads,so of course I had to buy this book. The photographs and illustrations are worth the price of the book, in my opinion. I really want to try making one of these, and have even bought size one needles to do so. I think I'll start it in January, with the goal of having it finished by December. Why? Just to say I finally made one! Even if you never make one yourself, just having the book and dreaming about it is well worth it.",5.0
I knit a great deal and saw this book in it's first edition and wanted to buy it but it was out of print.  If you knit...get this book,5.0
"When I first saw this book years ago, I loved every counterpane in it. I started making one, and then lost the book. I am so glad to see it in print again. It is full of beautiful designs. One could use parts of these designs for edgings, etc if one didn't wish to make a whole bedspread. (I think most of the counterpanes call for small size knitting needles, like ""0"" or ""00"".  I know my metal ones are bent from making multistitch popcorns, etc.)",5.0
"I saw an afgan pattern on Ravelry that said it was a counterpane.  I had heard the word since childhood from my mother and other elders but didn't know what it meant other than something to do with a bed cover.  I liked what I saw on Ravelry so I went searching for more information.

I found this book and knew I had to have it.  I think I will have to do a lot of practicing to get good at the squares, but they don't seem too difficult.  It looks like it might take a long time to make a counterpane, but would be well worth it.

Interestingly enough on page 2 there was a reference to a collection of Atoinette Lackner Webster from Eat Poultney, VT.  I have Webster relatives from VT.  I don't know if she is related but I wrote to the Poultney VT Historical Society and found out that Tony is deceased and they didn't know where her collection was but they did know a friend of hers and hopefully I will some day hear from the friend.

If you like knitting and want a challenging, fun task, try a counterpane.  The squares are created and assembled the way quilt squares are: a haphazard-looking design becomes a beautiful ""Picture"" when the squares are sewn together.",5.0
"I loved this book and started stitching a picture the day I got it. I live a magical life and this is the best book for someone who wants to put so magic in their projects! There is a wheel of the year,a beautiful dragon, Father Sun, Mother Moon and even some witchy magnets!! You will not be able to stop stitching. Metallic thread and beads embelish almost ever picture and they sparkle. Oh and the charts are full color and very easy to use.",5.0
The cross stitch patterns were easy to read and work.  I've always liked Ms. Elliot's work and this just shows how great her talent is.,5.0
"Great book, especially for people who love fantasy designs. I don't know which design I want to stitch first. They are all lovely.",5.0
"I've been a fan of fantasy stories and themes my entire life, so when my grandmother-in-law said that she'd make one of her cross stitch master pieces for me, in the design of my choosing, I started my fantasy cross stitch search. Until now (as a fantasy buff) I only knew one name in the world of cross stitch, Teresa Wentzler, but I am pleased to say that I've found another one just as talented, Joan Elliott.

When I received Bewitching Cross Stitch in the mail yesterday I was flat out stunned at the quality and complexity of the designs Joan Elliott created. The showcase designs are simply gorgeous, awe-inspiring. Her designs look like painted stitchery, not cubist interpretations. They are sometimes whimsical, other times hauntingly beautiful, always lovely. Even better is the fact that, while I'm not a big stitcher myself, she includes petite pieces and coordinating projects out of each design that are small and simple enough for the beginner to attempt (and actually finish).

Standout projects include the Father Sun, Mother Moon, the dragon from the cover, and the black cat/magical workshop. The cover of this book does NOT do it justice, the dragon pictured there is covered in tiny details and fine stitching.

Lastly, as a Pagan, I was pleasantly surprised to see the Wheel of the Year pillow and the celestial faces. The only thing missing is a Green Man face, now THAT would be gorgeous given the same treatment as the others.

All in all, a great book for those who like fantasy and magical designs. I think it's worth every penny, on sale or not, and will definitely recommend it to my likeminded stitching friends.",5.0
I love this book!  All the projects are fabulous!! I only wish that it didn't have color charts - and page overlapping charts would have been even better as well.,5.0

"Very nice patterns. Love that the designer has broken out some of them as smaller projects, too.",5.0
Magical and fun designs,5.0
"An excellent find, I am so very pleased with this book. I usually get a book for one pattern in it that I see, and reluctantly do the rest of the patterns to get my money's worth. You will not have that problem with this book.

Full colour patterns with gorgeous pictures, as well as tips on how to use patterns to the fullest extent, not just making the picture, but how to pull pieces from a pattern and make it look good. Your only problem you might have is finding all the reasons you want to do the patterns! Christmas gifts galore!

There is a lot of beading in some of these, but those are easily left out of the pattern if you aren't a good beader or a beginner. I would say this book ranges from intermediate to advanced, some of the smaller patterns are really detailed in the way of backstitching, though I wouldn't see a problem in giving it to a beginner, as there are parts of larger patterns they could do. All in all, and excellent book.

Here is a video if folks want to see some of my completed projects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8nJevDS5Gs&feature=youtu.be",5.0
Love it there are so many projects I want to do. I'm not sure where to start. Great price also.,5.0
Pictures are clear and big so you can see the squares clearer! The only thing bad I could say is that the pictures are so big they off on 2 pages so its a little hard to follow on some. But the pictures are great!,5.0
There are so many ways to describe this book that it is hard to choose just a couple of words.  The colors and the designs are fabulous.  The patterns Father Sun and Mother Moon are by far my favorites and I can't wait to begin stitching them.  They are just absolutely beautiful.  I bet Joan had a wonderful time coming up with these.  The colors are over the top.  Everything about this book is way over the top and anyone would be hard pressed to find a book to beat this one.  These designs are just small reasons why Joan Elliott is by far my favorite designer.  The designs are definitely bewitching.,5.0
Beautifully done and well laid out patterns.  Will be some nice projects to work on this winter.  Thank you for sharing.,5.0
"I bought this book for 1 specific pattern. After I got it and went through it dozens of times, there are SEVERAL projects in here I am VERY excited about! This book has the most beautiful patterns! Colorful, big with great detail and small easier patterns, the 1st I've seen that uses beading, metallic threads and multi tone threads....very Magickal and pretty :) !!! I LOVE this book!!!",5.0
My friend is doing the cover dragon and I am doing Lady Moon. What a beautiful book with great detail on cross stitching these designs. Imaginative and non-offensive or scary.,5.0
"Not only are the designs beautiful, but the comments and presentations throughout the book just make you feel good. Everyone can use a little more of that these days. I would recommend it.",5.0
Love Joan Elliott patterns aways good instructions and graphs . Good lists for supply's as alway I enjoy she patterns and pictures.,5.0
"This book is enough to happily convert unknowing stitchers to become Joan Elliott fans. It makes me want to collect all her design books. The book is just full of wonderful designs, making it difficult to quit looking and dreaming os what to stitch first. It's worth much more than the price I paid!",5.0
"I bought this in the hopes that it would have a dragon that wasn't evil-and I wasn't disappointed. My son loves dragons but the only pieces you seem able to find are the fire breathers waiting to kill someone or be killed. This has a beautifully done dragon, as well as other magical designs. I love the small snowy owl and the Witch's Best Friend. There are detailed pictures and there are simple day or two projects.",5.0
"I was thrilled when I got my copy of this book. The book is well made and the charts are easy to read. What I did not expect was how many lovely designs were in the book. Usually when I get a book it is for one design, but all of these are fun and magical. When previewing the book before ordering only a handful of designs are shown, so seeing Phoenix and all the witchy designs and the ornaments (little designs that go with the bigger designs) was a pleasant surprise. I've never stitched a Joan Elliott before, but now I have to hunt down some of her other patterns.",5.0
"*UPDATE*
I LOVE THIS BOOK! I have done almost EVERYTHING in here as gifts or just 'cause. I m redoing the Cresent Moon Dragon again. The 1st time I did it on black and it looks FANTASTIC! Now I'm stitching it on a blue/grey tye dye fabric.
This book ISN'T for beginners... itworks with evenweave fabric you have to work over 4 strands and its not only hard but it took me almost 8 months t finish the dragon because of that fact. The other ones are on regular Aida (you COULD do the dragon one on Aida but I'm a stickler for detail!) The charts are PERFECT... in full color and easy to read, 1/2 of the patterns take up more then 2 pages and each and every page is color. Some projects are small like post card size but the biggest one is the wizard (I am eagerly awaiting fabric or that one!), 18x22 inches!  I TOTALLY think its worth the money, I have had this book for a little over 2 years and i go to it whenever I need a project (my sister loved the Hope (bird) cross stitch and my cousin loved the egyptian style bookmark)...
If you can afford the amount of money and time it takes (you need PLENTY of both) then this book is a must have!!

I found this book at the library and when i rented it i knew i had to buy it. the designs are a little big (1-4 pages) but the images when done are more then astounding. i am an avid cross stitching addict and have to work on three projects at the same time but with these they don't bore me or make me want to go to another design.",5.0
"I love all things mythical and have fallen in love with this book. All of the patterns are extremely beautiful and so fun to stitch. I have already completed the ""Mother Moon"" and I am currently working on ""Father Sun"" and I have to say that they are both magnificent! The colors are rich, the details are beautiful, especially the metallic thread and the beading. If you are into stitching and love to do mythical type projects, this will be your favorite book. I first borrowed it from the library and after looking through it, I had to buy it for myself.",5.0
"Joan Elliott has outdone herself with this book. Beautiful designs. Breathtaking colors. She was born to design for cross stitching.
Every chart in this book is incredible. A friend just finished the Crecent Moon Dragon, and I am working on the Chinese Phoenix, my favorite in this collection.
If you want a challenging, yet extremely enjoyable project, this book is for you!",5.0
"Great patterns, and smaller sub-patterns for those who need a quick stitch or wish to make a full set!",5.0
"I bought one for myself and one for a friend when I saw mine.  Joan Elliott is the artist that draws the most beautiful faces in cross stitch. I like ""Mother Moon"" so much, I immediately bought all the ethereal Kreinik metallic floss,beads, and fabric to start stitching! The colors that are used to make her patterns are really seen once you get all the ""ingredients"" together. Once you start you know you are creating a Goddess! Next will be ""Father Sun"" and the wonderful Wizard and Dragon that are also in this book. I have bought other books and have been disappointed once you get them home and see how poorly done they are, but not this one. Some of these patterns were originally published in English Cross Stitching magazines. If you go to her web site you will have to pay more for just one of these pattens then you will for this whole book.",5.0
I was happy to receive this book.  It was all I expected and more.  The coloured charts are bright and clear and easy to see. I bought the book originally jsut for one design but have happily found others I look forward to doing.,5.0
"There are so many amazing designs in this project book that I am having a hard time deciding which to stitch first.  The book is color coded, which is easy for the stitchers in my family, especially my husband, who is working his first project from this collection.  While it is highly ambitious to do a first project from one of the large pieces in this book, it is especially valuable for stitchers who have done several projects and are looking for designs that go beyond teddy bears and old fashioned samplers.  If you are a fan of fantasy art, this book is strongly recommended!",5.0
I have already started the Father Sun pattern. Of course I made some floss changes. The Krenik floss that they call for is hard to use and more expensive than the Treasure Braid that I have chosen to use.,5.0
"What a fantastic selection of designs! As both an avid needleworker and a Pagan, I really appreciate the patterns in this book. They range from beautiful, large projects like the Phoenix and Mother Moon, to smaller projects for when you want to make gifts or just don't have the time to commit to a long-term piece (I plan to use the phoenix feather design to make pillow cases). My only small feminist gripe is that there's a huge, involved Wizard piece, but no Sorceress/Witch aside from a cutesy kitchen witch. I'd love to see an enchanting enchantress who isn't dolled up in a Hallwe'en costume over a cauldron. Still, for the scope of the works, well worth the money. I'm going to try adapting the Wheel of the Seasons to needlework, it'd make an amazing design for a tapestry.",5.0
"I saw this book in a library and new I had to buy it - very exciting to see an entire well-crafted book of counted cross stitch designs that aren't just flowers, kittens, or Biblical verses. As an intermediate-advanced cross-stitcher, I love the detailed, non-cartoonish designs. The colors are gorgeous (though naturally, with a little imagination, you could swap them for others if they aren't to your taste), and (extra kudos to the publisher!) the symbols on the charts are colored to approximately match the thread colors, making them fantastically easy to read. Each large design is also accompanied by a few smaller accent designs/charts, along with instructions on various project ideas (tea towels, keepsake boxes, etc.). The book also provides clear lists of items needed for each project and estimated sizes of finished designs. As a note, I recommend making a photocopy of the chart you choose to work on; a copy is easier to handle while you're stitching, and keeps the book from getting too worn.

I hope to see more from Joan Elliott and this particular publisher. I also recommend Teresa Wentzler's fantasy cross stitch collection, though her designs are far more detailed and challenging, and the charts aren't quite as easy to read.",5.0
"Beautiful papers with solid color complementary backs.  I like the larger size, too.",5.0
"I love these papers by Tuttle. I have almost all of them now. Beautiful colors with print on one side and coordinating solid on the other. The paper weight and size is perfect for all sorts of different paper applications. I use them for origami, paper beads and Modge Podge.",5.0

"This book from Japan is a wonderful book if you want to get started in needle felting. It has detailed instructions to go along with the many colored pictures showing the item you would like to create. The author also has little notes about her fuzzy friends and why she has created them making this a personal experience as well as fun and easy. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get started in needle felting. Not only is it about cute fuzzy animals but she also includes some everyday items such as pillows, pouches, and a rabbit shaped plate just to name a few.",5.0
"I've loved Donna Kato's work for some time, but while I've purchased several polymer clay ""how-to"" books in the three years I've been working with PC, this is the first of Ms. Kato's books I've purchased. It won't be the last.

I received it today, and read through it, cover to cover.  My hands are itching to try the techniques she so generously and painstakingly shares. While other leading polymer clay artists sell these same techniques individually in seminars and on expensive DVDs, Ms. Kato has demonstrated several processes I've been hungry to learn in one place, in a beautiful, inexpensive and clearly written book.

Hats off to Donna Kato!",5.0
"Absolutely fantastic  book. If I could give it 10 stars, I would.",5.0
Exciting and inspirational!  Great information.,5.0
very good,5.0
"I just received Donna Kato's Creative Surface effects.  This book appeals to me immensely as I love the heavy Asian art and Art Nouveau influences  The coloring of her projects feel both soft and strong, and I love her patterns.  I like this book as her designs are substantially fine art creations.  The designs are rich yet bold with patterns that are unique.  Techniques are well demonstrated through both pictures and clear instructions.  This is not quite for the novice as it assumes that you know the basic polymer clay techniques.  However, I think it would be a great addition to anyone's library because the point is to challenge ourselves.  So many beautiful things and never enough hours in a day.",5.0

Of course this is a great book - every polymer artist should have Kato's books. I'm not a fan of her clay (WAY too hard to condition) but her instructions in her books are impeccable. She is the true Queen of Polymer!!!,5.0
"This book out weighed my expectation's! This book is so wonderful and so informative. Donna gives you do's and don'ts and everything in between. So many wonderful thing's were swirling around my head while reading. This is an updated version of an older book she wrote and It was so interesting that I bought the old book too.

"I love this book! I fell in love w/i this book 3 years ago in a well-known bookstore, where it was priced out of my reach, then. When I finally had a little more money, I thought to go to Amazon for the book, and got it so inexpensively that a friend asked to get a second copy for her.

I have purchased Donna's other book on polymer which is excellent and this book is also in e same top quality directions are very clear with sharp images of steps for completion of projects.

"This book is awesome! I'm a long-time polymer clay lover, and though I know the basics such as conditioning, curing, safety, tools, and a few helpful tricks, I never really knew how to achieve all the amazing effects true clay artists use. Now I do.
This book covers a variety of effects, such as the three-dimensional illusion, several different image transfer methods, faux-enamel, and more. And to make it even more perfect, it isn't a project book, and it's not a technical book: it's both. It focuses on teaching you the techniques, but at the end of each chapter, there's a single project that shows you how you can use what you just learned. It's the perfect combination!",5.0
"Donna Kato is at it again. She has many books out on many subjects. She has incorporated so many different techniques in this one book. She is a talented artist and it becomes evident in this, her latest book. She sparks my creative juices. Great Book.",5.0
"but this one is my personal favourite.
I have a lot of polymer clay books. Unfortunately very often books repeat themselves and one cannot find many new and interesting informations. This book is full of wonderful inspiration and techniques brought into perfection. If you are interested in polymer clay and want to learn and understand it - Donna Kato is the best book-teacher. After going through this book you will see more of possibilities hidden in polymer clay",5.0
"This is the first book I have bought of Donna Kato's. It is absolutely fantastic - I cannot find fault with it. Well written, beautifully illustrated and full of inspiring project ideas. Donna's skill shows through in the quality of her work. I am a perfectionist and truly admire her standard of craftsmanship. I will definitely be buying Donna's other books.",5.0
"The best source I've found for spectacular surface treatments in polymer clay.  The explanations are simple, equipment minimal, and results very sophisticated.",5.0
"Highly recommend this book for its clear instructions, as well as inspirational photos. Since I cannot attend a Donna Kato class in person, I am always eager to add another Donna Kato book to my collection. I also purchased Kato's Millefiori Techniques at the same time. Both books are terrific, as well as Amazon's price and delivery time.",5.0
I recently bought this book and I have to say I am loving it!  There is so much to see and do.  I cant wait to start.  The instructions are direct and concise.  And the projects leave me craving the next page.,5.0
"I'm a professional researcher at heart so when I delve into a topic I dive into the deep end and don't come up until I've exhausted the field. True to form this is what I've done with polymer clay. My thinking: If I'm going to spend a lot of money on tools and supplies I'm going to research the heck out of the topic so that I technically understand what's what.  As with most artistic mediums, success and high quality results are dependent upon the artist/crafter's understanding of the technical issues.  This is where Donna Kato comes into my life (so to speak).

I purchased Kato's first book 'The Art of Polymer Clay' and was blown away by the depth and breadth (underline that last) of subtopics presented. Her writing and step by step explanations are clearly presented without being too pedantic. The side by side pictures detail the techniques being discussed and don't omit that critical step which makes the difference between success and failure. Some authors don't edit their own work very well and when omissions of this sort happen it drives me crazy.

From my experience with her first book I purchased Kato's `The Art of Polymer Clay: Creative Surface Effects' and again wasn't disappointed (remember my expectations at this point were high). This book is an outstanding tool. With Kato's help, and admittedly the help of other well qualified author's  my overall appreciation of polymer clay techniques has grown leaps and bounds and I look forward to years of expressing myself in the millions of ways this particular medium allows.",5.0
"Wow, that's some long title.  The book is excellent in that is shows step by step how to transfer images to clay, stamping, using stencils, inks and paint to make the most unique pieces of art...............not the clay projects you remember from childhood.",5.0
"Donna did it again with this book and as with her other books, I am learning so much.  I suggest this book to anyone who wants to take their polymer clay work to another level.  Well written, great photos, easy to follow instructions.  Thanks for another great book, Donna.

"I was totally new to clay working, heading for a class in the medium, when I purchased this book.  I was absolutely delighted, and was able to start my class with some background and understanding of working the materials.  I sit in awe of Ms. Kato's talent, and did find the techniques more difficult than they look.  This aside, it is an excellent accumulation of many of the techniques that makes polyclay such a joy to work with.  Ms. Kato does list several varieties of clay, inks, paints and other products, but I appreciate that she enumated which she found easier to work with, and why.  I did expect some bias towards Kato Polyclay, as she helped develop it, but have also found this an excellent product to work with and have not been disappointed with its performance.
The book is a MUST HAVE for the beginner reference library, and is also an inspiration with the images from Ms Kato and other artist's collections.  I'm pleased I purchased this book, and plan to keep it as a cornerstone for clay working.",5.0
"I was surprised at how many ""finishes"" you can give Poly Clay. This book explains it all . She does show alot of ""specialty tools"" you can use - but they can be substituted with your own tools or simple copies. GREAT BOOK - Great Pictures and easy step by step instructions.",5.0
As with all of Donna Kato's books it is well written and her explanations and photos are geared for all level of artist. It is a must have book if you love working with polymer clay or just love to look at innovative Asian influenced design ideas.,5.0
"This is an amazing book and one that you should really get to add to your collection of polymer clay books.  There are soooooo many things in here to try. I just can't wait!
Plus, buying it from here saved me lots of $$ over the local craft store cost and even ebay.",5.0
"Donna Kato's new book, with photographs by her husband Vernon Ezell and a foreword by Carol Duvall, covers a wide range of techniques and styles.  Kato's work defies categorization, covering nostalgic pieces, modern pieces, whimsical items, Asian-inspired items, and even sculpture.  Her versatility is amazing.  Her teaching ability is wonderful, and through the many photographs we get to see her flawless craftmanship in action.  I was especially intrigued by her Brocade Technique and by a watercolor-y bead, done with alcohol-based inks and a rubber stamp of some handwriting.

Always breaking new ground, Kato gives us a collection of stylish, artistic and creative techniques.  She carefully explains each one, along with reasons why she chose the materials she used.  She includes work from other artists as well, making this a well-rounded and extremely useful book.  It doesn't get any better than this!",5.0
I recommend this book highly. It's for the most advanced as well the mostly beginner polymer clay artist.  Definitley a keeper. I routinely order lots of books on polymer clay and donate most to the library...,5.0
"I reviewed this book at a bookstore before I bought it.  Wonderful book.  I couldn't put it down, I had to read through it from front to back and again in certain areas that interested me more....",5.0
"To be honest I was a  little disapointed by Donna Kato's first polymer clay book, but this one makes up for that, and then some!
It is about 50/50 techniques and projects and covers everything in great detail.  The projects are really interesting and different for anything I've seen before.  The finished items look really professional and prove that polymer clay can be pretty amazing when in the right hands. I would strongly recommend that anyone into polymer clay get this book.",5.0
"If your looking to do something different with your polymer clay, then this is the book for you.  I love all the different methods Donna Kato talks aout, and she writes so well, it is so easy to read, and she makes you feel like it is the easist thing in the world.  I love just looking at the images in this book as well.  The only thing I would say I don't like about this is book, is that several of the projects are japanease style, but this doesn't make any difference bcuase you can create whatever designs you want to.  If you thinking about a polymer clay book-to extend your knowledge then don't hestiate to buy this one!",5.0
"You get to know how to, to all the things the title of this page says but most of the projects are to make pendants, if you looking to make a lot of beads projects get "" Making Polymer Clay Beads: Step-by-Step Techniques for Creating Beautiful Ornamental Beads by Carol Blackburn "" as complement to this book, I think you gonna learn a lot out of this two books to start making polymer clay jewelry or whatever.",5.0
"I just started working with polymer clay a few weeks ago and wanted a book that logically explains techniques as well as offering good photography.  Being a librarian and fiber artist, I HAVE to have my own library of art/craft books for reference and inspiration. Kato's is one of the best I have for any media.  It's well written and organized and the photos are inspiring.  I highly recommend this book for any polymer clay artist or library wanting to add a high quality book to a crafts collection.",5.0
This book is so well done with instructions that are easily followed. It opens the creative channels and encourages you to explore and take things to the next step. Donna Kato is so sharing and giving and an inspiring artist. This is a valuable addition to your library.,5.0
"I am admittedly still a beginner, only claying for the last year. I learned so much about little things I had not known from finishing techniques to folding clay that the time saving alone was worth it! Coupled with the amazing techniques found without I should have enough knowledge to create some beautiful items, amazing book!",5.0
"This is a must for anyone who is into Polymer Clay...! Tons of new techniques and tips to make all your projects outstanding..!
Donna's done it again..!!",5.0
"Donna Kato has done it again!  Her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay, published in 1997, is still a valuable source of information but now
she has written another that is also a beautiful, informative, visual gem.  This one is full of surface effects including methods of transfers for toner and inkjet prints, stamps, stencils, inks and paints, liquid clays and more.  Each technique has a step by step tutorial with clear photographs and text. The finished pieces are all enhanced by outstanding design as well as craftsmanship.
A great book by a truly talented artist.  It has been well worth the wait.

"With this long-awaited book, Donna Kato has deservedly earned the title of the ""queen of polymer clay"".  This is a wonderfully well-written, and beautifully photographed reference for both beginners and established polymer afficionados. Donna's mastery of this medium is unrivaled and so is her generosity when it comes to sharing her knowledge. There is inspiration on every page of this book and countless techniques that will lead you on an amazing creative journey that starts the moment you open it.  Enjoy the ride!

"Here's the review I also have posted on my blog, Polymer Clay Review [...]

Yes, another 5-star book. Are there books I don't like as much? Yes. Have those been published lately? No.

It has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I've taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna's class-and I haven't looked back.

Donna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.

Donna splits the book into seven different sections:

  * Polymer Clay Basics
  * Mica Shift Techniques
  * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay
  * Creating Texture
  * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders
  * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays
  * Sculpture and Mold Making

I love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.

The twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.

Peppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my ""Donnelly's Sampler"" is included in the book.

This is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library. I love having a Donna class on my shelf, ready for me at any time.",5.0
"This book is more like a ""Polymer Clay Bible"".  I've been working with Polymer Clay for 2-3 years and have several books.  This one is by far the best I've read.  There are so many techniques that were new to me and her explanations are so thorough.  The step-by-step pictures are beautiful and all of my questions were answered.  The tools, cutters, paints, clays, etc. she uses are all identified and easily obtainable. The pictures of her amazing art and those of many other artists are beautiful and so inspiring.  This is definitely a book that every PC enthusiast will want in their library. It's one you will refer to over and over again for both inspiration and pleasure.",5.0
this book is outstanding for both beginner and advanced polymer clay artists.  there are many wonderful techniques to learn and utilize in your own projects.,5.0
"Donna Kato is a perfectionist and a wonderful teacher.  She is generous with her expertise and ""secrets"" of this craft form.  This book is so well put together that experienced clay artists will find much to inspire them and refine their art, while beginners will learn quickly and develop their craft.  Donna's style is elegant and adventurous, rarely ""cute"", and the final products, as she makes them, are worthy of high end jewelry stores and craft galleries. But she makes the techniques so accessible that I think even novices will produce something to be proud of.  In addition to a beginning section on all the basics of working with clay, the actual projects include details for finishing and refining them so that they don't have that ""homemade"" look.  Even if you're just a dabbler in this field (like me), you will appreciate the beauty of the book and the level of instruction.  It inspires you to think that, if you really took the time, you could make something this wonderful, too!",5.0
"This long awaited book sure lives up to (and even exceeds!) what we'd expect from Donna Kato!  The book is meticulously and concisely written and photographed, and the projects are simply _gorgeous_!  Each unique and classy technique is more intriguing than the last....every turn of the page brings added excitement about trying out her projects.  Donna's writing style and the formulation of the book are reader/clayer friendly, and the instructions so clear and easy to follow.  I'm fairly picky about polymer clay books, and this one definitely ranks at the very top of my collection.  In this book, Donna shares with readers her unbelievably unique, creative and stunningly beautiful techniques and shares her vast knowledge.  Even this avowed 'caner' is excited about trying the many surface techniques from this book (steering me away from caning isn't easy to do!). I highly recommend that clayers from beginner to advanced add this latest of Donna's books to their libraries.  I don't think I can praise it highly enough! It's a beautiful book...a 'classic'.",5.0
"I've worked with polymer clay for over fifteen years.  I have almost every book every published on the subject.  This new offering by Donna Kato is concise, clear, beautifully researched and breathtakingly photographed.
We've waited a while for this book to appear and it has been worth the wait.  So many books on this subject offer great photography but confusing text.  This newest book offers the processes we've wanted to learn in terms that we can all manage - no matter our abilities!",5.0
I have been working with polymer clay for five years and have purchased many books but this is the best one ever.  It is a must for both beginners and experienced polymer clay enthusiasts.,5.0
"I bought this book when I knew next to nothing about quilting.(I could piece, and that was it!) I have learned so much from it, everything from how to choose fabrics that look well together to binding and finishing. The  book has a complete list of tools you will need, and step by step  instructions on piecing several differnt quilt blocks. It is complete from  start to finish.  I have a lot more confidence and I have actually finished  a quilt.  I refer to this book so often it is getting a bit dog eared. My  only regret is that my copy is not a hardcover.",5.0
"A friend of mine loaned me her copy of this book, and I am buying my own  because if I don't, she will never get hers back!  This book takes you step  by step, gradually but not insultingly so.  I like the way they include  both hand piecing and working on a sewing machine.  Also in this book are  interesting historical tidbits about quiltmaking.  I started out thinking I  would just read this to learn enough to teach my daughter to sew a little,  but this book is so inspiring and easy to follow, I am doing the projects  and learning to love it!  Whether you are just starting or have lots of  quiltmaking experience, this book is very helpful, interesting, and a great  resource.",5.0
"This was among my first books as a new quilter.  It's been excellent.  First, I like the hard-cover format, because it has spiral binding & I can leave it open to review as I work.  Simple, detailed instructions &  tips for each step of the quilting process, both machine & hand-work.  Includes easy-to-read charts for measuring fabric, speed-cutting &  piecing.  Gives detailed instructions for more advanced techniques.  Plenty  of projects, from simple blocks, wall-hangings & quilts.  I'll continue  to refer to this book for years!",5.0
"I have found this book to be absolutely invaluable!  It was the first book I purchased when I began quilting, and though I have accumulated many books over the years, it is still the one I refer to most often.  It covers  patchwork and applique, piecing and quilting, choosing fabrics and design  basics, and a multitude of other invaluable information.",5.0
I didn't know anything about quilting till I bought this book it has taught everything I need to know. Very good book for a begginer and even an experienced quilter. The projects are easy to understand.,5.0
"If I could only recommend one book on quiltmaking this would be it! It covers all aspects from beginning to end and is appropriate for the novice as well as the beginner. I have referred to it over and over again. The illustrations and photographs are clear, concise and simple. All the fear and mystery of quilting has been replaced with fun. As a quilt teacher I can recommend this book with confidence. My only ""complaint"" is that I need another as I am wearing out my current one! What a wonderful gift for someone special.",5.0

It teaches techniques by making sample blocks, has useful tips highlighted, is so friendly, simply, easily put that even I believe I can follow along and make a quilt without reading an encyclopedia's worth of information.  This book has all the information, but it is so well put that it doesn't overwhelm you.  THIS IS THE BOOK FOR BEGINNERS AND EXPERTS ALIKE.  BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT. This is the book I will use to start my 20 yr old daughter's quilt, and have a reasonable expectation of finishing it quickly and beautifully.",5.0

"This is a good reference to keep on hand, and I like the way they introduce you to quilting and the different blocks. Instead of having you make several large quilts, they teach one or two techniques with a single block, then teach something else with the next block.  At the end, they combine the blocks into a sampler quilt and show different layouts for the same set of blocks. It will take practice to master the techniques, but you have some variety while you are learning and are introduced to new things before you get bored or frustrated.",5.0

There are a few areas (i.e., more pics or more detailed terminology) that you might need along the way.  I did want a little more info about machine quilting.  So, I just purchased one more book ""The Quilters VIsual Guide..."" to use as a second reference.  I paid $7 for a used book...including shipping.  It was ""brand new"" when I got it.

"This book is absolutely wonderful. Concepts are presented in a lesson format, teaching you to cut pieces, piece by hand and machine, draft templates, speed piece, paper piece, various styles of quilting (hand, machine, trapunto, and more), and much much more. If you work through the first few lessons, you'll have enough information and experience to tackle a fairly complex quilt. Working further into the book you'll learn techniques you never thought you'd care about... until you make your first quilt!

In fact, by the time you finish all the practice blocks, you'll have enough blocks for your own sampler quilt!

This book is definitely the first book you should buy if you're learning to quilt, like I am. I've already finished piecing my first quilt top, hae it basted to the batting and backing, and today I'll start quilting by hand. This is something I never thought would happen.

If you can only get ONE book on quilting, THIS IS THE ONE!!",5.0
"Quilter's complete guide is the first quilt book I ever got and it is just the best. It show you everything a new quilter need to know and has a step by step way of learning how to quilt, if you can not get to a class.

"I recently got interested in quilting and purchased this book. To my amazement it has all the basic information that you need to complete a quilt from beginning to end.

"I took this book out of the library a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to get my own copy.  Marianne Fons & Liz Porter have written a book that is even clear to me!  That's an accomplishment! Each quilt in the book starts with the invitation to make one block, in order to learn new techniques. When you've completed all these single blocks you can put them together and have quite an impressive quilt.  Instead of having one quilt pattern that you're comfortable with making, you have an entire repertoire!

These women are excellent teachers.  They include tips throughout the book. Many diagrams, many clear pictures illustrating the steps.  I can't say enough about this book. Whether you're a beginner or an accomplished quilter this book will be an excellent addition to your bookshelf.",5.0

It has lots of great information at the beginning about what supplies, types of fabric, choosing colors, and sewing tips.  Then the rest of the book is filled with patterns/designs and how to put a quilt together for each step.  If you only buy one book - this is it.  I found that you can get a lot of free patterns online so as long as you have a great reference book like this, any other books are just 'fluff'.",5.0

"One. of two, of my all time favorite books for quilt making, hands down. Liz and Marianne have created a book that will teach everyone some important skills. It sits inches away from my machine at all times. If I have a question I run to this book for the answers. The layout is fantastic. It starts out with a Quilt making Primer, which offers you everything you need to know about Tools, fabrics, and colors. You learn basic quilting skills and then move into direction for block drafting. Then it is onto borders, where you will find an important chart on how to calculate for borders. The book takes you through the step-by-step process of thinking, creating, making and finishing a quilt. Every step along the way there are two page classes on skills you can learn, to put into action the tricks they just taught. Then you move beyond basic patchwork to more intricate techniques. The patterns range from easy to more complicated and remove the risk element on new techniques while you learn different block construction skills.",5.0
These designs are new spins on traditional patterns.  Usually Fons and Porter use more than one color scheme so that the same design takes on different moods.  I subscribe to the authors magazine.  Each issue has some quilt that I must have.  Enjoy!,5.0
this is another great book from the gooseberry cookbook line.  i get these for the wife and she immediatly reads through them.  she writes down which recipe and/or craft she wants to do.  she just loves gooseberry,5.0
"The book was exactly as promised.  I have the series, but was missing this one.  Thanks for completing my collection.",5.0
"Another cookbook from the set that is full of delicious recipes for Christmas and beyond.  These cookbooks are published annually and because the recipes are so down-home, even the early ones contain recipes that are still good for today.  The GP cookbooks never go out-of-date.  I love them.",5.0
"I have all the Christmas books now and many, many of the other cookbooks!  I have so many that the bookshelf is full!  But I will be passing some of these along to my daughter soon...too many to keep here!  She is a wonderful cook and a new mother so will find most of the recipes easy to prepare...Then someday, she will have them all if she wants them. I love the Gooseberry Patch cookbooks and illustrations in them,  The hints, ideas, and recipes are wonderful.  Have not tried one yet that has not been good!",5.0
i love anything gooseberry patch.  takes me back to when i was growing up.  plus i like to see what other people are making.,5.0
What's not to love about Gooseberry Patch.  The crafts are great and easy.  The recipes are also good.  Have the whole series.,5.0
"Service was excellent, and packaging was perfect. I'll continue to order from Amazon, and really apreciate the GR8 service, and products. My wife really enjoyed the Gooseberry Patch Christmas book number 13.",5.0
"This is book number 13 in a series by Gooseberry Patch folk with fantastic things to make and cook!!  Everything is fairly easy to make, and for a non-cooker, people rave about what cook out of these books!! I love all of these books, and look forward to book number 14!!",5.0
"I always appreciate how Gooseberry Patch offers beautiful and creative ideas that are also actually doable. Gooseberry Patch Christmas Book 13 is not just a recipe book, but it also offers craft and decor suggestions that are perfect for the holidays. Of course, there are stunning photos that show the completed dishes and projects, as well as lovely Christmas scenes indoors and out. There are fourteen sections with all kinds of festive holiday ideas, from open houses to woodland decor to casseroles and delicious blue ribbon cakes.

It also has lots of family favorites from their readers like Corn Casserole and Early Riser Breakfast Casserole or the holiday colored Cranberry Broccoli Salad. I was glad to see the chapter with treats that only use five to seven ingredients, like the Easiest Pumpkin Cupcakes with just five ingredients in it, plus the cream cheese frosting!

All of the crafts would make excellent gifts and have full instructions and templates in back, from the sewing kits and aprons to a coiled rag basket. I can't wait to start making the Snow Day Pillow that I saw in the Handmade Gift Area, with its adorable appliqued snowman and children making snow angels. And the Framed Button Tree is a perfect way to turn leftover buttons into a lovely decoration. I think it's really nice to have fun things for the kids to do while I'm cooking and getting ready for guests and they have a section for Fun and Games for the kids, with lots of good ideas, including an darling Turtle Tic Tac Toe Toss.

Gooseberry Patch really knows how to do Christmas and Gooseberry Patch Christmas Book 13 is no exception, with so many wonderful ideas to help me and my family have a warm and memorable holiday.",5.0

I'm going to get a bunch of these for Valentine's Day to give out! The packets are great to give to anyone at your church, homeless outreaches, orphanages, nursing homes etc.  In each packet/goody bag I put a Bible tract (I like the ""Somebody Loves You"" Bible tracts), candy and a bracelet that I make and maybe cookies or brownies that I make.  Go bless others today and buy these to share the gospel in a fun way!  Make some Jesus packet/Valentine goody bags for anyone and everyone you know!  ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."" Mt. 24:14.  Amen, come Lord Jesus come!

"I love this puppy book, it's really nicely illustrated and has plenty of room to add photos and information about special moments in your puppy's life. I just got my new puppy, and I can't wait to start adding to it. I love that it is a hardcover book, so it is durable and looks very nice.",5.0
"This book is a hardcover book, a little pricier than some of my 4 human kids baby books, but it has pointers about safety issues, purchasing items for a dog, etc.  There are pages to fill out about the parents of the dog and about the humans in the family that's adopting the puppy, a page for paw prints, place for filling out litter information, feeding information, personality of the litter, adoption dates and info, human playmates like kids, training info if you get a trainer, or a training class, doctor info, immunizations, weight and height, and many pages for photos of both Jewish and Christian holidays as well as neutral non-religious holidays.  It's 72 pages long, and has animal organization info like websites and address and phone numbers.  This is a great book to get before you even get the dog because you will be prompted to ask for more information than you got from the owners.  I can still call, but I don't want to be a pain asking for more.  I already had them email me photos of the parents, and they also sent me photos of the puppies at birth and one week and more.  There is plenty of room for all of this.  Book is 11"" by 9"".",5.0
"When my son suggested that i make a ""baby book"" for our puppy like the ones i had made for my children, i thought he was crazy. So i started looking for a book that in actuality, i didn't think existed. in my search, i came accross THE PUPPY BABY BOOK so i ordered it - when it arrived i was so excited, its a very user friendly book (even child friendly - my 8 year old fills out the info) and is styled exactly like a human baby book and all the information pertains only to dogs. this book is wonderful! If I adopted another dog i would definately purchase this book again. And I do think this book is a must if you truely love your pet like a baby to document all pertinent information.",5.0
"I am a new puppy owner, and like most, I am ABSOLUTE gelatin in her paws.  When I caught myself getting inordinately excited that my ""baby"" went up the three steps to the deck by herself at only seven weeks, I decided (to my infinite embarrassment) that I needed a puppy journal.  After searching diligently for about a week, and rejecting all of the silly, cartoonish and cheaply-made wire-bound variety journals, I stumbled across this utter gem.  The first thing that makes ""The Puppy Baby Book"" stand apart is the fact that it is an actual hard bound book.  This really IS something that will withstand the test of time.  The artwork is clean and understated so as not to take away from your photos or entries.  It is done in subtle hues with a definite art deco sensibility.  There are also several handy pockets inside for things like adoption papers, medical records and even your puppy's first rabies tag.  I couldn't be happier with the exceptional style and quality of this book.  I would particularly recommend it for pet owners with a sense of history and an appreciation of those classic breeds that were at the height of their popularity in the 20's and 30's (Boston Terriers, Greyhounds, Afghans, etc).  Finally, Three cheers for this and all those other struggling independent publishers out there.",5.0
This unique book is a must for that puppy lover in all of us. This chronicle of your puppy's life will become a treasured keepsake to cherish for years to come.,5.0

"I absolutely love this way of quilting.  It is so easy to figure out the different blocks and you can get so many various looks by just changing the way you cut the block.  Jodi has done a great thing here with her way of quilting.  If you are new to quilting I would recommend this book but also  her video.  It helps to watch her do the actual squares but once you have  the hang of it, it is no problem.  She is also very good of answering any  questions you might have by either phone or e-mail.",5.0

"If you are a serious rider looking for the best rides and roads, Butler is the map for you, I picked up one and looked at it while my bike was being serviced a couple weeks ago and was impressed by how much great stuff they packed into a manageable, tear-resistant, fold-up package. I'm a big GPS guy but there are times when you just want the ""big picture"" for orientation or for trip planning. I can sort out the best roads for my trip and then put them together in my GPS for a great single or multi-day ride.

I'm heading out on a ride in a couple of days and couldn't find the Butler map I needed anywhere I checked in my area. I contacted Butler customer service to see if they could point me to a source I may have missed. Butler came through for me in completely unexpected ways. Their customer service went above and beyond the call to ensure my trip came off without a navigational hitch. Outstanding product and exemplary customer service!",5.0

"This book is a treasure with something for every quilter to love, from the beginner to the experienced quilter.  The Farm Girl Sampler Quilt is shown on the front of the book.  There are  45 Farm Girl blocks + Barn and Tractor blocks.  Each block has it's own page with very clear directions for both 6""  block size and 12"" block size.  I especially liked the option for the 2 sizes of blocks.  Any one single block could be made into a whole quilt  --  there are numerous examples of Mix & Match Setting Quilts.  There are also ideas given for table runners, pot holders and wall hangings. The author has her own multiple fabric lines which would be very helpful for fabric selection.  I just discovered  Lori Holt's designs and I became an instant fan.  I like how she takes everyday items and turns them into darling blocks + giving such good directions for the reader to join in the fun.  This book is a great showcase for her style.",5.0

This book is different! All of the blocks are really cute and the instructions clear. I`ll be using this book many times for sure.
The fact that all of the block instructions are given in two sizes makes it even more useful.
The spiral binding makes it easy to use as well because the page opened will stay open and you can come back to the instructions any time during the cutting and sewing process.
VERY recommandable!",5.0
What a fun book!  Of course I'm going to make all the patterns in this book!!!  I do leave it out so when there is a few spare moments I have it right there to pull out my scraps of fabric and get to work.  Lori Holt writes fun and easy to do books....love her.,5.0

"This is a great book to add to your collection.  The quilt pattern(s) are charming with easy to follow directions.  I especially like pieced shapes (as opposed to appliqued shapes), and this book has instructions for many.  It is designed for retro fabric (is it called that or depression era . . . can't remember.), so if you are not attracted to that kind of fabric, it will be more challenging to select alternatives.

"I have only returned two books in my life, and this was one of them.

I purchased this book because the cover looked promising.  When I received it, I realized that these two little dogs were the only projects like that in the entire book.  As another reviewer also mentioned, the vast majority of the projects in this book are also for wet felters, not needle felters.

The real reason I returned it, though, was the truly horrible writing and directions.  I realize that this was written by a non-native English speaker, but could the publishing company not have tried to clean it up a bit before releasing it to the unsuspecting public?  I am already a fairly experienced needle felter, so I could have figured out how to do the (very few) needle felting projects on my own.  However, a true beginner would have been totally lost and would probably give up on the hobby as a result of this hideous book.

There are a lot of good needle felting resources out there.  I encourage the new felter to check out some other books and websites rather than buying this trash.",1.0
"I found the book just did not live up to my expectations. When will crafting books realize that photo transfers done with xerox machines hardly ever work as they are shown in books? The techniques of photo transfer, which is covered in this book as if it works, is really frustrating. Also, the use of translucent clays to good effect is iffy and the high polish acheived by the author on many of the pieces. I just couldn't get it to work.",1.0
"Have any of the 5 star reviewers actually used the instructions to cut fabric for a quilt? The directions for cutting setting triangles for an on-point set are WRONG. If you follow these instructions, as I did, you will get triangles that are too small! I had to replace several yards of very expensive fabric thanks to the bad directions.
The entire book is suspect now - I threw this POS in the trash. I am very disappointed that such well-respected quilters would give us a book with incorrect cutting directions.",1.0
"I was so excited to get this book; I have been a fan for a while and love the magazine. A complete resource, all in one place. I couldn't get it home fast enough.

The first thing I used it for was to cut the setting and corner triangles for a group of blocks that I was setting on point. I cut according to the instructions and sat down to sew. Waaaiiitt... they were ALL THE WRONG SIZE. Did I cut them wrong? I checked the instructions, nope, the instructions given in this book by well-known and admired authors to cut setting and corner triangles was WRONG.
Naturally I had used all but a few inches of that special color, long out of print, not available anywhere, that tied it all together. I adapted my plan and  finished the quilt, but not before tossing this book in the trash. I would not donate or sell this error-ridden piece of junk to someone else.",1.0

"Sorry, but I ordered 6 of these and two were substituted with red ones.  The four I received were great. Very disappointed since I needed and wanted six pink ones.",1.0
"I was excited to find this tool on sale at Amazon and was eager for it to arrive. Hugely disappointed! The caps won't stay on, especially on the stilleto side. This makes it a VERY DANGEROUS TOOL to have in your sewing kit. If you have children in your household, do not purchase this item. I am floored by the number of people who reported the problems with the caps, and still gave it a 5 star rating.

The other problem I have is that the glue used to keep the product stuck to the cardboard backing during shipping left a sticky residue. Removal leaves a stain. This product is made in China and I wonder just how much Alex was actually involved with it. I suspect it's her name that is used here, not her talents.",1.0
Broke in two week.,1.0
"The ""caps"" don't stay on well, and the ""presser"" isn't smooth.  I have also heard that they varnish came off on a fellow quilters piece when she was using the ""presser"" part.

It's a great idea... but it isn't made well.",1.0
"I ordered this ""tool"" because of it being suggested by the designers of a paper-piecing pattern I just bought.  Being a ""prime"" member, it was not sent in the time frame of that membership.  Then when I did receive it...the metal tip of the seam ripper was broken off and inside the wooden cap.  When I found that, the shaft of the whole seam ripper piece came right out as if not glued and/or secured in the handle.  I am returning this for a refund, I don't even want to mess with a replacement.  I also informed CT Publishing of the dissatisfaction with this product.  I would suggest not to purchase this as a ""real"" quilter's tool.  Not good quality.",1.0
"The quality of the 4-in-1 tool is poor. The wood is not finely finished, the caps refuse to stay on, the point and cutting surface of the seam ripper is not notably different than any other seam ripper on the market. Considering the price, you would do better to purchase a stiletto and seam ripper separately.",1.0
"about this tool!

I really was excited to find this tool. I was sure of the quality if Alex Anderson is involved and she won`t give her name for a bad buy. That was a mistake......

Well, the idea is really good, but the quality of the tool is horrible!
The lightly adhering caps drop away every time. So I can't put it in my sewing bag, because the risk of injury is high.

The wood has lots of indentions and the whole tool has a bad completition! Wasted money!",1.0
I was so happy to see this tool.  I thought it would be great but mine is already broken.  I put the wrong cap on the seam ripper and it broke off.  Both caps were very loose and kept falling off.,1.0
"There is no use in ordering an e-book with templates from Amazon/kindle, since you can't print from the e-book. And the hassle to get the templates from another site is a drag. Definitely not worth it.",1.0
I never order it so I can't review it. I don't know why is in my list of orders to review it.,1.0
This is not wrapping paper. Too thick and awkward to even consider wrapping anything in. It's a poster of a map. Waste of money. Description very  deceiving.,1.0
I thought this would be wrapping paper.  It was really just two maps.,1.0
Thick and hard to truly wrap a gift with. It looks nice but it's not true wrapping paper as I was expecting,1.0
"I ordered several sets/tins to decorate a suitcase and none of the stickers from these sets are sticking or staying on the surface. The other stickers I ordered, a book of old fashioned luggage stickers from a different brand stick well.",1.0
"The nicest thing about this item is the attractive tin the stickers come in. The stickers are also quite attractive, but they are also very small and don't stick very well. Also, there are many duplicates. I had hoped for the original quite large stickers that were common in the era of ocean liners. I wanted to decorate a steamer trunk I own.",1.0
I was excited to get theses stickers for my suitcase and for my guitar case. I wanted these to represent all the places I travelled to. I put many of them on and the next day almost all of them were on the floor. They failed to stick. Very disappointing product!!,1.0
"I didn't look into this purchase enough and if I was smart I would have returned it. I HATED IT! It is out of date and most of the bags looks like something that only a butch lesbian would carry arround. Nothing pretty or fashionable.
Think twice before going for this one. They did a great job at marketing, however the product stinks.",1.0
"If I'd had the chance to flip through this in the bookstore, I never would have bought it.  There are no diagrams or illustrations, the directions are confusing, and the bags are generally hideous.  (I would say that they were out of style, but virtually none of them could be said to have been stylish in any era.)  If you're tempted to buy it based on the other reviews, do yourself a favor and check it out at a library or bookstore first.  The (very) few tips it has to offer are better found elsewhere.",1.0
"50 designs from many people and most are UGLY.  That is quite an accomplishment.  The one on the cover is OK so you hope for the best if ordering site unseen.  The advice to check it out in library first makes sense-you'll never buy it if you do.

I also don't want to make a single bag in the whole book and  the instructions on the few I read through leave alot to be disired.",1.0
"I am not a picky person,I like lots of bags in all sizes and colors but this book is just terrible! The bags are not pretty at all! I can't even comment on the directions because there wasn't a singe purse in this book that interested me enough to even read the directions. This is one of those books that will sit on my shelf until I do a clean out and then it will be gone.",1.0
This book is not that great. It is the same purse pattern (fold over flap sack type bag) just has differant designs. Many are for people that crochet... I dont!! And it doesnt' even show how to crochet. What a waste of money... I sent it back!! I did read all the reviews and orederd it any way. Take heed... don't buy it!!,1.0
"Did not care for these designs.  They seemed to be lots of work and not good for practical wearing.  The designs are creative and look good on models, but I knew I would not wear any of them, so did not take on the work, and searching for the errata pages.",1.0
"A beautiful, but very frustrating book due to an abundance of errors. Buy it only if you have tons of time and money to burn from these errors. By the way, if I, an average knitter can easily discover these errors, how come the professional knitters and editors can't fix them prior to putting out their defective product? Not for a beginning knitter unless you want to turn them into an ex-knitter.",1.0
"I have been a fan of Norah Gaughan for many years.  I always looked forward to her designs in knitting periodicals. I have knit a few of her designs. The pictures are nice in this book and the concepts are interesting.  The designs leave me cold.  I also bought this book unseen, but with Norah's previous designs in mind.  I would send it back but it would cost me almost as much as I paid for the book in postage.  Let Dr. John C. Scotland knit and wear these designs. Almost if not all knitted designs are comprised with elememnts of math.  Many designers are inspired by nature and I am inspired by the designers.  Two very respected designers come immediately to mind, Meg Swansen and Alice Starmore. This book is the greatest disappointment in my huge knitting book library.  I have never written a review before this book inspired me to do so.  EBG",1.0
An expensive book with one or two pattern worth doing.  I agree 100% with Nancy. The title has nothing to do with the patterns.,1.0
"I bought this book, which I expected to be a beautiful revelation by a great knitter who was going to capture the wonder of natural forms in knitting (Norah Gaughan IS a great knitter - despite my opinion of this one book).  What I found was a very beautifully produced book that is filled with what I'll call ""nature knock-offs"": ""Let's see, star fish have 5 arms, that forms a pentagon, let's all knit pentagons and call that 'knitting nature'.""  Or, ""Honeycombs and other things are formed in hexagons - let's all knit hexagons!""  You get it.

Aside from the disappointment of discovering that a book is not really about what the title implies (photographing knitting outdoors does not make the knitting ""natural""), there is also the fact that the book designers desided that all the models should look depressed.  I know this is a current fashion trend, but in the context of a book that isn't doing what the title says it will do, and in the context of what are often designs that boringly repeat a chosen geometric form (I like geometry, but really . . . ), well looking at depressed, wan models did nothing to uplift the situation.

There are actually books out there that do what the title to this one promises but fails to deliver.  Anyone interested in really discovering how to look at nature and then create knitting that captures the living heart of natural forms should look at The Art of Knitting (why didn't Norah read this first?), Poetry in Stitches and Inspired Cable Knits.  Those books really have something to teach all of us.",1.0
Has anyone actually used these written instructions?  The stitch count is off on almost every lace row.  You have to work out the correct count before you can begin each row.  Something is terribly wrong here.,1.0
"I was disappointed in the book.  I purchased the book based on the quilt on the cover.  I am an experienced quilter but found nothing ""easy"" about the piecing techniques described. For me, using black netting to provide shadowing in not an acceptable method to use on a quilt either as a bed quilt (which this quilt is too small to be) or as a wallhanging.",1.0
"I don't understand how this item can be an ""updated 3rd edition"" and still have errors in the CMYK codes for the secondary colors of red and blue. Because of these errors the CMYK codes for the colors associated with them are also incorrect.

Red: True CMYK = 0, 100, 100, 0; Product CMYK =  0, 100, 50, 0

Blue: True CMYK = 100, 100, 0, 0; Product CMYK = 100, 50, 0, 0

A couple simple internet searches will confirm the correct CMYK codes for Red and Blue.",1.0
I purchased this item based on the reviews but as a graphic artist who depends on tools like this to provide accurate color information this is all wrong. I thought my settings in Photoshop were wrong and I went through everything only to find that this tool and its codes are inaccurate. Dont recommend this at all.,1.0
"I bought this product from Amazon, based on the strong user reviews. I was quite surprised to see what it proposes as ""Orange"" (Card #21). Please see my attached photo, which shows :
- this product's Card #21 (""Orange""), on top of
- the ""Pocket Color Tool"" showing a correct Orange reference hue, on top of
- a book with an orange color, on top of
- a book with a white cover.

The color mixing formula given on this product's Card #21 specifies the ""PURE"" Orange hue as CMYK (0,100,100,0). In other words, according to this product, orange pigment is an equal mix of pure magenta and pure yellow pigments. YouTube happens to have a video showing what happens when you mix these two primaries : you get Red! Please search on YouTube for the video called ""YELLOW + MAGENTA = RED""

If you Google the phrase ""orange color"", the results page has a sidebar showing example swatches and images. None of these match what the 3-in-1 Color Tool presents as Orange. Neither do any of the examples shown in the Wikipedia entry ""Orange (colour)"". According to the Wiki page, Orange is CMYK (0,50,100,0) -- i.e. 50% Magenta pigment plus 100% Yellow pigment. So this product's Card #21 is off in both the hue and the CMYK values for Orange.

All of the above is simply technical justification in support of the obvious: the 3-in-1 Color Tool presents Red as Orange. Another reviewer here has mentioned the same perception. For my part, I can't justify or recommend giving this product any further consideration. I will be returning it. Hopefully the publisher will reality-check everything and correct for version 4. (I am reviewing version 3) I have written to the company asking them about all this. If and when I hear back from them, I will update this review.",1.0

"Turns out, the meaning of TRI-colour listed in the description means triangular in shape, and NOT 3 colors per pencil, as the definition of tri-color connotates!!! So, if you are looking for a pencil with 3 colors and not one single color per pencil, then do not get these!!! I wonder if they sell tri-color ink cartridges that are triangular!!!
Because the wording of the item description is not correct and quite misleading, I am returning these pencils, as I have so many single colored pencils already...",1.0

"I LOVE moleskine products and have so many notebooks, I can't count. I even gave out mini moleksine notebooks at my wedding. This one disappoints, though. There is one small section for recording meals and the rest of the book is for vitamins, etc. - everything in a separate section. I'm not sure who designed this, but it doesn't have enough pages for actually tracking food in a food journal and as a user, I wouldn't flip back and forth between all of the sections to record info. I should have just purchased a Moleskine calendar.",1.0
"If you are looking for a 29-Day Food & Exercise Journal here ya go...

From the makers of the legendary Moleskin notebooks comes this glaring missed opportunity. There are far better Health Goal Journals out there. This one is a terrible disappointment.

Includes a 14Day section called ""Games/Sports."" 14Days? WTH? A 50(!!) entry section for ""Body Treatments."" So you can log all of your wraps and facials? All 50 of 'em that your'e gonna get within the 29Day Food & Exercise period. And, a 60 entry section to log all the vitamins and medications you are taking... Ummm Huh?

"I actually returned this.  Might do for the occasional movie-goer, but not for the serious, 52 films a year person like me.  Paper way too thin, hardly any room to write a critique, not lined, and who wants to put down a memorable line from each and every movie they see?  Or the title in the original language?  Came with all sorts of stickers, as if this were a grade school assignment.  Not for me.",1.0
"Although I love moleskine products, this product is something I do not find useful at all. This isn't a practical recipe journal.. There are a limited number of pages and a bunch of blank pages...",1.0
"The idea is wonderful but it has a lot of problems with it.  For one, the pages are way too thin, making it impossible to use pens without the ink bleeding through.  I've been using a pencil and colored pencils, but it's definitely a problem.  Second, the stickers they include aren't worth the price of this journal.  I was expecting better stickers.  The organization of this product makes sense in some sections, but is difficult to maneuver in other sections.  Other reviews have basically said it all.

All in all, I absolutely would not recommend this product.  Save your money.",1.0
"I've been happily using Moleskine notebooks and this is the first time I'm using a Passions Journal. I like the minimalist concept and the quality of paper. However, the alphabetized tabs of six review pages each seems more of a LIABILITY than an asset to me. Why? So far, I have already watched and reviewed five movies and my journal still feels and looks empty because they're scattered everywhere following the stringent alphabetization of the titles of the movies that you watch.

In other words, it doesn't make me feel like I had accomplished writing a lot of reviews as I would've if only I could write down my entries chronologically and see what I had written page after page. The alphabetization is a weak feature for me especially because in the back pages they already have blank index of the movies so why the alphabetized tabs especially when you can only review a limited number of six films under each letter?

To fill this journal with your valuable insights about the movies you watch, you got to watch movies with titles that you can equally distribute across twenty-six letters multiplied by rooms for six films. But the question is, what happens once you run out of room under certain tabs?

With an already efficient pagination and a blank index in the back, what's actually the great benefit of the limited alphabetized tabs?",1.0

Go Heat Transfer Paper for short.",1.0

What a piece of garbage. The Avery dark transfers go on beautifully and stay on beautifully too. I'll take that over something that won't even let go of its paper any day - the rest of these (after three attempts - I should have quit while I was ahead!) go in the trash, where they belong.",1.0

The ones that do fit work well. There were less than 5% that were obviously broken or cracked. I strongly recommend considering another brand. Not sure who's making these for PC, but they simply need better QC to ensure that this high a percentage of defective units aren't going to the customer.",1.0
"I bought two of these glue guns, and on both of them the trigger failed within aprox. 8 hours of use.  Once the trigger fails, the glue gun will not heat up.  They are junk and you would be wasting your money if you  bought one.",1.0
"You would think buying one of the more expensive glue guns would get you your money's worth. Not always the case.

I've been using a glue gun since the sixth gradeso I know how to use a glue gun. It's one of the most amazing tools a creative person can have and use. Since that original gun was lost over the years I thought it would be good to buy a ""professional grade"" glue gun. Yes, this looks big and nice and well made, but if only it worked the same. The yellow glue that is supposed to go with this drips out of the nozzle like it's leaking; it's almost impossible to control the output. Then in under a month's time I was pushing glue into it and somehow the glue stick is now stuck. I can't push the glue stick in, or pull the glue stick out. It's now unusable and trashed.

If you're doing crafts, I'd recommend a *mini* glue gun. But if you need a dual-melt gun for delicate gluing get something else. For now I'll stick with cheaper mini glue guns that just work.",1.0
"I bought this gun mainly for it's interchangeable nozzles. However, when it arrived, it turned out that the default nozzle was almost impossible to remove, due to a faulty thread in the gun itself, In removing the nozzle, the thread was stripped, so that none of the nozzles now can screw on!!
Gun itself may be OK, - I don't know, since it became useless only a few minutes after I received it!
Wouldn't buy another unless the thread was checked and found to be OK.",1.0
"I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this -- like some others, the gun never dispersed a drop of glue. I heated until smoking and smelling. No glue.

I first had issues with the tips staying screwed in place.  They would continually rotate while I was trying to work causing for my work to come out with less quality than desired. The second issue I had with the tip was that one broke off while inside the heating element.

I went to use the tool and it didn't alter the solder I had, so turned it off without using it at all. I bought solder which flows at a lower temperature however the next time I went to use the Versa Tip it wouldn't even turn on.

My reasoning for purchasing this despite negative reviews was I trusted the Dremel brand.",1.0
I agree with another customer review that this is not worth a crap. I too used mine twice for small projects and the tool broke off in the iron and no way to get it out.

"I purchased this specifically for the hot knife. After only 10 mins I noticed the base of the tip starting to bend at the threads. I was not misusing the knife or putting undue force on it. It snapped after less than 20 mins of use. The tip broke with part of the threads inside the tool, rendering it useless for anything else. The knife attachment could have been designed better and made out of better material that will stand up to heat. I was expecting more from the Dremel brand. Don't waste your time or money.",1.0

I have a couple of older woodburning tools that I use occasionally, but they were never high enough in wattage to get hot enough and would take forever to complete a project. So, I bought this one which worked great for two months. Now it doesn't heat at all. I would probably try a replacement of the same one with the idea that maybe this was just a lemon. But, if it happens again, I would never buy this product again.",1.0

"I bought this engraving dremel even though I have a general use one and it came a day later than it promised, thanks ""get it tomorrow..."" not. Also when i attached the tip to it it did not feel secure.

"installing the engraver point was impossible; not only did it require tools i didn't know were needed, but once acquired, the screw lining was so bad that the entire product is unusable now. i'd be happy to try again if sent a replacement; otherwise i would NOT recommend unless the appropriate tools are provided or the product documentation is updated to include this info.",1.0

"What was I thinking! There was a reason I hadn't bought a Dremel in years...they're cheaply made, so they fail often!
$16 for an engraver?  I should have known better.  The most important part of the tool, the system Dremel used to hold the cutting bit in place, failed. The little screw was never able to hold the bit, finally it stripped. So it failed without being able to perform a single operation. But really, I'm not surprised.  You'd think they would ""get it"" after all these year! Cheap price doesn't cut it if it doesn't work, and when the bit cannot be held properly, the tool does not work!

"Pretty bad, especially coming from Dremel, which usually makes high quality tools. This engraver, however, is rather weak and hard to use. Worse, the tip constantly flies out and must be put back in again, and again, and again. You really need a tiny eyeglass screwdriver to be able to put the bit back in.

"Who knows if it works, didn't come with a screwdriver so you can use the tip. The screw and screw hole are much smaller than anything I have. So be careful unless you have that.",1.0
"i did not recieve the number template or carbide point with this, even though the packaging and description clearly state that is included. i cannot use.",1.0
Template does not fit the tip. So nothing can be done. Horrible and inadequate instructions.,1.0
Faulty plug. Cant connect tu electric socket.,1.0
"It would be nice if it came with a screwdriver that would fit the screw you need to loosen, tighten. This thing is completely useless without one. Now I have to make a special trip to the store. Sucks!!!",1.0
"It came without the actual spare part that goes on the tip, can't use it",1.0
"Didn't even work, and since there are no safeguards for online shoppers, all I can do is this.",1.0
"My bit wasn't included.  I tried to open up the area to put the bit, thinking it was hiding there, but no bit :(",1.0
This is not as easy to use as described. I have not been successful engraving since my purchase.,1.0
No,1.0
There were no letters included. Had to purchase separately.,1.0
This product is very loud. I could not use it at home because it annoyed everyone. I will have to purchase another one that does not make much noise.,1.0
"Read the negative reviews before you purchase. I got this tool tonight with additional engraving tips. I was excited to try out the other ones and after 2 changes, the screw that is supposed to hold in the tip, won't hold anything in any more. Not to mention the pain of trying to find a small enough screwdriver to get the screw out to begin with. I have a note into Dremel since all the packaging says to contact them instead of the seller... so we'll see what they do about it. But I'd advise a shopper to keep searching to avoid the headache or disappointment factor.",1.0
Do yourself a favor and get a better dremel,1.0
I haven't been able to use it. It vibrates too much and it's too noisy.,1.0
Does not work!!!!  should of known for the money. calling amazon ..,1.0
"Tried and tried to unscrew it, so could put a blade into it.  Never could, so gave up.  And then just got a small
hand held one that works even better.  Also looked cheaply made.",1.0
"My first engraver blew & the first time I tried to use the replacement, within 30 seconds it started smoking  would probably have blown again if I hadn't stopped using it. Maybe I expected it to be able to do more than it can",1.0
"Poorly designed and manufactured. I had a red Wen engraver for years and will be looking for another tomorrow when I return this. The Achilles heal of this tool is the the design where the bit is supposed to sit in a round shaft at the top of the tool and be held in place by a set screw. First of all, Dremel has purposely not pre-installed the bit, so unneccessary, vexing assembly is required. Rather than use a set screw that takes a hex wrench and provide you with the tool, as is often the case, Dremel has chosen to use a slotted set screw that requires a tiny screwdriver, such as from a jewelers screwdriver set which you will need to own or purchase. A hex wrench would allow you to get much greater traction and it's easy to see that the set screw head will wear quickly. Repeated attempts to tighten the set screw enough that the bit would not fall out failed, so I carefully took the tiny set screw all the way out. to inspect the bit holder When placing the bit in, only the tiniest sliver of its surface area extends into the place where the set screw can make contact. There's just no way this thing will work the way it's supposed to. Save your time, money and sanity and get another engraver. (If not, better keep your receipt.) This is one of the worst tools I have ever dealt with. I have loved Dremel's mini tools in the past, but this one will cause me to think twice (and read reviews) before buying Dremel again.",1.0
SOMETHING GOING ON WITH DREMEL I THINK.  My first Dremel engraver was fine.  Had to get another and that one died within a week.  Looking for another good engraver.,1.0
"Very unsatisfied with this product. Bought this Dremel engraver about one year ago. Worked fine for six months then started shorting-out. Limped it along for several more months until the short become so bad that it quit working entirely. I thought it was just a fluke that it had a short. So I bought another one. Used it once for about three minutes and it worked fine. Just went to use it again and it's not working. Makes a soft buzzing noise, but will not engrave. Very frustrating! Sending this one back and will never buy a Dremel engarver again!",1.0
"Utterly terrible. As a beginner engraver I was really excited to use this product for glass engraving - for which it is highly recommended. Strangely though I had a total of ten minutes in which to use it. I first put it on for five minutes and it caused the glass I was working with to become unbearably hot. I now know that that is NOT NORMAL with electric engravers. I tried it a second time two days later. It sparked, flashed and SMOKED within five minutes of being used once again. The entire handheld region registered at 50 degrees Celsius (according to my turkey cooking temperature gauge). Thankfully I bought another gun for half the price at my local hardware store and it works a gem.
As to the Dremel, it's utterly terrible and I will never buy one again.",1.0
"Bought 11/20/2014. Used the tool only twice, once for a light engraving project, a second time to sand (catching tiny links on a medical bracelet). Today, I wanted to do a little more sanding on my bracelet as some links still catch clothing a little, but the tool no longer works. I submitted the registration today and sent an email to Dremel. I am awaiting to hear what they propose but  their customer service doesn't work week-ends (which doesn't work well for my hobby schedule...). I might change this review depending on how the manufacturer resolves the issue, how fast, and if I end up with a product that actually works or with a refund.",1.0
I do not recommend this product it sucks,1.0
"The bit is only held in place by a tiny screw that was lost while inserting the point. The tool is useless without the screw, will not buy this brand again.",1.0
I'm sorry to say I don't like it and it didn't hold the drill bit in place.,1.0
"I bought this at my local hardware store so I can't comment on the customer service, just the tool. There is a small screw that you remove, insert the tip, and tighten the screw that acts as a clamp to hold the tip in place. After removing the screw completely, the tip would not go all the way into the chamber. It stopped just above where the screw goes. I could see into the hole where the screw goes that the tip would not go any further. I ended up returning the tool. I think this was a fluke because I can't find anything similar in the reviews here, but it meant that I couldn't even use the tool. Bummer.",1.0
"I have tried for over 2 hours to get the bit installed.  I followed the directions, and this should be a very simple task.  I am wondering if I got a dud whose hole is not big enough for the bit since it barely goes in.  I have tightened, loosened, removed, tightened again the set screw with no luck.  Bits will not stay in.  Can anybody help me with this issue??  Please!!",1.0
You have to have an absolute steady hand to use this. Its almost impossible to write with clearly. You can see it but it may not turn out the way you intend,1.0
I AM A EUROPEAN CUSTOMER AND THE UNIT SUPPLIED WAS 110 VOLT AND NEEDED A TRANSFORMER. I PLUGGED IT IN WITHOUT CHECKING AND IT BURNT OUT INSTANTLY. I EMAILED THE SUPPLIER AND GOT NO SATISFACTION. I BOUGHT TWO OTHERS FROM ANOTHER WEB SITE AND THEY WORK PERFECTLY. I WONT BE USING AMAZON AGAIN TO PURCHASE ELECTRICAL GOODS.,1.0
"Upon opening package, found one engraving bit, but there was no tool to tighten this bit to chuck. One is forced to buy optional accessory kit, Dealer uses Nickel & Dime spending sales tactics.",1.0
"Cannot take higher voltage inputs, only 120V other wise you will burn the motor like me. Make sure to get one that supports the right Voltage",1.0
"Purchased this dremel to sign artisan jewelry pieces.  The screw that you are suppose loosen, insert engraving tip and then tighten is so tiny.  I spent hours trying to find my tools used for watches to find a screw driver head small enough, and once I found a correct tool, it still would not tighten.  Unusable, and am returning.  It also stated that a replacement tip was included....not in my purchase.",1.0
"Like other reviewers, I opened the package, installed the engraving tip, turned the set screw and promptly stripped the threads.  What a piece!  All Dremel had to do was upgrade one part of the housing material to a harder grade of metal, and this wouldn't happen.  I guess this helps explain the low price.  I like Dremel products, but this is a swing and a miss.  Look elsewhere.",1.0
"I bought this in May but hadn't had the opportunity to use it until now.  After about 1 hour of use and changing the bit only once, the threads for the set screw stripped and now this is unusable.  I just logged in to return this useless, poor quality tool, only to find out there was only a 4 week return window - unbelievable.  Very unhappy customer.",1.0
now i have to buy a tip because mine never came with one when advertised a tip to be included,1.0
Engraved one number on 6 keys with a diamond stylus.  Tool completely quit working after that.  It is now in the trashcan.,1.0

"Ordered this for my husband for Christmas. He opened it, and the piece on the tip that holds the actual carving tip parts is shoved in backwards meaning the thumbscrew cannot hold the tips in place. Very disappointed, especially since the only way I could get this product was to order it since we are stationed overseas. It will be such a pain to return this....",1.0
"I bought a Dremel 290-1 at Home Depot. I turned it on and the motor sounded like a 747 landed on my roof. With its carbide steel engraving point I tried it on wood and bone, but it barely made a scratch. So I order a diamond point bit from Amazon and tried again but without success. After I screwed up a few of my valuable a few days later... I gave up and start shopping for a new tool!",1.0
"There isn't really much to the story I have for this product, because I didn't even get a chance to fully use it.

Took it out of the packaging and followed the instructions. There's a small screw you're supposed to tighten in the head of the engraver that keeps the tip in place. Well, A) the screw was too big and B) the screwdriver required wouldn't tighten it anymore. Tried out the tool and not even three seconds after starting an engraving the tip fell out. Tried it three more times, and each time it kept happening.

I love Dremels, but I hate this product. Worthless.",1.0
"My girlfriend purchased this engraver for me right before we moved 2 months ago.  I've been very excited to engrave glasses and finally found time to use it tonight.  HOW THE HECK ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FIND A FLAT HEAD SMALL ENOUGH TO ADJUST THE SCREW?  I have TWO tool boxes, tried tweezers, a ulti key even, other household items, NOTHING.  A tool should have been included to adjust the screw or the design should have been different.  This experince was ridiculous and very disappointing.  Would return the engraver if I could.  the engraver was purchased under emilycannon86",1.0

"My daughter bought this engraver two months ago and kept it to send it to me as a gift now. When I opened the package the engraver point (9924 carbide point) was missing. I could read from other reviews that this is not the first time!
I can't return the item (they have a ""special"" return policy for this product).
I can't find a way of contacting the seller in the Amazon site.
The only thing I can do, if I am to use this engraver, is to buy the engraver point which should have been sent to me.
Very frustrating.",1.0
Wouldn't know whether it works or not because the package had no engraver tip. I'm not in the mood for 100 bucks worth of time and hassle with Amazon customer service to retrieve a 5 dollar item which I paid for and didn't receive in a sealed package. Somewhere there should be a bricks-and-mortar store which has the engraver point which I can still get before Christmas.,1.0
"It arrived 99.9 % assembled except for the major part- The engraving bit. To assemble it you need to loosen one of the smallest screws I have ever seen, Insert the bit and then tighten. No tool to loosen this small screw was supplied. So sadly instead of being able to use it from the package I need to head to the depot to find the world's smallest screw driver. I don't have one that small in the tool box. Rated 1 for this inconvenience.",1.0

Awl arrived with the handle broken away from the shaft.  Not repairable.  Poor quality,1.0
Not for book binding.  Point big and dull.,1.0
This little item fell apart before I even used it.  The metal collar piece ( attached at the wood neck) fell off as I removed it from the package.  Guess I shall drive the 32 miles to the nearest Harbor Freight and get one tomorrow.  I do not recommend this product.,1.0
Been using this model for years.  Evidently they moved their manufacturing to india.  This tool snapped after 2 days.  Still using the one I bought several years ago.,1.0
I bought this to do book binding but it's HUGE for that so I haven't actually used it because I don't want a hole this bit. It does seem to be good quality and it's SUPER sharp (it poked right through the protector that comes on it) so depending on what you're needing it for it may work perfectly. If you want it for bookbinding this is not the one for you!,1.0
I was very upset with this sadly. The handle has a deep crack running along its length. There is chipping on the metal point making it looking like it  was jammed into something and then put back into its packaging. The Rubber tip protector was just lying besides the point not even covering it before I had even opened it. I do not recommend this product at all. Ill add a photo later on showing the damage.,1.0
"This was a terrible purchase. First of all, the picture shows a very narrow point that gradually slopes, which is perfect for bookmaking (what I bought it for). I got a straight shaft that only slopes to a point in the last 1/4 inch and is just way too big for anything I'd need it for. Not like the picture at all.

If all of this sounds too particular, I should also mention that it came with a rubber tip protector, and the entire point under said protector was absolutely rusted out. It was too cheap to bother returning.",1.0
"This awl is a piece of s***. Don't buy it and don't be lured by the add-on deal. First of all, if you're using it to poke holes in metal (like hammering the top area lightly) the pointy end flattens immediately. The shiny metal you see is just a cheap coating and started chipping off immediately as well. Then, the metal cusp thing that's connected to the wooden head is cheap, after gripping the awl for a couple minutes the cheap glue connecting it to the wood came apart and the metal cusp fell off. Don't buy this piece of s*** awl, please. I'm trying to return mine.",1.0

"I did not like this awl, it really is not for book making you can use it to make holes in a belt but not for making books.",1.0
This awl is not tapered finely for piercing paper but has a short and stubby point at the end that has already ruined two books from a limited edition printing...which SUCKS! Save your money for a better tool- a friendly tip from one disappointed bookbinder :(,1.0
These shears arrived with no packaging and used! They looked super old and had nicks all over the handles and sticky stuff on the blades. Very disappointing and annoyed that it happened. I'd be very careful when you order. Sometimes you think you are buying something new (especially at full price) and you get something totally different.,1.0
"these are awful. just go with the oil based. they're sticky and not smooth at all. makes oil painting SO much harder than it has to be. sure, they're non-toxic but they aren't worth the hassle or the extra cost. no thanks",1.0
"Beware! Color might be off. My alizarin crimson came look weird so I purchased another single tube and here is the comparison. The bad one has an orange hue while the correct crimson is more pink. The difference is very subtle but it will have a more noticeable effect when you try to mix color. I am new to watercolor so I don't really know what cause the paint to be off. But it is really bothering me because crimson is a primary color and I use it all the time....
Also the description says it comes with a #5 brush but it actually came with #3 brush....
Otherwise the case is pretty convenient for me to bring to class and such.",1.0

"1) Goes on like sludge
 2) Does not cover well
 3) Took 5 days to dry
 4) The manual is misleading
  a) company told me NOT to mix the paints with water
  b) company told me water is only to clean brushes
  c) while the manual says you CAN mix it with regular oils, the company says the water in the paint will cause the layer to lift over time
  d) while the manual says you can apply regular oil paint over dry water mixable oils, the company told me that you can't or AGAIN, the layer will lift over time.
5) Even without water the colors do NOT mix well together on their own
6) THEY ARE NOT ODORLESS. After 8 days my house-- with windows open all day-- still STINKS.

 I had to get this stuff off my painting, the entire background done in browns, and was advised by another artist to sand it gently. I got most of it off. Some thick spots were still tacky after 7 days. I had to scrape them with a knife and the paint came off like a waxy crayon-like substance. I could see why it would lift from the feel of this waxy stuff. It would never really adhere especially with other layers of paint. I read the other reviews and I thought ""paid reviewers"" because nothing I read is what I experienced with this horrible, destructive product.",1.0

"I recently bought these water mixable oils and I'm sorry to say they are awful. I have always painted in oils, but hadn't painted in quite a few years so I bought fresh ones. I figured as long as I was buying new paints I might as well try these since they seemed like they would be way less toxic and smelly. Let me just say these paints are not good. At all. The first time I used them I hated what I painted and blamed it on being rusty since I hadn't painted in so long. Well, I just tried to paint with them again tonight and it's definitely not me. They are nearly impossible to mix (I tried the correct medium and tried plain water, both resulted in gloppy paint that never fully mixed), so if you can't get them to mix properly you can just imagine how hard they are to control on a canvas; you can't control them. Maybe if you are a super abstract artist who prefers gloppy, thick paint these will work for you, but I need my paint to be very smooth and easy to control. I'm so mad that I wasted my money on these.",1.0

this set does not provide nearly enough of the white and cream color (just 1 of each) and most of the colors need a mixture of one of these.

I didn't like it koi watercolour is way beTTER,1.0
Disapointed!!! I bought 2 based on reviews and reputation of the company and it was one of the worst watercolor art supply purchase so far. The color are so diluted with cheap fillers. I ended up using 1/4 of the pan just to get a decent depth of color for a wash and it was still light. The ugly graininess was super frustrating too. The cadmium yellow was like more light lemon yellow. This set may be cheap but not a value since I would go through it in 3 paintings. If I had used this when learning to watercolor painting I would have gave up. I would not recommend this to anyone! You cant give it to a child either because the colors are toxic.,1.0

If I had used this when learning to watercolor painting I would have gave up. I would not recommend this to anyone!,1.0
"This set is much smaller than I expected. The tiny pads of paint are seriously smaller than my thumbnail. They measure about 5."" x .3"" and are so small that if you're using a wide brush, you are guaranteed to get paint from the next pad on the brush. The entire boxed set measures 10"" x 5"" - much smaller than expected. It took me almost 2 hours to pop out all of the paint, unwrap and organize them. The printed color chart that comes included in this set of 24 is actually a color chart for the set of 40, so none of the colors correspond. For such a pricey set, I really expected a lot more and am seriously dissappointed. Wish I'd opted for the Full pad set rather than the half pad set. Live and learn.",1.0
"i thought this looked like the perfect way to get some fairly good quality watercolors in a very small, watertight case.

i don't like most of the colors and the pans are so small you'd need to use a size 0 brush to use in this box without mixing one pan with it's neighbors. that ruined it for me.

but the very worst thing is how difficult it is to open the case. i thought it was broken at first, because i had to use so much force to open it. i ended up hurting my fingers when i kept trying to open it.

who wants to use a product that hurts them?!",1.0

"I bought it hoping to have a good mix of colors, it doesn't even have the primary colors like in the picture, it has 2 yellows that are pretty much the same, a green that's more blue than green and 2 shades of brown that are very similar which is not useful. This is not worth the price.",1.0
"Very poor quality manufacturing. That set itself is difficult to open. The cartridges are supposed to be removable but I've nearly torn out my finger tips and nails and they won't budge.

Overall the set feels poorly made and cheap. The paints don't look great either. Can't be sure of their quality because I couldn't test them: because I can't take them out!

This set has come highly recommended by experienced watercolorists. I think its price is pretty unbeatable. Worthwhile if you're on a tight budget and willing to put up with the poor quality. I'm returning it.",1.0

"Got my first X-Acto kit in 1959.  Been using their products ever since, as a licensed professional engineer and as a hobbyist.

Real disappointed with this latest purchase, though.  I really need the box for efficient storage, but the workmanship is so poor that I can't overlook it.

1) The top is warped ... leaves a gap at the front left corner 0.165"".
2) The top relief plate is held in by double side tape until you remove the cellophane wraper to get at the tools.  Now it rattles around loose in the box.
3) The thickness of the relief plates is so thin that the tools easily puncture them when removing and returning.
3) The quality of the clasp is so poor that it is not functional.  The center post is loosly held by the baseplate.  When the toggle is fully engaged, it clicks into place like a ratchet.  Requires two small screwdrivers to release it.

My letter to X-Acto about this remains unanswered.
Wow.  What a mess.",1.0
"Really disappointed in the overall quality of sets I received. I bought this thinking to use the best on my window film installations.

Sent this one back, the replacement set came brand new, sealed in plastic/cardboard... without the #2 holder with blade even in it. Other extra blades were not in place, bounced around. Sent back again. I cannot recommend this product due to such poor quality control.",1.0

"Terrible product from a once great company.

I ordered this set after losing my old Xacto handle.  I don't use these tools often but any hobbyist or tinkerer needs a set.  This product seemed to get pretty good reviews and I'm familiar with the Xacto brand for decades so went ahead and ordered it.

When the set showed up there was no confusion about it being the genuine article, it was in the same blister pack it would be in if it was hanging at the local office supply store.

As soon as I took it out of the package I started to become disappointed.  The tool handles were held in place in the wooden box by a very flimsy plastic clamshell which almost definitely will fall apart if you use the tools regularly.  You basically have to dump the whole insert out and then pop out the tool you want.  Completely unacceptable, especially considering how cheaply they make this stuff in China.  Same story with the knife blades.  They are held into a very thin and flimsy black plastic clamshell insert, you have to tip it out of the case and then pop the blade you want out of the back.  No chance at all you could cut your fingers while doing this.. no sir!

Final two insults.  The wooden box the set arrives with had a latch that didn't even work.  It wouldn't snap or lock into place keeping the lid shut.  I don't leave my tools out but the lid not closing limits where I can store the box without concern.  Then there's the tools themselves.  Cheap construction... very slight tarnishing on the very low grade steel used.  A real disappointment.

"Hi everyone
I've just come across this on my Amazon suggestions and thought id do my good deal for the day by imparting some advice (probebly more for beginners or people buying for presents) this really just isn't the thing to get, i bought a set of these when i first started out as an 'all in one' solution when i first started model making and quite frankly they aren't worth the time, price or effort. aside from quality issues, there are just better ways to buy knives and even though this may look like you get a great choice of blades and handles but quite frankly its almost a gimmick!
In my professional opinion, take the 16 (in the UK) you would waste on these and instead go buy yourself 3 vastly superior knifes that will cover you for almost every job (and you can probably buy a few replacement blades as well for the same price)!
1. a 3 scalpel with 10a surgical blades that you can buy online in bulk for really cheep (its the only type of blade you will almost ever need, their so sharp, cut almost everything and can be used for everything up from fine detail work to accurately cutting huge sheets of foamboard. you can sharpen them if you need to but there so cheep you can just bin them as you go) http://www.amazon.co.uk/Morton-scalpel-handle-No-10a-blades/dp/B004OIAVJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442961697&sr=8-1&keywords=10a+scalpel
2. a 'Stanley Knife' (i think their called that in the US aswell). these are the knives with the trapezoidal blades that slide in an out. dirt cheep, a good all rounder that you can get some power behind if you ever need to. not a lot to say about them but they are a must have (ou P.S, don't get any with a fancy sprung locking mechanism like the one 'forge steel' sells, they will fair on you, just a cheep simple screw together jobbe will do you fine)
3. finally and even this is a more specialised tool, get a box cutter (one of those knives with the long, expendable blades that you can break off when they dull). its certainly not an everyday tool and shouldn't be used for model making especially as they just arnt fine enough but if you ever need to slice through some thick material like foam or polystyrene they are a life saver! the one i currently have is a Stanley one (bright yellow plastic handle with the thicker gauge blades) was not an expensive buy but when i need it its there!

hope this helps anyone!!! good luck (and by the way, the case is crap, get retractable knives if you can if you cant (like the scalpel) get a scrap of leather or two and some duct tape and make a sheath! it will save you a lot of agro and if you then wrap it in the most hi-vis tape you can find you'll never lose your knives again)",1.0

"I had a set of Xacto knives that looked like this one for over 50 years.  I bought them when I was a boy, and built many model planes and boats, and the knives always performed beautifully.  Of course, I bought many, many replacement blades, particularly the classic #2 blade, but the handles lasted and lasted.

After a rather messy divorce, my trusty set of Xacto knives were ""misplaced"".  I  recently had need for knives like these, so I bought a new set.  What a disappointment!

The classic wooden box is now made of some cheap material with a thin veneer over it.  Instead of the fitted wood handle holders inside, there is now a cheap, thin plastic piece that doesn't fit properly.  The magnetic blade holder is, in theory at least, a potential improvement over the old style, but even that is so poorly made it might as well not be there.  The handles - the handles are just badly made.  The chucks don't tighten properly, the aluminum is poorly finished, and the plastic of the large handle has rough casting edges on it that make it very uncomfortable to use.  The blades that used to be the standard for knife edges are now cheaply stamped out, low quality, improperly heat treated, and poorly finished.  The edges are not as sharp as a good pocket knife, and they don't hold an edge like they used to.

Why?  Well, to me, the answer is in a small paper sticker on the box: ""Made in China.""  I understand the Xacto brand name is now owned by Elmer's Products, the maker of Elmer's glue.  Apparently when they bought the brand, they figured it would be cheaper to have the knives made in China and depend on the name they had built up over the previous decades to continue selling them.

I think, from now on, I will not buy anything made by Elmer's.",1.0
"Extremely dissapointed by the xacto handle, specifically the red handled fellow here, and would highly recommend handles from other manufacturers.

5/7/2014:  And I finally found a decent replacement: the Warren Cutlery line of handles and blades.  For $25 I received a decent wood handle with a brass collet, and a variety of useful sharp blades.  The xacto blades shown above will not fit, but some of the others do.  Perfect as a gift, or an upgrade to ones own hobby knife.",1.0
The only thing that is quality about this kit is the Price. In the kit I received the threads on the knife handles are smashed and would not tighten around the blade bases. All of the blades were packaged in a single plastic bag and arrived nicked and damaged. The injection molded plastic parts such as the plane and balsa stripper are useless and literally fall apart in your hand. The only redeeming factor about this kit is that it doesn't take up much room in the trash can.,1.0
"Everything about this product is cheap.  Very disappointed!  I looked at the # of stars on this product and unfortunately did not read the many, many bad reviews...the cheap box, cheap handles. I don't understand why this has 4 stars.  Even though it was a hassle, I returned it.  I suggest everyone that is disappointed with this product do the same.",1.0
"I was stunned Xacto would make such a crap product...I really was.  Basically, I needed a scripto knife, but was looking for a set that also came with a utility saw blade that this set has (no other sets really seem to have the same type).  I would be using the knife for a variety of projects, but once a year--when Halloween comes around--the little saw blade is the most amazing blade for carving (I had one when years ago but can't find it anymore).

At any rate, I ordered this set and it just blows.  I put the saw blade in the black handle and after two saws on a pumpkin, the handle base popped out of the metal blade attachment piece.  This shouldn't come out and isn't made to.  I now have to glue it in so it will hold.  This thing is such a pile of junk.  If I had a bomb and it was legal, I'd completely blow this set up.

Xacto, I now hate your company for producing such garbage!  You should change your name to Crap-Acto!",1.0
"I purchased this kit to get back into carving as i thought it would give me more options compared to the buck knife i used to carve with as a kid.  This thing is junk, the blades are very brital and thin, so quite easy to break; especially the longer ones.  On top of that it is a pain to put the blades in the handle.  The dangerous part us that once they are in the handle, it is a twist to lock the balde into place but the whole blade turns.  The twist lock does not stay tight no matter how hard you can hand tighten it so during short periods of whittling it losens and the blade rotates, sometimes toward your thumb.  Might work if you crank it down with pliers, but that just becomes a pain when you are trying to utilize the variety of blades.  To add, it is not in the slightest bit ergonmoic and is very uncomfortable to carve with. Dont buy this junk; stick with an old fashon folder or upgrade to the Flexcut if you absolutely MUST have a specialty knife.",1.0
If you're only using knives to carve this set is ok.  All the gouges were dull and almost impossible to sharpen.  Not worth the money,1.0
Cheap and nasty don't waste your money flimsy metal blades and a useless box where nothing stays in place rubbish.,1.0
"A waste of money. I wish to know better tools than those... Very small, not for carving wood, perhaps clay ...",1.0
"Just wanted to say that these chisels are junk. I pity someone who develops an interest in wood carving and starts out with this set. They are very poorly ground and as far as I can tell they are made of poor quality metal. I am a seasoned wood carver that can never have too many chisels and gouges. I thought if they were ground poorly, I could regrind them to make tools for special applications. However, the metal is soft, so there is no good reason to do anything with them. Compared to well known carving tools (Swiss Made, old Buck Brothers, etc.) and these are far softer. I question if they are hardened at all. New wood carvers would be far better off with one decent quality chisel than a whole set of these.

Disclaimer: I bought these from a seller on eBay for almost nothing, so I should not complain too much. However, I am writing this review to prevent people from being discouraged with wood carving.",1.0

"Years ago I  bought a set of wood carving tools to use for fairly complex and exacting woodcarving/pattern making; I loved the tools. Recently I decided to return to wood carving and  decided I wanted a set similar to the old ones I was used to. Save your money and don't buy these. The tools themselves were disappointing, They were obviously very cheaply made and the edge they came with was clearly something I would have to work hours on to get a mediocre edge at best.  I love Amazon as I returned these without any hassle. I almost never return anything, but these were junk. My recommendation is to spend a bit more and buy  something with quality. These tools will give  anyone nothing but trouble.",1.0
"20 years ago I owned the exact same set.  So when i wanted to get back into modeling I just ordered another one.

What a mistake.

The box and inserts are already falling apart.

The handles feel flimsy and poorly balanced and are slick
instead of textured like ""vintage"" xacto.

The handles do not seem to grip the blades all that securely.  I almost do not feel safe using them.

At least it has plenty of blades.

There are US manufactured hobby knives that do not cost much more than this junk and are much better quality.",1.0
"While seemingly a nice set, they don't hold up to use in even soft pine. I've snapped two blades with minimal pressure, and several of the rest don't want to stay locked into the twist mechanism of the handle. They continually slide out.

If this is American made, it's shameful. If it's Chinese made, it's typical.

Either way, I am very disappointed with the quality of the blades.

edit: 30 minutes later a 3rd blade has broken. This is absurd.",1.0
"This set was not worth the money. The blades were very weak, 2 of them broke wiithin the first few days and none of the blades fit in the handle right. Everytime I try to carve they come out.",1.0
"I can deal with the handles, but the factory edge is worthless. The burr on some edges makes it feel like carving with a spoon, not a knife. The bevel, such as it is, is so deeply corrugated by the 40-grit wheel that apparently sharpened it that I'll have to grind a lot off to get a truly straight edge on anything.

And then, I'll be down to the steel itself, and how it holds its edge - or doesn't, my hopes aren't up. I should have been more patient and waited for USPS to bring me a decent set of tools. But noooh, I wanted it right away. Serves me right.

"I used to have one of these knife sets years ago but lost it in a move.  It was made with pride in the USA.  Beautiful craftsmanship.  The item I got now is a sad, made in China (ofcourse) piece of garbage. The box is made if some unidentifable sort of plastic made to look somewhat like of wood.  The hinge pin is way too small allowing lots of slop in the lid as though the hinge screws were loose.  The lock ring is so rough it is very difficule to secure the blades. This was addressed at the factory by applying light oil to the threads.  That cure didn't work. The plastic inserts that hold the pieces are a joke. Distorted out of shape gripping the tools way too tightly.  The only good thing I can say is the blades are sharp.  Come on Elmer's, you can do better.  I would gladly pay twice the price for the original quality,",1.0
"JUNK THEY DID NOT COME CLOSE TO FITTING THE KNIFE, AND YES THEY WERE THE RIGHT TYPE.
JUST POORLY MANUFACTURED, I DON'T BELIEVE X-ACTO MADE THEM",1.0
"Although the correct size for my instrument, not all of the blades in the package fit it.  Not worth the hassle to return, but very disappointing.  I actually wondered if this item might be counterfeit,  not actually X-Acto.",1.0
"It doesnt carve wood blocks really at all. I used a rotary tool instead, and it was so much better!",1.0
"I bought these for a print making class, used them once, wouldn't cut very soft thin wood without bending. I am returning it and hopefully finding something that will actually work.",1.0
"It is extremely bad product, Binding is too bad, pages started falling from binder on very first day.",1.0
These don't fit and super poor quality.  They do not allow returns,1.0
This is actually only 5 pages- thought it would be 10. Way over priced!,1.0
The size was not what was represented and didn't fit the album like it was supposed to.  I had to send it back.,1.0
"I bought these refill pages to add to a standard two-post album. The holes in these refills are cut for a custom size, not a standard two post. I ended up having to cut notches in the existing holes to get them to fit. The pages now look terrible.",1.0
I bought these refills last year hoping I could just slip my mother's old pages into it.  I did end up changing my mind and put those in another album but I wanted to use this one for something else.  I do not believe these refills received much wear and tear but now I've  found about half the pages have to be replaced because they have torn loose at the holes.  Needless to say I am NOT happy and very frustrated.  and I'm not sure I'll be able to find refills of this size anywhere else.,1.0
These do not fit 12X12 paper . You have to cut off about  1/8 of an inch of  to get it to fit. I was really unhappy with this purchase.,1.0
So not worth it. I regret this buy. I would get something else if I could do it over again.,1.0
This are listed as 2.4 ounce Value Size but they are infact .88 ounce the same as the normal size that is sold cheaper by other sellers,1.0
It doesn't stick. It was such a waste of money. I'm just going to have to throw it away.,1.0
This is double the cost of getting this at a craft store and nearly double of what it costs at other websites.  Total ripoff.,1.0
"Maybe it's because of the brand of album I was using, but these Pioneer inserts did not fit. Once I inserted them into the album (following the company's own instructions), a 12 x 12 sheet of paper would not fit in the sleeve without being bent. They do not have the extra half-inch between the sleeve and the holes, and this is necessary (otherwise part of the sleeve is covered by the binding of the album, and everything in the album gets bent when you flip through it). Although the packaging said it could be used with a post-style album, it's clear these are made only for 3-ring binders and nothing else.

It's a difficult issue to explain, so I hope this makes sense. I was told at Michael's that they would fit ""any 12 x 12 album,"" and this is simply not true. I also found the plastic to be very flimsy.",1.0
Sorry I bought two of these for even with a thick thorough application 8x10 photos separated from the mat board.  A waste of money!,1.0
So gross there were dead bloody bugs stuck to the papers,1.0
Purchased this item to do t-shirts printed the picture but paper wouldn't transfer image over to t-shirt.  Mercerdise was old recommended no one to purchase Amazon gave me $1.17 refund for this item,1.0
"Ordered this because I liked the older product (2012 on package).  November 2016 order of different quality, opposite of former.
Just opened one of the five packs I had ordered.
Photos don't come out sharply, more like water color, with long time for ink drying.  Will not order this again unless old quality can be guaranteed.",1.0
"bought at ac Moore ... To do a project for a client. Ive used other brands before and this is by far the most horrible brand ever. After following instructions to a T... The pictures lifted and some came off . I lost so much money . I will never use this brand again , nor would i recommend it to anyone else.",1.0
The worst transfers I have ever used. Had to buy new fabric and throw everything away and my house stunk for hours. Did not adhere completely when following instructions.. I had to iron less than one sheet for TWENTY MINUTES for it to adhere and it yellowed horribly and STILL tore up at the corners. Furious.,1.0
"I used the transfer on to a maroon shirt, the design had significant amounts of white and now the design has significant amounts of maroon. It could not have worked worse. So not only does the transfer not work as advertised, the shirt is ruined as well. Thanks so much, Printworks.",1.0
"I would give these 0 stars if I could.  I have used Jolene's transfers and had no issues, but I ruined a Christmas gift with these. Unlike Jolene's, which actually transfer the ink..... these leave a very cheap and plastic feeling transfer.  Sadly, as I said, I now have to spend MORE money and make a tie dye shirt all over again, buy the not crappy transfers and hope I can get it done in time.

Don't waste your money on these!",1.0
This product is aweful I followed instructions to the letter and the transfer came out yellow and started separating before I wore it. I wouldn't recomend at all.,1.0
The material was old and dry.  Not useful.  I would appreciate my money back in full.,1.0
"these wash off in a couple washes, no matter how closely you follow instructions.  If you really want to do this kind of thing, buy yourself a low cost heat press (iron won't cut it) and use appropriate heat transfer paper.",1.0
"We just got these and were hoping it would work on our dark shirts. The instructions say and I quote ""Cut out design: Trim your image as close to the edge of your printed design as possible. Any border will be WHITE on your fabric...

Now isn't that a normal WHITE T-Shirt Transfer!!!!

DON'T BUY!",1.0
didnt workat all i tried all sorts of ways and no good .i evean took it to the dry cleaners and blah,1.0
"Seems like a quality product at first, but when you load it in to the printer the edges curl up and do not properly feed. When the printing begins and ends the corners of the paper end up smudged. I was afraid it would get stuck! Not recommended for full page transfers, but may work better on smaller designs printed on the center on the page. I wasted a lot of precious ink on these!!!",1.0
"these did not work at all.  after application and ironing, they left a pattern on the fabric from decal not attaching fully or properly to the fabric.  tried all the sheets, no luck with any.  save your money, don't purchase",1.0
"Wow. These didn't work at all for me. After reading the rest of the comments, I feel like maybe I got a defective batch or something. Followed the directions to a T (haha) but the shirts I used (dark blue and green) completely swallowed up the ink-- you really could barely see that anything was ironed on there. I felt like I was using transfers for white shirts. (I wasn't. They were dark tshirt transfers, unless someone pulled the old switcharoo on me.) Guess I'll try a different brand. Pretty bummed about these.",1.0
What I need to do is print a few words and transfer those to dark colored t-shirts. Looks like this will work for shapes and you have to cut the shape and transfer it to the t-shirt like a sticker. It does not work for my purpose to transfer only what is printed. I imagine it would work well on white t-shirts since you would paste white on white.,1.0
"This really made me mad when I realized that whatever image or word you print, unless it is an identical match when folded in half, needs to be edited so that it's mirrored...not as easy as I thought it would be. Buy the brand Avery instead...

"This is the first review I've ever written for a product ever. I was prompted to do so because I think that this is worst product I've ever purchased. I have used avery t-shirt transfers for many years, they're not the greatest but they usually hold up to a couple months worth of washes. With this product I was pleased with the way the transfer printed and transferred and everything still would have been fine until I washed the shirt found the image disintegrated after 1 wash in cold water.  My many hours of work designing, printing, and ironing are all wasted not to mention the sad look on the face of the little boy I was making the t-shirts for. I will be returning this. For the few extra bucks you save it is not worth it, you will be sorry.",1.0
"I have made iron-on t-shirts for years with great success. Yes they do wear out fast if you use a washing machine. I only hand wash cold, inside out. I just used Printworks for the first time (they were on sale). It printed easy, ironed-on very nicely but when I washed it for the first time and let it air dry the graphic peeled off! I never had that happen before! Maybe it is bad quality paper, I don't know but won't buy it again.",1.0
"I was very disappointed in this product.
The printing looks good, but after ONE wash it begins to crack, flake, and fade.  I have used Avery product before and it did crack after several washing, but you can still see the iron-on pretty clearly.  This product didn't even last two washings...washed in cool water with the shirt turned inside out.
The iron-on process doesn't go smoothly either.  I had to iron for SO long to get the transfer made completely, that I ended up scorching a couple of them.
I would not recommend this product to anyone.",1.0
"NOT happy with this one - my three year old son and I tried to make the imprint of his hands in the gel mold this evening and it was nothing but a HUGE mess.  Instructions tell you to immediately put their hands/feet in the gel mold so it can form around their hand.  Sounded simple enough except for the fact that we sat there waiting and waiting with NO drying.  I can't blame my son, he got impatient with it and started sliding his hand and crinkling his fingers and all we had left was a slimy hand and a few dried pieces of gel in the mold.  I think that if we had waited for the gel to dry more it would have been better but you only have one chance to get it right and if you follow the directions it will be botched.

One Mothers Day present down the drain.  Sadly - it was the only one, I am VERY disappointed in this product.",1.0
"We purchased this craft to use a gift from my 8 month old daughter to her grandmother - what a joke!  After my baby was asleep we tried to ""imprint"" her foot (thinking that it would be easier than her hand) - the wait time for the gel to dry was well over 1 minute, and wouldn't you know - baby woke up and the whole thing was a huge mess.  The entire craft is now in the trash and we have nothing to show for our hellacious attempts.  DO NOT BUY unless your child is old enough to understand holding his or her hand still and can do this for more than a minute.",1.0
