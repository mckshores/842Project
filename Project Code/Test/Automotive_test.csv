"It's beautiful and blends right in with my wooden desk. If you like simple and elegant, this is for you. It stays in place on my desk nicely with the included pads installed. It's a phone stand, not really for charging your phone.",5.0
"I love this stand! I had been looking around for a phone case that would fit my phone and had a kickstand, but this was even better. Not only can you use your phone on this, but you can use tablets and most other devices as well. While the phones sit perfectly in the rack, the tablets would hang over a tad and may seem overpowering, but with the 4 grippers that came with it, it will hold it up perfectly. The grippers work really well in holding this stand steady so that your devices won't fall over because they are too heavy for this stand. I love this stand because it is hands free meaning I could pop a recipe up on my phone or tablet and be able to do everything it says without having to touch the device. I was given the opportunity to receive this stand for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.",5.0
"This is a very basic stand. I bought 2, one for my desk at work and one for my end table by the bed. It's inexpensive and does the only thing I need it to do, hold my phone up. When it's charging I turn it landscape.
Bought one for my husband and he is happy with it as well.",5.0

"I purchased this vacuum about two weeks ago, I was looking for nice, convenient, light and good suction vacuum for my car, this product perfectly meet all my requirements. When I received the product, it is even lighter than I expected which is very good for my wife to handle that. The manufacturer is very thoughtful, they give an extra filter and a nice carrier bag. The inside of my car becomes harder to clean when you have kids. There are a lot of food residue, confetti and hair hidden in the edge, corner and the inside of car-seat. It helps me with all these small messes. The power is good for a small and light vacuum.",5.0

"Good vacuum for cleaning car seat.
My young daughter loves having some snacks during driving. So a lot meshes or others fell on seat. Its hard to clean it all. This vacuum is really good to clean it. For quarters or small dirty things like hair or sands or soils, it works good.",5.0
"I bought this vacuum by mistake i wanted the 4th gen but after using it I like it.
I park my car in my backyard so its always leaves and debris on my shoes when I get inside.
I had to find a good strong vacuum. Again I like it, Its a vacuum it does the job well.

In these photos I started out with the brush attachment. This took me less than 1 minute. Then I added this second attachment that helped pick up all the little small sand type dirt that you can barely see.

I want to get a second for for my dad when possible.",5.0

"I bought this car vacuum cleaner, because I was tired of constantly bringing out my big one for just some crumbs. Since my son is a toddler the crumbs in the car are happening more often than I would like. The cord is long enough to reach to the trunk. The attachments are wonderful and I can finally get to spaces I was not able to get to before. I also love, and this was probably the main reason why I got this vacuum instead of another one is I can vacuum wet surfaces. The suction is great as well. Keeping my car clean just got so much easier. I'm very happy with my purchase!",5.0

It collects the embedded crumbs that are under the seat without too much noice. It came with several attachments and a bag for storage. And it looks good!",5.0
Works well for the price !,5.0
This vacuum works fairly well. Its not good for heavy cleanups unless you want to spend an hour vacuuming. The suction wasn't as great as going to a car wash but itll come in handy for the little cleanups. The cord was long enough so I could get all in my car and the trunk.,5.0
"Small size, large power,
Can handle damp and dry dirt.
Rope long enough to be placed in the car,
Easily sucked all corners of the dust.
Worth to start",5.0
"Since my boy began to hold cookie and eat by himself, I just prefer to hold a cleaner all the time, especially while on the vehicle. This machine is very useful to clean the carseat. It's very powerful even with such small size. This package is worth to try.",5.0
"Plugged into my car easily turned on, sucked up alot of the dirt. Easy to empty. Has many attachment and a nice carrying bag.",5.0
I love this little vacuum . For starters..this vacuum DOES fit in the bag. I attached a photo of mine showing how I place the items in the bag to get them to fit to help anyone out who may have problems with this bc I noticed on some reviews people say the stuff won't fit in the bag. The bag is small so you can't just throw everything in however you please or it won't fit. You gotta play Tetris with it and figure out how to fit it all just right. My picture shows the way I figured out how to place everything to get things to fit right and be able to zip the bag back up every time. So hopefully that will help future buyers. But this vacuum has worked great for maintaining cleanliness of my vehicle. Now my suv was destroyed inside . it was sooo dirty from months and months of dirt and dropped food pieces from the kids that we literally had to take a shop vac to it to get it cleaned or this little vacuum prob would have took forever to clean it. This little vacuum is not really made for super heavy duty jobs. Its more made to maintain keeping your vehicle clean after its already been heavy duty cleaned. But once I got the inside of my suv fully cleaned...I now use this once a week to go over the seats and carpets and dash area etc and it sucks up the dust and dirt in the carpets and seats etc just fine. My driver side floor gets pretty dirty after a week from dirt and it has no problems getting it clean. But like I said if your vehicle is very very dirty you may want to pull our your shop vac and save you some time and then just use this little guy once a week to keep it nice and clean. Great buy for the price for a simple vacuum to maintain vehicle interior cleanliness.,5.0
"I cannot believe I waited so long to get a vacuum for my car. I clean my car out often and I always use the vacuum at the car wash. This is convenient and does a good job. Love the attachments, too.",5.0

"powerful vacuum works well in sucking up the very fine dust ! Easy to use ,The cord is long enough for cleaning everywhere in my car.it comes with a bag to store it in. It's also have other functions like tire inflator pressure gauge and LED light .",5.0
"This upgrade to use, by the lamp, under the car seat corner places are now see clear, on the GROUPON bought a before, bad to use, no car battery line collocation, can only be charged at home electricity to get the car to use, and can't use how long the power went out.but this one the charging car with a lot of different small, very practical, I now put back directly, at any time",5.0
"So glad I bought this. Working very good! This package come with quit a few things,this car vacuum comes very well equipped ,with 2 filters,4 in 1 Hotor powerful Wet/Dry ,12V 100W,used one time and it is very easy use all around the car,is a great size to carry in the car!",5.0
"So glad I bought this. It comes with a bag and a few attachments. The bag is great because I just leave it in my car and it doesn't take up too much room.
It plugs into your car's cigarette lighter/socket (whatever you want to call it). And the cord is fascinatingly long for easy use all around the car. It has a light you can turn on if it's dark.
The attachments it comes with is:
- A slightly longer, skinner nozzle to reach difficult spots
- A very long stretchy, bendable hose to give it more length
- A small broom-like nozzle (I'm guessing to use on your dashboard or other areas)
- A replacement filter, which is so nice to have.
- The bag of course

All in all, its way easier to use than to go to a car wash.
I just had my car detailed a month ago and use this to keep up with the dirt/debris that gets left behind.",5.0
"I bought this vacuum to keep my car clean. The vacuum is very light, easy to use! It is powerful enough to suck out the dust! Grate product!",5.0
Must get for parents! We have two little ones and every time we get them in the car we have to make sure to bring lots of snacks. The problem with having little ones is that half the time the snacks falls to the floor and the other half lands in their car seat. So any parent should really have something like this so they can keep their car in a reasonable condition. It comes with a cord so you can vacuum underneath the driver and passenger seats and you can charge it with the cigarette lighter in the car. The only thing I wish is that it has a stronger suction but still not bad at all.,5.0
The vacuum works great and easy to use. It doesn't take large space in my car.,5.0

"I had this listed on my wish list for several months  before I finally bought it. I lose my keys fairly often and looked like a good solution. I was fairly skeptical about how well it would work since I have several keys on my key ring, and was unsure it it could hold the exta weight. I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. It attaches to the wall easily and quickly, and holds 2 sets of keys without any issues.",5.0

"Really happy with this car vac! It's small, light, powerful and comes with a storage bag. It even has a bright LED light so you can clean in the evening. It worked OK when I first plugged it in, I didn't expect anything so small and 12 volt to be a powerhouse. Then I read the instructions that said to run the car while using and that doubled the suction power for faster cleaning. Wow, read the directions, what a great idea! Wonderful vacuum!",5.0

"I have come to distrust anything that plugs into the 12v car cig outlet. 99% of these small 12v appliances are too weak and too cheap. This vacuum is in the 1% of the items that actually work. We use this vac to clean out my wife's car. She has an all-you-can-eat membership to a car wash near her office, but they only wash her exterior. This vac has made it so simple for her to clean inside. She actually stores it in her car and uses it when she gets a wash during lunch. She's a tough customer, but she absolutely loves it. This is SO MUCH easier than dragging out the shop vac from the garage, and it works much better than a rechargeable dustbuster.",5.0

"(Updated: The first unit I received died after 3 minutes of use; however, the company responded promptly to my problem and sent me a replacement. So this updated review is for the working unit.)

The HOTOR is a good lightweight car vacuum that is easy to use, easy to clean, and has a bevy of useful attachments. It has adequate suction for its weight. You could get much more suction if you give up the convenience of having a lightweight device that is easy to manage inside a car, where space is limited (some of the reviewers that complain about the suction should take into consideration that greater suction means a heavier and more expensive motor is needed, thus you lose ease of handling in tight quarters and inexpensive acquisition cost.)

The entire unit has a nice storage bag that, given its light weight, I keep in the trunk all the time. And speaking of the thunk, the cord is long enough that you can easily reach it and vacuum back there too.",5.0

"PROS:
- Easy clean and durable filter (have not even burned through the first one yet)
- Good suction (always use it with the car running for best results)
- LED light is useful even in midday, because you wouldn't otherwise be able to see near the peddles, behind the seats, etc.)
- Variety of tools and convenient carry bag
CONS:
- Crevice tool could be skinnier or longer",5.0
"The vacuum comes with extended soft pipe, brush head, and a plastic extending head with a narrower opening. The wire is long enough to make sure the vacuum can reach to any point in my car. With the brush header, sticky debris can be removed easily.  For on seat debris, it is good to just use plastic narrow header to clean.  Overall really good vacuum to clean my car.",5.0
"Cheap product which may last hopefully few weeks! After switching off the device it produces very strange sounds as if something inside going to fall off.

UPDATE: The HOTOR offered to replace the damaged item and even refund expenditure. For this reason I'm marking up form 1 to 5 stars because the customer service is simply unbeatable !",5.0
"Works alright. The little brush helps a lot. It will take you about 30 minutes to vacuum the cars seat and floor if you're a ride-sharing driver. You'll still see a bit dirt after finished but it's really an insignificant amount. After you place the rugs back on, it will look good.",5.0

"Practical products
1: My family have a baby in the house, he often eats in the car, so the car is very dirty. The vacuum cleaner makes it easy and easy to absorb the food scraps

"Product: 4.5/5 stars
Pros:
-Various tips and connectors makes getting into the tight crevices an easy job.
-Very good suction for a handheld tool.
-Power cable is long enough to reach all the way to the trunk easily.
-The design makes cleaning the unit a simple job.
-Extra filter is a nice perk.

Cons (very small issues):
-Be careful when using the long flexible tube. Mine unscrewed halfway during use. But, I realized it was probably mostly because I kept twisting the hose around. Also, it easily screwed back in and can probably be held in place with a little duct/electrical tape.
-The storage bag is slightly small, but ONLY by a tiny bit. The current size makes storing all the pieces a bit of a jigsaw challenge to get everything to fit properly. This is only a comment for future upgrade improvements as everything does fit into the included storage bag.

Customer service: 5/5 stars
To start, I purchased this product with my own money. I believe a company's customer service and confidence in their product is essential to any purchase, big or small.

"Disclaimer: I bought this with my own money. I don't know these people. I just felt like writing this review because most of the reviews for this item are suspiciously positive and written in questionable English.

I bought this because I'm somewhat obsessive about keeping my car clean, and it was getting silly pumping quarters into the gas station's vacuum every week. Now that I got to try it out for the first time, I have to say that it works as well as I expected. First thing you should know is that it isn't terribly strong. It can't be. No vacuum running off of a low-wattage 12v power source like your car's cigarette lighter will ever be powerful. Don't compare it to a house vacuum or the gas-station vac which is easily consumes 10x the current. You'll be disappointed. What this thing is good for is vacuuming up normal amounts of dirt/sand from the carpet and dust from the center console, especially that weird dust that falls to the bottom of the cupholders and in the shift boot (dead skin cells I'm told). In fact it in a way it's a bit more effective than the gas station vac because of the brush attachment, and the fact that the nozzle can fit into smaller areas. The brush attachment makes all the difference in the world. The LED also light is actually quite helpful for seeing what you're doing in the darker parts of your car.

What it's NOT good for is sucking up 4lbs of Cheerios off the floor of a minivan. So if you have kids and routinely need to clean up massive messes, this might not do it for you.

Pro tip: Have your engine running while you use it. The system voltage is higher (usually around 14volts vs 12volts with the engine off) and the vac will be a little stronger.",5.0

It's light and comes with a tire pressure inflator ( which I hope I would not have to use)I have 3 dogs and I take them to work with me everyday, so you can imagine dog hair flying in the car and out of the car when I roll down the window. My co-workers refused to take my car when we go to lunch, so I found this wonderful vacuum and it works. I just have to do a quick vacuum before my co-workers get in my car. Now I have the cleanest car in the office and they stop making fun of my car. Thanks a lot.",5.0

This vacuum pulled dog hair right off, made sand and leaves disappear! It is a great buy!",5.0

"I loved it!
The box was pretty simple and comes with instructions.

The tape covers the entire back of the cloud so there's no space for screws or hooks. It sticks pretty hard to the door which is basically plain metal, so probably that helps a lot.

Magnet is strong, I have put up to four keys and there has been no problem at all.

Plastic quality is also good, is hard and shinny!",5.0
Bought this for my car after reading great reviews on it. No doubt the suction is super powerful. Even comes with extra filters. One filter will last for a year and i think it can be cleaned with a brush to reuse as I always do. This is great for picking up crackers that my baby drops,5.0

Nice little vacuum for my car.  It does a good job cleaning up my floor boards and the back hatch with no problem.

The vacuum itself works very nicely.  It has great suction and gets up anything I need it to.  It comes with 3 attachments to suit any need and can be used for wet or dry applications.
I have to say, my favorite part about this vacuum is that it doesn't have a battery! All the other handheld vacuums I've had before had such a short battery life and had to be charged forever! Not this one!!
Overall, I am very happy with this and would highly recommend it!!",5.0

"This is an amazing vacuum! It works extremely well. I tried it on my vehicles carpet floor the day it came in and it worked wonders. I had dirt and dry mud all over my carpet floor thanks to my siblings and I was able to get it all out. The price is just right and I love that I went with this one after much research in looking to buy a car vacuum. The blue color is really nice, sleek, and attractive looking. It plugs into the car's outlet so it is very convenient. The cord is long so no need to worry that it won't reach the back of your car because it will! It comes with many extra accessories. I'm excited about it having a tire inflator. I might not be using it much but it's great for backup in case of emergencies. It's really lightweight and makes the cleaning so much easy. I'm keeping it in the trunk of my car in the bag it comes with. My only concern is that the flashlight is in a spot where it kept almost turning off because my hand would rest on it while vacuuming at night but it's not a deal breaker or anything. I am completely in love with it and I highly recommend! My only trouble was that it was missing the valve tube but I got that resolved with Amazon. Look no further into buying another vacuum because this one is it!",5.0

"Although I now own several diffuser necklaces and have more than enough pads, the first necklace I bought only came with 2 pads, so I immediately needed more. I found these pads to be a very good price and I love the different colors. Plus they fit in all three of my necklaces, which were all purchased from different companies. I sometimes choose which pad to use based on what my outfit is for the day, and other times by whatever scent I have previously applied. I've also found that they do a great job of maintaining the scent for several days without needing to be replenished. And they are also very thick and well made. Overall I would highly recommend these pads to anyone who owns a diffuser necklace.",5.0

It helps me clean my truck and gets into all the nooks and crannies on cleaning days. I like that it has a long extension cord to plug into the cigarette lighter. The attachments come in pretty handy too.,5.0
"Updated and shortened review:
Had this vac for over a month now and really like it.  There are other vacs with good ratings that are just that.  I really use the light on this one often, and the pump is great for getting some air in bike tires when on the go.  The guage is a big plus too.

I use this weekly or every other week to clean dried mud/sand out of the back & front seats that the dogs drag in when I take them for a walk.  With the brush end it gets the dog hairs pretty well too.  They are short haired but do shed little hairs.

What I like most is I'm not running to the house for the small shop vac, and running a 100' cord from the trailer house to the car in the parking lot.  Plenty of cord for your own car, and with a simple 25' extension you can easily clean a friend's car from your cig lighter. (Saves on gas with a prius as the generator! :))",5.0
Very nice! Easy to use!,5.0
"So glad I got this for our car! After my husband and I cleaned out our car this last weekend, we used this vacuum to get all the dirt and crumbs and dust out. It worked great! The only problem I had, was that it didn't plug in very securely, so it would come unplugged easily. Other than that, it was perfect for our needs. It has a nice long cord  and all the necessary attachments, so you can get every inch of your car clean. Empties easily and has a replaceable and washable filter... even comes with one replacement. This is a wet and dry vacuum, so it can even be used to clean up your spilled coffee or pop (or whatever it is you drink). The vacuum, with all of its attachments, fit nicely the included bag for easy storage and transport. This new vacuum now has a permanent home in my car.",5.0

After researching on Amazon, I bought this HOTOR 4in1 Car Vacuum Cleaner since it also comes with a tire pressure monitor and pump.
The package comes with quite a few things. There are HOTOR Car Vacuum Cleaner, Extension Hose, Brush Attachment, valve tube, Operation Manual, Carrying Bag, and 3 different Pump Tips for Inflation. The attached cigarette car charger comes with a pretty long cord at 14.76 feet. There are 3 buttons on top of the vacuum cleaner. The button in the front is a release button for the dirt bin and to access the filter. The button (switch) on the handle has 3 modes - Vacuum, OFF, and Pump. The very last button activates LED light. There is no home AC output adapter included in the package.
PROs:
- Wet/Dry cleaner. This vacuum works with dirt as well as liquid. This comes very handy after rainy or snowy days.
- Good suction. The vacuum is rated at 100W and it's able to pickup most dirt/ food leftover on my car's carpet and chairs, except those ones that are really sticky. It picks up hairs as well but I usually have to try a few times.
- Bonus tire pressure monitor, pump, and pump tips. It's nice that HOTOR included a few different types of tips in the package so I can use this to pump balloons, balls, and kids' bike tires when we're outside. I haven't tried using the pump to pump car tires but it might be too difficult for a small unit like this.
- LED light. There is a LED light near the front part of the handle. It's quite useful in the dark and when I am trying to clean up the car inside garage.
- Washable filter. I prefer using filters that's washable as it saves money in the long run. There is also a handle on the back of filter for easier removal. There is only one filter included in the package though.",5.0
"I just received this today as i was cleaning out my truck.  Perfect time to try it out. I was really happy with this vacuum.  Plenty of power to suck up leaves, sand and a few bubble gum wrappers lol.
I'm attaching a few pictures of what i got in the package.  The quality is really better than expected.  All the accessories fit tightly  and there is no air leaks anywhere. I like the carrying case and everything fits in it perfectly.  The cord is super long! I give this 5 stars no doubt and highly recommend it if you are looking for one of these.",5.0

I added one of the attachments the hose so that I could get into small areas and the suction was very weak. There didn't seem to be another setting for the suction pressure. I am not to concerned with the suction of the attachment the vacuum itself worked great and will make it so much easier to clean up my messy kids crumbs and dirt. I would still recommended this car vacuum based on the size is perfect and the suction on the actual vacuum worked great and I was very happy with that. I look forward to cleaning my car easily in the future.",5.0
I just purchased the car vacuum and am very pleased with it. The vacuum has sufficient power to pick up dirt in my car and I like that it's got a long cord to plug into my cigarette lighter (12v).  Plus having the bag for the vacuum and the accessories makes it nice to be able to put everything in one place. Definitely worth the price.,5.0

This vacuum also comes with a nice carrying case and hose extension to reach even the toughest areas in the car! I love the design, it's very easy to hold and use and it is super simple to change and clean the filters. The design makes it easy to get in between seat cracks and the suction power really is great! I can suck up an entire bottle of water and then dumb it right out the window! This is great for traveling pets in case they have an accident, you just suck it right up, dump it outside and rinse the canister and filter!

"I have bought this Car Vacuum from Hotor to clean my vehicles.. This kit came with its own carry case, the vacuum, a hose attachment with two other attachments.. First of all I love the fact that it came with its own carrying case so that wverything will be all togther in one bag and easy to just grab and go.. The vacuum itself is very light weighted and no to heavy to where you'll have a hard tume maneuvering it around your car.. The attachments is a plus to catch all other difficult places that you cant reach with the vacuum and the brush one to get up any dust or any particles stuck to the surfaces.. The plug is a lighter plug in so yes you can just leave it in your vehicle to use at anytime.. All in all I think everyone should have ine in their car hust to have..",5.0

"I previously owned a Dirt Devil Hand Held Vaccum that i used in my car to pick up waste from food thrown out by my 1 yr old and various other debris from shoes not to mention hair. After 3 years of service it finally died on me (Well could not ask for more of its service for the $30 i spent on it).

Was scouring through amazon for a decent vaccum cleaner and i stumbled upon this product. Since amazon has got my back, ordered this product  and i am definitely not disappointed with my decision to go with this bad boy.

Not only it did a better job than my dirt devil to pick up debris on my car floor but it coupled as tire inflator and as well an emergency led light in case of situations.

The product itself came in a nice little portable pouch that can house the contents of the product and get tucked in nicely in my trunk. My only question that i need to contact the seller is how often do we need to change the HEPA filter (Asking this as my previous vaccum cleaner is a no filter model) and if there would be cheap as it wouldnt make sense to spend a bomb on the filter when the vaccum cleaner itself is inexpensive

I also tried the pointed attachments to inflate my volley ball just for the heck of it and it worked awesome :)

Like the product description mentioned, it came in with all the attachments. Build quality itself is very good and i am super sure this will last for more than what my dirt devil did. Overall, it is a great purchase and i hope it won't need to claim warranty and that it runs for a long time to come.

My verdict: Must have in your car if you got kids",5.0
"I really, really love this car vacuum. Not only is it super convenient, it works awesome. I have 3 children under 8, youngest is 2, and they make a lot of messed with snacks in my car.

"There isn't anything bad I can say about this pendant. It is well made, good quality stainless steel, and even the chain is nice. For most pendants the chain is an afterthought, and most of the time I discard the chain and use one of my own. It is a long chain, suitably thick, and works well with the pendant. The pendant is heavy, and it is fairly large, but I think I like it that way. However, if you are looking for something small and discrete, this won't be a good pendant for you. It is definitely a statement piece. The included pads are thick and absorb a lot of oil. As I received the pendant today, I can't speak for their washability, but you can find replacement pads online that are relatively inexpensive. I will add on to the review if I have any issues with the pads. Overall, a quality buy, and the price is low considering what you get.",5.0

"This diffuser is so quiet you'll never realize it has turned itself off due to being dry. I love the fact that I can fill this baby up and it runs all night. It will turn itself off if it gets empty, and I like that feature. There are settings for roughly 30 minutes to an hour, but I haven't used those setting because I like a continuous run of the essential oils; so I put it on the ""run until I'm out of water"" setting. The colors are very nice and soothing, but those can also be turned off for bedtime. If you want a unit that puts out a good stream, run quietly in the background, and turns itself off when the water has been depleted, then this is your unit.",5.0
Love my new diffuser! Love the fact that it has different settings and shuts itself off! The night light is wonderful too and my granddaughter loves it being in her room.

They all had one common problem - the battery. Rechargeable battery life is not holding up very long on these devices, and it takes several hours to recharge it. Most of the time when you need to vacuum, often the vacuum is dead because out of battery.

This Hotor DC 12 Volt 106 watts Wet and Dry handheld vacuum with long power cord eliminates that problem. Not only vacuum dry debris, this vacuum also can vacuum wet items or liquid spills. When you ready to vacuum, the battery (capacity) is not the limit. You can vacuum much longer and ready to go at anytime. Best of all, there is air filter to prevent dust going out on the other end  this is might help if people have minor allergies (note: I believed the filter is not HEPA). Besides that great feature, the extension hose, crevice tool and brush attachment work perfectly.

Pros:
-  DC 12 volt (no battery problems)
-  Wet and Dry Vacuum
-  Portable
-  Lightweight
-  Long car lighter cable (16.5 feet)
-  Easy to empty dust bowl
-  Easy to Use and handle
-  Great build material
-  Great Price
-  Air Filter (to prevent debris and dust coming out
  from other end)
-  Great Accessories (Storage Carrying Bag, Crevice

-  Great for car
-  Great Warranty

"This review is for a Car Vacuum Cleaner that is DC12-Volt 106W. This portable handheld vacuum can handle both wet & dry  with the 16.4FT(5M) Power Cord that it comes with. It also tucks away into a nice compact blacl carry bag with zipper.

Here are some PROS & CONS:
PRO:
It can handle both wet & dry dirt.
Cord is long enough for inside of the car.
It comes with attachment heads.
It comes with hose extension.aww
It comes with a carry case to keep it contained.
CONS:
Wish the suction was bit stronger but still gets the job done.

I didn't try the air pump capability but this could come in handy if you get a flat on the road. So It will stay in my car for sure.

And I call it my toy because it is just so much fun to use! This one vacuum has:

1) DRY VAC for cleaning up dirt and spills tracked into the car.

2) WET VAC for cleaning up any spills in a quick hurry!

3) BRUSH ATTACHMENT to comb the carpet or brush the upholstery.

4) INFLATION TIPS -- ball needle, air mattress, etc.

5) TIRE PUMP to inflate flat tires with built-in tire pressure gauge on the rear of the vacuum

6) LIGHT built-in to the vacuum for added convenience

7) EXTENSION HOSE for those hard to reach places

8) CARRYING CASE

It is so easy to plug the vacuum into the charging port of the car and clean up any mess that may be in the car or inflate my kid's flat soccer ball or even top off my tires when needed. There isn't anything that this compact vacuum can't do! And when I'm done having my fun, all I have to do is pack it back up into its compact storage bag and slide it up under the seat...it's so compact it is impossible to even tell that it is there!

The biggest surprises for me were 1) that it was strong enough to actually inflate the tires of my large SUV and 2) that the vacuum had enough suction to remove pet hair from the carpet!

The biggest surprise for my friends is when a ball needs to be inflated at soccer practice and I pull out a vacuum and proceed to inflate balls in a matter of seconds. The shock and awe is too funny...then it immediately turns into ""where did you get that???""

This vacuum has been a huge hit!! I LOVE it and all of my friends who have seen it have really been taken with it. It's so easy to have fun with this multi-tool :)

I normally don't rate or review items I buy.  I've never really liked or disliked an item enough to do so.  Until now.  I purchased this item to do little quick vacuums in between my car cleanings without having to pull my husband's big shop vac around.  I just basically threw that money away.  This thing is horrible.  I think it drops out just as much sand as it picks up if you don't hold it a certain way.  It won't even pick up little pebbles!  And it's not like the sand is in carpet so it's hard to pick it up.  I have Weather Tech mats and it will hardly grab the sand off of it.  Do not waste your money on this thing.

"I'm not mad at all that I bought this, I'm more like disappointed. The description claims this can pick up two iPhones since it's ""upgraded"" so I was pretty excited to be able to clean my 2007 Dodge Charger R/T. After a short wait (FYI: The shipping time was great) on shipping I was excited to get to use this, but after seeing it's suction power I was dissatisfied with the 25 or so minuets it took me to clean the front of the car when I usually take 15 with a shop vac. I won't be using any more and I'll be looking for something with a bit more power. I don't recommend this product.",1.0
"This vacuum has such weak suction, it is like running a lint roller across my carpet floors. I don't know why it has so many high reviews from others... I'm pretty sure I know how to use a vacuum?

I gave it one star because it picked up maybe 20% of the dirt on the floor. It's not good for much and I'll have to buy another vacuum.",1.0

Pointless to use it as it does nothing.",1.0

Within a month this vacuum fell apart . Very disappointed.,1.0

Doesn't pick up dirt/ hair very well. And every time I press down on the carpet the filter and chamber pops off. It is just cheaply made.

I don't give bad review for product but this vacuum is a piece of junk. It over very weak suction. Much weaker than I expected. It is like 4 times weaker than my wireless BlackDeck vacuum. The vacuum hose keep come off (detached) while vacuuming. It is very annoying.,1.0
I wish the vac was stronger than it is. I am very disappointed in this product. I don't recommend unless you have very very very little dirt in your car. It's not strong WHATSOEVER. And it can't pick up liquids! It'll leak the liquid onto your seat before you even take it out. Do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,1.0
I don't know what was upgraded but the suction on this is terrible.,1.0
Horrible excuse for a vacuum. not enough power to pickup tiny pebbles/rocks and the attachments useless. I don't recommend,1.0

Received. Took it out of the box. Attachment pieces do not fit on the hose. So you can only put the directly on the vacuum which will not allow you to get in between your seats or in areas you need the attachment on the hose. The hose also falls out of the vacuum. The hose is too wide for the attachments to go on.,1.0

"No suction power at all. Couldnt pick up cookie crumbs from car seat. I wasn't even in the the corners or crevices , it was literally on the seat and nada. Then I tried using the accessory attachment and still nothing. Didn't even bother with the tire pressure gadge since its primary function failed. The reason i gave it a star is because it is packaged well otherwise.",1.0
The Cover does not stay on when you vacuum your car. I have a Uber Car needs cleaning daily.,1.0
Gave one star only because I can't go lower. Received on time us the only good thing I can Say. Very cheaper carrying bag and product.,1.0

"After reading several Amazon reviews on this product, I purchased it and I have to tell you I am very disappointed. This vacuum doesn't have enough suction (whether you're using it with or without the brush attachment) to pick up much beyond fluffy lint. I just had tiny bits of dirt and leafy debris I wanted to vacuum out of my new car, but this couldn't even handle that. And just so we're clear, I'm talking about dirt no bigger than 2 - 3 mm and leafy debris no bigger than 1 - 2 cm (and not that many pieces of them either), so this the vacuum should've been able to handle it quite easily. But it didn't.

On the bright side, the light is very bright and you'd have no problem seeing the area you're trying to vacuum. I didn't try the tire inflator or pressure features, so I cannot speak to them.",1.0

"I've been waiting almost a month for these to arrive and was so excited to get them that I can't even describe the disappointment I felt when I opened the box. Initially I was impressed because they looked just like the photo. On closer inspection though they just didn't hold up.

First the silver one. It wouldn't even OPEN! No matter how hard I tried I couldn't pry it open with just my hands. I had to use two pairs of jewellery pliers and actually apply quite a bit of force to get it to open. I was hoping that it was just a bit stiff the first time I tried opening it, however I have to use the pliers each time.  The finish too is not up to the quality I expected for the price. I know that it's not real silver so it may eventually tarnish however when you turn this locket around its already tarnished and looks like it's been worn.

The bronze one isn't any better. While I can open it this one looks even more used. Not only is it also tarnished on the back already it looks well worn. The hinges have some""thing"" in them. It looks like grease and maybe fibers though I'm not sure what exactly it is. They may just be fibers but it looks like someone got their hair caught in the hinges and just cut it out. Not attractive at all.

I was hoping to give these as a gift and was so excited that I even purchased another set in another design and I'm worried that those are going to be just as bad. Neither one of these can be gifted and they're barely wearable. From the other reviews it seems that this product is hit or miss on whether it arrives in good condition or not. I really can't recommend these based on what I received but I sincerely hope that I lucked out on the next set because these are just too disappointing.",1.0
"How this item got 5 stars is beyond me. It had a problem picking up six little quarter inch pieces of dried leaves from the carpet in my vehicle. Calling it a toy is an insult to toys.

After purchasing the Service and Repair Manual I opted to purchase the Triumph ""Owner's handbook"" from the Parts Department of my local Triumph dealer.  The handbook covers the 2010 Bonneville, Bonneville T100, Thruxton and Scrambler motorcycles.  The handbook is in line with my needs, although it was much more expensive than the Haynes manual.",1.0

I bought this Haynes book thinking that it would give me the specific information I need to upgrade my cars to R-134a.  I picked it because of the 2000 publication date.  BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it.  The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate.  The varous pressure/temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12.  The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers.  Charging with R-134a (which is legal) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it.  There is no info on charging from small cans.  There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging.  Very disappointing.  P.S.  I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so don't let me scare you off Haynes.,1.0

It did not mention anything about having to take the passenger front tire off to change the spark plugs and the serpentine belt.  It instructions tend to be overly simplified and/or vague.  There is very little in the way of any sort of technique to use or things to look out for.  I found some forums on the internet that did a much more thorough and respectable job than this p.o.s. and the people there didn't charge you for the info.  It is good for a couple of things.

Steering dampener is a part that you have to replace after 20K miles, so you would think... No I guess not. The pictures are dark, looking as if the pages were copied not printed, the wording is not clear and the book is way too expensive for what you get.

"I am a classic DIY'er who enjoys working on all manner of projects, including minor automotive repairs. So, I bought this manual, having used both Haynes and Chilton in the past. I have a 2001 Nissan Frontier and wanted to change the spark plugs, wires, cap, and rotor. I read online that the sixth plug is difficult to reach and replace. The online suggestions seemed a little odd, so I thought this manual might help. Wrong! After changing the cap and rotor, first five plugs and wires within twenty-five minutes, the sixth plug took over five hours to reach. The manual had no help at all. I had to use a telescoping mirror just to see the cylinder hole in which to place the plug and then the plug wouldn't thread correctly. I ended up having to take the truck to a mechanic who told the only way to reach the plug was remove the intake. Others suggested that I loosen the engine mounts and tilt the motor forward two inches. Either way, no mention on any difficulties with this plug in the manual. It says it is based on a complete tear down and rebuild. This is a joke. The author didn't once attempt this project on the 2001 model or its instructions would have been far more detailed than something like,",1.0

According to the manual the #1 plug is located in the back. That seemed odd to me but since I took the wires off two weeks before and didn't pay attention to the firing order since I had a manual. After wasting several hours of my time I went to the Internet for answers. The first thing I found was several references to #1 being in the front right were I expected it should have been. After 2 minutes to switch the wires around the Jeep fired right up and sounds good. How can you publish a manual with a major error like that?",1.0
"Don't bother. I bought this to change the wheel bearings in my wife's car, it says because of the tools required, take it to a professional. What's the point of getting the manual if it's just going to say take it to a professional. Save yourself 20$ and just look it up on YouTube",1.0
"Even though it lists models to 2011, this has very, very few notes on the JK. Do not buy if you have the JK.",1.0
The one item I needed instructions on was not in the manual. Don't recommend.,1.0
"Haynes states that this manual covers Jeep Wranglers 1987-2011, but in reality has little to no information, diagrams, or photographs for modern vehicles. The book makes no differentiation between Wrangler models such as Unlimited, Sahara, etc., and is almost completely useless for a 2010 JK Rubicon. The manual references photos that do not exist, substitutes actual instructions for ""remove part X"", is of substandard construction for a shop book, and is destined for the mulch pile (yes, the pages are that poor quality).",1.0
"Assume they just added a new cover to a manual for the pre JK models.  Needed info on EGR valve and a couple other engine/chassis related fixes.  3.8 liter engine and JK chassis not even mentioned, so was no help to me.",1.0
The manual has to many years of jeeps in one manual. Some of the steps were not explained very well with no photos. It would be great to show pictures of how to unclip the electrical connections. They are all different and seem to break easy.,1.0
it don't tell u much any more most of the stuff u can figer out on by ur self if it get in to any thing hard or really just about any thing that is not normal stuff it tells u to take to a shop well if I had that kind of money I won't need the book,1.0
"I wasted a good deal of time following the instructions to remove and replace the starter motor on my 2000 Mazda 626 4-cylinder.  What the authors chose not to mention was that the starter in the Mazda 626 is not in the same place as in the example car (Ford Probe), so the Mazda starter cannot be removed and replaced by following the instructions.  I removed the entire air intake housing, as instructed, before I figured out that there's no way in hell you can get to the starter from that direction.  Ingenious!

Maybe this manual is useful for the Ford Probe or MX-6, but it is useless if you want to fix your Mazda 626.  I really want to find the publishing executive responsible for this nonsense and throw my old starter through his windshield.  Until then, I'll just try to find a manual that is specifically written for my Mazda.",1.0
Only bought it for turbo section which was not included :/,1.0
"Terrible step by step direction on engine removal , poor quality photos  paper is reminiscent of newspaper stock if you want a good manual download the PDFs from the web or get a factory copy . Haynes good learn a thing or three  from Bentley don't waste your money . And the delivery time was by tortoise 2 weeks is ridiculous",1.0
"If you are looking for Honda CR-V Models maint manual DO NOT BUY THIS ONE! Almost 95% of the content of this manual talks about Civic models, 1.8L & 1.9L engines! Outdated photos still shows. Haynes failed CR-V consumers on this edition.",1.0
"I've bought a couple of these manuals for cars before and am familiar with the level of information you get for what is a pretty low price, ... but this particular manual is a new low.  I own an 08 Civic Si and there is very little model specific information.",1.0
Not much info on the civic.,1.0
"I have been buying Haynes manuals for ever, and this is the worst one. Every other Haynes manuals were great. This manual covers too many models. Simple information is just not there. I have a 2007 CRV, and wanted to know the location of the oxygen sensors. No pictures or diagrams for them, or a simple description where to find them. I open the hood, and cannot see the spark plugs. There is no basic picture or description of the proper procedure to change the plugs.",1.0
"BEWARE! It doesn't cover what the description claims.

I've bought a Haynes manual for every auto I've owned for the last 25 years and this is the worst one I've seen. As others have stated, it tries to cover too many model years of the Civic and throws in the CR-V on top of it.

It would have been a much better manual if they would have left the CR-V to another manual and actually covered the Civic. Nowhere in the description does it tell the buyer that it doesn't cover the CNG or Hybrid models. You're left to find that out AFTER you've got the book.",1.0
"I think this is a pretty lousy manual for this day and age -  Many of the pictures are useless and the index is wrong.  I have pretty much given up on this manual and get information from youtube.com.  I can get the information off youtube  much faster than using this manual with its inaccurate index and since youtube shows a how to video the parts are easier to see, how they fit and such.  AND IT IS FREE.",1.0

"It must be that they have attempted to cover too many model years and not even one completely.

I bought the book to perform automatic transmission and differential maintenance. The 7B Automatic transmission section is 4 1/2 pages in total. One page is dedicated to leaks, a second to shift linkage and a third to general operation and specifications.

It even says ""this Chapter contains only those procedures related to general diagnosis, routine maintenance, adjustment and removal and installation."" The book is only slightly more useful than the vehicles Owners Manual.

Older issues actually showed where the differential drain and fill plugs were located. This one does not even do that.",1.0
not helpful fir tdi owners as it only covers gas models and has irrelevant verbiage and pics. don't waste ure money,1.0
By far one of the worst Haynes manuals ever put out. Tries to bridge too many different models in one book. Has pictures from 1st Generation New MINI as explanation for 2nd Generation New MINI. Poorly put together. Should have separated the two generations.,1.0
The description for this repair manual says it includes 2005 convertible's which in fact it does not the only way that you know that it doesn't provide any repair information  for the convertible top is to actually read the last line on the back side of the cover that is the only reason I bought the manual because I have probably convertible top and I guess I needed to have read the information on the manuals picture,1.0
"I bought this book to try and tackle the cylinder head removal. The  section on that is very small and incomplete and leaves you at the point where the cams are still in the head...Head bolts don't exist I guess. Then the next section is removing the valve cover???
Pictures are of different make cars sometimes and overall bad. Spend a little extra and get a better manual. This thing is good for torque specs only, IMHO.",1.0
"I've owned about 10 Haynes manuals since the 80's, mostly for motorcycles, and didn't hesitate to order this one because, from past experience, they were top notch when compared to others. Total let-down for the Haynes Mini manual. The pictures are so bad most of them look like black blobs and the ones that aren't are of different non-Mini vehicles. Too many things are generalized and don't relate to the specific model. The organization is such that you have to waste valuable time and energy accidentally reading info that does not apply, especially for a 2007 or newer. The wiring diagrams are a joke. You can tell Haynes just doesn't care anymore and went the way of Chilton's.",1.0
The photos in this manual are the poorest I've ever seen with fuzzy gray on gray images that don't show much detail. There isn't much technical detail either and the wiring diagrams are hopelessly incomplete. It's not bad as a starter manual but you couldn't use it for any complicated repairs.,1.0
Images are not clear and text not easy to follow. Don't recommend.,1.0
Useless. Does not help at all. I regret buying this.,1.0
"Outrageously bad.
**None of the wiring diagram are for the 3rd gen (2010-2012) Prius. They just have 2nd gen diagrams and say ""2004 and later"".**
Some procedures are just wrong. For example, to check the thermostat they say to see the engine temperature displayed on the dash. The 2010 Prius does not display the temp so clearly the authors did not even go through the procedure themselves.
Scumbags. F***ing scumbags.",1.0
I found this manual to be vague and very general.  The spark plug change procedure isn't applicable to the 2011 Prius.  It make me question the usefulness of the rest of it's procedures.,1.0
"There is a big generational change in ask prius from 2009 on. In fact in 2012 Toyota released servers different versions of the prius (there's the standard, I have the can type prius V and then there's the mini prius C. This manual is not specific to any of these models and id's of little help with many things, such as rebuilding the battery. I suggest getting the dealer's service manual.",1.0
"This book claims to be based on ""a complete tear down and rebuild,"" yet the book is silent on the single most important component of the Toyota hybrid system... the hybrid battery. This book was useless for my DIY high voltage battery repair job. I got further with information available online and in the Toyota Prius tech manuals. Avoid this book.",1.0
"Although is says that it includes 2014 Outback, most of the information I needed was did not apply to this model.  Relying on the book caused me to buy the wrong oil, none of the pictures I checked matched the Outback, and instructions for simple things like changing oil were wrong.",1.0
"I want to say I was looking forward to getting this manual for working on my subaru. That was until I received the manual... There are so many pages of this book that are half copied, completely black or blank. I wouldn't recommend ordering this manual.",1.0

Call fire department.",1.0
"How to find  and get to the spare tire is information that a driver needs to know. That info is not in this book. After decades, a  major change to these vans is Stow-n-Go seats that fold into the floor. With  the Stow-n-go seats taking up space under the car, Chrysler engineers moved the spare tire from its usual pickup-truck-like position under the rear of the car to under the car between the driver and front passenger seats. You need a special tool from the car's jacking  kit to access the winch inside the car from between the front seats and lower the spare tire from under the car.
  In this book, you will have to really search for the two half photographs of  the spare tire and the three sentence blurb of a paragraph that basically says ""lower spare tire , install on car.""
  I gained more info from online videos on the subject after I had already spent $24 on this book.
  Aligning wheels and replacing tie rods is some of the large amount of information in this book. Simple information that a driver will probably need more often like ""where is the spare tire?,"" is not.",1.0
I've never been very happy with haynes manuals. I should have known better. Specific repairs to systems such as the parking brake are completely missing. I miss the old chilton books that were twice as thick as these and covered anything you would need to know. I'd probably just stick to google and youtube and skip buying this book.,1.0

This suit sucks.  First suit I bought had visible damage so before I even wore it I had to get a new one.

What these guys sent me was a paper thin, poorly colored, low quality sticker that looks like it was printed at home on somebodys desktop computer...seriously they might as well have printed it on toilet paper. Total misrepresentation in sales, these guys should be prosecuted for false representation and unscrupulous business practices. Threw sticker in the trash, totally worthless.",1.0
Cheaply made....... was not at all satisfied! Would have gave a half star if it was available!!! Do not buy!,1.0
"The font used for 'CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC' on the sticker is NOT the same as in the picture shown, nor on any CA flag I've ever seen - not what they use in Sacramento, not what they fly at City Hall. Without going into font specifics, I would just say that it looks too modern and computer generated. The original is not copyright protected as far as I know, so I don't know why they would do this. Also, the vendor has not responded to my request for a refund ... perhaps Amazon lost the message or I missed their reply, but these stickers aren't going to get stuck on anything.

The American flag sticker I bought at the same time is also wrong - the stars are tiny and it looks kind of ridiculous. I am not going to display an American flag that looks like a kid drew it unless it was drawn by my own kid. Even then, I'd tell the kid to make the stars bigger.",1.0

But what they sent me is completely unusable, as it is not what I need. So now I have to take time and effort out of my busy day to return these for a refund. There's no excuse for any vendor on Amazon (or anywhere online) to show a picture of an item that's different from the actual product they're shipping. That is called deception. Perhaps the intention was innocent, but they're just setting a customer up for disappointment and annoyance. This may seem like a stupid and trivial complaint. But now it's caused a huge inconvenience, and it's costing me in time and effort to now have to return this item, and then go back to the drawing board to try to find what I actually need.

"Coleman Cable 08662 25-Feet Heavy-Duty Booster Cables, 4-Gauge.  I bought the ""best"" January 2013 and just stored them in the trunk for some future emergency.  Had a totally dead battery in Hyundai 6 months later (dome light left on), and pulled up 2nd car (Expedition).  Once hooked up, all power was restored to Hyundai dashboard lights, horn, windows, etc.  But on turning the key to start, all voltage disappeared and starter didn't even click.  Worked half an hour getting a firmer clamp on top post terminals, letting the Expedition run at 1500 RPM to charge up the Hyundai battery a little... all with no success.  There was so much resistance in the Coleman cables that once real amperage attempted to flow, there was a complete voltage drop across the cables.  A friend loaned me a ratty old pair of cheap cables that started the car instantaneously.  Were the Colemans really 4 gauge?  Or perhaps manufacturing defect where cable welded to clamp.  They were completely useless.  Tried to return but Amazon web site said they had to be returned in 30 days... but, hurray for Amazon.com, when I explained the problem by e-mail that upon first use, they failed, Amazon approved the return 6 months after purchase.  Its not obvious how to test jumper cables when first purchased and you don't have a dead battery to try out the cables.  I will buy a different brand from Amazon.com. And when they arrive, I think I'll unhook a battery cable from the battery and test the cables jumped to the open cable when I receive them, rather than ""assuming"" they're good and just putting them in the trunk.

"The cables are made in the USA, which is great, but they are not copper cables.  They are the much cheaper ""copper clad aluminum"" cables that are of much lower quality.

I need the jumper cables for emergency use only so they hopefully won't be used much.  If you need to unroll and roll up the cables often look for copper cable, not this product.

"6 years = 3 motors.

I had the misfortune of having a Lomanco fan installed with my new house.  Of course to work best it is in the highest, hottest, most difficult to access portion of the roof.  Well, I am now and expert a changing out the Lomanco fan motors since they fail (seize up) approximately every 2 years.  House if 6 years old and I just replaced my third motor.

Bad enough but what torques me even a little more is these units are remote and hard to get to.  So, you don't even know when they fail.  For all I know, the motor failed months ago and I have been burning up my shingles and AC units to deal with the high attic temps.  I someone offered a heavy duty motor = it would be worth the $15 bucks to be able to rely on the attic fan working.

So, I am planning on converting this Piece of Stuff to use a gable fan which I'll mount flush below the roof board but use the existing roof hole, critter screen, and roof cap.  Hopefully Broan makes better motors.

If you are going to stick with your Lomanco motors, buy six motors and store them near your attic fan.  You change them out just about as frequently as the oil in your lawn tractor.",1.0
"My new Motor lasted all but 6 months. In the Northeast! I replaced it yesterday (91 deg. F - OUTSIDE). My thinking is as follows: When I went to turn the Fan Blade - it was slightly siezed - & then it spun freely. But it still had burned out a a result of the light siezed condition. If you can easily get to your fan, as I can, turn the Thermostat to turn on at the highest Temp. - once Fall has passed. Or, install a switch, so that the Unit will not try to turn on during the next Season, unless you're there. I plan to freshly lube mine in the Spring - and TURN IT BY HAND for the 1st 'power - up' of the season. I hope this will ease any high current draw should things sieze over the cold winter months again. One other thing... installing an in-line Fuse may save the windings as well. My old Motor was similar - but it was over 20 yrs old & I never did ANYTHING to it. My roofer tossed it in the Dumpster w/o even asking me. I certainly should've saved that motor!

I bought this item 27 April 2012 and here it is May 29 2012 and motor quit. But the company acted fast to my problem. They sent me a new one at no cost and no hassle. The company takes pride in their USA made products. So I would recomend ordering attic fan motors from this company.,1.0

"This motor was in my attic for just under 4 years before it seized a month ago.  My builder had put this in my new home, no doubt the cheapest thing on the market. I removed the motor from inside the attic, it wasn't fun but I got it out and was surprised at the small size and lightness in weight of the motor.

I could have replaced it with the same but went to Home Depot and they had one type of replacement motor on the shelf.  In comparison to the original motor, it was about 2/3 heavier and longer but about the same in circumference.  The replacement fit perfectly in the bracket in the attic.

The new motor quality appears far superior to the original I replaced.  Also, it has sealed bearings and brushless in design.  I am not sure of the Lomanco model having these features but I am guessing it doesn't.  Regardless, the Lomanco model died in just a few years and quality motors typically last 20 years.",1.0

"This product being advertised as a 'muffler' is misleading. I observed no difference in sound level.  I just completed my test.  It is being returned.  An effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac.  This is a viable option for my use, since I will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective.",1.0
"I didn't need exhaust dispersion.  If I did I would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device (To my knowledge none exist).  I wanted a muffler.  This doesn't muffle. I took it back.  The End

PS This site won't allow my 'zero star' rating.",1.0
"I was surprised to see that this 'muffler' received 4 stars. When I read the reviews, praise was given not because it muffles sound, but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust. Indeed, this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my Ridgid vacs. (I bought two of them, but I was in a rush and got them locally.)

When we are working on a job site, there often is lots of dust. Imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place. Not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in, it also spreads the dust over an even greater area. As other reviewers describe, this 'muffler' -- oh, why not just call it 'air-diffuser' -- redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle. This greatly reduces the force of the air.

It is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler, but the difference is too small to spend any money on. So in terms of living up to its name, I give it one star.",1.0
"This is definitely not a noise muffler. It's not a silencer either. It does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face. By redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable. I bought this for our new Ridgid WD1680, which Amazon doesn't sell. The big box store I bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so I got this to go with it. Used in a garage, the vac is surprisingly quiet. It seems our Hoover upright is much louder. I measured the Ridgid as-is at 83dB. With the 'muffler' on, it was 83dB. There was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant. I figure it's also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I'm going to return it. The WD1680 also works as a removeable blower. In that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port, even though it was the same port with just a tube attachment. So bottom line is that this is useless.",1.0

"This product works great for draining your car's crankcase oil. It has a screen to catch the drain plug. HOWEVER, the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a PIECE OF CRAP. You are supposed to tighten it down, then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal. The large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all. It falls off when you tip the unit to drain, emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor. This is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well.",1.0

Well it has fit in two oil changes, however, the closing up is a different story.  My main complaint has been with the train spout: It LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE!  I changed the oil in one truck, put the pan in the back of my other truck overnight and came out to a good half quart leaked out.  I thought maybe I didn't tighten the cap down enough so I gave it another quarter turn and the next day was more of the same.  As much as I liked the concept, I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.",1.0

I figured if it was all every store sold that it must at least be decent.  I was wrong.  It leaks all over the place no matter what you do and the cap for the large orifice does not seal at all, creating a large oil spill in your new garage and ruining your clothes.  This is the absolute worst $10 I have ever spent.",1.0
"This product leaks so badly that I might as well have taken ten bucks out of my pocket, set it on the floor of my garage and drained my cars oil right on top of it. Oh, wait then I would still have the ten oily bucks.

"I bought one of these to change the oil on my RV.  It seemed like a good idea.  Unfortunately, this is NOT a quality product.  Once I had drained the oil, I put the large lid (on the side of the pan) back on and picket the drain pan up.  In the process, the large lid simply popped off the drain pan, dumping about 2 quarts of dirty engine oil all over the garage floor.  Even if the lid doesn't come off, it leaks badly with large amounts of oil running down the side of the oil pan.  AVOID this product at all costs! It will cause more grief than good.

Wally, Youngstown, OH",1.0
I'll just echo the other reviews on this product.  Both caps leak and it leaves a huge mess on your garage floor.,1.0
I've have two of these and trust me its not about IF the cap will leak but WHEN.  The cap is made from plastic that gets brittle when it comes in contact with oil!! Why Rhino will not change this easy to fix solution is beyond me. Even the large main cap on the top does not close securely enough to carry the container on its side without oil leaking out.  Do NOT buy this.,1.0

"DO NOT BUY. Don't know how this is still on the market. As other reviewers state, it leaks from both ""caps."" Will make a big mess wherever you put it.",1.0
"Bought for oil changes and whatnot.  Mine actually worked decent most of the time.  It did not leak from the side cap like many reviewers said.  My problem is that every couple months, while in storage, that side cap would split.  Thanks goodness I did not have oil in it.  Anyway, I emailed the mfr. (Blitz) from their website.  I never heard back in terms of a response but a couple weeks later I got three new caps in the mail.  I thought that was nice of them.  Unfortunately, it's been a year and all three caps have since split so I threw the thing out.  Would not recommend this product.",1.0
Really should've read all these other reviews before I bought this POS. Is it seriously that difficult to make a screw-on cap that doesn't leak? Last Blitz product I'll ever buy.,1.0
"This drain pan is totally useless.  The concept is good, but they have used the cheapest materials available for construction.  I would gladly pay double what they're asking if it would work as designed.  First of all, the drain cap broke during my first use after it failed to stop a continuous leaking of oil from the side.  The top cap also broke during my second usage and I had to resort to using a large garbage bag to transport both the leaking oil (making a major mess in the process) and pan to the recycle place.  After dumping the remaining oil, I just threw out this piece of trash and swore to never buy anything from Blitz again.  This item is supposed to make your oil change easier, but instead, it made it much more messy than necessary and cumbersome to clean up.",1.0
"When I first bought this oil pan/container, I thought it was pretty neat, because it has a screen and a large twist cap that allows the container to be stood up after changing the oil.  Well, after three oil changes, I have thrown it out.  The small twist-off cap cracked and broke, and the large twist-off cap leaks when stood up.  If buying this pan/container, only use as a drain pan - not for storage or transport.  I would recommend a regular drain pan with a large opening, as this one's opening is quite small.  I made a mess when I used it, as the position needed to be adjusted - and forget about trying to line up this pan with the oil filter.",1.0
"I can't believe I bought this.  I usually check reviews before buying so not sure if I was just asleep or what.  Needless to say, it's leaking like crazy and I need to find something that actually works.

DO NOT BUY!!!!",1.0
"This product suffers from the same thing every other oil change product does - leaks.

I purchased this from AutoZone and was skeptical.  The rep told me ahead of time that it will eventually leak, just not as bad as the others.  The problems are:

* The top lid can be easily overtightened causing the top large lid to leak.
* The small side cap can be easily cracked just by tightening rendering the pan useless.

It took 3 oil changes for me and this is in the trash.  Back to the cheapo metal pans.

Just to add.. the AutoZone rep was brutally honest and I appreciate that, great store, just a bad product with no good inexpensive ones on the market.",1.0
"This item is poorly made. Even with the cap well put, IT LEAKS! Oil all over my trunk and garage.",1.0
"I bought this product hoping to help with oil changes on my truck & SUV. The wide mouth and screen make the distance the oil drops to the drain pan less of a mess from splatter.  However the durability and execution of this product is questionable.  I am on the second one of these as the cap cracked on the first oil change for the initial pan.  The auto parts store exchanged the pan for a new with no questions.  The second one has lasted through 3-4 oil changes but the side cap leaks (and top cap for that matter) and I wouldn't use this container to transport the used oil without fear of it leaking in my trunk.  Blitz needs to improve their execution of this product before I'll buy another or recommend to a friend.  On a separate note, my Wedco drain pan has lasted 15 years with many successfull oil changes.",1.0
"I have pwned this oil pan for 6 years and I can testify that it leaks from both the end cap when horizontal and the top as you pour.  They are not major leaks, but the leak around the top is sufficient to make a mess when you pour, and the leak around the small plug is enough to allow residual oil in the pan to ooze out after the pan sits for a while.  The opening is also small, such that (at least on my cars) for the first minute or two after the drain plug is removed it cannot catch both the oil stream and the drips from drain port.  This leads to a rather large oil pool under my car.  I came to Amazon to finally find a new one and had to comment after seeing this here.",1.0
"i picked this up from walmart - and it was really cheap. $7-$8. after using it on an oil change, i thought it was a good product because of the design.  but the larger diameter screw cap as well as the smaller drain cap both leak oil. i screwed them on tightly but the oil still seeps out. i found out the hard way as it leaked all inside my car, even after i double bagged it. that makes this product pretty much useless",1.0
"Just like the others said, mine leaked, couldn't stop it which led to a frantic dumping into a 5 gallon bucket.  What a waste of my bucket and my patience as I deal with cleaning up my garage floor.  Total junk.",1.0
I bought this at a local Auto Zone. I went to tighten the smaller drain cap and it cracked. I exchanged it for another and that leaks oil despite the cap not breaking on this one. I left it in a garbage bag and it's half full of oil. How can stores and this company market and sell something like this that obviously does not work? Frustrating to say the least!,1.0
Both the drain cap and the larger top cap leaks oil no matter how well you tighten it.  Grid on top fell in when I set the oil filter to drain on it.  I bought to save myself time in the clean up.  I lost more time than any I could have potentially saved.,1.0
"What an absolute piece of garbage. You won't be thinking about the money you wasted on this thing as hot oil comes splashing over the ""chicken wire"" mesh that sits under the large cover. Yes, the ""chicken wire"" can be removed, perhaps by just touching it and then the whole thing falls into the hot oil, but then you have a large area to drop the drain plug into, The side spout leaks and if you try to tighten it too much, it will pop back out, ditto for the top lid. Oh, by the way the top lid leaks a little bit, too, but if you're taking this thing full of oil somewhere, you better put it into a leakproof container....inside of another leakproof container - and maybe the place will throw the whole piece of junk out for you.

I made a total mess the first time I used this, will get the oil drained and then the whole thing's going into the garbage and I'll look for a better design.",1.0
I purchased this container and it leaks like crazy. It does not matter how tight you tighten the cap on the side. It works its way loose and starts leaking. Also there is a screen on the top below the top lid. It easily falls through the top hole and winds up in the oil.,1.0
"It's a great idea...  But, the big lid on top is difficult to get screwed on correctly with getting it cock-eyed or cross threaded.  And even when you do have it on right, it doesn't seal up very well and allows some oil to leak.",1.0
"This product is horrible.  Nothing about it works correctly.  I purchased this at an auto parts store without doing any research online.  I guess the only good thing about it is that I'm not out more than $10 so assume this is why it has a one star rating.

First of all the opening is too small and the drain plug catch screen causes oil to splatter.  You will be repositioning this thing from start to finish trying to catch the draining oil.  Once finished you will be cleaning oil off your floor and this drain pan.

If you seal it up it will constantly leak oil.  I assumed oil wouldn't leak out of the top if it is laying flat, but somehow any oil on top of the seal will find its way out.  You would need to clean any and all oil from the large opening screen area.  Then you will find that the large cap will not screw on correctly.  You wipe the outside clean and a minute later there is more oil leaking out.

Next is the small drain plug.  This thing cannot be tightened.  Like the large cap if you tighten it too much it pops out of the threads, too little and it will not be sealed.  Either way it leaks.  It took me a few days between changing the oil and dumping it at the recycling drum.  Each day I would wipe up the oil from underneath and from the drain pan itself.  Each time had as much or more oil than last.  When I finally took the used oil to the store I dumped this piece of crap in the trash and bought a basic large open pan for $3.

Buy this oil drain pan if you want to witness a product so flawed that it does nothing right for what should be a simple task.",1.0
"Please save your money and do not buy this, it leaked from both caps... all over my driveway.  Horrible.",1.0
"I've owned two or three of these by now and unfortunately it's about the only type/brand of oil pan sold anywhere near me.  Do not buy this piece of junk, the top lid doesn't screw on tight and the front drain cap leaks.  Considering that oil is a regulated hazardous waste you would think this company would atleast test their product and make sure it doesn't leak before putting it in stores.",1.0
"I bought this and used it exactly one time.  After oil leaked from both caps all over my floor, I threw it away and started over.  Do not buy this.",1.0
"I needed a pan so I bought this at my local auto parts store, took it home and had problems with the lid so I figured it was defective and took it back to exchange it but it had similar problems.

Although I've never had a problem with the small cap, the top lid is a joke at best. It's either loose or semi-screwed on. In either state you will lose a lot of oil. The 2 times I risked taking it to the oil depository I had it on top of old carpet, etc. in the trunk to absorb the oil that might spill.

It has a screen under the lid part which is ridiculous. It actually splashes falling oil onto you and other things. Not only that but mine has fallen inside of the container.

I can't believe so many stores and chains still sell this item after what must be thousands of dissatisfied, and oily, customers.",1.0
"Cap on top does not seal, therefore oil will not stay in the container, making it pretty much worthless.",1.0
"after first use i had oid spilled all over my garage floor...both seals don't hold tight enough no matter what You do. Please don't buy this product, look at other reviews.",1.0
"As others have said, this is an absolute piece of crap.  Neither lid seals, you try to tighten them and they pop off the threads.  As a result, there is no way to store this without leaking out of either the lid on the side or the top.  I wish they would make a decent quality product and just charge a bit more for it.

[...]",1.0
"The opening is too small for automotive use and neither lid seals. Due to the distance between the typical oil pan drain plug and the oil drain pan, the draining oil can easily spill onto the floor and sides of the oil drain pan. The small size also prevents draining the oil pan and changing the oil filter simultaneously. After use, the large lid and drain plug both leaked. I used this product once, returned the oil to a local auto parts chain, and threw the empty oil drain pan in the trash on the way out!",1.0
"I bought this product to prevent oil spills. Conceptually it is sound. Practically, not so much. once it fills with oil, the oil leaks out of the smaller front lid sending oil on to the floor. No matter how you twist the smaller cap it will not make a seal. I am returning this product for a refund. Terrible. In addition, the larger top lid is no better. I bought this from a brick store and compared it to others of the same product, and they all have very poor quality (none of them made proper lid seals). Save yourself a headache and disappointment. Do not buy this product.",1.0
"The oil drain pain in the picture on this product page clearly shows a pour spout.  The ones that are being shipped do not have a spout like this, they just have a small section of the rim that is pushed out.  This is essentially useless as a pour spout and the oil just flows over the rim and onto your garage floor/driveway.",1.0
"Why would anyone make an oil drain pan with a spout that is flush with the top rim?  That's not a spout.  Unless you pour the oil out of this thing at a ridiculously slow rate, the oil just flows over the sides and misses whatever you are trying to pour the oil into.

This thing is going straight into the trash.",1.0
this item is flimsy when filled with 5 quarts of oil. pouring the oil out is a challenge. recomend getting a different kind,1.0
I bought a similar Blitz 10 quart oil drain container at Autozone and have had the same problems as other reviewers. The product looked like a great idea as it had a screen on the opening to rest the filter and prevent the crush washer or drain plug from accidentally falling in. I was shocked to find that the side cap leaks. I actually thought the people at Autozone were at fault and had placed the wrong cap on the product. I went back in the store to try to return it and the clerk showed me that all of the caps were exactly the same. Apparently the cap only screws on over half of the threads on the container! This is one of the most poorly designed products I have ever bought. I mean the whole purpose of the product is to keep the oil in the container without it leaking all over the place until it can be recycled. I have never written a complaint like this before but I felt compelled to do so because of problems with this product. I did submit a complaint on the company via their website and also requested a replacement cap. I will update this review after hearing from the company.,1.0
"This is a great design but executed very poorly.  The concept of a large opening up top and grille to catch the drain plug in the oil pan is smart.  The side spout to drain oil is also well thought out.

BUT...the side spout cap is made of extremely weak plastic.  As others have said, it leaks.  Actually, the threads on mine broke during my 2nd time using it in only 4 months of ownership.  I did not tighten it excessively.  The thickness of the top of the cap is maybe 1/16-1/8 of in inch so it is prone to just break.

You will be better off buying a large flat aluminum cooking pot in a resale shop or garage sale because it will last forever and not 4 months like this product.",1.0
"This is a great concept.  It has a handy screen to catch your drain plug and crush washer, and looks like you could just haul it to your local auto parts store for recycling once you finish draining the crankcase. NOT! Once you get past draining a little over 3 quarts the used oil level gets even with the pour spout (small cap) and starts to leak even with the cap screwed on tightly.  This is because there are no gaskets in either the spout cap or the large top cap.

Further, there aren't enough plastic threads in either cap to prevent leakage.  So, if you're draining a typical 4-quart crankcase, you have to prop this thing up at an angle to avoid the spout leakage, and then transfer it into an actual leak proof container (gallon plastic water bottle?) ASAP to keep used oil from assaulting your garage floor.  Whew, c'mon Blitz, we think you coulda' thought this through a little better.  You make some good products...this just ain't one of them.",1.0
"wow... where to begin.

As mentioned in the other reviews, this LEAKS... which is not what you want when dealing with 5+ quarts of oil... it's a PITA to clean up afterwards.

Draining this is stupid too.. MOST oil pans are TAPERED so that when you drain it the oil goes down a little channel so MOST if not all of the oil is gone... not this.  It's just a hole that is in the side (topped with a screw cap that does NOT stay tight and also leaks)  So you are forced to move the entire container around to get that extra half cup of oil OUT of the pan and then what happens is you get dripps and leaks from the top center larger portion of the lid...

this is absolute garbage... I can't understand who thought this was a great idea to make but obviously they failed as engineers making this thing...",1.0
"Do not buy under any circumstances. Oil leaks out of both caps, a huge unexpected mess. I can't believe they even sell this thing.",1.0
"Sorry folks - MAJOR complaint: purchased the 6 qt. oil drain at a leading national auto parts retailer yesterday...

... I honestly cannot recall purchasing a product so stunningly inferior - no matter how hard I tried to seal the oil, both the large top screw cap as well as the smaller side one leaked. What a mess.

Had to pack the container in several plastic bags, took it back to Advance this morning to recycle the oil. Walked to the rear of the store... to the room that contained the large oil tank - imagine my surprise in seeing two empty, oily Blitz 6 qt. containers, oily bags next to them, discarded and sitting on the top of the tank. Hello!? Two add'l customers obviously felt as I did... screw this container, I'm never using it again. What a piece of junk. My discarded one made three.

One might say ""Buddy, what do you want for this price?"".  NO. Wrong. I'd gladly pay double and more for a quality, leak-proof container I could conveniently use over and over again.

Perhaps what amazes me the most: I'd somehow expect this from a China/Taiwan-made product... but American???!!!!

Additionally: It took less than a minute on Google to find a corroborating negative review from a disappointed Blitz customer.

""Blitz: The Seven Organic Principles?... Identity, Openness, Connectedness, Balance, Creativity, Flexibility, and Wholeness??""... HUH!!!???.... YO, HOW 'BOUT ""QUALITY?""....

...""At Blitz, we have a firm understanding of our identity as a provider of quality consumer products from the Garage to the Garden."" Please. Don't make me laugh.

In summary: Complete waste of money and effort. Recycling oil is supposed to save our environment... instead, there's one more used plastic oil drain container in a landfill. Blitz: you should be ashamed selling such an inferior product -  and shame on any auto parts store for carrying it.",1.0
"the idea of a large drain opening with cap covering entire drain opening is great, but when the product is tipped over, oil leaks out the large drain cap, and also starting with during the draining process, oil leaks out of the cheap little side drain cap (the drain cap easily is overtightend - never makes a good seal).  the world needs a high quality version of this desgin.",1.0
"If you don't mind spilling half or more of your used oil on the garage floor, this product is the one for you! The large diameter lid is great during the draining process, but makes a poor seal and falls off when you tip it up to drain out of the small plug. Truly an item that needs a little more careful design.",1.0
"A tow strap is better than a rope or chain for most recovery operations. But those metal hooks give me the heebie-jeebies. Keeper makes a very good tow strap, but this isn't the one.

Plus it's made of nylon, which stretches to absorb shock and can be used for kinetic recoveries. This is better than nothing, but not the best choice.",1.0

I wasted more time talking to the manufacturer who simply said it wouldn't work, but didn't want to do anything to correct the problem.

Original review that had 4 stars:
I bought this for my husband. He really likes having one, but here are 2 things he says you need to know before you buy this:

1 - it leaks around the base of the applicator tip. It's not on right or something he says. When he presses down on the thumb trigger thing, oil comes out where it's supposed to, but it also comes out just behind the tip, too. It's permanently affixed there, so you can't tighten it.

2 - it leaks around the base of the tube, too. He thinks he may not have it screwed on tight enough, so we'll see now that he's tightened it down.

Would he recommend it? Maybe or maybe not, depending on whether you could find a better one. He likes the size but wishes it didn't leak.

Oh, and he keeps 30 weight oil in it, in case you need to know. I don't know what that means, but you should if you are looking for an oil can.",1.0
