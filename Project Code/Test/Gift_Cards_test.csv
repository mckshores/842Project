"aren't we going to save trees?! :) People who were complaining about paper gift cards can simply buy an electronic gift card via email. It's very convenient and indeed a great gift. I found paper gift cards annoying since you have to always wonder how much money you got left on it. And if you lose it, you lose it. An electronic delivery of the gift card makes it a lot of easier to redeem, you only need to COPY/PASTE the code into your gift certificate balance and it'll be there whenever you want to use it.

I've sent friends electronic gift cards via email for their newborns, for their weddings, and for their housewarmings. :)

Happy holidays",5.0
"You can always get someone something from Amazon with the safety net that they can return it if they don't like it. But returning things is such a hassle. The card takes care of that--no more returns, no more hassles.",5.0

$25 for a $25 Amazon Gift card. Great for gifts and great for holiday presents when you don't know what exactly to get them. What more can I say? It arrives fast and free and comes in a nice packaging so no wrapping is necessary. All you need to do really is to write the person a note or letter for the occasion. Great!,5.0

It's just like having  $100. Except I couldn't get Walmart to accept it. Apparently you can only use it on the interweb at Amazon. That would've been nice to know before my purchase. If you are looking at gift card reviews maybe it's time to seek professional help.,5.0

We I got some 50 dollar gift cards to buy parts to upgrade my old laptop computer at Goody's. The gift cards are fine and you do not have to pay a fee like Visa gift card or master card. But they were not reloadable but are good and safe for small purchases under 500 dollars. And unlike credit cards there is no interest to pay just the amount of the card upfront at point of purchase. So for my experience was good. After these I never want a credit or prepaid debit card for shopping on Amazon.,5.0
"We buy these gift cards for our grandchildren for Christmases and birthdays.  After a child gets to be a certain age, it is difficult to buy the right clothes, toys or electronic gadgets.

The gift card is great.  I have so many ideas of what I want to buy with it. BUT I almost didn't get it.  The delivery (UPS) I think put in under the wheel of my garbage can sitting in my driveway.  The only reason I even found it was that I decided the weather was so nice that I was putting garbage from my car inside large garbage can in driveway instead of dropping it in trash can inside the house. It rained next day and who knows when I would have seen it.,5.0
This was a great idea that AAWL had a baby animal shower via Amazon.  I bought the gift card for them because to ship dog or cat food is ridiculously expensive and I would have hoped that Amazon could have waived the shipping fee since this is for an animal rescue.,5.0

"With children, adolescents, teens, and adults for whom I must shop for birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays, my poor brain gets overloaded with ideas and suggestions.  Then, because we do not all live near one another or get to see on another regularly, I do not always have an idea of what they prefer. BUT. . .I found a sure cure way to please them all and get marvelous thank you notes!

I am willing to share with you.  I send Amazon gift cards!!!!!

For those I like a lot, I send a more expensive card, for those I am just remembering, I send a less expensive one.  No matter, I know that my family and friends can go to Amazon.com and find something that they will really want and with which they will be pleased.

I have had thank you notes for such varied things as towels, sheet music, transformers (that is a toy, I learned), and books.  Not for a moment would I have thought of these gifts and yet they were gratefully received.

AND, your ordering them is as easy as clicking your cursor on one of the links below, entering the information such as to whom it is to go, for how much, and your credit card information.  BUT. . .the GREATEST thing is, if you forget and you are driving to work and remember your mother's birthday is TODAY (YIKES!), you can go to the link and have the card delivered to her computer THAT DAY!!!!!! She can shop for her gift before you get home from work!  Now, you cannot beat that.

So, I highly recommend an Amazon.com gift card to solve your shopping woes.

Delivery was on-time, the gift card was for the desired amount of money and the packaging was satisfactory (actually mildly amusing, stating something like ""exactly what you wanted,"" which pertains since it was given as a gift... hence the name gift card... I digress). Good card. If you want a 25 dollar gift card for Amazon, you've come to the right place.",5.0

"I'm terrible trying to guess what my nieces, nephews, cousins and other relatives want for Christmas. I also dislike sending money even if the bills are fresh, crisp and in a nice bank envelope. But everyone likes money and Amazon sells everything, so why NOT buy anyone an Amazon Gift Certificate? You can send one for any amount by E-mail or print one at home and include it in a nice card or (my favorite), buy a Gift Card made out to the relative and send it to myself, where I can include it in a nice Holiday card. This is the perfect gift!

On an aside, you know how tough banks are about credit cards lately. If you don't use your card in a month or usually a year, your card can be cancelled or the credit limit will be reduced (I have had this happen). So I took my cards with zero balances and bought myself $5 worth of gift certificates made out to myself. Now it shows the banks that I am using my valuable cards and all I have to do is pay off that $5 the next time the bill comes around. I know that most brokers and banks well raise an eyebrow at this, but these are weird times and I will do anything to keep my credit score high. Plus, I get to get a cool gift for myself. PAY OFF YOUR BALANCE IMMEDIATELY! Have fun shopping!

I will be very happy to buy anything from Amazon...you are amazing!",5.0

"I *highly* recommend the electronic versions of the Amazon gift cards as well as the ones you can print on your own. I have never had a problem with either of these methods, nor have any of my card recipients.

Although it is theoretically better etiquette to give a physical card, I've found that because Amazon is an online vendor and the cardholder is going to visit the web to use the card number, recipients enjoy the convenience of having the card information delivered to their inboxes--especially when it's on the day of a special event. If you use the printed versions, you can easily mail or hand deliver your gift with your personalization applied.

In short, make your life easier by sending joy to your loved ones through the technological magic of your computer--they truly will appreciate the sentiment behind your gift regardless of the delivery method.",5.0

I think there should be a way to purchase the gift card online and print it so that the intended recipient could receive it quickly.

"I, too, bought a couple of Amazon gift cards for Christmas gifts and the recipients were thrilled. The difference was that i bought them from a gift card kiosk at a local grocery store. The store personnel activated them in front of me so there were no glitches or shipping delays/charges. I just lucked out - it never would have occurred to me to check reviews on gift cards from Amazon. I just stopped to look at the gift card display in the store and was pleasantly surprised to find Amazon cards as one of the choices. It's ironic that the whole joy of the Amazon shipping experience for me is the online ease and fast, efficient delivery and that's the very thing that caused so much frustration for so many people this holiday. Now, I'm inclined to wonder about some of their electronic systems. I hope they work out their problems..",5.0

I am shopping for Amazon.com gift cards for Christmas gifts and am really so disappointed that out of five choices there isn't one that says ""Merry Christmas"" or mentions Christmas at all!

"Why take 50 dollars of good money with no limitations, and turn it into Amazon money that can only be used at their site? Where is the benefit?

Also, you spend time and headache buying these types of cards, dealing with any activation issues risking expiration or delivery issues and then you have to keep up with them and keep track of how much you have remaining on the card....

"I purchased six $50 Amazon Gift Cards from a local supermarket (Bi Lo) to give as Christmas Gifts in 2015 (something I've done for many years). My Sister-in-law, the recipient of one of those $50 Amazon Gift Cards called me to say that she's lost the Gift Card (most likely accidentally discarded with all of the Christmas paper, etc. and burned in the trash). I told her ""no problem"", since I had kept my receipt from Bi Lo that includes the Amazon Gift Card Number, and I felt certain that Amazon would be able to see that no purchases had been made against their Gift Card Number and that either Amazon or Bi Lo would be able to cancel that card and issue a new one, or Credit her online Amazon Account $50 and bypass issuing a new physical card altogether. I was sadly mistaken.... when she initially contacted Amazon, they told her that since the Amazon Card was purchased from Bi Lo, we would need to take the matter up with them. I went to Bi Lo and was told that there wasn't anything that they could do and that I would need to contact Amazon. Since my Sister-in-law had already contacted Amazon and been turned away, I decided since I was the one who made the purchase and had the receipt, I would call my Credit Card Company first to see if they might be able to offer some assistance in getting the matter resolved since I had purchased all of the Gift Cards with my Credit Card. After 30 minutes discussing the details with my Credit Card Company, they said they understood my dilemma but weren't able to dispute the charge with Bi Lo. They suggested I contact Amazon directly since I had my receipt with Amazon's Gift Card number on and since it was Amazon's gift card. So... after about 30 minutes on the phone with a very nice gentleman from Amazon who made 2 attempts to get his Supervisor to approve some type of credit for the loss, he sadly informed me that Amazon isn't responsible for purchases of their Gift Cards that aren't made from their website. I told him that since Amazon isn't willing to offer any assistance, even though they can clearly see in their system a $50 unused Credit on that lost Gift Card and since I had my receipt with their Gift Card number printed on the receipt (proof that I had purchased their Gift Card), I felt as though Amazon had ROBBED me of $50, since the only one who will benefit financially from this gift transaction is Amazon and I had certainly not intended to add ""Amazon"" as one of my 2015 Christmas names to buy for! Furthermore, I told him that I would not be making any more purchases from Amazon directly or purchasing any other Amazon Gift Cards in the future and would encourage others to do the same. I try not to support businesses that engage in thievery, and that is exactly how I feel I was treated in this instance.",1.0
"Amazon gift cards are the biggest fraud I have ever seen! My husband was issued a $50 gift card from his work over a year ago and had been waiting to use it on something he or I needed. With Christmas just around the corner he and I thought it would be a great idea to use the gift card to buy gifts with. My husband spent $24 dollars and change leaving me a balance of $25 dollars to use if I wanted to buy something. I thought hey this is perfect! I can buy my nephew the movie he asked for and a few other small items for stockings and not break the bank.

Well of course life doesn't work out the way it is supposed to. Because my husband and I each have our own Amazon accounts, created before we were married, and maintained for buying the surprise birthday, Christmas, or anniversary gift. And here is where the CATCH comes in... Any purchases or that were made on an Amazon gift card, or if a gift card was even just registered under a particular individual/account can not be used or shared by someone else. The powers that be at Amazon consider that transferring. This includes any minor children that may have an account not just your spouse. Which means...I would have to spend personal money out of pocket if I wanted to still buy these items off Amazon, instead of using a perfectly good gift card that would have covered the balance. Or the other option which was never suggested was log into my husbands account not look at what he bought me in his previous purchase section and buy what I wanted for my nephew and kids on my husbands account only after I ask him for his password (which he would have given me.)

Don't bother taking into account that minors can not own items so to restrict the transfer of property (from parent to child) is illegal and minors can not be bound to such agreements ...and I myself live in a joint property state so at the end of the day what is my husbands is mine and mine is his.",1.0

"I just tried to buy an iPod for my daughter with our gift cards from Christmas. It turns out you can only use one gift card per order. The call rep I spoke with acted like it was very generous that Amazon allows customers to combine both credit cards and gift cards in one order.  She repeatedly sited ""security reasons"" as why I could only use one gift card at a time.

Considering Amazon issued the gift cards AND my credit card, I don't understand how they can't figure out security issues that would then allow me to actually use these things. I wouldn't have thought Amazon would be so petty as to cause customers to make multiple orders on low cost items and force cash or credit payments for higher cost ones, but that is obviously the case. It is even more irritating that they sell gift cards for $100 but I couldn't use two at $25. I will definitely NOT be buying any more gift cards from Amazon.",1.0

""One-day shipping"" is a total joke in my case.  Yes, I could have done the one where I email it to my dad or print it out, but I thought I'd do something nicer that I could put in the card I'm sending him.  That card has yet to go out.

"Received this product as a gift. I rubbed off the film that covers the claim code and the claim code rubbed away with it. The card can't be used without the claim code. Make a better card, Amazon.

I must contact the person who purchased it and that person must go back to he store that sold it to them. That person is 2 time zones away and we all live busy lives. The trouble it would take to make this happen is great and I'm sure Amazon knows it.

I think the maker of the shoddy product should accept reponsibility for selling lemons. Own up Amazon. I have the card and receipt. Why can't I ship the card and receipt directly to Amazon and have Amazon credit my account? How many other Amazon gift card recipiants will share the same experience and not be able to spend their Christmas gifts?

"Unlike most of the other reviews here where people bought the cards & gave them as gifts, I'm one who was given one of these as a gift.

And with all that considerateness, I've ended up with a worthless gift card that's not activated.  I like using Amazon, but my own experience here with these cards is extremely negative.  I can see from the reviews that this is a VERY common problem, and Amazon, you're ending up with customer's money without them getting a product in exchange.  I know that's good for the 'ol profit margin, but I can't believe you operate that way.  So... you'd better find out what the problem is and FIX IT.

"First time I've ever had a problem with getting an item through Amazon, but since I never got my gift card, (but got charged for it), I have to rate this pretty low.

The card has been ""stuck"" at some mail sorting center in Capitol Heights MD, but I have no tools or options to fix this situation.

"U.S.P.S delivery tracking claims that my gift card was delivered, but I never got it. This appears to be the first item ever stolen from my mailbox in 7 1/2 years.

The upshot is that I'm out the $25.00 I paid to Amazon, and Amazon provides no way for me to even inform them that the gift card was stolen/lost.

Instead, give a check or some other type of gift card for that you buy in person.",1.0
"Be very careful with all of your Amazon gift card purchases!  Amazon is not up front in letting you know the card will not cover ALL of their merchants.

I attempted to make the purchase with a $200 gift card I had previously purchased from Amazon.  Since the promotion forced me to take the $25 gift card, I was not allowed to use my $200 gift card for the purchase.  I was not aware of this until they billed my credit card company.  After 3 hours on the phone with people I had difficulty understanding, I was forced to send back the ITOUCH I originally purchased, turn in the $25 gift card and repurchase the ITOUCH with my $200 gift card.

I ordered a gift card on 12/12 for my nephew for Christmas and was told it would arrive by 12/17. By 12/24 it had not arrived so I called Amazon. Another card was issued and I received it on 12/28. I was tracking the original card and it apparently was held up somewhere in Kentucky. When I called Amazon with my complaint the woman I spoke with initially had some difficulty understanding my call. I was on the phone with her much longer than I would have anticipated. My new card did arrive in a timely manner. I am somewhat surprised that Amazon didn't offer me a credit for not sending the original card.,1.0

"The card I purchased was stolen before it even came to me.  First Amazon said that it hadn't left UPS, then they said it hadn't gotten to UPS, then they said someone else used the card.

I have to dispute the charge to my credit card, which is Amazon!  They either get to keep my money for awhile or collect interest if I don't pay.  That's the scam.  I have been a loyal customer since year 1.  That just changed.  BEWARE OF PURCHASING THIS ITEM.  IT IS NOT A SAFE PURCHASE.",1.0
"I am a devoted Amazon shopper.  However, I received a $50 gift card in the mail from a family memeber, and to my horror, I had actually almost mistaken it for junkmail and thrown it out.  If you are giving a physical GC as a gift, consider having it sent to yourself first, and then re-sending to your intended recipient as the computer generated address and return address make the envelope look as if it contains unwanted junkmail (as it just appears as mail being sent from ""Amazon.com""), and they may just toss it out before ever even opening it.  I have not tried to redeem it yet, and hope I am not further disappointed as others have been.",1.0
"We intended to buy the gift card and turn around and use it to buy the last WII product we bought for $43.95. We didn't expect to be charged another $50 for the gift card, but did expect to have $6 or $7 left to spend on another gift through Amazon.",1.0

I got an email from Amazon saying so, but getting it activated was the hard part.  I had to email Amazon Costumer Service three times to get the card activated.  For the first email I received the shipping information, which I had already been following through my account.  The second email went unanswered and finally with the third, after I expressed my displeasure with the service I was receiving and the product, I got the card activated.  I will never order another Amazon gift card.  While I thought it would be a good gift, I have found it to be nothing but a hassle.  I do not recommend this product.

"I LOVE AMAZON. I save up all my change and go to the market and trade the change in for an Amazon Redemption code, it is great for Christmas time, especially in this economy. Anyway. I have a redemption code with over $70.00 on it. So I figured I will buy a Amazon Gift Certificate with my redemption code. When I started the process online, there was no space for a Redemption Code, so I called Customer Service.

The customer service representative was VERY VERY hard to understand and went off on a taget about redemption codes and how you get them. All I wanted to know is why I couldn't buy a gift certificate with this PREPAID redemption code. She said something that I didn't understand and I asked for the boss.. they kept trying to tell me that the redemption code was a gift certificate and you can't buy a gift certificate with a gift certificate. All and all I think that most companies would just taken the redemption code and given me the darn gift certificate. Needless to say I am not ever going to try that again :)",1.0

"I ordered one $50 card to be sent directly to my sister-in-law for Christmas 3 weeks before Christmas.  I am amazon prime and the projected arrival date was the expected 2 days after purchase.  7 days later it had not shipped and I called about it.  Rep in India after much weavingf and ducking said it was delayed because it was Christmas Amazon Prime meant nothing to him but he assured me that it would ship the next day overnight to make up for it.  Two days later and no shipped notice - I called again who barely spoke English and who said they had shipped the card to me but it hand't shipped.  She hung up on me when I demanded a supervisor.  This run around continued for another 3 days when  card arrived at my house and I got a shipped notice that one was beinjg shipped to the intended by the US mail.  It arrived after Christmas and took several calls to figure out which one was the activated one.

Totally Amazon's fault for not arriving on time.  Through this whole farce, the web site showed cutomers that it could arrive the next day even though they were taking 7-10 days just to process them.  Also showed all the different shipping options and 2 day for Prime members when in reality they were being sent by mail.

I will never buy one again, request one as a gift or suggest one as a gift for anybody else. I'm doing less business here because I am sick to death of having to deal with customer service reps in India who just want to argue and have no idea of the concept of service.",1.0

I was very disappointed with the Amazon gift card. This was a gift for my wife along with the kindle 2. I thought that since the kindle didn't come with any books I would include some via a gift card. My wife has gone through 4 books in the two weeks since I bought her the kindle, but we still haven't found a way to use the gift card at the Amazon Kindle store.

The receipt stated that it would take a few minutes for it to go through before I could print it out.  After an hour and a half of waiting, I finally called customer service, and was told that I had to wait up to 24 hrs!!!

"I wanted an item that was 300.00 after tax and shipping was free and was given 3 different gift cards for 100.00 each for the 300.00 item I wanted!

I have my credit card on my account from a past order but wasn't prepared to use it for the item I wanted.... I checked the box saying I wanted to use the 300.00 gift card balance option it gave me  and since the gift cards were 100.00 each, they used 1 of the 100.00 cards and charged the rest to my unprepared cedit card... I was shocked!

I wasn't prepared for that with my credit card especially after the holidays, so of course it declined the extra 200.00 I was expecting the gift cards to have covered....
and I wanted to use the 300.00 in gift cards, not my credit card on my account from previous use of Amazon.

 I called customer service and kept getting a woman who I could not understand, telling me the same thing over and over as if she was reading from a script to me, telling me she couldn't help me and would forward my issue to another department and they would get back with me by email within 12 hours.

I get an email later stating i need to choose another payment method, as my credit card delined! UM, DUH! I didn't wish to use my card, I wanted to use the gift card balance!!

So, I wrote to explain this back to them and no answer, it has been a week, and my order was cancelled.

I still have a 300.00 gift card balance but cant use it for the 300.00 item I wanted only can use 100.00 at a time! RETARDED!

"As a long time Amazon.com customer, a gift card seemed like a good purchase. I am just trying to purchase a card to have e-mailed. I basically wanted to convert a Visa debit gift card into an Amazon.com gift card. I put the amount of the card in, the number and expiration date. Amazon accepted it as payment, but after hours of not receiving a confirmation e-mail I checked the site to see what was going on. The site claimed they could not confirm the payment, yet they had already taken money off the Visa gift card. I contacted customer service who told me a Visa gift card is not the best way to purchase an Amazon gift card and they would refund the money to the Visa gift card. I then put in another order using my Amazon.com credit card. A card I have used thousands of times before and never had a problem. This time, I received the same message I got when using the Visa gift card. I contacted Customer Service again. The first person I spoke to told me I had a ""Block"" on the account. She could not tell me why that was there, and she informed me she could remove it immediately. This claim brought me some concern so I asked to speak with her manager to find out the reason  a ""Block"" had been placed. The manager claimed there was no ""Block"" on the card and the sale should have gone through fine. So, I again went back and checked on the sale. Again there was a message that it could not be paid using the payment option I had selected. I called back again and told them to cancel the sale. This is extremely disappointing to me, as I have felt for quite some time that Amazon was one of the last customer service oriented sellers around. I guess they too have been pushed to the ""Make money, screw the customer"" attitude this country has been forced into with our economic situation. A trusted company has gone down the drains. I hope to see you come back to your original ideals some day Amazon.",1.0

As an fyi, the customer service people do not appear to have a clue, as they told me it will take 12 to 48 hours to receive an email gift certificate, but I had it in less than 2 minutes.

"Joining the ECA is easy enough, you can purchase a card like this and they even have periodic promotions where joining costs nothing! Pretty great deal, right? After all, you get all the perks that an ECA membership has to offer like 10% off all game purchases at Amazon.com, er, wait, no...they got rid of that, all for free!

Well, it seemed like a great deal and many gamers joined at the time with the understanding that turning off the memnbership's ""auto-renew"" feature would be as easy as the radio button in the member's area of the website. Turns out, the ECA has decided that the ""auto renew"" option should never have been on the site in the first place and that the only way to cancel a subscription is to snail-mail your request. Furthermore, they can't guarantee your mailed-in request won't be misplaced so be sure to fork over the dough for certified mail. Finally, if you think you're safe because the card you used is soon to expire, don't think so fast, the ECA has decided that it is within it's rights in changing the expiration date you submitted and re-runing the transaction. What's all this mean? It means that without jumping through hoops, your card could be charged indefinitely for an ECA membership...I really hope the word gets out about this.

The irony of a consumer advocate group pulling stunts like this is almost too good to be true.",1.0
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MEMBERSHIP FOR ANY REASON

Hal, the creator of the ECA has famously stated earlier on how TOS/EULA's are so dangerous to the industry with their legal jargon and constantly changing terms. So instead of enforcing his supposed beliefs into his own organization he does the exact same thing here yet even to a higher degree, by pulling shady things like forcing users into mandatory arbitration agreements striping away their legal rights, forcing through expired credit cards by changing the date, removing the lines stating we could cancel by phone and then stating we get a notice 30 days before the subscription ends to make cancelations yet we have to submit the request to cancel at least 30 days prior to the end date. All the while making changes to the TOS with no notice this has been done and without contacting any of its members.

The ECA advertises discount that do not exist such as getting 10% off direct2drive purchases. Its advertised as a perk before joining but logging into the benefits section there is no discount for them but an expired coupon for Borderlands. It has been this way for several weeks and all requests for support just avoid the question stating they're working on new discounts or that they don't have any control over what the sponsors offer.

The situation was made entirely worse when the ECA decided to announce all of the sudden the autorenew button on the website never infact worked at all after leaving it up for several weeks. The announcement was made that users would then need to pay for certified mail to cancel which is ridiculous and seems to go directly against CT statutes prohibiting this activity. Making it difficult to cancel for users only put the message out that the ECA was only interested in taking money from its users who didn't want to put up with all the roadblocks you set up to cancel. I will say it again- the ECA has removed all methods of canceling your account online. They require a credit card at signup for a reason, they intend to do everything in their power to prevent users from canceling only to be able to charge you every year. The reasoning they say this is they want a paper trail, which is funny considering they state they're going going ""green"".

Instead of Hal and the ECA taking this opportunity to reassure members and correct the PR nightmare at hand, they instead take to attacking its members in his statement placing the blame on everyone but the ECA and still avoided important questions people were waiting on answers for.

If you go to their  forums looking for answers you will be met with a great deal of hostility from the moderators who instead of offering help and answers simply deleted threads and threatened bans for asking questions that had been asked before, while at the same time refusing to give the actual answer or where they could find it. Again, you will get banned for asking for help there.

The ECA is a scam. They will steal your money and instead of fighting for consumer advocacy and rights they suppress them.",1.0
"As others have mentioned, the ECA is a shady organization masquerading under the guise of an advocacy group for gaming rights and first amendment protections for videogames.  Initially, the group offered a number of benefits as perks for membership, but of those, many are offers that you can get on one's own at any time (such as a free trial of Gamefly).  The best perks have been dropped.

The greater problem is that in order to activate membership, you are required to provide a credit card number, even for a pre-purchased membership or a free membership (given through various promotions). They make it very easy to become a member.  However, they make it nearly impossible to stop being a member.  The ECA charges regular fees that you cannot get out of unless you cancel your member ship through a very specific form of WRITTEN correspondence (no e-mail or website help at all), and well in advance of your membership due date.

If you have recently become a member, I suggest you begin the proceedings to cancel now, and keep multiple copies of everything you send and receive.  You might just get out of your contract by 2011.",1.0
"Beware of signing up with ECA.  They claim to represent the best interests of gamers, and that sounds great on paper, but they way they treat you when they get your credit card on file is far from being in your best interests.

The have continuously changed and edited their Terms of Service without asking members to re-accept the new terms, as most legitimate organizations will do (most organizations let you know the TOS has changed, not the ECA).

Their Terms of Service clearly states AT THIS TIME they will change the expiration date on your credit card if your card expires.  They will change the expiration date until they get a ""hit"" to continue to charge you a fee.

If you try to simply cancel your credit card on file with them to stop them from charging you, their President has stated they will file fraud charges against you through your credit card company.

The only way to cancel your membership is by sending a snail mail letter.  Yes, you can sign up on their website very easily, but have to send a letter in the mail to cancel.  They also state they will not confirm receipt of your cancellation letter, meaning if it is ""lost"" in the mail, they will continue to charge you.

Their forums on their website have banned all new registrants the past few days without people even making one post.  New registrations to their forums have also been shut down at this time.

When your first year of membership is up, they say they will inform you with 30 days left that your account membership will be auto-renwed for another $20, problem is, if you want to cancel, they have to receive your letter in the mail BEFORE the final 30 days.  So when you get the notice that they are going to auto renew you for another year, it is already to late to cancel since you CANNOT cancel your membership on their website or by phone.

Finally, simply check out their Better Business Bureau rating.  It states as I type this that ""This business is not currently rated. BBB has recently received numerous complaints against this business, and will issue a rating after it has fully evaluated them.""

Your membership with the ECA auto renews each year and they have recently changed their cancellation policy (with no proper notification to it's members of this change) to state that the the ONLY way to cancel your membership with them is to mail them a letter which is absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.

 This arcane cancellation process was defended by the ECA by calling many of it's own members who did not wish to cancel in this manner ""lazy"". You have NO option to cancel on their website, not through email, and not by telephone.

The gift card is a scam - you get charged a fee to purchase the actual card (even if you just require a code to email the voucher to someone and there is absolutely nothing Amazon need to do other than take your money and give you the code online).

"If I am incorrect, please forgive me, but as far as I have been able to establish, the person to whom the gift card was sent IS NOT ABLE TO USE IT AT ALL. I live in South Africa, and so does the recipient of the gift card. It appears that purchases may not be made on the card from South Africa. Whether the recipient wants to purchase software applications or physical goods to be shipped makes no difference. Apparently Amazon does not ship to South Africa. There may be a good reason for this, but why can you not sell games/applications to people in South Africa? These things do not require physical delivery. And if this is the case, why do you not have some kind of control in place to warn people with South African based e-mail addresses that their gift cards will be completely valueless, which is the minimum any consumer would be entitled to expect in such a case? Amazon was prepared to take my $75.00 and send the gift card to an e-mail address in South Africa, but now refuses to honour the card.

"We were trying to save trees and hassle for people who wanted to give us gift cards.  We assumed, like everything else on Amazon, that this process would be easy and convenient.  However, we ran into the following problems:

1.  It was not easy/intuitive to even get the gift cards onto the registry
2.  It was harder than it seems like it should have been to receive the gift cards
3.  The emails to redeem the gift cards did not work more than half of the time.

To expand on #2, I don't know why a wedding registry linked to my Amazon account could not just automatically deposit the gift card balance onto my Amazon account.  The process is that you get an email sent to your email address and then you redeem the gift card using the code in your email.  Although inefficient and mildly annoying, this process would be fine if it worked consistently.

However, in more than half of the instances where people bought us these cards, it did not work; we did not receive the emails with the proper codes in them even though we received a note from Amazon saying that a gift card had been purchased.  Granted, the times that it didn't go through could have been due to our guests mis-typing our email address.  But even though we could see that the guests bought us the gift card, there is nothing we could do on our side to get the credit according to Amazon support.

So we were left in the unenviable position of having to contact our guests and have THEM deal with Amazon customer service to get the problem resolved, which is mildly embarrassing.

The customer service guy I talked to said that privacy was the reason that these could not be directly linked to our Amazon account, but it seemed that this would be by far the most efficient way to redeem these cards.  I'm guessing this inefficient process is at least partially intentional so that at least part of the gift cards purchased do not get redeemed, making Amazon more money.  It's disappointing.",1.0

"CAUTION: I purchased a $200.00 Amazon Gift Card for Christmas for my son, and had it sent to me so I could send it to him with a personal card and note. The card was stolen in the mail and used by the thief (likely a postal employee). Amazon refused to replace the card or make a refund, even though, they know who illegally used the card. Amazon places the activation code on the back of the card so that whoever has the card, legitimately or illegitimately, can use it.

I also purchased Walmart gift cards to send to other relatives and had them sent to me so I could also send them with personal messages. Walmart mailed the cards to me, but emailed me the activation code. One of these cards was also stolen in the mail at the same time the Amazon card was stolen; however, since the activation code was not on the card, it could not be used by the thief. Walmart replaced this stolen card free of charge and sent it directly to my intended recipient.

Walmart does their gift cards properly, Amazon does not. Amazon will no longer be on my shopping list.",1.0

Trying to email this gift card 3x and it was never received by the recipient. Then had to get amazon customer service involved. What was suppose to be easy was a hassle. They really need to fix this funuction.,1.0
My nephew still hasn't recieved the gift card through email. I've resent twice. I even tried sending to a different email account - nothing. I would not recommend using this service.,1.0
"The link to Facebook appears to be broken. There's nothing but a spinning circle under #3 and when I try to order, it says it can't find my Facebook friends. I called the outsourced support people and Bangalore confirmed that it's broken. They didn't fix it, just agreed that it doesn't work for them either. This seems kind of typical of how a lot of things have been working at Amazon over the last year (prime instant video as an example). I think maybe they need some good competition. Here's hoping they get it, as it will be better for all of us.",1.0
"How can I give a positive review to a gift card that was to be delivered on August 3rd and did not arrive?  You do not send gift cards to the house in Canada and I did not have a printer.  When I phoned about the gift that was not delivered on August 3rd, the answer I received from the person on the other end of the phone (too many times to count) was ""OF COURSE THIS CARD WAS NOT DELIVERED BECAUSE YOU ORDERED IT FOR AUGUST 3RD"". I DID TELL THE YOUNG LADY ON THE PHONE NUMEROUS TIMES THAT IT WAS AUGUST 5TH AND THAT THE 3RD COMES BEFORE THE 5TH!!!

I was also told I would get a written report on the mistake within 2 days.  I guess that September 12th also comes before August 3rd.",1.0
"Received an offer through the app for $15 credit when purchasing a $50 gift card.  Tried to use the code and had to delete the gift card off the order because they couldn't split a payment for goods and gift cards.  Was going to charge the whole thing to my credit card instead of taking the goods off an existing gift card and charge the new gift card to my credit card.

Now when I try to get the promotion back it's saying that the code has been used for my account and when i contact customer service they claim no knowledge of the offer and directed me to a different $10 for $100 offer.

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!",1.0
"I have sent Amazon gift cards to numberous persons as gifts, directly from the Amazon site or as part of an American Greeting ecard.  The problem is Amazon does not provide any information as to whether the givr card was received by intended person or whether it was used.  If I order a package to be delivered by mail, I get a tracking number and can follow it to destination.  No so with Amazon gift card.  It seems as if Amazon is not only fine with not providing the feedback, it is in their interest for the card to never be used.  More transparency is needed.",1.0

"Gift cards are always a welcome gift, but I bought two cards for Mothers Day and Amazon screwed them up again and again, failing to deliver.  As a result I had to spoil the surprise and call my intended recipients to ask that they look in their spam/deleted folder.  The email addresses were correct, but Amazon couldn't deliver ever.  Finally, I had to have them sent to me and I forwarded them after Mothers Day had come and gone.  Usually Amazon is aces at what they do but they sure dropped the ball on this one.",1.0
"Do NOT buy!!

I was locked out of my account! Customer service claimed that they thought I was ordering from a different country. I placed the first order in my hometown. It kept screwing up. I tried again the next day at a friends home in a different state, and I was locked out of my account. I couldn't even change my password! I had to call for help, which took forever. Then, customer service gave me lame excuses!

Frankly, Im not trusting Amazon enough to order anything unless I am in my own home ever again.",1.0

"I ordered two gift cards of $50 each to be sent to my sisters.  Neither got an email from Amazon.  I sent a 2nd request, and still nothing got to them.  Finally, I sent them the order number you sent me, in hopes they can use that to cash in on the gifts I sent.

Gift cards to two separate recipients could not be opened, one, after many calls to Amazon, was finally opened, the other recipient was unable to open it and after a number of tries and a number of additional calls to Amazon they said we would receive our $100 refund within 2 days. It has now been 30 days and still no refund! I would not recommend an Amazon eGift Card. They really deserve 0 stars!",1.0

Had to make calls and emails for others. Mixed up and hard to resolve. Ended up having $$ credited to my account and had to buy new one. Will not ever do this again. The physical card is the only way to go. This online gift card for last minute gift is not an option.",1.0

"Do not try to order a gift card on your cellphone using the Amazon app. I tried several times to purchase one on my Google pixel last night but all I got was a spinning icon.  Then I wasted almost 30 minutes try to resolve the problem via Amazon chat but none of the 3 reps I texted with was able to fix the problem. One told me to email a copy of the screenshot to their customer service email but that seemed like a waste of time since the rep didn't confirm that they got it. Then they asked me to try placing the order on my PC but I didn't have access to mine last night. I could have avoided all the frustration if they would have just came out and said that I couldn't place the order using a cellphone. In my opinion, that is very poor customer service.",1.0
"Sent gift card to friend in the United States and they could only use it for delivery to a Canadian address....  Not very happy at all...  Either of us...  Poor service at best....

You'd think that a gift card for eBooks would be the perfect present to give someone who lives in a different country and is traveling around a lot. Unfortunately Amazon is not an international country and it just doesn't work. The recipient couldn't use it because of lack of internationalization. Bad service Amazon and a total waste of money.,1.0
I bought this gift card for my daughter's birthday so that she could purchase her Prime membership for her new Kindle Fire.

"I bought some of these gift cards for relatives in the UK, however they can only use them on amazon.com and not .co.uk.
if they do use them on amazon.com, then they will have to pay additional shipping and don't get the same selection of products to choose from.
