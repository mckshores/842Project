"Believe me, over the years I have tried many, many different hand creams. I am one of those people whose hands get so dry they have little cracks all over them.

Of all the hand creams, this is the best. It really moisturizes but doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy. And it lasts. I think a lot of lotions just have too much water in them. It has a very nice, subtle scent. I have to avoid a lot of lotions just because the scent is too strong!

I am overall very ""frugal"" but I think this cream is worth the money.",5.0
Great hand lotion,5.0
This is the best for the severely dry skin on my hands,5.0
The best non- oily hand cream ever. It heals overnight.,5.0
Ive used this lotion for many years. I try others occasionally and always come back to Gardners. Please don't change a thing.,5.0
Works great for dry hands.,5.0
The best hand cream ever.,5.0

Its a great moisturizer especially for gardners,5.0
This hand cream is the best! Have been using it for years. Keeps my hands soft all day,5.0
I am a healthcare care professional that suffers from dry hands.  This hand lotion has changed my life.  I keep it on the desk nearby.  The hand therapy instantly improves the discomfort from dry hands.,5.0
have used on and off for years. Product is good for dry skin. I like the smell but it may be strong for some.,5.0
Great hand cream,5.0
"This is my favorite lotion!  I have loved it for many years. The smell is one that men and women would like.  It's not a fruity or perfume scent, more herbal?  Its hard to explain.  The lotion is just amazing though. Not greasy at all.  You have to try it at least once :)",5.0
My wife loves the Gardeners hand cream and liquid soap.,5.0
"I always loved this lotion ,glad you had it",5.0
Absolutely great. Cleared my hands in just three to four applications. Would definitely recommend to others with dry rough hands.,5.0
use all the time,5.0
I haven't found anything I like as well for my dry hands and nails.. and I love the pump bottle,5.0
Bought this for my mom - she loves the stuff.,5.0
"My all-time favorite hand lotion. Smells heavenly and has just the right texture, not too heavy but not too light.",5.0
I love it because it does not leave skin feeling greasy.  I don't like that it is so expensive.,5.0
This is about the only lotion that gets my hands thru cold New Hampshire winters.  It's not oily. And doesn't leave my hands wanting more.  It is a life saver.,5.0
"I am sensitive to strong or artificial scents, and this always has a nice level.  It provides long-lasting moisture, but not greasy after a minute or so (I scrub my hands and nails with a brush after gardening/cleaning, dry them somewhat and apply).  At the promotional price, it was an excellent value for something I've loved using for over 20 years.",5.0
"Like many, my hands get extra dry in the winter.  It was so bad this year, none of my fingerprints were unlocking my phone anymore.  So annoying.  I'd moisturize at night, but it wasn't so helpful.  Someone left a bottle of this C&E moisturizer in the bathroom at work and after using it about once a day after washing my hands (it was annoying to take off rings more than once), my fingerprints started working again.  I wasn't expecting that!",5.0
"Well worth the price, as I know my wife scrapes the bottle to reach the last dollop of Crabtree & Evelyn hand cream. She keeps one in her car and one on her desk. Gifts are easy when you know she enjoys Crabtree & Evelyn products so much.",5.0
Used this for years. Handy to keep in my purse.,5.0
This is a wonderful hand cream that really works wonders. It softens and moisturizers. I have used it for years and now find it easy to order on Amazon.,5.0
Love this stuff!  Just wish I paid attention to the size.,5.0
This works very well without leaving your hands feeling greasy. It's perfect actually.,5.0

The best!,5.0
The best!,5.0
Actually bought this to share with my husband as he loves it as much as I do. I even used the pump to put some back in a 3.5oz tube that was almost gone. It's a favorite scent that can be used year round :),5.0
My favorite hand cream! Love it!,5.0
Best hand loton ever.  Bit pricey.  Has slight fragrance that wears off relatively fast.  I have issues with fragrance normslly but it's not been a problem.,5.0

great stuff!!,5.0

My favorite lotion and cheaper than from the store!,5.0
Bought as a gift. Great lotion.,5.0
Was a gift,5.0
This hand cream is amazing. My sister had a tube and when I needed some lotion she told me she only had this hand cream. I loved It right away. It made my hands so soft and it smells great. Bought a tube the next day.,5.0
"This is my go-to winter hand cream. Amazing smell, such a nice creamy feel and keeps my hands very hydrated.",5.0
"First off, my metal bottle and the pump arrived totally undamaged and fully functioning (this was something others had complained about).

The scent is kind of a spicy herb smell.  Not overly mild, but very pleasant and not overpowering in my opinion.  I'd rank it as milder than the average Bath & Body Works lotion.  I'd love an even milder scent for my husband, but he doesn't hate it, and actually prefers it to the off-putting scent of things like unscented Lubriderm (which still has a strong odor).

I'd had a tube of this about 15 or so years ago that lasted me for years and years, and thankfully this seems to be about the same product.  The formula is super thick and concentrated, and does not need to be applied quite as liberally as many other standard lotions.  Additionally, the formula doesn't cause as severe of pain when applied to skin that is literally splitting open from dryness.  This is a must have for people whose hands or other parts of the body start to bleed during the winter without constant attention.  I wouldn't recommend it for daily full body application due to the price and thickness, but it's great for targeting problem areas.",5.0
very good,5.0
This handcream has a beautiful fragrance. It doesnt stay on or protect your hands through washing.  This size is quite small.,5.0
Nicely scented lotion. Small in size and great in the winter.,5.0
Bought for my daughter.,5.0
Great cream for the skin.,5.0
This is one of my favorite creams. Highly recommend!!! Keeps hands moisturizers for a long time. Worth every penny.,5.0
"I simply love this lotion!  Originally, I received it as a gift.  Have been buying it ever since!",5.0
"This actually helped fix my wife's hands, which have bothered her for years.  It is not greasy or water-downed.  It's pricey, but it's worth it.",5.0
"A favorite, love that this can be purchased online with quick delivery throughPrime",5.0
"This is one of my favorite hand creams, ever. Smells lovely, like a light fresh herbal scent. Makes hands silky smooth with no greasy film.",5.0
"The texture is great for dry ""winter skin"", and the scent is light and floral. I love this hand cream and buy it again and again.",5.0
Everything was great! Product arrived on time and was exactly as described and pictured! No complaints!,5.0
"I've tried many, many different hand lotions, but have never found one that works as well as this one.  I put this on my hands (you don't need much), then put on a pair of spa gloves for about a 1/2 hours.  Awesome results!  Even better when you use the Gardener's Pumice first!!",5.0
Best around.,5.0
Excellent product for Gardners who refuse to wear gloves and use their hands to work with soil.,5.0
"The best hand cream, with subtle fragrance.",5.0
Excellent product for working outdoors those little cuts and scrapes will heal quick using this cream.,5.0
I have to wash my hands a lot for work and this is my favorite hand lotion after a long day. Works like magic and makes my hands feel really good.,5.0
The BEST hand cream you will ever use! Leaves your hands super soft and hydrated. It's like a drink of water for your hands.,5.0
"This is not an inexpensive product but it is the very best hand lotion that I've ever used.  When I pump a bit on my hands and spread it into my skin, my hands stop being dry and uncomfortable, although it's a classic case of, ""I didn't know that they hurt until they stopped hurting.""  I've never used anything nearly as effective.  I'm male and often work outdoors and with my hands and caring for my skin is simply not something that I do.  This stuff, though, works.",5.0
My favorite lotion hands down (pun intended). Smells divine and makes my hands really soft. This is my third bottle. The last one lasted a year and it has been on my desk all that time...I use it every day. Great quality.,5.0
"I was told by my dad to pick up a trade while I was an undergrad, and that trade was beauty. I worked at The Body Shop, Sephora, and MAC. Never had I had a problem with dry/cracked hands; however, my mother did and my beloved almond Body Shop hand cream wasn't enough.

Someone told me to get this product, so I got the smallest size, just in case. Wish I had bought her this size, as this was now her go-to!

Skip forward over a decade, and I'm pregnant with my 1st and only child. I had the most difficult pregnancy, so I picked up sewing as a stress reliever (plus, I could make my son his own clothes and cloth diapers!) Little did I know that sewing DESTROYS your hands!

You cannot have a greasy hand cream while sewing, as it'll ruin your fabric. Also, you need fast access to your cream, and twist tops just don't do the job. Lastly, when your fingers, fingernails, cuticles crack and peel, it can snag your fabric and threads, destroying your garment.

I remembered this product and quickly bought the tube. THANK THE LORD I REMEMBERED THIS STUFF!!! Saved my life and fabric!

The pump is the best price--dollar per ounce--and the most convenient. The smell is great and the product is soaked up by my abused hands in seconds. Never have I ruined a good piece of silk, and rarely do my fingers snag fabric. The only time it does happen is when I forget to moisturize my hands.

My mom works in electronics and is the lead of production. She files papers all day and sometimes has to handle electronic components to help others. Her hands would crack and bleed from her work. It was painful to look at! Plus, she, too, cannot use greasy products, as that would ruin the electronics.

As she worked along with C&E Gardner's, her hands became normal once again, no longer embarrassing her. We love this stuff, and if it came by the gallon, we'd invest in tubs!",5.0
Best hand cream ever,5.0
"Favorite and first go-to tool in my gardening kit!!! Try this: 1) Slather hands, with excess under your nails. 2) Don gardening gloves. 3) Garden till you drop! 4) Remove gloves, wash hands, and enjoy the lovely soft skin! :)",5.0
"The absolute best hand cream. Silky, not sticky or greasy.  Also when I use it daily, my nails are stronger and grow longer. The price is too high. Period. But it is my yearly indulgence. A bottle lasts almost the whole year, using it nightly.",5.0

Best ever hand cream,5.0
I am an avid gardener and I used this religiously. It's the best product for making my hands refreshed after a scub and. I use it before going to bed and the scent dissipates. Everyone I have given it to loves Love's it as do I. I agree C&E needs to do something about the palm oil.,5.0

perfect,5.0
"C&E hand cream is the most emollient cream I've tried, It does what it says it will,and the nice scents are lovely as well (not too overpowering) It's on the spendy side,but w/all the hand work many of us do,we deserved it.",5.0
One of the best moisturizers for super dry skin. And the fragrance is lovely too,5.0
"best ever, my favorite hand cream",5.0
"This is my very favorite hand lotion. I have used it for years, and nothing else compares for me. It is fantastic for dry hands and has a lovely, spicy scent. It's hard to find that combination of effectiveness and nice scent in hand lotions that actually work well! It is on the pricey side, but high quality and definitely worth it. Highly recommend!",5.0
This skin cream is so rich in moisture. I apply it on my feet nice and smooth.,5.0

Love this hand cream.,5.0
"I gave a variety of the hand creams out as stocking stuffers a couple of years ago and my husband really liked Gardeners and had been using it sparingly because he didn't want to run out.  He finally got to the end of his supply so he asked if I would get him more.  He is hard to please when it comes to lotions and moisturizers, but this is a winner.",5.0
"Not greasy. Smells good even for a guy - kind of 'green'. Lasts and really keeps your hands soft and not wrinkly. I keep a big pump bottle at home and use it in the morning right before I put on my watch and wedding ring, and I keep this tube on my desk at work. Buy it now.",5.0

"This is the best moisturizing hand cream I have ever found. I have been using it for 18 years: I am a nurse, gardener (heavy duty - callous-making work), and a paddler. Very hard on my hands. It will last through a few washings during the day and welcome relief at night. It absorbs quite well without leaving oily or greasy residue. The scent is more herbal than floral - my preference anyway, but definitely not shaving cream.",5.0

Softens and restores my dry cracked hands. Lovely fragrance. I use it twice a day . Once when I leave for work and again before bed when I know it will have time to absorb. I work in the horticulture industry and my hands get pretty beat up but this cream combined with the gardeners scrub [ which I use once a week ] has made a huge difference. You get what you pay for and a little goes a long way. This will be my hand cream from now on.,5.0

"It is a little pricey, so I save this for an occasional treat.  The scent is very herbal, not flowery.  It doesn't take a lot to cover your hands.",5.0
"I'm gardening 3-4 days a week. Push mower, weeding, trimming, planting... I don't like to wear gloves and my hands look and feel like they belong to a corpse, buried for 2 weeks. I put this creme on 2 hours before I make dinner and a second application as we sit down for dinner. My husband can't tell if I've been working in dirt all day. I'll use it 2-3 times a day during winter to combat the dryness. I love the soothing scent and the 'invisible glove' feeling it gives me.",5.0

"My skin is dry and fragile on my hands. As a nurse, I am constantly using foam alcohol or soap and water. This truly helps to heal my skin and make my hands look a little more normal after a long day. It soaks in and I can feel the effects even after a few washings. I carry the smaller tube to work for reapplications. Absolute lifesaver!",5.0

"I have problems in the winter time with my skin splitting open at the tip of my finger nails.  this ultra-moisturizing hand cream worked well.  Unfortunately, I think it's too expensive.  I used to use Aveeno with Menthol and loved it, but Aveeno discontinued making their skin care product with Menthol. I will not purchase Crabtree & Evelyn again because of the high cost for such a small amount.  I am still searching for something as good as the discontinued Aveeno for the price I used to pay for Aveeno.",5.0
product was perfect and arrived as promised,5.0
Wonderful!!,5.0
"A friend of mine recommended this product. I am a nurse and wash my hands frequently, of course. During the winter, I endure cracks on my fingers and joints that are so painful I need to take Motrin to sleep through the night. Nothing worked. Vaseline Intensive Care, that Bee stuff [can't remember the name], even Bag Balm [look it up..it's weird]. My friend told me that this Crabtree and Evelyn product is non-greasy and smells great not to mention, it WORKS on his construction worker hands. I tried it. It took a few days but sure enough my problem has virtually disappeared.",5.0

"My husband and I absolutely love this hand lotion. It doesn't have a strong scent and isn't a ""girly"" smell at all (my husband wouldn't use it if it was).

"This is one of my favorite lotions ever! I first received it as a gift, and I have loved it ever since. You don't have to be a gardener to use Crabtree & Evelyn's Gardener's Ultra-Moisturizing Hand Therapy Lotion. It's terrific for dry winter skin too. Not only does it feel wonderful, but its spicy aroma is very appealing as well.",5.0

"Holy cow this stuff smells amazing and feels great. It's just the right type of lotion, not too runny or slippery like other brands.

It's pricey but so worth it. Don't bring this to work because everyone will want to use it. Seriously you guys stop taking my lotion.",5.0
Great product for hands.  It works great and has a fresh light scent.  Absorbs into skin and is nongreasy.  I would recommend this product for soft smooth hands.,5.0
"I will put up with a lot of shenanegans in this life but slimy, sticky, stinky, useless hand lotion ISN'T one of those things.. I've been using this lotion for YEARS!!! I love it. It smells clean and warm but not like someone's sickly grandma.",5.0

"I've used it for years.  Still the best.  Havent found anything better than this for my hands, legs and arms.",5.0
"A friend turned me on to this hand cream about ten years ago.  It's not greasy, absorbs into your skin pretty quickly, and smells GOOD, unlike medicated creams.  Believe it has rosemary in the ingredients.  I usually order two pump bottles at a time so I won't run out during the outdoor working seasons.  I have had rough hands my entire life, but once I put this lotion on them, my hands feel wonderful,  and are soft and normal appearing.  I'd recommend Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's hand cream to anyone who has rough and dry skin but has found it difficult to locate a solution for their problem.  It really works!",5.0
"I love this hand lotion, it was first given to me by a friend and I have used it (sparingly) ever since.  I love the smell and it is good for my hands.  I got this one for my mom, it's a little pricey for me to get often for myself.",5.0
"This product is entirely responsible for my hands surviving the cold New England winters.  I've tried everything under the sun and snow for my hands, and this is the only thing that truly works.  Take it from somebody that works with his hands all day and washes a good dozen times a day.  In years past (before discovering this product), my knuckles would actually start bleeding from dryness in the winter.  Now all I need to do is apply a liberal slathering on my hands before going to sleep and I wake up with soft hands, ready to work another day.  It smells good, too!",5.0
Excellent product that I have used before and it works extremely well with dry hands.  Anyone having problems with dry hands will appreciate this product and will probably never be without it after using it.,5.0
"Perfect consistency and not greasy; no perfumey-like scent, which my husband especially appreciates for his use. We've tried many hand creams over the years and this has been the winner for a long time now.",5.0
"Even though this is targeted for gardeners -- of which I am one -- I use it all year round for feet,  elbows, knees and dishpan hands. I love the scent and emollience: it really moisturizes without being greasy. I highly recommend this product.",5.0
My son used some of this hand cream when I had it and is now a daily user and fan. I bought him some as a surprise. He has very dry and chapped hands. This cream or lotion seems to work and does not leave that greasy feel or smell to sweet. Good stuff!,5.0
This stuff is great and even my husband love the smell. While it is not strong it is not 'girly' so he loves using the lotion. You won't believe how great it is till you try it. I can have terrible dry elbows or flaking hands and one use and it is completely back to smooth and healthy looking.,5.0
"I've used the Gardener's Hand Therapy for many years, but always in that metal tube. This pump is so much more convenient! Lasts a long time and is the same, rich creme you expect from this line.",5.0
"I have tried many hand creams/lotions and this is by far the best. The pump bottle
has such a charming label! Nice to have by the kitchen sink.",5.0

"I was first given Gardeners as a gift in October.  I liked it instantly.  It's smooth, absorbent and smells great.  I wish more retail stores carried Crabtree and Evelyn.",5.0
I have used this lotion for years. Glad I got it so quickly!  Very happy customer.  The price was fantastic!,5.0
"My coworker bought this for me in 2008 when my hands were cracked and bleeding during the winter. I've used it every winter since and still had a bit left in the tube come 2014. Love the smell (as does my husband - entirely unisex). Love the feel. Love love LOVE the difference it makes in my skin. No other lotion has ever come close and I'm resolved to be exclusively committed to this one, so I finally bought a pump bottle. It may seem expensive, but for how long it lasts and how well it works, it's worth every penny.",5.0
"This cream has a great smell and stays moist.  I don't know what is in the bottle, but I love it.  It real gives moisture to your skin.",5.0
My wife uses this hand cream exclusive of any other. I make sure to buy multiple bottles so she is well stocked up. Found this item at a great price. My wife was very happy.,5.0
"There isn't anything that I don't love about this product. The smell is especially addicting - along with all those other perks = quality, quality and quality!

Oh, and before I forget = the 8 ounce container creates a great savings in addition to providing easy, pump-ready application.",5.0
"My wife loves this cream and swears it is the best hand cream she has ever used.  Like the subject says, if she's happy, then I am happy.  I will buy more when this jars runs low.",5.0
"I have used this lotion before so I already knew that I loved it !  It is awesome on my extremely dry and cracking hands. I don't garden but I have my hands in water and soap many times during the day. This is the first time I have gotten the bottle--have always had the tube before. The tube is convenient if you don't have a place for the bottle, but if you have a place to keep the bottle, I find it is much easier to use and I tend to use it more often.  I keep the bottle on my kitchen cabinet and a tube in my car!",5.0
"I keep this by my kitchen sink. After every washing, I add the hand lotion which really helps keep chapped hands at bay.",5.0
Great product for my hands.  I have dry skin and I'm a gardner.  This hand lotion works for me and it has a subtle fragrance that's not overpowering like so many products out there.,5.0
"This hand cream works better than any other I have found on the market.  I first found this product many years ago.  Because of the price I have tried many others since then but nothing works the same, so I'm back!",5.0
Have used Gardeners for years and found that nothing softens and soothes hands like it. A bit pricey but worth it.,5.0
"This cream has wax in it, great for the nails, and really makes your skin look years younger!  I use it at night",5.0
"My all time favorite hand lotion!  It's deeply moisturizing, but without the greasy feeling. Moisture lasts a long time, so I don't have to re-apply too often.",5.0
I've been using this hand lotion for years because it is the best lotion available.  It will heal dry hands overnight.,5.0
This is my wife's favorite lotion and is always on her Christmas list.  The container looks nice and can be left on the counter for quick use.,5.0
"I discovered the Gardeners Hand Therapy years ago at a little B & B in Alamosa, Colorado.  First, I loved the scent - it's pretty light and very pleasing.  The lotion itself is thick and healing (as in the name).

This hand lotion costs quite a bit more when ordered from Crabree & Evelyn, so I highly recommend Amazon for finding a much better deal on it.

Finally, the pump bottle lasts me a really long time - months really.  I still ordered two, however.",5.0
"I'm a 40 year old married dude-  I have bought this stuff in the past when I could justify 30 bucks for a thing of lotion. Last time I bought it was 5 years ago- and since, I've justified buying all names of other lotions which were all cheaper- with the same results: They didn't work.

I was at the mall with my wife this weekend- bought this for the first time in 5 years. I have used about half a pump every morning since and now I remember what I was missing. It does not take a lot- does not have the greasy or even watery consistency of some lotions- I have noticed a difference in my dry skin in just a few days. I will try to reserve this for winters- it is still very expensive to justify for year round use but I can't down rate it for that.  It has a smell- like fresh marjoram (yeah- what?)- It isn't flowery or perfumed- but not ""manly"" either- doesn't smell like motor oil or muskrat.

Awesome stuff.",5.0
"As a nurse, I wash my hands frequently all day long. This is the best moisturizer I have found. It prevents cracked bleeding hands and never feels greasy. I use it daily year round.",5.0
"This is absolutely the best lotion.  I use it all the time on my feet and hands.  It is creamy, NOT greasy and smells terrific too!  I love it so much that I also buy it in travel sizes for my purse.  The only con with this is that when it gets to the end it no longer pulls through the pump and there is quite a bit left.  With this being as expensive as it is, you don't want to waste it.  I turn it upside down in an old small baby food jar and it fills the jar quite a bit...easily 1 - 2 ounces.",5.0
This is hands down (pun intended) the best hand lotion on the planet and it is worth every penny. It is the only one I will buy.,5.0
"My favorite!  I put it on my feet before bed, and then put socks on, and when I wake up, my feet are silky smooth!",5.0
"Best hand cream I've ever used, and I NEVER use hand cream. This year, I got a puppy and with it comes a lot of mess and handwashing. Top if off with my working in the food industry + new York winters and you've got dry, painful hands. I tried many MANY different creams at a drug store one day - 2 hours worth of searching from the least to most expensive creams lead me to this one. It has a light leather smell, so definitely good for men also (I like the smell of leather, so Im a big fan, even as a lady). I put it on after Ive washed my hands and it is thick, rich, and I enjoy massaging it into my knuckles. Once it's on, it doenst leave a sticky or greasy film, just lovely moisture and no dryess. I have a mini tube in my handbag, large pump at the office, an 1in my home. I like the stuff to say the least!",5.0
"This stuff is amazing!  Not slimy, but makes hands much smoother.  Also has a neutral smell that is not feminine or masculine.",5.0
Great product in convenient pump bottle.  I have used this product for years and it is my favorite for sure.  Fast shipping.,5.0
"This hand care product is the best I've used in many years.  I've tried dozens of hand lotions over the years and this product absorbs quickly, has a light and pleasant fragrance and just simply works great.  I will be reordering in the future.",5.0
I have used this before after receiving it as a gift. Amazon has a far better price. This is great for summer gardening hands or for dry winter hands.,5.0
I love this hand lotion as it is so soothing to my hands. I do a lot of yard work and like to treat myself by putting this lotion on each night before bed.,5.0
"This is ""hands down"" my very favorite lotion to use on my hands when I retire for the night because it is thick and smells so good.",5.0
Bought for several people as gifts.  They loved the lotion and all were very happy with it.  Can't go wrong as a gift and smells great as well.,5.0
"I like all the hand moisturizers Crabtree & Evelyn carries but especially this one.  There's no fragrance, which is fine with me.  It's an excellent moisturizer.",5.0
"My wife gets very dry, cracked hands all the time, and I get dry, peely knuckles when it's really cold.

This soaks in and stays on for a long time.  It is the only thing that actually helps.",5.0
I use this product every night.  Very soothing odor.  Would use it more often during the day but it's not an inexpensive product so I only apply this one on a limited routine.,5.0
"Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's Hand Therapy has been my favorite lotion for many years.  While I don't have a problem with very dry skin, I still like a good, non-greasy lotion for my hands, arms, feet, and sometimes even my face.  This product is not greasy.  It does not have an annoying fragrance, actually not much at all.  My sister-in-law told me she uses it on her psoriasis and it helps.  It's not a cure, of course.  There really isn't one.  But it helps the skin feel better.  Since she liked it so much, I tried it and have been using it ever since.  It's hard to find in stores---almost impossible---but Amazon.com carries it.  Thanks again, Amazon.",5.0
"i use this product before, and i fall in love with smell (not too strong) and make my hand so soft",5.0
I have used this for 15 years since my daughter gifted me with it originally and still like it.  It isn't greasy.,5.0
"Fantastic product, larger  size makes it great to have in the house and more economical as well. I still have a small tube for my vehicle.",5.0
My husband and I use this on our hands and feet. I have tried so many different lotions to treat dry cracked heels but I always come back to this one. It is a little pricey but always does the job well.,5.0
I bought this for my sister as a gift. She lives in a northern state and in the winter her hands sometimes bleed from the dryness and cold.  This is the only product that helps her and she was so happy to get an extra large bottle!,5.0
"This is the best product for anybody's skin. Men can use this to treat ""leather"" hands. This doesn't leave a residue behind either.",5.0
I wash my hands a ton and they get dry and cracked at the nuckles.  This is the best lotion ever.  A little goes a long way.,5.0
"Although pricey, this has got to be one of the best hand creams out there. Have been using it for yrs, originally bought in a store in Mystic Ct and loved it.",5.0
"I'm not a gardener, but my skin gets very dry in a cold weather, and this is so far the best product ever. I also delighted how it smells--",5.0
"This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes.  The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized.  This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years.

The people I have given it to tell me that it's become one of their favorites too.  Everyone seems to like it's nice clean smell.",5.0
"My husband uses this hand cream exclusively to the tune
of about 5 pump bottles per year. It is non greasy,effective
and although pricey-worth the money because he uses
it and there is no waste-none being blotted off. A great choice!",5.0
"This is my all-time favorite hand lotion. I've gotten so many people hooked on this stuff. I've been buying it for probably 10 years now. I only go thru a bottle a year because I mostly use it in the winter, but it's also great for removing eye make-up because it has some oil in it.

It's not a very oily cream as long as you use just a little bit. It's not a hand ""lotion"" like most lotions. It's thicker, so you really only need a little bit. It spreads around really well. It does feel a little heavy at first, but it soaks into the skin quickly, which I love.

The scent is heavenly. It's light and fresh, like walking outdoors. It smells almost like a Christmas tree, but the scent is not heavy or cloying. I just love it. :)",5.0
Love this product and was so glad to find it on Amazon.com!!!! Made it very easy to purchase....used these products in 2 different fragrancies for years.  Kudos for having it on your website!!,5.0
"Now that the seasons are changing my hands are getting dry, dry, dry, just like they always do. Nothing beats Crabtree & Evelyn's hand creams for dry hands. This was at a GREAT price too. It arrived as expected in perfect, new condition. If you have dry hands I highly recommend you try one of C&E's hand creams.",5.0
"Crabtree & Evelyn Gardeners Hand Therapy is the best!! We have tried other brands, however nothing gets rid of rough skin on hands and fingers like Crabtree & Evelyn Gardeners Hand Therapy. This is the first time we have purchased the pump bottle & like that much better than the tube.",5.0
"I have used thie product for a few years now.  But, when I tried to purchase at the store, the price was doubled.  Therefore, I checked with Amazon and found it at a great price.
P.S.  This is the best hand cream for dry, cracked skin.  Love it.
Thank you for carrying this product.",5.0
"I live in an area that has a humidity level of about 11% so all the natural moisture in my skin just gets sucked into the atmosphere.  However, this product really helps restore moisture without being greasy.  I probably use it 3 or 4 times a day including right at bedtime and in conjunction with the nail and cuticle therapy sister-product.  My hands are no longer snagging knit and terry fabrics.  I hate that the product is expensive but I plan to keep buying it because of how well it works.",5.0
"I had this item sent directly to my mother.  She received it on time for Mother's day and enjoys the product.

Her one comment was it did not indicate who the item was from.

She wanted me to try it; when I did, the pump did not work.  I noticed the bottle was dented in two places.  It looked used.  I was disappointed in the packaging. Nevertheless, my mother likes it, so that is what is important.",5.0
"I have been using this hand cream for many years but ordering through C & E has become very pricey for one living on a fixed income.  Since I now order Oil of Olay through Amazon, I thought I would check out Hand Therapy and there it was at a very discounted price.  I have never had any trouble with the dispenser but would recommend that as the dispenser gets close to empty to turn it up side down over a small bowl.  There will be at least an inch left of the hand cream.  The only downside is that this container is not recyclable or refillable.  This is nongreasy and feels wonderful on very dry skin.",5.0
"As a Firefighter, my hands become cracked and extremely dry.  I have tried many creams and lotions to combat this problem with little success.  While the price of this product may seem a bit high, it is worth every penny plus. It works almost overnight. Absolutely Fabulous.",5.0
"My hands/fingers chap, crack, and bleed every winter. This lotion is fantastic though! I rated the item, not the price, which is too high in my opinion. It's on my wishlist for Christmas every year though! Smells great, feels great, and most importantly, it does a great job!",5.0
"For years each winter, I have suffered through having cracked skin on my fingers, right at the two edges of the nails.  I consigned myself to applying moisturizer to the cracked area and a band-aid whenever this happened and waiting for days for the fissure to heal up.  I also tried to keep my fingernails as short as possible to help prevent the cracks from forming in the first place.  What a royal pain!  Then I tried applying C&E's Gardeners Hand Therapy (my wife had received a tube as a gift several years ago) right before bed each night.  I started doing this at night because I don't like the feel of any moisturizing product on my hands during the day.  Lo and behold - the painful cracks on my fingers stopped forming entirely, even though I had no moisturizer on them during waking hours!  And I didn't even have to be vigilant about keeping my nails super-short.  Fantastic product, and I like the unusual smell.  Thanks, C&E, for giving me my hands back during the cold New England winter.",5.0
I have hands that get very dry and sore in the winter and I've probably tried a dozen different hand creams that are supposed to help.  Even the prescription stuff that the Dermatologist prescribed didn't help.  But this stuff works the best of all of them. It's worth every penny.  I put it on at night and then a cotton glove that I got at the Dollar Tree for $1.00 and my hands are actually starting to improve.  Love this stuff!,5.0
"This has got to be the very best soap for gardeners!  It digs deep and gets rid of all sorts of grime. (I don't like to wear gloves!)
Came in house and bypassed the Crabtree and Evelyn soap for regular pump soap - couldn't understand why it was taking so long and so much work to get hands clean - the the light bulb went on and I realized I used the wrong soap!!
Hope they never stop making it!",5.0
"Fabulous soap.  Works well, smells wonderful, and lasts much longer than other liquid soaps.  I'm buying more.",5.0
LOVE this soap. Not only does it clean up my hands great after working in the garden but it also smells amazing! Definitely recommend it even though its a little pricey. My only complaint is that my container arrived dented.,5.0
My favorite soap! Makes hands feel so soft. Love the fragrance too! I would highly recommend it. I use it every day.,5.0
You can't go wrong with Crabtree and Evelyn products for yourself or as gifts. Hand soap is wonderful and I love the gardeners hand cream as well.,5.0
"I have Gardeners Liquid Hand Soap in every room with a sink.  It has a mild, pleasant fragrance that I enjoy.  It is not one of those soaps that you can smell on your hands from two feet away.  I have sensitive skin and normally use unscented products.  Surprisingly, this product works for me.  The soap comes in a metal container with 10.1 fluid ounces.  Crabtree & Evelyn started selling a refill again, which makes so much sense ecologically.  I just wish the ""value size"" were larger!  This time I found it cheaper to buy two regular size than one ""value size.""  When I reorder, that may not be the case.",5.0
"This is a great smelling liquid soap. I've been using it for years after finding the Gardener's hand cream - which is an excellent item - with a nice, not overly flowery smell.",5.0

"I have used the Soy Milk Hand Cream from Archipelago Botanicals for years.  I love the light fragrance and the way it feels on my skin.  There is never an oily feel, your hands feel smooth and soft.  I will never buy another hand cream as long as Archipelago Botanicals continues to make this product.  I highly recommend it.",5.0
Best hand and cuticle cream for in the world! Buy 2 and keep one in your purse. Very mild pleasant scent.,5.0

"I use it as a face moisturizer...a little dab will do you and it is not greasy, soaks right in and smell is nice. Have used it for several years and try not to run out.....ever!",5.0
As a nurse who washes her hands frequently this is the best lotion. Has a mild aroma and doesn't leave your hands greasy or oily feeling. Easy to put gloves on right after application if needed.,5.0

It was a treat for my bday!",5.0
"I love this hand cream. It has a nice light scent, and it soaks in really smoothly.",5.0
"After more than 7 years of living in Florida, I had forgotten how dry the winters were in my home state of Ohio. I tried several hand creams to prevent my hands from cracking and becoming rough, including some of the lotions provided in my hospital, but nothing really worked. I am a male who enjoys a lot of time outdoors and I have to wash and sanitize my hands often for work, so my hands take a beating in northern winters.

I had been given a tube of this hand cream a few years ago while still in Florida, but decided to give it a try in Ohio. I am very glad I did!

So often hand creams and lotions are too perfume-y and not something most men would like to have to smell all day long. The scent of this hand cream is light, clean, and non-offensive or bothersome. It's not what I'd consider feminine, either...it's just right.

One does not need to use a lot, either, so even though the cream is a bit on the pricey side, a tube will last me an entire winter. It's a pretty rich consistency, so about a quarter to 3/8 of an inch of cream is more than plenty to rehydrate. It absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy.

You can bet I'll get another tube come next winter!",5.0
Love how those lotion comes in a toothpaste type tube! The smell is light but clean. Wonderful for my dry hands. I'm going to buy the mint next.,5.0

So thankful a friend hipped me to this hand cream!  I carry a tube in my purse at all times!  It smells wonderful and absorbs nicely without leaving a greasy residue.  I work in optics and am always handing eyeglasses.  The last thing I need at work is greasy hands!  My husband also likes this product.,5.0
I first tried this as a sample in a store.  I was so impressed with the silky feel that I found it immediately on Amazon and bought it.  I love this hand crme and will buy it again.  The best word I know to describe the feel of my hands when I use this crme is silky.,5.0
The only thing that works on my dry overworked hands. The smell is divine.,5.0
"I am ordering this for the 3rd time from Amazon, though I'll pick it up at a shop if I see it available for sale. It never leaves my wish list - ever. I use the body wash, I have the giant pump bottle for body and this hand cream is practically with me everywhere I go. I found it over a decade ago at an Ulta store and fell in love. It has the most delicate fragrance - not overpowering, not the usual sickly perfume-y aroma that most hand creams tend to have - it's mild and smells like... I don't know. Like, ""soft"" if soft had a scent. AND it has NEVER made my hands sticky. That right there is the major selling point for me along with how little you need to use. I am constantly washing my hands, so I have to moisturize a lot. I'm not always great about it, but when I do, a quick dime sized dab and good to go. I know some people may balk at the price, but it is so worth for me. I last purchased this in August of 2015 and I am almost out if that gives you any indicator of how long this lasts with moderate use.",5.0
The best product.  It leaves my skin so smooth with no greasy or oily feel.  I have given it many times as gifts and I always have to keep extra tubes on hand so I do not run out.,5.0
Cleanest smelling lotion and best feeling that I have ever ever used.,5.0

The best!,5.0
"For whatever reason I bought a tube for my wife and ended up receiving two.  I do that sometimes...forgetting to look at the quantity in the cart before hitting the payment button.  So I threw the spare tube in my pocket and took it to work.  My workplace is like the Gobi Desert in heating season, so I ended up trying it out.  I was impressed by the quality of the product, the fact that it doesn't leave a greasy feel afterward, and smells like my first girlfriend in 7th grade.  I would give her a lift on my bike, perched on the handlebars with her hair in my face.  The smell was awesome and quite intoxicating as I rode her home.  She dumped me for the football team captain.  That's ok, I've recovered.  I had my moment of olfactory bliss, and I can have it again with Archipelago Botanicals Soy Milk Hand Cream No. 3.  The only rough spot in this transaction is the description on the Amazon blurb clearly states ""hand cream"" while the back of the tube reads ""Body Creme"" (sic).  My hands didn't know the difference.",5.0

"I used to love this lotion. It's one of the few that actually does what it says it will do. My issue with it is that Crabtree and Evelyn use palm oil in it, which I didn't realize until I read the product label the other day. And for those of you out there who don't know what the big deal is about, google palm oil plantations and the effects they have on local wildlife. It's horrifying to see what these plantations do to orangutans, tigers, etc-the farmers completely destroy the natural habitat so they can sell us cheap palm oil to use in our products. I'm boycotting Crabtree and Evelyn until they remove this from their products. I won't buy a product knowing that doing so is destroying the earth.",1.0
Bottle arrived dented. No packing slip. $30 way too expensive for 8 ounces. Sorry I bought it,1.0

Can was dented. For 30.00 a bottle for lotion you do not expect a dented can. I will keep it because it is too much time and money to send it back.

I'm big on whitening my teeth, and I thought the powder mixture combined with the whiten teeth and get fresh breath all in one would end up being a favorite, but that wasn't the case. Actually using it wasn't so bad, but it made my teeth feel really grimy afterwards. I would actually brush my teeth to try to get rid of the feeling after I was done using it, because I couldn't stand what my teeth felt like. Not one I would recommend.

Sadly the whitening sticks/ rods  also don't  work. Crest whitening strips w/ supreme flex fit works well for me, none of the other crest strips are effective for me, and this stuff doesnt work at all. I wish Id demanded a refund.",1.0

"I have used the green apple flavor about 4 times so far and it is horrible. It seems they were going for a sour Jolly Rancher flavor, but the overwhelming flavor is bitter saccharine.

I won't be giving this product a fair shot at whitening, I realize, but I don't believe that the seller of the product is informing the public of the damage that it can wreak on one's gums... Not worth it!!",1.0
I happened to start using this toothpaste and accelerator the day before my semi-annual cleaning.  When my dentist saw my gums she asked me what in the world I had done to burn them.

I would think this was due to wear and tear even though it's only been a few uses but for both of the tools to have done the same thing I'm very disappointed,1.0
Bad design. Kept pulling my hair,1.0
The cheaply made plastic handle made the way it closed very uneven. When it arrived it also did not work. I sent it back and because of the quality I will not order again.,1.0
I was sent a used flat iron. when i received it i plugged it up immediately and it would not unlock let alone heat up to use. Returning this item,1.0
"Love this brand, I've had for years, bought a new one (Same exact model) and the handle's ""bolt"" (where you clamp down) completely gave way, I checked customer reviews, and apparently I'm not the only one this has happened to. The only reason I didn't return was because I didn't want the headache. Truly upsetting. Will NEVER buy another Hot Tools item again! TERRIBLE.",1.0
"I originally bought the Helen of Troy flat iron several years ago and LOVED it. Would use it on the hottest temperature setting and it straightened my hair quickly. It lasted me several, several years until i accidentally damaged it with water. Then i did some research and realized that it changed names to Hot Tools. I purchased another iron from Amazon not too long ago. It was working great at first, then the hinge broke in between the two paddles (screw came out). I kept pushing it back in and it wouldn't stay, but kept using it anyway. Then the night of my nephews wedding I used it, and it must have been on it's last leg, because it died after i damaged the hell out of my hair. It singed my hair terribly before the wedding. So I decided to purchase another one since I figured it was a faulty iron. I purchased it last November. It has been working great until last night. I was straightening my hair, and mind you I do not straighten my hair everyday-- so it is not getting a whole lot of use-- and the hinge broke again!!! Would love to have given this product a good review, but Hot Tools needs to change how they manufacture their product.",1.0
Not the same kind I had previously.  It does not get very hot. It says it can get to 420 degrees and it doesn't.  I can hold my hair after you run the flat iron in it and it does t burn me.  I only use hot tools flat iron b/c I have very thick curly hair and the hottest temp straightens it really good but not this one that I got. Very disappointed!!!,1.0
"It doesn't get hot, I would like to send it back to exchange or for a refund.",1.0
"Snags on hair, don't recommend.",1.0
Terrible! Doesn't do anything near straighten. Just pull n frizzes.,1.0
Haven't open it. Don't think it will get my hair straight.,1.0
"Sealing seam separated and warped so it will not go back together...  It's the same model number Sally's sells, but the quality of build has changed substantially over the years unless I unwittingly purchased a knock off...",1.0
"It got real hot quickly, it did not retain any heat. Very soon after achieving the highest heat it became luke warm. It was useless!",1.0
"Right after the 30 day guarantee expired, it wouldn't turn on or heat up. Very dissatisfied with this product. Definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.",1.0
I ordered this item for christmas and 2 months later one of the paddles does not heat up! So it is no good to me because you can't flat iron  ordered it straight from HOT TOOLS !!! I'm not happy at all ! Twenty some dollars down the drain.,1.0
"never was right since the day i opened it... this flat iron i wanted because i used a friends-often and loved it.  I have used other flat irons in the past and this was fast, sturdy and didn't fry my hair. However after receiving one as a gift-the flat iron never felt the same as the one that i had used prior.  it never closed properly and just literally came apart in my hands.  It was lighter, more plastic, just junk!!!!
Since i received it as a gift i tried to return it I hit roadblocks everywhere. Too bad- guess you get what you pay for..wondering why it was so much cheaper than the others.",1.0
"For the first few months after buying, it worked great.  It did pull my hair a little but I had that issue with other big straighteners. However, it just stopped heating after 2 1/2 months after I purchaed. Ive had other hot tools products before that have lasted years.  This was the first I've ever bought off amazon instead of a major retailer.  Next time, I'll spend the few extra bucks at the major retailer and get a good product.",1.0
Very poor construction.  Pieces didn't fit tightly together.  Literally fell apart (into three pieces) after only two weeks.  In the garbage now and I'm on the hunt for another product.,1.0
It didn't work! Upon first use out of the box it barely heated up twenty minutes later on highest setting. Ugh.,1.0
Pulls hair! I used to have one many years back and it seems like the old one (which was pretty banged up) worked better than the new one!,1.0
"My last Hot Tools flat iron lasted for 15 YEARS of professional use. So, when it finally died recently I didn't hesitate to buy another. But, like everything else they don't make them like they used to. On about the tenth use, I turned it on to heat up and it made a popping sound, started to smoke and the handle melted. I had owned it for 35 days, (five days past Amazon's return policy) so I can't return it. I'm stuck sending it back to the manufacturer and paying shipping both ways. Boo!",1.0
"I was very excited to try this as nothing else is working for me for my new friend Rosacea.  It took a lot for me to put out the $85 but if it works then I can justify the price.  It actually made my condition worse.  I'm itchier, redder and blotchier than I was before I used it.  And I actually think I have real pimples now to boot!  So great!
I also made the mistake of putting it around my eyelids to help calm my ocular rosacea so now my eyes feel like they're bleeding.  It's so frustrating how one thing works for someone and is just pure evil tor another.
Still searching....",1.0
"This product, which was very expensive, did not calm, cool or correct my facial redness. It made it much worse.",1.0
"I got this because I had red dry patches in my ""t zone"" thinking this would ""calm and cool and correct it"" all it does is burn the heck out of it. I suggest not buying it.",1.0
Terrible product.  It spilled all over me and the floor.,1.0
Everyone saying how wonderful buy by day two my under arms had broken out in a painful red rash.  One of the reasons I bought it was comments it was great for sensitive skin.  I also felt dampness under my arms by afternoon.,1.0
"The most unhelpful product I ever ordered from Amazon.  The descriptions for the product ingredients are not as specific as they should be so one can't know what they are purchasing.  I ended up wasting $22 for a worthless product.  If you want lasting protection and no worries about putting more aluminum in/on your body, DO NOT buy this product!!!!",1.0
"Still produced a rash, just took longer. for the price, would not recommend!",1.0
Whyyyy not sydney!!!!!,1.0
"I bought this product based on reccomendations from a writer/blogger that has severe excessive under arm sweating issues, not unlike myself; I have purchased several products in the hopes that one or a combination of a few would stop the embaressing sweating! Long story short, I received the DERMA DOCTOR product, used it and it had ZERO effectiveness in reducing my under arm perspiration. Only AFTER using it for a week did I decide to read the back and discovered it's active ingredient is EXACTLY the same ingredient as the clinical strength Secret solid I already have, not only that but my SECRET clinical strength antiperspirant has 19% as where the Derma Doctor only has 11.25%! In addition, the SECRET clinical strength only cost me $7.00 dollars and the Derma Doctor was $20.00! Neither antiperspirant works for me but if you want to try an antiperspirant with this active ingredient to see if it may help for you buy the secret clinical strength at your local store and save yourself the $13.00 dollars difference in price!",1.0
It made me sweat more and didn't change the color of MY under arms. I don't shave my under arms every day and I apply St. Ives SCRUB and that has been working for me.,1.0
"However, it is more expensive. Not worth the extra money. I tried it, my husband tried it.... we really gave it a shot hoping it would work for us but alas...",1.0
Sad to report that this very promising product turned out to be nothing more than very disappointing. No whitening at all and I had used it for several months.,1.0
"I've had KP since I was about 12 (I'm 28 now) and I recently tried KP Duty. I am absolutely *shocked* that a product that makes such brazen claims can be so ineffective.  The bottle actually has a cartoon CHICKEN on it, says it ""Effectively eliminates"" the bumps, and that ""Flawless"" skin is achievable.

  I have KP all over my legs; most of it is not inflamed, but there are a couple patches that are reddened.  I also have very fair skin (transparent, basically) and the KP looks bad enough that no one has seen my legs at all since I was 12.  (Insert complete social isolation and low self esteem HERE !)  So I was so happy to see that this ""KP Duty"" product was formulated specifically for this disease, and I really thought it would work.  Well, I've used it once a day for a month now and have noticed no reduction in the bumps or the red spots or the redness generally.  The skin does *feel* much softer, but it's as ugly as ever, and the bumps are obvious when you look at the skin in profile.

  I have no clue how long you're supposed to use this product before you see results.  They say you should try any new skin product for at least 6 weeks before you give up, so I think I will keep at it for a while longer.  But I'm assuming now that all of the raving reviews this product gets are due to its skin-softening effect, not ANY actual treatment of KP.  As Jay mentioned, any lotion can provide softer skin without the $35 price !!

  I have noticed within the past week or so that the ankle/calf region has started peeling.  I hope this is a good thing (exfoliation?) and maybe if it continues there could be some better skin revealed underneath.  However, so far even the peeling areas still have red, KP spots!

  Will post another review here if the product does turn out to be effective, but don't hold your breath, folks.",1.0
Didn't help at all with my child's keratosis Pilaris,1.0
This product is super expensive and I saw zero results. Look further.,1.0
"This product was recommended from my dermatologist and have using it for months and have not seen any results with my keratosis P (chicken bumps). I have seen more severe than mine, so I tried a couple at home remedies that were more effective (check out sour cream and sugar, olive oil, etc.)  Also used gylolic  acid cream and peels which seems to be helping as well. So don't give up and if you don't have the money for this or decide to use it anyways after reading this and doesn't work either, don't give up.  Google it and you will find something that works.",1.0
My arms have light keratosis pilaris and this really didn't do anything for me. The smell was unpleasant so it was also unbearable to apply this to my skin.,1.0
"didn't really do anything for me, even when used as stated in the directions",1.0
Did not make a difference in my daughters KP at all.,1.0
Does not take away my dry skin bumps like it says it will.,1.0
"I have suffered from this ""chicken skin"" on my upper arms for about 5 years. A few months back I purchased KP Duty based on the great reviews.
I was a bit of a skeptic so decided to use it only on my left arm and continue to use my Target brand $5 lotion on my right.
4 months later and there is nothing different about either arm. They both look the same.
Save your $40.",1.0
Used this once and it made my daughter's KP possibly the worst I've ever seen it. I want my money back. $40 for something I'll never be able to use.,1.0
It didn't help at all; my skin got worse!!!,1.0
"doesnt do anything, better off exfoliating and using natural oils",1.0
Didn't work. It wants you to use their complete system. This also lasts for a few weeks. Terrible product. Do not buy.,1.0

"I'm so disappointed at this product. My skin is still the same. Just waste my money,waste my time and it gave me a fake hope.",1.0
been using it for a month and i don't see a difference. i don't like it. maybe ill try buying some more,1.0
"I thought at least the redness or the bumps were gonna disappear but no 3 months later my arms look the same, I'm didn't use only the lotion moisturizing but the scrub and serum as well not even because I was using it daily, I'm seriously very sad about the results",1.0
"Product does NOT work.  Tried the product for 2 full wks as instructed, nothing changed.  Money spent was a total waste.",1.0
"I was so disappointed in this product. From what I saw on the Dermadoctor website, it gave me hope and it has such a cute package, plus I felt like this doctor knows what she's talking about. But I used it religiously, the whole tube, and it did absolutely nothing for my KP. I felt like a loser for spending all this money on something called KP Duty that didn't work at all. I think my bumps looked a bit worse, actually, to add insult to injury. Learn from my mistake, and if you have KP, keep looking (I'm still looking for something that works!)",1.0
"I was dissapointed in this product.  It was not effective at all on my daughter's skin.  Worse, if she had even the tiniest little scratch, the product would burn so badly that I had to wash it off.

I submitted a review for this product on the manufacturer's website.  They sent me a nice apology note, but they did not post my review.  I'm just trying to stop other people from being suckered in to buying this product.",1.0
"I very much wanted this product to work.  I read reviews from the Dermadoctor website and it seemed like a miracle product/cure for ""chicken skin"".  I used the entire tube as directed and noticed no difference in my skin or any improvement whatsoever.  I'm very disappointed and won't buy this product again.",1.0
This product claims a lot and does little.  It hasn't helped my KP at all infact I think it maybe getting worse.  I have been using it for a month twice a day and nothing has changed since I started.  What a waste of money.  I hope I can find something to help the KP on my arms before my wedding.,1.0
"Not only is this product over-hyped and overpriced - but Dermadoctor website publishes only reviews with glowing comments about it!  Which I did not find out until I read those glowing reviews, wasted my own money and time on this product and then posted a negative review at their site - which never showed up there!  Aha, I thought, now I see their game - never will buy a single thing from them again.... Maybe it works for some - but who can know what the real results are when they don't publish both the good and the BAD reviews.",1.0
Don't waste your money. This product made the bumps on my arms even redder. I tried it for several weeks thinking it would eventually get better. The redness went away after I stopped using it and I'm back to square one.,1.0

I don't understand why every time I order these irons. It stops getting hot and I don't understand why. I need to speak to someone about this because this is the third iron I got that just stops working.,1.0
I bought this iron got it in the mail today plugged it in and it started SMOKING!! and it smells like it has a hot wire. I'm returning it immediately.,1.0
VERY hard to use. Returned the next day.,1.0
I am highly dissatisfied with this product. It is very difficult to use and is no different than any other curling iron. This iron is very unstable which makes it so easy to burn yourself on it. I would never repurchase this or suggest it to anyone.,1.0
I don't like this iron. Very cumbersome to use. If I had the box I would return. Waste of money.,1.0
Couldn't' master it...gave it away. Not good for someone with arthritis.,1.0
Dislike. The clamp doesn't have a spring to help grab hair so you have to use your hand and fingers to clamp it down. The clamp also leaves a crease on your hair ... I have it on the lowest heat setting so too much heat isn't the issue.  Would not buy again,1.0
"It stopped working within 2 months of using it!!! In the past this product would last for years. I will never purchase this from AMAZON again. Of course, now the window of returning it has closed. FRUSTRATED!!!",1.0
This was flimsy. The spring was also very loose. I was unable to get a decent curl out of the tool. I returned this and got one at Sally's. It's much better quality.,1.0
Did not hold a curl at all. Very disappointed.,1.0
"This curling iron is amazing at first and I have purchased several over the last 16 years but the last 5 (yes 5!) have gotten a short in the cord, some of them less than a couple months old. There is nothing more embarrassing than holding your cord in a certain position trying to make the light stay on while finishing a client. I don't think I should have to go out every few months for a new one but it is the only marcel I can get locally in a hurry.  Something has to change. Shopping online for a new brand :(",1.0
How in the world does anyone use this thing without burning themselves!  Ouch!,1.0
"Horrible curling iron. Its very awkward to use, not your clamp and curl iron everyone is used to.  I returned this product immediately for a full refund.  If I could I would give zero stars!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!",1.0
This product is DANGEROUS as it heats to extreme temps and is way too difficult to handle! Yesterday I burned my face accidentally when the end slipped out of my hand. It went in the trash this morning as we were past the return date. Major regrets on this purchase!,1.0
"First of all this thing gets hot, which is a good thing, until it burns the crap out of your face! I literally have a penny round burn mark on my face. There's nothing to hold the other end, just the iron itself. Not to mention it is very hard to use! It's not like your regular curling iron clamp. This one is really loose and is just very hard to work. I ended up giving it away.",1.0
I accidently bought the professional tool and I was physically unable to use it.  I had to sent it back.,1.0
"This item stopped working about 6months after I received it.  I purchased another one larger barrel and seems to be working fine, just very disappointed only worked for 6 months or less.",1.0
Incredible hard to use. I watched several tutorials but it was still not an easy use.,1.0
"I'm not sure if it was put in the description of this curling iron, but this is very hard to work with.  There isn't a clamp to hold your hair, you have to somehow hold/maneuver the lever/clamp manually.  I haven't even attempted to try this one because I know I will burn myself with it.  Since I took it out of the box I can't exactly return it so I think I will pry the clamp off and give it to my daughter to use it as a wand (?)",1.0
"This curling iron lasted about 5 minutes, before it stopped heating up.  I will not recommend this product or company to anyone.",1.0
"Very unwieldy to use.  Seems like it is broken, but hard to tell. I accidentally ripped the box opening it and so can't return it.  Very disappointed.",1.0
I bought this product with great hope because of the reviews rating. I had been using for one month now. But it does nothing to my pore. My pore is still large as it is.,1.0
"I wanted to try something that minimized my pores. I purchased this and tried it. It made my acne worse, didn't do anything to reduce the size of my pores, and had a heavy, sticky feel.

I figured that the problem must have been remedied since those reviews were posted, so I chose to order anyway. But there is something wrong with the product I received. For one, it's very thin and doesn't cover well at all. But it also gets gooey very fast in the bottle, so I have to shake the bottle constantly. And it chips easily, within 24-48 hours multiple nails are chipped and I have to make repairs. At 3-4 days it's peeling off. On top of that, it arrived with polish spilled out onto the outside of the bottle. Something isn't right here.",1.0
"This was the worst nail polish I have ever used (and I have used OPI for years).... Even when applied by a pro nail tech, it smeared and streaked and basically rubbed off....

I received it today. Im highly disappointed & quite frankly, angry. It applies like a cheap polish from a dollar store! The emblem on the front matches none of my OPI bottles, & I own quite a few. I would send it back but I highly doubt this company would have the integrity & wherewithal to refund me.",1.0
The product is old had to throw away,1.0
I'm sorry but did I get a dud? I used this polish as soon as I got it. It started chipping the next day. I took all the nail polish off a few days later and applied a heavier coat to have the exact same thing happen. The polish itself looks like white out when it dried. This is not something i've ever had an issue with when buying opi directly from salons! The picture I'm including is 1 day and 4 hours after applying.,1.0

"Not the same color, bottle, or quality of previously purchased OPI polish in the same color.  You can see in the photos this bottle is darker and not as soft pink as the original.  Also, unless they changed their packaging its not the same product.",1.0
I had this color put in in the nail salon and loved it so much I bought this. This is NOT OPI quality. Im not sure if its a fake or what but its so watery and thin I had to put four coats to cover my nail. Either I got an old/bad bottle or this is fake OPI,1.0
"*update*
Not sure if this was a knock off (Im seeing others post comparison photos, and Ive never bought this brand before I did however go to Sallys and the bottle is different!) but this polish has destroyed my nails. They are peeling, brittle and just awful. Never have my nails received this amount of damage from any polish. Will never buy cosmetics through amazon again as there are too many fakes being sold, and too many fake reviews to back them up. Pretty sure this was right through amazon, not a third party seller.

Purchased dulce de leche for a wedding. I thought the color was pretty hideous, but the naipolish itself held up well. I took it to a salon and they gave me a manicure. If you're using base/top coats make sure you use Opi brand as others didn't work with it. Held up for the 3 days i needed it to, without any cracking or chipping. I doubt Ill ever use it again. Im just glad we didn't have open toe shoes. 10 nails exposing this color was enough. Lol. (It wasn't just me. Even the manicurist said it was awful!)",1.0
Samoan Sand- I just got this in the mail and its totally fake. The packaging is definitely NOT the original OPI bottle and there was no sticker on the bottom of the bottle with the barcode and name of polish. Save your money!,1.0

I just received my bottle today but unfortunately I was one of the unlucky shoppers who received a counterfeit bottle.

See: my pictures, bottle on the left is real and bottle on the right is what this seller sent me. The labels on the bottle are completely different and the polish itself is watery garbage and definitely not worth spending $10. The color isn't even a dupe to the real version; the real YSAB is a subdued periwinkle color whereas the fake is a more childish and bright lavender. I wouldnt buy this crap from the drugstore for $2.",1.0

I have Nomads Dream and was running low.  Instead of getting the mauve-tan with the irredescent green tone like the original I received a tan shade with no irredescence.  The bottle was a very close resemblance but a tad different.  This is the second bottle Ive purchased online.  The first was a color Ive never used before but oddly the polished chipped after 3 days like drug store polish instead of staying on for 2 weeks like OPI normally does on me.  Not worth buying online anymore because I think its fake.,1.0

"I received the Mod about you color. The quality of the nail polish was extremely poor. I believe this company is selling dupes because the quality was subpar to the real nail polish. The nail color was off and the actual substance caused considerable streaking on the nail. Unfortunately, you cannot return the polish so I had to throw the new container away. Buyers beware.",1.0
"Yes, my SKIN! It stained my skin when I used the nail polish remover. I just removed it and realized my fingers were smeared with the color and I can't get it off. Check out the pictures. After rubbing my skin for 10 mins with nail polish remover, I gave up so to not completely dry and ruin my skin any further.

I've been dying my nails with dark colors for years, on and off. Black, brown, dark blue etc. A lot of them OPI brand. Never before have I had a nail polish do that to me.

There is something seriously wrong with this product. Stay away.",1.0
"Do not buy this!  I tried this three separate times and used multiple coats but it will chip the very next day.  I have never had this much of an issue with ANY nail polish and strongly suspect whether this was authentic OPI or whether this bottle was compromised at some point.  It will not hold for even a day despite base coat and multiple coats.  Save your money and avoid this color at least, if not this batch!",1.0

Cold was nice but just a little too dark,1.0
I like the color based off of what spilled out of the broken bottle in the box.,1.0
This is way darker than the picturestandard they show. Will not buy again,1.0
This seems to be fake OPI. I gave it 4 stars on account of it looks and works exactly the same as Samoan Sand but the writing does not look like OPI. I hope it works out the same as the regular OPI in the end otherwise $10 is steep for off brand nail polish.  UPDATE: THIS IS TERRIBLE!!! I feel like asking for my money back. It's all chunky and even drugstore nailpolishes work better than this. Look somewhere else.,1.0
"Received fake product, can't return. ZERO STARS",1.0
loved the color. it peeled in chunks within 14 hours. super disappointed,1.0

Adding pictures...color on hand is Samoan Sand.",1.0
I ordered Mod About You and what I received was not the correct color.  This polish is A LOT darker than the authentic OPI.,1.0

One star is just for the color. Needs lot of multiple coating as the polish runs like a water. Disappointed!!!,1.0

This is not the right color!!! I was very dissapointed :(,1.0
This appears to be a knockoff product. Bottle is not the same as OPI bottles I buy in the salon and the color is darker and more pink than other bottles of Bubble Bath that I have. Don't think this is the real thing.,1.0

Arrived burst and the color is chalky and streaky.,1.0

The polish never drys. It stays sticky. disappointment!,1.0
Fake product: indicated by mis-printed label and the polish itself. Be wary of online cosmetic purchases!,1.0
This polish is not as it appears ...very pinky silver and dated looking...most disappointing.  Also I could have sworn when I ordered the polish Amazon said I could return it but now it says I cannot??  I'm noticing you really have to look closely AFTER items are in cart.  Some of my prime noted items did not arrive quickly others I even canceled due to delays...  ??  Love OPI as a product just disappointed the color is not as it is described or pictured,1.0
"The color does not like the picture shows
Want to return it but amazon rufused",1.0
"I have used OPI before and have had good results; however, this bottle was very thick and gooey as if it had been dried out.  The color started to chip within hours of painting my nails. I think I received a very old bottle of polish which is a shame because it was an expensive one-time use.",1.0
It chip My wife nails in a day. If you have a nail gel nail dryer? Then stick with or go with the gel nail polish. It last longer than this stuff.,1.0
Light colors are streaky and so is this one. Through it out after first five coats were unsuccessful.,1.0
Its fake!,1.0
"Very disappointed, put it on and one can't even tell if I'm wearing polish or not. The color is not light, it's translucent, see through, and that you do, see right through it, down to the nails.
I have a lot of OPI nail colors, and this one I recommend you pass it by.  Came packed well, if not over packed, it was wrapped so tightly it took over 10 minutes to get all the wrappings off. Was excited to see the color, just doesn't look like this on one's nails.  Too Bad!!
It's a shame some colors just aren't what they seem, I would have loved this color on my nails.  Shame on OPI",1.0

Applies poorly
I would NOT RECOMMEND",1.0

"I usually like all of OPI polishes. There was nothing wrong with the consistency of the polish and it went on smoothly...it was just the ugliest color I have ever seen painted on my nails. It may be my skintone, but it looked tacky and I hated it.",1.0
Pretty sure this fake OPI,1.0
Nail polish was thick and glopped (is that a word?) on in streaks.  Probably old or damaged.  Won't buy from this vendor again.,1.0
"I bought 3 colors: Step Right Up, Samoan Sand and Alpine snow. The Alpine snow worked well for French Manicures. The other two are pretty color's but almost impossible to apply evenly.  When I first opened the bottles the polish was thin and streaked but before I finished the first coat on all my nails it started to thicken.  By the time I finished the second coat it was gloppy and unusable!  I haven't used OPI in quite a while so maybe they changed the formula?  It used to be great polish. I won't be buying again.",1.0
"Product streaks when applied, even second coat and I use OPI base coat.  Also this particular bottle has little black flecks in polish.  Need to send this back to Amazon, but not sure how to do it yet",1.0
This nail polish was sealed closed so tight as if it had already had paint around the bottle. It was already goopy when I opened it. Poor quality!,1.0
Ordered a cream pink and received a bubblegum pink almost the same exact color I ordered previously. Was not happy at all.,1.0
"This color is not the color I have been using for years. It is labeled as ""Passion"" but not the same color. Very disappointed",1.0
not what I expected. does not look like the color I got. the color I got is darker than this picture. not impress with the customer service I got about this.,1.0
Horrible gunky formula! So thick and uneven. No glossy finish. This polish does not feel or look like OPI.,1.0
I love OPI but this particular polish comes out very thick and clumpy. It streaked so bad that I had to remove it immediately. I would like to return this but it is not returnable.  Wish I never bought it.,1.0
I was very disappointed upon receiving my nail polis as it was 2/3 full.  1/3had already been used out of the bottle!!!! Not happy at all!,1.0
Not as expected,1.0
"Beware, I received a rip-off as well. Easy to tell... font and text on the bottle was different than genuine OPI nail polishes. Another easy way to tell is the sticker on the bottom of a genuine OPI bottle has an option to ""peel here"" option that will display the name of the nail polish instead of the barcode.",1.0
polish I received was old and sticky.,1.0
Counterfeit item!! Labeling is way off compared to all my OPI products purchased in stores. Will be returning.,1.0
This is not OPI polish. The bottle looks different and the color is not the same as the real OPI color. I'm very disappointed to have paid more for this that I would at the store only to find it's not even the real color. The bottle also has little chips in it which has never happened with my opi bottles. Even after I've dropped them.,1.0
Received busted up inside package,1.0
"Last week, I purchased four OPI nai lacquers through this Amazon listing (Passion, Funny Bunny, Rosy Future, and Mimosas for Mr. and Mrs.). Amazon, not a third party seller, was the distributor of all four. Every single one was obviously counterfeit.

The text on all four of the bottles was applied crookedly and in uneven ink. The font and text on the front of three bottles is totally different from any font and text used on any OPI nail lacquer, current or past.  I still own well-cared-for OPI polishes I bought more than a decade ago, so I can compare easily!

Passion and Rosy Future look nothing like the bottles I've purchased from authorized sellers (salons and beauty supply stores). Seriously, Passion is not supposed to be a cool toned bubble gum pink that is thick in texture and opaque in two coats. Funny Bunny is a chalky, nearly opaque white (Alpine Snow, anyone?). Rosy Future and Mimosas do seem nearly normal in the bottle, but Mimosas is a nasty, sheer beige when applied, even after multiple coats - zero pink or peach.

Luckily, Amazon refunded all four in under eight hours after I explained the problems in detail. The ease and speed of the refund process makes me wonder if Amazon knowingly and willingly sells bogus cosmetics but prefers to settle with the consumer rather than encumber legal issues.  Lesson learned: buy from a reputable authorized seller outside of Amazon for the real McCoy.",1.0
I love the color but the polish is so thick and globby it's impossible to not get air bubbles while painting so it ends up looking terrible. Normally polish will get thicker after multiple uses but this happened the first time I used it.,1.0
"This is a fake product. The logo is totally wrong. Also, the authentic product should have OPI logo molded into the shaft of the brush. This isn't even a decent fake!",1.0
"Rip off. I buy all of my OPI polish from beauty supply shops - clearly that's where I need to continue getting it. Top row are all true legitimate OPI polishes. The blue is what I got from this seller. Clearly a fake & regardless of wear, I'm pissed I spent the money for OPI and got this.",1.0

"This review is for Russian Navy. Nice color, but when you remove it, it's a real mess, it makes it look like you have dirty hands and nails, the stuff gets under your nails and you have a big mess, discolors your natural nails too. Awful! I have it away from my other polishes to be sure I don't use it again. I had to refile my nails and tried very hard to get the staining off, I wanted to cry. I use a base coat too so this isn't the case. I love opi, but they can keep this, not sure what there doing, I hope it's just this color and they haven't changed the formula, I do not recommend this unless you want dirty looking nails and hands upon removal",1.0
"The description said it was streak-free, but this was far from true in my experience, regardless of what I did. I guess I'm not good at putting on nail polish, or something.",1.0
"This is definitely a fake OPI nail polish.  The bottle is slightly different, font is not the same and wording is not the same as other authentic bottles.  Really disappointed",1.0

"The print of a product can tell the authencity of it. Please see the pictures of the comparison of the product I got.  Let's see the details:
1. The line is missing. There are 2 lines in total, but the blue nail polish only has one.
2. The order of the addresses should be company's address, then the manufacturer's address. But the blue one has the manufacturer's address first. This doesn't make sense on a business perspective.
3. The class labes are much smaller, the flamerble, shelf life etc,.
4. The color is off. You can argue with that. But
I don't dare to try this nail polish.
The middle one is also from the same seller, but it looks better. But the blue one makes me think that the middle one could be not authentic as well. You can't return the items. Please be aware you might get the same one as mine.",1.0

Terrible! Wore off in one day. Must have been very old. Threw it away.,1.0

This is not Back to the Beach Peach.  This is very misleading.,1.0
"It had a pinkish tint.  I compared to another bottle I had if the same color and it was clearly not the same.  I love OPI polish and Bubble Bath is my favorite shade for my hands, but I was disappointed the bottle I received with that name on it was not the color it was supposed to be.",1.0
"I think this is counterfeit.  The label is completely different than any other OPI bottle I've seen, but, more importantly, the color is not ""bubble bath"".

"I want to return this. I had just used OPi's Princesses Rule on my nails last week. Loved it so much I wanted to order it online. Turns out, OPI changed the formula! Beware~ if you think this will be the shimmery silver with just a tiny hint of blush polish you will be sadly mistaken.",1.0

Inauthentic OPI product.  See pictures of bottle I received (left) compared to an authentic bottle of OPI nail polish that I purchased at a salon (picture on right).,1.0
"Pretty positive this ""It's a Boy!"" color is an OPI knockoff. In my attached picture, you can see an example of a ""real"" OPI polish (green, purchased from Sally Beauty Supply, an official OPI seller) next to what I received from this vendor (blue). The font on the bottle is completely different as is the bottle itself and the brush. Held next to the computer screen, you can see that what I received does not even match the bottle shown on the web page. Very disappointed, and will never purchase from this vendor again.",1.0
"I have used this color at salons for some time.  Despite thoroughly mixing the polish, it went on very streaky from the bottle I ordered.  (Also the other color I ordered did the same.). I can only assume since my salons don't have a problem with it either the polish was a different product in an OPI bottle, or it was very OLD, which I suspect.  Made several attempts and same result each time. Since both are from the same seller, my hunch is the latter. Won't be ordering from them again.  Samoan sand is a pretty warm undertone beige neutral.",1.0
"This product isn't the real deal. It is not a authentic OPI product..I actually purchased the real product at target and although the color is somewhat similar it isn't what it truly is, it's also quite watery...Do not buy this product as it is not returnable, you will regret paying 5 bucks for a nail polish that is probably worth 1 dollar..:Just go to a beauty supply pay 4 more dollars and you'll still the real deal and you don't get ripped off like I did. On the picture it looks like the OPI nail polish containers I have and then you open it and it's not as it appears. I have uploaded pictures of the fake product and the authentic polishes I've purchased at the store...I have quite a collection old and new so with that being said do not purchase this product here it is not the real deal!!!! ..:see for yourself what you see is not what you will get...",1.0

Even though the labels on the ones received clearly  state  'Pink-ing of You', they are in no way anywhere NEAR the same color of the existing bottle.  The color of polish in the new bottles is WAY off and definitely not the soft,  light pink of the one I own. Shame on OPI for changing the color of an existing polish and keeping the same name!!  Since they cannot be returned, I guess I am out of luck.  :(",1.0

The color is nothing like the picture!  It is a lot brighter in person and would be great for Halloween but that's about it!,1.0
"The color I received is not ""Tickle my France-y"" It is much pinker than the real color and a thicker consistency. I have a tester bottle at home and compared the color. The bottling is also different than the OPI bottles I have purchased before. The lettering is to big and close together, the font is not the same, there is usually a line under the ""nail lacquer"" line and the product description at the bottom of the label is usually in french and spanish. In short I do not believe this is an authentic bottle of OPI unless the product packaging and color has changed.",1.0
Doesn't spread evenly. I had to dab it on all over the nail to get the sparkles. I think my bottle was defective but seller DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS! My bottle had more clear polish than sparkles! Don't waste your money. This bottle is going to little girls to play with.,1.0
Very ugly color :/,1.0
The color is not gray nor blue. It is ugly. I threw it out after putting it on once.,1.0
I'm not sure if this is real product or a copycat.  The packaging is totally different than the rest of the opi nail polishes,1.0

I received nail polish that wasn't brand new and appeared to have additional thinning ingredients added.  It remained sticky for hours and was therefore unusable.,1.0
I purchased this color based on the name after I used it at a recent pedicure. The color is not at all the same. Opi has done a poor job of color consistency. I really liked the color of the same name at my nail salon. The one that I ordered using the Opi name is an uninspiring color.,1.0
I love Opi nail polish however I do not like this product.  The color is not what I expected it to be.  You have to put lots of coats on for it to not be transparent.  After three coats and one top coat later it chipped off less than 9 hours later.  I just wasted my time and my money.,1.0

Til I went to take it off. This is NOT opi. This is a knock off. My toe nails are dyed green and I'm not sure HOW seeing as this green polish was applied OVER a bottom coat, 3 coats of blue and 2 top coats! How did it even reach my actual nails? They're totally dyed and I'm gonna have to have black toes as nothing else will cover it. I'm using hair dye remover to get it off my skin! I should have known by the lumpy yet thin consistency. Will not even put on my wishlist from this seller... this isn't the first time I've got a knock off OPI on amazon either! The photo is my nails after soaking in acetone AND buffing the dye off, still green!!! -and by knock off I mean it's old and watered down all at once-",1.0
peeled the next day.  Expected much better quality  from OPI,1.0
"Probably should have returned this polish. NEVER had OPI polish that behaved this way. I question the brand name....can this rely be OPI?
Sure does not behave like it.  I learned my lesson.  Ill buy my polish elsewhere, suggest you do same.
Sadly disappointed.",1.0
not impressed with color or polish....way too expensive,1.0
It said it was matte black polish when I ordered.  It is not.  Waste of time and money,1.0
Not the correct color,1.0
"... IF YOU PURCHASED OPI BUBBLE BATH locally and it was a gentle, soft, almost natural color ... this bottle has awful bubble gum PINK polish that is nowhere near what I wanted ... this color would be great on a little child or her dolly.",1.0
"This color is NOT A BRIGHT color as pictured-this is NOT a bright pink/red...I don't think so. It's REALLY  maroon, about 5 shades DARKER than pictured. I don't like it at all...that being said, just about every OPI color I've recv'd so far isn't true to color.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF YOU LIKE THE COLOR PICTURED...a word of advice, ladies, ,unless you are  familiar with a color, have used it, and found it here for a good price....SAVE PURCHASING NAILPOLISH FOR IN PERSON!! What a disappoint...and it's just been disappointment after disappointment w colors. I spent alot of money, and won't ever wear the stuff I rec'ved. AGAIN-THIS IS NOT A BRIGHT PINK/RED...it's a flat maroon. If you like that color, by all means, purchase it...but you're being  mislead. Im a cosmetologist, and did nails for a long time...I specialize in nails, pedicures, skincare and makeup.  DON'T DO IT!!  I've wasted ALOT of money on nailpolish here. Never again.",1.0
I bought this same color in the store and the colors are not the same at all.  My friend has this color too and it matches the color in the store not this one.,1.0
Nail salon technician would not use this polish because it was thinned and would not properly cover.,1.0
Nail salon wouldn't use this polish because it was thinned and would not cover correctly.,1.0
This is the only OPI polish I've ever bought that is awful. It does not have a smooth appearance even after several coats. Very surprised.,1.0
Chipped off after one day.,1.0
The color was not really showing even though I tried to put more layers. Not sure if I got the real one because OPI used to stay on easily and show colors. Disappointed.,1.0
Product arrived broken and the rest (11) of my nail polish that came in the same box were completely full of that color on the outside,1.0
This polish must be old! Will not go on smoothly starts pealing off in 1 day.  Very dissatisfied with this one bottle  This is a good brand. Not this bottle!,1.0
"If I coud give this 0 stars I would. The color is beautiful and goes on smooth. However, when you try to take it off...it will stain your nails and all your fingers. So you will have green fingers and nails. No amount of nailpolish remover would take it off. I had to go to the salon and pay for a mani/pedi in order to get rid of the stains left by the nail polish. It took several salon staff over 2 hours to get most of the color out of my skin. And even then, I had to paint over the nail, because the green did not come off. Worst experience ever.",1.0
Fake fake fake!!! The brush is different and the polish is watered down. Do not buy,1.0
This is almost white. Not nearly the pink they show in the picture. Won't buy polish on line again..,1.0
"The color on the screen is nothing like the polish. The polish is dark - dark with a flat, opaque hue. It does not have any shine at all. Ive bought two of the OPI infinite shine colors and definitely wii not make that mistake again. Hello, Revlon!!!",1.0
Not the glow in the dark cotton candy.  This has a matte finish and they won't take returns,1.0
"I've gotten the OPI Passion Nail Polish at different salons when getting manicures and always enjoyed the color.  Unfortunately, what was sent to me is not of the same quality.  Perhaps it's sat in a hot warehouse for a long time???  The color is off from what it should be and the texture is somewhat gloppy.",1.0
"I've purchased this nail polish before and had no problems with it. For some reason the bottle I received this time has a very unpleasant  strong smell to it, to be honest it has a strong marijuana type odor to it. I'm used to nail polish having a strong smell, but this makes me not want to use it.",1.0
I received the wrong color. I ordered Cha Ching Cherry and received Color So Hot It Burns. Disappointed!,1.0
"I have a love/hate relationship with this nail polish for the last two years.  I love the way it dries SO fast (you have to use the infinite shine Top Coat to cure it) and lasts for a long time without chipping.  It's beautiful polish.  BUT after wearing it for a couple of weeks, it absolutely destroys my nails.  I don't know what it does, but my nails take a couple of months to come back to life.  My nails chip, crack and are just demolished after using this polish.  I've tried off and on for two years now and I guess I just have to stop using it.  I normally have very strong, healthy nails but something in this polish just sucks the absolute life out of them.",1.0
"I bought this in the pale blue ""To Infinity and Blue-yond,"" which had a bit of a shimmer in the pics. Nope. Polish was streaky and impossible to apply. First coat was uneven and thick--you could see every brush stroke--but a second coat made it so goop that it wouldn't dry. It was like using White-Out or semigloss house paint. (Both of which I've done in the past.) Third attempt, final versionshade is a thick powder blue, and the only ""shine"" comes from the flash on my phone camera. (Deep blue in photo is Essie Gel Couture ""Front Page Worthy""  you may be able to see the difference in texture.)",1.0
The polish i received wasn't the same as advertised it is more pink. I wanted this color because of getting a manicure at a nail salon and I loved the color. I am not happy since I can't even return it.  The 1st pic is the bottle I ordered and the 2nd is from the nail salon which is the same as advertised.,1.0
I thought it was gel polish but its regular and too expensive for regular polish,1.0
Worst buy ever. Doesn't become a solid color even when I put 3 coats on.,1.0
This OPI bottle came shattered in the box.,1.0
"This is the wrong color. I bought it because I liked the sample sized version I got, and wanted to keep wearing it. But when I got this it was a completely different color. I went to Target yesterday and found a bottle to compare them, and I think this one might be fake because the label looks different.",1.0
I have bought Nomad's Dream for many years.  But I haven't bought it the last several years from my hairdresser's nail display because it looked different.  By chance I saw the Amazon photo and it was the silvery pink I used to buy.  What I received today was completely different than the picture shown. It is a golden coral.  I am very disappointed.,1.0
I ordered a pearlized pink and got tan,1.0
This green color stained my nails so badly.  I now have to go around looking like I have mold growing under my nails.,1.0
"""Pearl of Wisdom"" color goes on streaky and irregular, their other colors are better at this.  Very unhappy with this",1.0
"One of the worst nail polishes I've owned/used.  I had to put on 4 layers for it to be black and it started chipping off by the next day.  I was wearing two colors black and orange, and the orange was perfect.  Never chipped and the black was thrashed when I removed it.",1.0
"Color was beautiful, but the glitter in the product damages my nails.",1.0
Garbage - chips right away.,1.0
Color nothing like what us shown. The picture showing the grannies nails are not the color that was sent. DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED.,1.0
Horrible color.  Has the consistency and look of White Out on your nails.  Threw away after painting two nails.,1.0
It was not the correct color at all!!!! So disappointing!!,1.0
Disappointed.  It was more glittery than shiny,1.0
HORRIBLE DONT BUY. When I received it was so thick unable to use.,1.0
Very  dull no shine,1.0
"Coverage is terrible. It takes at least 4 coats, if not 5 for fully coverage, in addition to the base coat and top coat, ultimately demanding at least 2 hours of patience to dry. Because of how many coats it requires, it also chips quickly and easily. Putting it on is a nightmare that I wouldn't wish upon anybody.",1.0
Streaks very badly.,1.0
I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it came from Hong Kong.  It took almost a month to arrive and then had to be signed for.  The polish was thinner than it should have been and chipped after a few days.  It doesn't seem to be authentic OPI.,1.0
"Very see through. You can hardly tell there is polish on. its almost like a top coat for a French manicure-where you can still see everything underneath it. It's basically a top coat with a slight tint. If that's what you're looking for, this may be the polish for you.
From looking at the image online, I thought it was an opaque color, or at least somewhat opaque. It's totally translucent though.
Hope this helps your decision.
Cheers!",1.0
I don't think it's OPI. The worst polish ever. Doesn't go on evenly. Super thin. Bad all around.,1.0
i guess it was old. the Mrs. said it went on all gloopy and not smooth as it should.,1.0
"terrible finish.  Streaky, lumpy, poor coverage.",1.0
Product description not on Amazon website accurate.  The description says OPI Nail polish.  It should read GEL polish! TO MAKE IT WORSE THE ITEM IS NOT RETURNABLE!,1.0
"Orange, orange, orange.
If you're a Broncos or Syracuse fan this color is for you. Sadly, I ordered a product that claimed to be red...",1.0
This was not a good sale or a good product.  I believe that the polish was  old or defective.  It did not dry and look like the color in the bottle.  The vendor wanted to charge me a 15% restocking fee and pay for return postage.,1.0
I strongly suspect this is a cheap knock-off. I've had OPI polish at the nail salon and it doesn't start flaking off in the first day or two like this one does. I'm going to throw it out and buy something from my local shop.,1.0
"Needs multiple coats to cover, near impossible to apply without streams.",1.0
This color is definitely more of a brassy yellow than gold.,1.0
"Usually I LOVE OPI polish and have used it for years. But for some reason, this new formula is awful. It starts to chip off within 48 hours. I expect much more from OPI, especially for $12.50 per bottle. I've had better results from cheap Sally Hanson polish. The picture here is two coats of polish that I put on two days ago. Wretched looking! The only good news is that I won't need to use polish remover before my next polishing; all I have to do is wait a few more days and my nails will be bare when the rest of it chips off.",1.0
"Somebody must be color blind.  This polish is not deep burgundy, it is blood red even after 3 coats. Big disappointment.",1.0
"This is NOT really OPI. I purchased and used and it was so hard to paint on my nails. It was like glue. I purchased OPI from Sallys later that day to try and it was completely different and better. You cannot return this item. Save your time and money.

(I buy from Amazon at least once a week... never had an issue like this before.)",1.0
"The wrong color was sent and I never could get any satisfaction/re-send of the proper color. Also, product was possibly frozen, got too high a temperature or was old/defective.",1.0
"this color looks nothing like shown and you cannot return it or get a refund because of some issue with transport. It is like a blackish burgundy, horrible and gothic looking! I threw it away because I would never wear it and shown looks mauvish-burgundy. BEWARE!",1.0
Peels within 2 days,1.0
Chipped the next day. Don't waste your money,1.0
Color looks different and it makes bubbles on my nails.,1.0
I am so disappointed with this purchase. i discovered this color the other day at a nail salon. it was the most beautiful shade after only 2 coats. i just applied 4 coats and the color is still really light. nothing like the shade I had applied at the salon. I honestly think the sellers dilute the nail polish.,1.0
"This is a horrible product. It does not 'rapid dry'. It makes the polish, for a lack of s better word, gooey. Even after 2 hrs. I wish there was a returb policy. Complete waste of money!! This will be making it's way to the trash. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. OPI typically has a very high standard in my book. They dropped it on this product.",1.0
"I will be throwing this away because this stuff NEVER dries! I would paint my nails around 2pm and it appeared to be dry to the point where I could go about my day. But after going to bed at 10pm and waking up in the morning there would ALWAYS be tons of sheet prints when I woke up. I also only did 1 coat of the top coat, so its not like I used too much product. I don't experience this problem with their regular polish. Just this top coat. I bought Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat and am MUCH happier with that purchase.",1.0
"When I received this product it was broken in the package, there was nothing protecting it from being able to break nor a fragile sign to warn people thats its breakable",1.0
"Infinite Shine line is very streaky, the top coat doesn't level, so it may be shiny, but is very textured. Dries to a ripple texture just like CND Vinylux line. I am astounded that reputable lines release these products that are doomed. It may last longer because it's like latex or vinyl & therefore softer & less prone to chipping when nails are subjected to shocks & dings. But just looks aweful",1.0
Bottle came cracked in 2 places... afraid to even open this...... !!! Now what? stuck with something I can't use...,1.0
Love the color but it is so runny (not thick at all) I can't even use it.  I love OPI and I have never had a problem with OPI before.,1.0
"As someone else already commented, this polish color chips off after ONE DAY! I went back to Ulta to ask for tips, and the girls there suggested using alcohol prior to application to ensure the nail was dry. They suggested waiting plenty of time to let it dry between coats. I have tried this polish multiple times following all the steps and using all of the three infinite shine layer steps. Something is wrong with this color formula--for me anyhow. I have other colors in the ""infinite shine"" collection that don't have this problem.",1.0
"You can see the color in the picture is a deep red sparkle and what i received is a baby pink gel polish (with the same name, Indefinitely Baby). Amazon issued a refund.",1.0
"picture of color and name are incorrect, I received something with same name, but it is a baby pink and a lacquer.",1.0
Just because amazon didn't let me return this product I must to warn you guys. THIS IS NOT OPI. IS SOOO POOR QUALITY. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE. IM REALLY DESAPOINTED.,1.0
This stuff was terrible!!! No shine whatsoever. Total waste of time and money ,1.0
Stuff is horrible. I followed the directions exactly and it took less than 24 hours to start chipping off. Amazon could not accept a return due to policies about shipping chemicals but they issued me a refund anyway.,1.0
"Worst top coat I've used. I love OPI nail polishes, but this is terrible. It takes forever to dry, even after 8 hours it still dented.",1.0
I paid way to much for my nails to still be chipping the next day. I paid 10$ for literally nothing. Dont have the energy to return Ill just use it when i want a glossy look but don't plan on it protecting your nails.,1.0
"A pale pink (I would not call it nude), wasn't thick, and went on well, but dries streaky, even after three coats it was not opaque. I will have to use something else on top of it.",1.0
Never had an OPI polish that chips and peels off the same day I put it on. This one does. I tried it twice. Once with base coat and once with out and both times it chipped off within hours of my doing my nails. Very strange.,1.0
"This is not what I expected.  The polish looks like 'flakes'.  When removing......very difficult.  I love OPI nail polish, but not this one.",1.0
Bottle was old color was seperated,1.0
"I bought this polish (Opi Mod About You sold bu Pinnacle Supply fulfilled by Amazon) because a friend was wearing it and it matched my pink Electra beach cruiser bike EXACTLY. The color is fine but this polish arrived totally separated and is thick, streaky and impossible to put on nicely. I used to sit next to a lady at work who gave herself manicures with the white-out.  My nails look like a pink version of that nightmare.",1.0
"I bought Bee Mine Forever, put it on for the first time today. This polish is a darker yellow than it looks to be on the listing, which, ok, that happens, but it's just really terrible overall. The consistency is such that the first coat is streaky, and the second coat does not help, the streaks beneath are still visible. I have had it on for just a few hours now, having used the OPI base and top coat for this line, and it has chipped already even though I have done nothing chip-worthy. This line of polish is really hit-or-miss with color, consistency, and durability and I would say this one is a major loser. Also do not recommend the silver or Beyond the Pale Pink.",1.0
"Do not buy this, I LOVE the color but the nail polish quality is crap. I am really good at nails but this nail polish just WILL NOT go on without several coats and the consistency is like tar. Will not buy again.",1.0
The WORST quality--my nail color chips 3 times as fast with this coat. UGH.,1.0
"I bought a bottle of high shine top coat, shipped and sold by Amazon.  However I believe this is a knock off or thinned by someone.  The consistency is really watery, any drops on the nail immediately spreads and drips everywhere.  The tips of the bush immediately picks up color from well dried polish.  I had high hopes of getting a high shine, thick top coat, but the item I received is a really bad product.",1.0
It is not the opi brand . The product is very watery. When you look at the back the label is definitely a forgery. So surprising Amazon sells this product,1.0
Color doesn't look like picture. It's a greenish yellow looking color.,1.0
Received broken bottle upon arrival. :(,1.0
This arrived BROKEN! Tiny glass pieces everywhere,1.0
Ugly color! What was OPI Thinking?,1.0
This shade is definitely not the same as the original OPI Hawaiian Orchid at all. The original was sheer with a hint of lilac. This is neither. Very disappointed.,1.0
Came broken and covered everything in my order.,1.0
really weird polish,1.0
