"Having lived in West New Guinea (Papua) during the time period covered in this video, it is realistic, accurate, and conveys well the entrance of light and truth into a culture that was for centuries dead to and alienated from God.",5.0
Excellent look into contextualizing the Gospel and God's sovereignty over cultural barriers. The book and movie are both captivating. I would definitely recommend to both Christians and non-believers.,5.0
"More than anything, I've been challenged to find ways to share Christ is a culturally relevant way to those around me.  Peace child is a cherished ""how to"" for me to do that.",5.0
This movie was in ENGLISH....it was a great summary of the book and the experience of the Richardsons while in New Guinea.,5.0
"This is a fascinating true story, well acted by many of the actual characters.  Watch this and see just one of countless examples of how faithfully God works out ways for all of mankind to find Him, in every culture.",5.0
"So sorry I didn't purchase this years ago when it first came out!!  This is very good and entertaining!  We absolutely loved it and anticipate seeing it repeatedly.  We actually wore out the cassette years back, so we also purchased this same product on cd.  Best purchase we made out of all!  Would purchase on dvd if we could find one.",5.0
"Product received quickly from seller. Product was in great condition as stated. People who enjoy southern gospel music will be thrilled with this offering by the various Cathedral performers, with the exception of Payne and Younce, down through the years. Also quite happy with service. Would use seller again.",5.0
Believe me when I tell you that you will receive a blessing watching this video of the Cathedral Quartet.  They bring back most of the singers that were ever in their group and it is a really great VHS.,5.0
This video arrived in perfect shape to the far away country of New Zealand It is a really blessing to see all the different members of the quartet over the years. Great singing! Pastor Greg,5.0
"The Reunion of the Cathedral Quartet in 1995 was an effort to salute the men who had contributed to this great Southern Gospel quartet.  The driving force behind the quartet was Glen Payne and George Younce, who remained with the group through several personnel changes.  This video is full of moments of laughter and sentiment, and the music is outstanding.",5.0

This is truly a moving video to watch if you like great southern gospel quartets. It has some of the greatest singers that have made up the greatest gospel quartet of all time and even the ones that have not been  with the Cathedrals for 30 years still sound fantastic. It is a blessing to  watch.,5.0
"I have a thing against purchasing live DVDs. After all, how many times do you want to sit and watch a gig that you probably weren't even there for in the first place?

But as a dedicated X fan, I couldn't resist checking this out, and I'm thrilled that I did. This is the band in top-notch form.

It's encouraging that people who weren't around L.A. during X's heyday are finally clueing in to how historically important they were, and still are. And this DVD proves they're still as vital and viable as ever.

Do yourself a favor. If you've wandered to this page, there must be a reason. Don't leave without purchasing this DVD. You'll be glad you did, whether you're a diehard fan like myself, or a fan of music who is simply curious. All hail X, and may they continue to make music together for years to come.",5.0
"This DVD is unbelievable!  If you are a fan of punk rock, you have to own this DVD.  They play all of their classic songs and the bonus footage is amazing.  I think my favorite part is when they play ""White Girl.""  X has been around for a long time and this is their first live concert DVD, so it makes it even more awesome.  And the liner notes by Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers are really cool too.  Definitely buy this DVD!  It's worth every penny!",5.0
"Just brought this DVD home, and it rocks.  Those uninitiated to this great band don't know, but the fans understand, that this is a band that never disappoints live, and I can vouch for this having seen them 25+ times with and without Billy Zoom, solo, and in their Knitters incarnation.  The cool thing about this DVD is that it does not feel nostalgic - unlike the recent Blasters DVD (also by the good folks at Shout!).  The Blasters were and are a fine band, but one look at the audience on that DVD shows that the thrill is, if not gone, definitely waning.  No so with X.  Fans are still passionate, the playing and singing are still passionate, like the band still totally believes in what they are doing, and it shows.  So, fans will love it, but can this win over some new fans?  That's the question.  If you love the band, this DVD is a must buy.  For those of you with tangential interest, or who love other great bands like The Ramones, The Clash etc., or all of you on the east coast not too familiar with the band, take the plunge.  This DVD rocks.  Dare I ask....rock and roll hall of fame anyone????",5.0
"This is exactly how a concert DVD should be done. Tons of cudos to the editors and director of ""X Live in Los Angeles"". Thank you for just showing this amazing live performace, of one of Los Angeles greatests bands. Not .5 seconds rapid fire editing that would make someone sick to their stomach, just simple edits that emphises the music. When Billy Zoom does a solo the camera is actually on......Billy Zoom. Now to the performance. Basically, X still has it, in spades. The song selection is good, John Doe sounds as great as ever and the band is smoking.

I have seen X do faster paced sets in my day but this one is very good. Although the DVD is excellent, the best way to experience this show is to get as many people as you can into your living room, turn the heater onto around 100 degrees and blast this sucker. Now we're living.",5.0
"I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait.",5.0
"I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the ""power pop"" ""punk"" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!! UPDATE:  I've been so lucky to catch X a couple of times with Billy on guitar since I wrote this, it was just incredible seeing them, this DVD does give an accurate view of what it is like to have X RIPPING it up in concert!  cheers.",5.0
"X is one of the best punk bands ever. I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.

This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.

Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.

Why X? Did you know, for example, that:
- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?
- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?
- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?
- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?
- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with ""Soul Kitchen"" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors</a>
- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?
- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?

As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.

I waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good.",5.0
"This is a fantastic video for anyone that is a fan of X or punk music. They sound as great as ever.
The DVD contains all the great songs. I look back fondly on the days when music was raw and real.",5.0
"For all you X fans out there-you will love this DVD -X are a great band live, and if they aren't coming to your town on their tour-this may be the next best thing to seeing them live!",5.0
"I got this DVD as an Xmas gift. I was very hesitant as I did not want to ruin the greatness I had in my vivid memory of X on the Sunset Strip back in the day. Needless to say my trepidation was unwarranted.

This DVD is awesome. It is edited well and they sound great. Billy Zoom has not lost anything and  Bonebrake is as good as ever. John Doe still can sing and has the great bass line, Exene sounds good as well, all though the years have not treated her well.

A must buy for any X fan. Now if the UCLA bruins football can return to the 1979-1984 form as well as X -all would be good.",5.0
"I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other ""new wave/punk"" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them ""live"" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as ""pretty"" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago. Then, once humbled, go buy this CD. You will love it!",5.0
I think I saw X about 20 - 25 times from 1985 - 1995. They were always great and this brings back a lot of memories for me. They are a tight band that always sound great. I wish this had all of thier songs from that concert that is on the CD.,5.0
"Being born in 1960 really ticked me off...Not old enough to really enjoy or not enjoy those carefree rock/roll, Dylanesque  years and awaiting my young adult years was the end of disco or the beginning of something in music called punk....Being a ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" landed me in the punk scene in the Bay Area...""Dead Kennedy's"" ""The Replacements"" and others were just either playing local clubs or being thrown into jail. Jello Biafra got married in a cemetary..Anywho, I was just shedding my Beatlemania and visiting nightclubs like DV8, One Step Beyond,181, Club X, Das Club, The Edge/Vortex, Face to Face, and Gotham City...I had seen ""X"" on New Year's night 1990 and being I was 30 decided this was my last year for dancing and clubbing...All the new wave/punk places were being torn down or remodeled for the next generation....That night I was blown away! Everyone in X had aged but still retained that youthful spirit and I tell ya it revitalized me! I danced all night long just like the old days....This DVD strangely enough revitilizes me again and had me tapping my feet, bobbing my head or singing along to ""We're Desperate"", ""White Girl"", ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline""....It's definitely not a Beatles concert but the spirit and energy of the times will affect those of us growing up in those times and listening to that loud music....Geez, whatever happened to Dot Little? She's the one who asked me to be a punk with her! If you see her tell her I still love her!",5.0
"It just so happens that I was at this very show at the HOB in hollywood.  As a matter of fact, I can be seen in many of the shots of the crowd.  This show was nothing short of amazing.  After the show I was permitted to socialize with the band in the upstairs room.  Pretty cool for an old dude like myself.

If you know X, this is a must.  If you are young and new, it's a great place to get a taste of music history.

"I recently saw X live in Atlanta, Georgia and was blown away with thier amazing performance, this DVD displays how they still have a passion for playing punk rock music. Good picture and sound, if you like X, buy this testament of punk history!!!",5.0
"I must admit I was hesitant to purchase this DVD. A classic punk band performing twenty plus years later, what could one expect? Apparently, one can expect a hell of a lot. These guys and gal can still tear their songs apart.

It's well filmed; there isn't that MTV, rapid editing that can cause seizures. The audio is excellent; you can actually understand the lyrics. It's well mixed. It's far superior to a lot of live performance DVD's currently released by some bands. X released a product that is worthy of ones money.

If you like X; you'll love this DVD. If you just appreciate a good rock/punk concert, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
"WE have ""Hide 'Em In your Heart"" the first volume, and I cant say anything but great things about it. All my children love them ranging in age from 12 months to 11. They sing verses directly out of the bible. I find myself singing the verses throughout the day. It is a great tool to put a song in your heart that is in fact God's word. Also a great tool for scripture memorization.",5.0
"My husband and I have had Steve Green's Hide Em In Your Heart Vol's 1 and 2 playing in our home and cars for over 10 years as we have been raising our 7 children.  (We started with cassette tapes!) The quality is great, and the lyrics are simply Bible verses.  The best part is that you will not ""grow weary"" of listening to these as you do with some other children's music.  I recommend them to anyone with small children that is interested in teaching them Bible verses.  They will learn all of these wonderful verses in no time and fill your home with sweet music!",5.0
"We have been playing this album to our 1-year old almost ever since she was born.  She loves the songs so much that sometime she likes to dance along, and sometimes the songs amazingly can calm her down.  All the songs are very pleasant to listen to for the baby and even for us, and we believe it is a great way to teach our daughter bible verses.  We would not need the DVD though if we were to buy it again.",5.0
"I heard about this cd/dvd on the radio and after reading the reviews here I bought it for my 2 year old son.  It is great, the songs are not long, very clever, and I don't mind listening to them over and over either.  My son loves watching the dvd and already knows some of the words, which is awesome because the words are straight from the bible.",5.0
"We all enjoy this video, the clothing is a bit outdated, but the verses and songs are timeless! My youngest children even are saying the  verses along with the narrator the first week!",5.0
"We got this CD/DVD set for our 2 year old, and I can't say enough about the quality of the music and lyrics.  This is clean, healthy, happy music!  The music is beautifully arranged and doesn't sound like a low budget synthesizer.  This is actually well orchestrated and professionally recorded.  The lyrics are straight out of the Bible, and a terrific way to memorize scripture!  Our son has thoroughly enjoyed the music, and begs for us to play it for him over and over.  We have listened to the CD so many times I'm amazed it hasn't gotten worn out, and even more amazingly my husband and I are not sick of it...on the contrary, we are sincerely uplifted by it.  It hasn't gotten on our nerves, the way so many other kid's CD's do.  The DVD is definitely outdated, as far as the outfits go, but the content and the music are delightful!  Don't hesitate on this purchase...you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"Excellent dvd, lots of fun and great songs!  Steve Green is a wonderful artist.",5.0
"The clothing is dated, but the music and words are timeless.  My son has learned so much from watching this DVD.  We don't watch much television, but this is a great DVD for young children.  The music is catchy (but not irritating as a lot of childrens music is), and the words are straight out of scripture.  There is a nice variety of upbeat songs and quieter songs.  My son is almost 2, and he asks for his ""Bible Kids"" ALL the time.  Our copy is several years old and scratched, I came looking on Amazon to buy a replacement, but it is unavailable.  I hope if it is out of production that it will be remade in the future, I wish there were more DVD's like this on the market for kids.  I give this a five star rating for content and quality.  If you are going to be annoyed by the very 80's style clothing, I'll give it a four ;)",5.0
My grandkids loved this and it made it easy for them to learn scripture verses I a fun way. The DVD was a great bonus.,5.0

We LOVE this at our house!!! My 4 year old knows all of the songs and I catch her singing them constantly. Our toddler loooooves watching the DVD and dances to the CD whenever we put it in. She even hums along and chimes in a word here and there where she can!,5.0
Love it!!  Great way to teach children the Bible in a fun way.  (Side bonus--adults are reminded of the Biblical truths again.),5.0

"This video may be dated, but my grandchildren listen and watch is almost daily.  Even I find myself singing along at randomly times when it isn't even playing.",5.0
The CD Is great and teaching kids the Word of God through song! The DVD is 80s and you can tell but still great and clear!,5.0
My granddaughter loves it! This is her bedtime music; she walks around the house singing SCRIPTURE.Steve Green's voice is that strong tender that brings respect for the WORD of GOD.,5.0
"When I was a little girl, my parents had both the VHS tapes and the cassettes for both Hide 'Em In Your Heart volumes. We also saw Steve Green do these live a time or two.  My siblings and I knew every song by heart, and we loved them.

Now, I have children of my own.  My daughter, barely two years old now, was given this DVD/CD combo pack by her Nonni and Poppop.  She knows all the songs.  Just yesterday she ran around singing ""My Father's House . . . Mickey Mansions . . . Prepare a place for YOU, for YOU!""  I almost cried with joy.

Having my children learn the Bible through these songs is priceless, especially since this was (and often still is) how I learned and remembered Scripture growing up.  The songs are short enough to hold interest and are easily learned by even the youngest child. My son is seven months old and, while he is too young to sing them, he recognizes them to the point that he will stop screaming and begin giggling and smiling when he hears the music begin.

Each song is introduced by the corresponding Bible verse and often a brief, simple explanation to help little ones understand what is being taught.

I cannot recommend this highly enough.  Get this music for your children and grandchildren and watch in wonder as they sing Bible verses all day long.  Hide 'Em In Your Heart got five stars from me as a child, and it has ten stars from me as a parent!",5.0
My son loves this video!  It came in perfect condition and in a very timely manner.  I would recommend this for parents with young children.,5.0
"I grew up with this on VHS, thats why I bought it for my boys. Loved that it was a DVD/CD combo. One in the house ,other in the car. My boys are entranced by this movie. I get so much done without them underfoot when its running",5.0
"I have three small children, one doesn't even watch tv yet.  The three and four year old will sit and watch the video.  It's great because as they go about singing the songs they are learning scripture.  No they don't understand everything, but it's hiding in their hearts for when they will need it later.  OK, a little silly, but they seem to like it.",5.0
"We enjoyed the original VHS, so I was already impressed with the content.
What a great treat to purchase the CD and the DVD together.  My whole
family loves it: my toddler enjoys the music and interaction; my teen feels
nostalgic about it; my husband and I are pleased with the content and
presentation.",5.0

"I have enjoyed this video for many years with my nephew and nieces.  As soon as my daughter was old enought to enjoy it, I purchased it.  She loves to watch other kids and she loves to sing and dance.  All of that along with a very good way to remember age appropriate scripture makes this video a must have for my family!",5.0

"The C.D. / DVD is wonderful, the music is great...but there are no performance tracks for our 3 & 4 year old choir.  And there is no sheet music available either.

The music is really great, but it needs to be supported for children's choirs.",5.0
The DVD came in great condition and provided lots of entertaining minutes of reliving the past.  Definitely worth the money.,5.0
What a great way to instill the Word of God in your child's heart. It has been a treasure to hear my 4 year old sing these songs out of the blue. The music is well done and encouraging. I find it is so good for my heart too.,5.0
"Wonderful, fun way to teach truths to children.  Every child I know loves these videos and songs.  Good for parents too.",5.0
Every evangelical Christian should be familiar with the information provided in this video.,5.0
"This was an amazing DVD that I definitely recommend.  What I found interesting was the background and beginning of both, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU!  It actually turned my stomach a couple times.  Hopefully you enjoy it as well.",5.0
"I enjoyed the Gospel focused presentation of the history of our nation, but one section regarding the trial of a soldier for homosexuality is inappropriate for younger children. Also, later in the movie there are some clips of violence against a church by homosexual activists covered by news reports that would be too strong from young children.  Lastly, open displays of affection by homosexuals is covered by news reports at the end of the movie as well.  My advice is to view the movie yourself first and then determine what sections you can allow your children to view.  If you are not a Christian, you'll hate this movie.",5.0

The result of this journey will give us a better understanding of where America is today, how she arrived here, and where she must turn at this critical hour.

This is a real eye opener. You will feel outraged and saddened by what has slowly happened to this country. You will feel inspired to fight the good fight in order to not lose any more ground to the liberals in our country. You will get an insight to the US Court sytems and how their controversial decisions have slowly eroded our freedoms and challenge the very fabric that this great nation was founded upon.,5.0

"There is an essential message here that is not being told in society today.  People claim that this nation was not founded on Christianity, and that the writers of the Constitution were actually Deists rather than Christians.  There is a preponderance of evidence over centuries of time presented here, including the wording of documents such as the Mayflower Compact, that establish the Christian heritage of this nation unapologetically beyond refute, as a matter of history.

The other story that is not being told is the origins and destructive objectives of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The founder of Planned Parenthood was interested in eugenics, and specifically in reducing the number of Blacks to survive being born in this country.  Efforts by the ACLU to remove prayer and the Bible from school are shown to be in direct conflict with the statements by the founding fathers about what they considered to be essential for a proper education that would equip the youth of this country for effective citizenship.  The redefinition of marriage to include homosexual relationships is shown to be tearing at the fabric of the traditional family, and of the stability of our society.

We HAVE become A Nation Adrift, and much of that comes from ignorance of how this country was founded, and of the sacrifices that were made along the way.  This DVD would be beneficial for viewing in every home, school, and church in this country.",5.0

I found this dvd put together with historical facts and visuals that kept my interest in the issues discussed. would recommend 6-12 grade classes watching this.,5.0
"Well done!  I will definitely be showing this to my children when they get a little older.  This is the documentary you will never see in our public school system these days.  Ironically, it is the one documentary that you should have to see before you graduate.  It is amazing how far our country has fallen from the original intentions of our Founding Fathers.  This is a great reminder of what liberalism and political correctness has done to the United States of America.",5.0
This is the history we need to be teaching in our schools. Everyone should see this!,5.0
A Nation Adrift is a must see documentary.  It tells you what your history books didn't or tells your children what they don't hear in school.  This true American history needs to be shown in every church across the United States.  We as Christians have failed to guard what God has given us.  God have mercy on us.  LW,5.0
Really excellent piece of work showing the beliefs of the founding fathers and what is happening now to our nation.,5.0
"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.
Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.
I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.",5.0
"When this first aired in 1979, I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was ""A Christmas Carol"".  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away.",5.0
"I must confess to being a bit of a coinsure of Dickens' classic tale.  I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.
In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.  All in  all an excellent holiday piece well worth the money.",5.0

This TV movie brought back fond memories of the first time my wife and I watched it in the late 70's. Henry Winkler did a great job with the character of an American Scrooge. It was radical change from the Fonz.,5.0
"More of a 'modern' version of the classic.  I didn't think I'd be impressed when my parents took this out but I gave it a try and have to say...what a great adaptation.  The cast was great, Winkler was exceptional.  I was very happy to see this on Amazon and happened to catch it when the price went way down so I snapped it up.  Great timeless classic...and Winkler really surprised me with his portrayal.",5.0

"There are MANY versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" out there. In my humble opinion, this feature length story, set in America during the Great Depression, starring Henry Winkler in the ""Scrooge"" role, is BY FAR the finest interpretation of the classic story. It's as Dickens would have written if he had lived in America in the 1930's. The human drama is REAL, and the joyful ending brings Dickens' ending into the American culture. BIG smile !",5.0

"I was thrilled to see, ""An American Christmas Carol"", on the Prime list.  I love the Dicken's story and this was a worthy adaptation that I remembered from my original viewing more than 30 years ago.  Set in early 20th century America, there are a few simple changes from the classic version.  Scrooge is a money lender, having grown rich by lending, then repossessing merchandise when his clients could not keep up on payments.
The ghosts of Christmas past, present and future are represented by some of the clients.  But, anyone familiar with ""The Christmas Carol"", will have no trouble recognizing the storyline.
Feel good, holiday favorite.",5.0

"I can recall watching Henry Winkler on a talk show when this movie came out on television.  He asked the viewers to let him know what we thought of him in this role as it was different from the ones most had come to know him (eg.  ""The Fonz"").  When I watched it over 30 years ago, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't until recently I sought it out and watched it again.  It is an excellent retelling of the Dicken's classic with an Americanized twist.  The lessons are timeless and Henry Winkler's Mr Slade is really well done and believable.

If you are fan of a Christmas Carol and have seen many of the cinematic variations and made for TV, this is one you really have to see.",5.0
Excellent story that reminds you - to love yourself and other as God/Jesus loves you.,5.0

"In this Americanized version of The Charles Dickens classic..which takes place in Concord New Hampshire on Christmas eve,1933..""Ben Slade""(played by Henry Winkler)is an insensitive and greedy time payment holder..who forces the citizens of the small New England village to either pay up their loans or lose all of their items. When they can't pay up..they lose all of their assets and he even fires his assistant""Thatcher""for trying to get his boss to reopen the failed  mill to create new industry and jobs for the unemployed workers. But ""Slade""soon learns the folly of his ways from the ghost of his late partner""Jack Latham""..who tells him that his cruel nature will be the ruin of him and to prevent his soul from being dammed..he must expects the visits of three more ghosts..that night..""Slade""does receive those visitations..and thru the retelling of his past and seeing tragedy of a lonely and sad death..he learns his lesson and although he doesn't became a happier soul like""Scrooge""..He does learn to deal with people in a better way..This film is a wonderful retelling of the Yultide tale and Mr. Winkler gives his best performance ever.",5.0
From all the Christmas Carol's I watched based on dickens book I liked this the best.  As a boy I watched this on TV and this was not long after Henry Winkler ended his career as the Fonz.  Personally i think he should have made a bigger career as an actor but i assume he may have been type casted and thus shortened his acting future.,5.0

"I do. I like every well made version I have seen.
This one, in my opinion is the best.
Without spoiling anything for you, here is why.
The setting is in a small New Hampshire town.
It is the tail end of the great depression.
We, in the USA, can relate to this as, know it or not, it has greatly influenced todays society.

Our grandparents  were very thrifty throughout their lives as a result of these hard times.
Then, many of their children, as adults did a complete turnaround when it comes to spending, credit, and unknowingly influenced this me me me society we now witness. So now, maybe more than in Dickens' time, we can benefit from such a lesson.

More important, in my opinion, is the detail the writer used when the ghost of past showed Slade of his childhood as well as the detail of Slade's reaction at the end.
This big tough guy's eyes well up everytime I watch it.

As a couple others said, I stumbled on this movie on TV. Mid 1990's .TBS?  Quickly put in a vhs tape to record. Later,  with software, switched all my tapes to DVD.
This one, on switching, the last minute or two were destroyed.  Plus, the fact that I didn't record the very beginning and the way networks edit out several minutes to cram extra commercials, I am so looking forward to seeing, for the first time, the entire movie.

"The best filmed version of A Christmas Carol I've ever seen.  Henry Winkler is brilliant.  Many times, I've given this film as a Christmas gift to an entire family - and it is always well received by young and old.  One of my favorite scenes is when Scrooge is about to see his first ghost - can feel a haunting approaching - and is looking for an intruder among all the belongings he has repossessed from people unable to keep up on the payments.  There is a malice in his action and it makes the belongings look haunted.  Really effective.",5.0
Great,5.0
A must have for anyone who loves the Charles Dickens original. A great holiday movie for the family.,5.0
"This movie was a 1979 TV special that we watched and really enjoyed when it first aired. Henry Winkler starred as Benedict Slade (""Scrooge""), and the movie was set in Concord, New Hampshire during the Depression era.  Unfortunately, it was only broadcast a few times over the following years. It never became an annual Christmas classic like other Christmas movies.  It was available on VHS tape for a few years, but these tapes went out of production, and became hard to find, and thus expensive when found. The movie did not immediately become available on DVD, as I looked for it over the years. When we found the Blue Ray on Amazon while looking for other Christmas titles last Christmas (2013), we bought it!",5.0
Best performance ever,5.0
"I have always loved this version of A Christmas Carol, but the quality was always poor.  If you can get this on blu-ray, I recommend that.  This is a great movie, though.",5.0
Really a unique twist on a classic.  Loved this movie since I was a kid.  Great to have it in my collection!,5.0
I enjoyed this movie because it was much easier to relate to than the original English classic version.  I had watched parts of it on TV many years ago.,5.0
"I received the dvd in perfect condition and relatively quick.  The seller delivered as promised!

If you're a fan of Chrismas Carol movies, this one is a good one to have in your collection.  It's a bit different than the traditional version, but ALL versions are the ""same but different"".  I highly recommend this one!",5.0
I love the Dickens story and this is a Depression-era take on that classic. Winkler is very good as the cranky Mr. Scrooge.,5.0
I always loved this version of a Christmas Carol. It's quite well done and original. A nice diversion from the standard fare. Winkler is wonderful.,5.0
"Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive. He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge. The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers. This one is fun and easy to watch. A fine family film.",5.0
"This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid.  Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens Christmas Carol, this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit.  I love the regular story of Christmas Carol, but this is refreshingly different and a must see.",5.0

"This timeless story is relevant to today's economic times. This movie is as valuable as any modern-day teachings I've read within the context of ""how to be a better person, live well, and do it right in the new year"".

Good fun movie for the holidays nice different version of A Christmas Carol like the characters but it could have been longer,5.0

my family really enjoyed this movie. hoping to find the dvd in stores someday. might have to order on line. thanks for the choice of classic shows.,5.0
"I found this film to be just as uplifting as the classic ""Christmas Carol"".  Henry Winkler gave a sterling performance as the cold and indifferent ""Scroogelike"" character.",5.0
I collect all the (non-musical) versions of this story. This one is not seen often on TV. I watch it every Christmas. Good updated (1930's) version of the Dickens classic. TRY IT!! DVD has played well with no problems.,5.0
It seems like just about everybody has made a Christmas Carol movie.  This one is the best by far!  It seems more realistic than all the others and the time period seems to be perfect.  The acting is also far better than any of the others I've seen; my opinion.,5.0

A well done version of the story based in America.  Henry Winkler does an impressive Scrooge and pace of the film and visuals are fantastic.,5.0
"I wasn't expecting too much from this film, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the production and acting!  Henry Winkler (famous for playing ""the Fonz"" on Happy Days) proves his acting abilities and range of emotions in this satisfying film.  Some unexpected twists and just enough grit to make it evocative of Depression Era America make this a nice take on the Christmas classic.  (P.S.  Just wait for the Ghost of Christmas Futureso wouldn't think that would work out well, but it did!!!  That's all I'm saying. Love it.)",5.0
"Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here. This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.

The acting is splendid and the story is well written. It is suitable for the entire family and it gives a good picture of the depression era of our country.",5.0

"Next to the ""A Christmas Carol"" with Reginald Owen, this one should also be in your collection.  Can not go wrong having this movie.",5.0

"All I can say is watch it and judge for yourselves.  I used to live in Concord, and it is not truly historically accurate. though there does appear to be a genuine Concord Coach in Slade's barn and there is indeed still a granite  quarry.",5.0

"The first time I saw ""An American Christmas Carol"" I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.

"The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.  Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.  Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.  This is an annual ""must watch"" story for me.",5.0

"This is Charles Dickens' classic Christmas Carol with an American twist.  This version does a nice job of capturing the consequences of history and one's personal role in it.  It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, ""A Christmas Carol,"" did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.

"I almost began with ""what can I say"". Well, thinking about it I can say much about this Christmas tale. It is a great twist on a classic holiday movie. Henry Winkler is well know for his role as the ""Fonz"". He owned this movie through his portrayal of a miserable miser. His gradual aging from youth to old age was quite amazing. Oh Henry, you prove over and over what a quality actor can do for stage and screen.",5.0

It's a must-see picture, and is genuinely different from the original English version of the story. You won't be disappointed!",5.0
"I can't believe how long it took ""them"" to get this wonderful Christmas show on DVD. It's a modern (1930s America) twist on Charles Dickens' classic tale.

"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character, although well known by most, is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale.",5.0

Happy Days stifled Henry's gift as a very great actor. This movie demonstrates subtle nuances that showcase his talent and tell a great story. This film manages to tell a familiar story in a more contemporary setting that is pretty balanced for a made-for-TV. Recommend highly!,5.0

"Horrible movie.  Why Henry Winkler.........why?  The make up was terrible the sets were subpar.....I get it was '80s made for TV, but it brought our evening down fast.  Love the Winkler....no likely this movie..",1.0
"Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.

Although the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.

This review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.  It all goes to show you that one bad decision does not a career make, so there is hope for all of us, every one.",1.0
"I thought I remembered this film as a good one from television many years ago but I had obviously forgotten it completely. It's poor quality film, dated and badly written. Henry Winkler's make up is just awful. I couldn't watch it through to the end. I collect Christmas Carol films  but this one that will never go in the dvd player again!",1.0
Many changes / additions!,1.0
For being a Christian movie I felt they went to far with the scenes between Joseph and  Potiphar's wife. I gave it one star because you have to but I would not give it any or recommend it to Christians. I actually took mine out and burnt it.,1.0
"I'm not particularly religious and have nothing against X-rated movies.  This is an okay movie.  I just think that you should never watch this movie with young kids.

I watched it with my two daughters, 11 and 8, and it was an embarrassment.

There are 2 rapes, in which the women yell in pain.

There are about 35 murders with knives.  The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people.  My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.

There's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.

There's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.

"I'm not particularly religious and have nothing against X-rated movies.  This is an okay movie.  I just think that you should never watch this movie with young kids.

I watched it with my two daughters, 11 and 8, and it was an embarrassment.

There are 2 rapes, in which the women yell in pain.

There are about 35 murders with knives.  The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people.  My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.

There's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.

There's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.

"The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.  Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.  I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.  This should be rated PG 13 at least.",1.0
"Utterly grievous... My wife and I didn't make it past the stomach sickening, unbiblical, immoral scene where she's grabbing Joseph's jewels in the bath. We were both very disturbed. I thought I was watching a family film, not a porno-promo. Twenty minutes later and I still feel sickened. Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph. It's not worth watching the truth of God's Holy Word twisted and profaned for the sake of enjoying ourselves with unholy entertainment. Please do not grieve the Holy Spirit by subjecting yourself to this.

""Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!"" - Jesus (Matthew 6:22, 23)

""... the light you think you have..."" Selah.",1.0
"The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.

At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  ""Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?""  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.

What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that ""they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.""

Another reviewer writes, ""Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...""  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?

And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?

Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.

I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, ""Praise be to God"" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.

And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.

The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and ""the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.""  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?

Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.

If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.",1.0

"This horrible mess should have never been made...terrible story, awful music, dreadful animation (I use the term lightly), nasty characters, devoid of any warmth or charm...just awful, awful, awful.  This has nothing to do with Christmas or any other holiday for that matter.  Stick to the charming ""Frosty the Snowman"" and it's sequel, ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" where Frosty gets a wife.  Shame on Golden Books for including this with the original Frosty. Wish I could rate this a ZERO but I wasn't given that option.",1.0
"I hated this special.  Frosty is completely sarcastic and obnoxious, nothing like the friendly folksy Frosty we all grew to love.  Even sadder is that CBS keeps airing this back-to-back with the original Frosty.  There are so many other great Christmas specials which aren't aired on the major networks (Little Drummer Boy, George C. Scott's A Christmas Carol) because of cable and VCRs.  So it's all the more sad that this one receives yearly attention by a major network.  Couldn't they at least air the true sequel - Frosty's Winter Wonderland?  ABC used to run that one, so I don't know who owns the rights nowadays.  But either way, that would make much sense for a second half hour of Frosty rather than this dreadful piece of unwatchable junk.",1.0
This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting! Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.,1.0
"This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen!  My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason.  The movie is filled with overdone, unrealistic, trite political issues of the 90's.  It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot.  Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues.  There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.  The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple, buy that one instead.",1.0
"I just watched this sad excuse for a cartoon for the first time after viewing the original classic Frosty the Snowman. All I could think was is this country in trouble. Simply put the movie was worse than anything I could have ever imagined. It is an insult to the original cartoon. This is the result you get when left wing communist atheists attempt to destroy our American culture and traditions. How often do you hear any commercials on television or radio mention Christmas anymore? The term Christmas is practically banned from the public airwaves. I say boycott any business that refuses to use the term Christmas in their advertising. Thank god there are some of us old enough to remember what this country and it's traditions use to be like. It was at one time the greatest country in the world, currently being destroyed by the communist enemy within. I fear for the future of this Country. And in closing I must add, who ever heard of a winter carnival? I can say with confidence that this cartoon caused Jimmy Durante to turn over in his grave. An absolute disgrace.",1.0

"I really had to hunt to get all these, but I am seriously disappointed for 2 reasons. First, the presenter. Oh dear. OH DEAR. I am sure he's a great guy and all, but a presenter fit for filming he simply is not. His attempts to appear spontaneous and unscripted make him look VERY silly. VERY SILLY. You can see straight through it as clear as day. This ties in with the cinematography. Each presenter is teaching an invisible person. The camera angles follow the person if they are walking, or still, slightly to the side of the person. But where is the person the presenter is talking to? Oh my gosh. EYE CONTACT. They never eyeball the camera. It makes you feel very weird. I have never seen anything filmed like this. So the whole entire time you're watching you just want to see who the HECK are you talking to? but you never see, because there isn't anyone, and it is insanely frustrating. So it's like the presenters are talking to you, but they NEVER look at you. Argh. It's an exercise in patience as it just makes you want to slap the guy and say, ""HEY, I'm over HERE, LOOK at me"". The way I am expressing it, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but watch it and you'll find out. Imagine watching Katie Kuric on the evening news, but she's looking to the diagonal all the time, never at you, you'd want to slap the TV.

Another problem is the continual stop-start nature of the teachings. Every few minutes you need to hit play to keep going.

My second serious gripe is the way they have encoded the DVD. Clearly the DVD producer didn't know how to create scripts in the project because every chapter has been saved as a title. This means ripping the DVD to watch on your AppleTV or iPod, computer etc is impossible. To some this will not matter, but for me it's a big issue.

I am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it, which I just can't. I have tried several times over the last few months and it's just frustrating. Overall it's an incredibly amateurish project totally out of character for something with Zondervan's name on it. This is why it simply must have a 1 star rating.",1.0

"I discovered I had a vaginal prolapse after having issues removing a tampon (I typically wear pads, but was in a bind back in May and wore a tampon for the first time in my life). The prolapse is most likely from the birth of my daughter two years ago. I began my research on what to do for it, as I don't want to have or eventually have surgery for it (I've heard way too many horror stories). I started doing this DVD back in the very beginning of June...and instead of doing it three times a week, I ramped it up to roughly one workout every day/other day. I cycled through exercises one through four for each day I did it. I went out and bought an exercise ball (well, two - a large and a small) and additional stretch bands. I also did kegals, as suggested, throughout the day everyday (held kegal for 8 seconds with four quick flicks). It is now mid-July and my vaginal prolapse is no better and no worse than when I started the exercises. Literally no improvement whatsoever.

This isn't uncommon in special effects movies (even the most  expensive productions have their faults), but in this case the wires are so  visible and distracting (they almost look like ropes) it ruins the entire  fantasy element. I'm surprised Disney even greenlighted this project.  Pathetic.",1.0
"This is a terrible film -- low-budget seat-of-the-pants filmmaking with an exceedingly thin plot line. But in a way, it's still worthwhile viewing for  fans of the sublime Oliver Reed, who makes a wonderfully sinister villain  (Russian this time); and Michael Crawford, who is his usual endearing self.  The latter's performance in ""Condorman"" is reminiscent of his  role as Cornelius Hackel in ""Hello Dolly,"" which is to say it's  about as far away from the Phantom as you can get. Still, the film is  amusing at times. But check out ""The Assassination Bureau"" if  you're an  Oliver devotee.",1.0

"The 1947-version is the best version, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.

In this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in ""Wives and Daughters"", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version

The 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.

The book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: ""Oliver Twist"" 1839, ""A Christmas Carol"" 1843, and ""David Copperfield"" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story ""Great Expectations"" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of ""Great Expectations"" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.

Charles Dickens's book ""Oliver Twist"" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The ""Oliver Twist"" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play ""Oliver Twist""; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story ""Great Expectations"" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story.",1.0
"Firstly I have to say that this is not a Mobile Masterpiece production it is a BBC production.  The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel.

Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.

It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television.

If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market.",1.0

"As a talented actor, Toshiro Mifune portrays his roles more definitively as a Japanes Samurai or SHOGUN, not a stranded soldier on an island.

In comparison to his other films, I found Hell in the Pacific to be quite boring. I can cleary understand the dialogue between Lee Marvin and Mifune yet the film could have pumped up a notch with at least a shred of Budo action from Mifune. Its evident from their first encounter on the beach that Mifune's raw talent could have produced a dramtic fight scene but they are left standing there, fiercely gazing at one another with no climax.

Chanbara films of today are far more entertaining and not conservative like Hell in the Pacific. I recommend ""Seven Samurai"".",1.0
"I wouldn't call myself a Woody Allen fan but I thought this film was simply hilarious and most of the jokes and gags hold up well even today and if you like off-beat humour ala ""There's Something About Mary"" or even ""Saturday Night Live"" you will find a lot to like about this film.  The jokes come thick and fast and although not all of them score, the vast majority of them do making it a comedy that rewards repeated viewing.

The only problem is with the dvd which is not restored in any way and so the picture and sound quality really suffer in comparison with what's currently out there.  There are no special features of note either.  This film is certainly one of the funniest and most enjoyable that I've ever seen but my advice is to wait for the Blu-ray version that significantly restores the picture quality as well as adds good special features and has good audio options such as at a minimum a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option to do justice to your home theatre system.",1.0

So thanks a lot for throwing me back a few steps and wasting almost $15!  We then bought Elmo's Potty Time and she loves it and I think it is way better than this one was.

It is really annoying that they have messed up the episodes by putting them in the wrong order and mislabeling them.  Half the tension in the episode they list as first is confusing if you haven't watched the THREE episodes that predate it.  The occasional mislabeled episode in the previous seasons was easy to overlook, but in this case, its flat out unprofessional.

"Just a terrible movie.  Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in.  Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.  For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent ""Austin Powers"".",1.0
"Dear God!  Did this movie suck ass!  Even Sean Connery's entire coolness couldn't save it!  Unlike Highlander 2, his scenes were some of the worst!  If you can get thru the ""Teddy Bear"" scene, you are a better man than I!",1.0
"Combine the worst elements of Wild Wild West and Batman & Robin and you get this god-awful mess of a film that's as confused tonally as it is made poorly. And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.

First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way ""Toys"" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.

Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named ""Evil Peel,"" and gets to say the line, ""You just saved me from myself."" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the ""funnier"" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!

It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.",1.0
"I can't remember the last time I turned a movie off out of sheer boredom.  When my daugher is watching Elmo's Potty Time, even that show is able to hold my attention for the entire program.

Seriously - I tried to watch this movie on two different occasions and it failed to make me want to watch it thru to it's conclusion both times.  I found myself distracted by the least little thing.  Watching a bird out the window, counting how many times the ceiling fan rotated every 60 seconds,  trying to determine if this number was constant or variable, if not constant then how many rotations did it vary per minute, was there a pattern to this variation,  what's for lunch,  blt sandwich maybe?  Bacon... mmmm... bacon.....

-sorry, back to the review.

I've never seen an episode of the original TV show so I didn't have the element of familiarity to help me out - but from what I've read in other reviews similarities between the TV show and this movie are few.

Some people may say that since I haven't watched the whole movie I have no right to give it a bad review.  I say the fact that I COULD NOT watch the whole thing speaks for itself.",1.0
"Even though ten years older than myself, it is clear that director Jeremiah Chechik didn't have a clue as to what made the TV version a draw (Diana Rigg).  If you don't cast a Diana Rigg then forget doing a remake.  When Val Kilmer took on the role of ""The Saint"" it was casting agent Elisabeth Leustig and director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games) that had the right stuff to revive a British staple of 60's television.  It should have been Noyce directing ""The Avengers-1998"" as well, coupled with another incredible music score of Graeme Revell.  I've no doubt it would have been DY-NO-MITE!  But it wasn't....not even close.  Keep your fingers crossed for the 2012 version.",1.0
"I used to watch the show as teen and would catch it on A&E when it used to come on. Sure it was campy but it was fun to watch. This movie is no such luck. It was doomed from the minute the director screamed action. The whole plot involves some asinine scheme by August De Wynter(played by Sean Connery) to control the world weather. The British secret service assign Emma Peel(Uma Thurman) and John Steed(Ralph Fiennes) to the case. The story also involves plot twist where one of the head of the secret service(affectionately called ""Mother"") is in cahoots with Sir Wynter. When you're not laughing at the cheesy dialogue, you cracking up at the hackneyed fight scenes and the overacting by Sean Connery, who seems to have more fun chewing up scenery even though he advised people not to watch it. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is non-existent. The mechanical bees and the teddy bear costumes...nice. This movie wasn't pre-screened for a reason and Sean Connery did warn people not to see this movie. You can put two and two together and see the outcome. People overact like its going out of style, the humor is on par with those Roger Moore James Bond flicks and the premise is pretty juvenile. If you liked the show you'll hate the movie.",1.0
"How can you improve on perfection?  The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever.  It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories.  It was a wonderful world unto itself.

By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story.  But it fails utterly.

This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book.  Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry, in spite of their great talent, but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable.  I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen.  That answers the question:  you shouldn't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.

Not recommended.  THere are far better things to waste one's time on.",1.0
"As someone who was an insatiable fan of The Avengers British TV series, I was horrified when this movie appeared in 1998.  I have always felt that one cannot improve upon perfection, and, at least as far as I was concerned, the original Avengers was about as close to that as anything can be, and still be man-made.  Because of this, I vowed NOT TO SEE IT!

All right...granted, this movie has a marvelous cast, and even boasted a cameo role for Patrick Macnee (the first -- no, make that the REAL John Steed), but this was just another case where a great cast does not necessarily a good movie make.

Well, I kept my vow for all these years, but finally broke down and recently watched The Avengers, the movie.

OUCH!

Even Sean Connery couldn't pull this one out of the dumpster!  It was painful.  I was only able to suffer through half of it before I had to eject the disk in self defense!  To cleanse myself, I watched three straight hours of the REAL Avengers immediately.

If you are tempted to watch this travesty because you fancy one of the stars...DON'T.  Go and purchase another of their films instead, or, better yet, go and find the original Avengers and have at it!  You'll be delighted, entertained, and you'll see it done the way it was INTENDED.

This was just...sad...",1.0
"Sean Connery is an evil scientist that wants to blackmail the major countries with his evil device that can wreak havoc in the world. The Avengers must find him and stop him. Even the great Connery couldn't save this dog from the DVD discount bins in Walmart, although his performance brings the only class to this sham.

Ralph Fiennes is an outstanding actor in many other things. In this one he just missed that brilliant sparkle that the British own, and he doesn't get it. While he was brilliant in movies such as Schindler's List, this is another one of his hit and misses. I'm not very familiar with Uma Thurman, I know a lot of people drool over her, and it's obvious why. However, she also didn't have that chic magic that the original Mrs. Peel possessed.

The plot and scenery remind me of a well-made computer animation game--today's audience accepts this sort of 'near realism' but I could do without it, I would have enjoyed more thought provoking plot lines.

I wouldn't own this one but it's worth a watch on one of the premium movie channels if you're bored. I'm only hoping that another sequel isn't made, this was enough of a waste of money and film.",1.0

The only thing worse than watching this movie is the fact I originally confused it with something else and didn't realize I'd seen part of it on Cable before and then ended up trying to watch it again to see if it realliy was that bad.. and indeed it was.

"I like bad movies sometimes, especially ones with big budgets. But all the other reviews were right, this is a bad movie! I am not a fan of, or seen many of the original ""Avengers"", so I had no preconceived ideas that way about how the story should go. And had really wanted to ""enjoy"" a big budget, bad movie. It doesn't start out to bad, but I found the lack of chemistry between all the actors to be unbearable. It's like they are all acting in separate movies, or have some sort of off screen feud going on, and refuse to talk to each other. But in the appalling delivery of lines, apparently written by someone with a severe lack of imagination and no sence of humor.

 Also, if you had seen only this movie with Sean Connery, you would wonder just why he was an actor. The bear suit was not his finest hour...although pretty funny.

 And I also have to wonder just why when casting this, the ""supporting"" role of henchman (with no lines) was given to a stand up comedian, Eddie Izzard. Known for being a non-stop talker. But of course for the one and only cuss word for the whole movie...and I swear that it's not Eddie Izzard's voice in the first place, just a dubded in word.

 So finely, this movie does get a star because the location shots are not bad. And you have to enjoy the only opportunity to see a deeply respected actor(Connery), make a fool of himself in a gigiant bear suit. Other than that, if you really must find out how bad this is...rent it!",1.0
"Even though we approached this movie with the attitude that it had the same title and characters as a series that we enjoyed, but that it would most likely be different from the series, we were seriously disappointed. The movie stinks. 'Steed' is not comfortable with his umbrella or his bowler hat, and 'Mrs. Peel' is channelling 'poison ivy' from the Batman film. The plot is threadbare, the acting is woeful. Even Sean Connery fails to save this movie.

Rent it if you have to watch it, it's not worth buying. Better yet, buy one of the box sets of the original series. Even on her worst days, Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel is far sexier and wittier than Uma Thurman's attempt, and Patrick Macnee's wit and dry humour has to be seen to be believed.",1.0
"This movie must have been done by ""The Producers.""  Every thing possible to make it unrealistic seems to have been done.

Steed and Emma seem to be culturally lower class people who have come into inheritances which they use to buy expensive clothes.  The actress that plays Emma would be more realistically cast as a prostitute.

The characters substitute arrogance for talent.

My favorite bad scene is where Emma is walking away from Steed and unable to see him.  She has her sword over her shoulder point to her back.  Steed hits her sword on opposite sides with his sword.  This is something the Three Stooges would do.  The real Steed would have whacked Emma's bottom with his sword.",1.0
"At last I got to see this film.  I wish I did not!  This is nothing short of kidnapping the characters of Mrs. Emma Peel and John Steed by a squad of Hollywood SCAVENGERS!  I could understand pairing Steed with a new female partner played by Thurman.  Thurman fails miserably (and embarrasingly) at capturing the essence of a cultural icon of the caliber of Mrs Peel.  I found myself so embarrased watching Thurman stumbling her way in her unconvincing attempt to embody the character of Mrs Peel.  Way to go Uma :-D  The other problem is:  Fiennes is NO Steed.  Gone is the wit and charm, the playful sexuality, and the magical chemistry!  Thumbs down!  Hopefully we'll have something better next time! Meanwhile, hold on to your Mrs Peel Megaset DVD set :-)  Of course, one would say that we, the hard core fans of the TV show, should lighten up.  Issue is that I expect a multimillion project in the form of a film production to open up new vistas, and to throw new light on that landscape we know very well from the TV show.  Thurman, Fiennes, and the script writer of the film were not expected to copy and imitate.  But at least to give us the viewing pleasure of what we came to expect in that experience of watching the TV show.  Instead, we got an infantile love affair, childish sexual gazes that lacked the vagueness and playful complexity of Riggs' Emma and Macnee's Steed, silly lines, and gestures that lacked vitality, and so on and so forth (by comparison, we all know the endings, for example, of 'Too Many Xmas Trees,' 'The Negative Positive Man,' and 'The house that Jack Built,' to name only a few).  What I expected is a Thurman that could have enriched the character of Emma.  What we got is an Emma melting to a kiss on one occasion, and an Emma who is so mistrustful of Steed because he dared look at her asleep!",1.0
"Let me just say that I love all the Avengers from Mrs. Gale to Tara King (for the most part) and I do love the actors of The Avengers movie but this movie stinks. It has nothing to do with the original show. First off Mrs. Peel never dealt with Mother. Mrs. Peel also did not have an on screen affair with Steed either. But Hollywood got it's paws on the story and ruined it. If your a fan of the show then you will hate this movie. I even tried to watch it a second time and just turned it off. This after Wal Mart had it for $5.00 on a discount rack. I should have been free.

Nothing in this movie blends with the real show. Nothing! I only wish that the real Avengers fans had a say with the script before they drove the image in the ground. I bet the script writer never really watched the show in the first place.

Stick with the original Avengers of the 60's. It can never be replicated. At least not in this movie.",1.0
"Being a big fan of Uma Thurman, I picked this up the other day on DVD (much to the dismay of my friends) for only $1 at a local pawn shop. I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......

On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.

In its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.

The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.

After the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.

A perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.

There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.

I read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.

The acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.

The film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.

Special effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).

I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.

(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)

"Let's face it...this movie is terrible, whether or not you compare it to the brilliant sixties series.  I went in with an open mind, knowing that Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg will always be John Steed and Emma Peel.  I thought the addition of Sean Connery as the villain would be a delight.  WRONG.  The tv shows' wonderful theme by Laurie Johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes, but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness.  Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed. And Sean, what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better.  I did like the mechanical bees sequence; the only true original touch in the movie.  The teddy bears was preposterous and almost worked, but since the whole movie was such a drag, I'm not sure anything could save it.  Macnee was smart in his invisible cameo role.  Too bad Uma didn't back out and get replaced by a more lively Mrs. Peel.",1.0
"To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.

When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.

To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.

The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.

So that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.

The casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.

There are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.",1.0

"This movie is easily on my top-5 list of the worst films I have ever seen.  The painful truth of the matter is that I saw this in the theater.  What a horrible memory that is!  I am a 33-year-old male, and in my entire life I have never wanted to leave the movie-house as badly as I wanted to while watching this pile of rubbish.  I have never walked out on any movie, much to my dismay.  I should have left during this one.  In fact, I remember at least 4 people leaving the theater, never to return.  One scene, in particular, haunts me to this very day.  There is a complex conspiracy afoot, and the villains all meet one last time before the crime will unfold.  They decide to wear disguises to conceal their identities.  They are all dressed in giant, multi-colored Teddy Bear costumes!!!  What?  Yes, you read it correctly.  It is so incredibly stupid that I have a hard time retelling it without my lower intestine reaching up and strangling my brain.

"I loved the original Avengers series. It was a near flawless program; at least until Diana Rigg left.  This film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show. The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored.
This is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film. The television Avengers' unique character is nowhere to be found in this disaster.",1.0
"I got caught up in the nostalgia and hype when this movie was first released. I'm one of the few people who actually saw it in the theaters. The line that best describes this movie came from another reviewer (can't remember who):
""Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before, it makes you think they've never even SEEN a movie before.""
That about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in. It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it's taking place in modern times. The generic 60's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they've been on ice for a few decades.
Sean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role. He's blustery and over the top, but it's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing. Connery's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes (excellent in Strange Days). Uma Thurman shows that she can't hold a candle to Diana Rigg. She ends up in the leather catsuit but doesn't have much to do once she's in it.
There are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series, but with no real effect. The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing.
The final mano-a-mano battle royal at then end is  pretty forgettable.",1.0
"What a mess.  I was so disappointed by this film (especially since I invited a group of friends out to see it).  There's got to be a story behind how this movie self-destructed.
And it's too bad, because, when it came out, THE AVENGERS could've out-sluethed both Austin Powers and James Bond.  It could have had the bizarre Avengers flair with the 007 intrigue and thrills.
Personally, I thought Uma Thurman was a mistake as Mrs. Peel, only because the built-in audience (those familiar with the popular British TV show) would've expected an English girl.
Ralph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian.
But the movie is incomprehensible.
I'd read that the director was relatively new, having directed only a couple of small, independent films.  Was he overwhelmed by the massive production or did the studio take it away from him to cut it to pieces?  What makes me wonder if it was the former is that Sean Connery's first scenes have him talking with weird, exaggerated tics and such--and then they're gone.  Connery just walks through the rest of the film.  I've always heard that Connery did not suffer fools on a movie set: did he turn on his young director?
I've read the script (which is available online) and I'm still wondering just what in the world happened to this film.

"I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud.
I am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this ""film"" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time.
What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).
The film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.
Do yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series. Then rent the DVD of this film -- you'll quickly see that newer, in this case, is definitely not better.",1.0
One of the worst movies ever made. Watching Sean Connery in a bear suit while running around was ugly. The pair (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) have no chemistry what so ever and talk like their English. Horrible. He fights people with an umbrella and she can't fight at all.

I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?
This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.
This movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.

"I tried not to set my hopes too high but this was ABSOLUTELY awful, and embarrassing to boot. Thurman is a fine Peel and Fienes is quite OK (although there's  not much found in the way of the strange ambivalence (like? love? mere professionalism?) in the relation between Steed and Mrs. Peel from the series), but Connery does this one straight from the teleprompter. No credibility, no presence, no strength.  Arguably his worst performance to date.
The retro-look is too glib, and a sense of humour sorely lacking. The film tries VERY hard to be surrealistic (with the Baddies dressing up as teddybears and not-quite-but-almost Bond-like gadgets) but everything the desperate producers throw at us is hollow (You can almost hear them pleading with the audience: ""Now THIS is really funny and weird? Isn't it? Isn't it?"").
A pathetic excuse for a film, even when not compared to the original Avengers. Give this one a miss. It's REALLY not worth your time.

The special effects are mediocre. The film even drags down two excellent performers (Sean Connery, Uma Thurmann)who are given so little latitude that they can do nothing to salvage the situation. Overall, the impression is of a very second rate James Bond type movie, with cliches galore.

I also remember the intermission, where I was torn between going to McDonald's before they closed and staying to see if the second half was any better.

Update: In retrospect, I realize this review is utterly useless to anyone who hasn't seen the movie.  It's been a long time since I saw this movie and I've blocked most of it out, but from what little I do remember, it was more of a fashion show than a story.

The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike.

"Wow.  I thought I was in for a treat when I saw the previews for ""The Avengers.""  At least the previews were entertaining.  The beginning of  the movie started out pretty good, but it was downhill from there.
Can we  say, ""movie turns into a fashion show?""  For crying out loud,  every single time Uma left a scene and came back, she had on a new hot  little number for an outfit.  If I wanted to see a fashion show, I would  have stayed home and turned on my cable.
I absolutely love Ralph  Fiennes and Sean Connery.  Most of what they have done I have found  wonderful.  I was sorely disappointed by Sean Connery's role in this movie.  His lines were stilted, he seemed extremely uncomfortable in what he was  doing, and I started to feel sorry for him midway through the movie.  Was  this supposed to happen?  I don't know.
I do understand that this movie  was supposed to represent the quirkiness of the original TV show, but I  didn't buy it.  Perhaps it was starting to grate on my nerves every time  Uma showed up in a different tight-fitting outfit.
The special effects  were about the only redeeming quality in the entire movie.  The bubbles  they walked in, those big mechanical bees, and the high-flying act at the  end were all pretty dang cool.  I just wanted more out of the characters.  I wanted more out of the plot.  I wanted more out of Sean Connery's  villain.  I wanted more out of the relationship between Uma and Ralph.  Perhaps I wanted too much, but when coming right down to the nitty gritty,  that's usually what the criteria is for making what most people consider a  ""good"" movie.",1.0

I've always liked Shout! Factory; I've considered them the Rhino for the new millennium in terms of putting out product that really delivers for fans. But this is just unacceptable. Another reviewer mentioned that he'd spoken to Shout about it and that they plan to release seasons 5 and 6 individually. But a) it may not happen, and 2) it's still not cool making us wait. How on earth do you justify a release like this? Where's the logic? Did NO ONE at Shout look at the countless reviews (and IMDB message boards, for that matter) decrying the absence of the last two seasons? I don't have the market research numbers, of course, but I imagine that a significant percentage of potential buyers for this were in my situation. The ratings and reviews here certainly bear it out. I very much want the last two seasons of ""The Bob Newhart Show,"" but I'm not about to pay this much to get four seasons I already own and, more importantly, support this misstep. Shout and other studios, take notice: if we don't refuse to buy it, how will you learn?",1.0
"Hoping the re-make would get the spirit of the old series I bought this DVD ... and would like to warn everybody to repeat that mistake.

"A Movie that just tries to hard to be clever & succeeds only in making the film worse and driving the viewer closer & closer to despair. Plot - Well not Much can be said for it since it really was awful, Did you care  what happened? Did anyone come across well? No!  The shame was that the  potential was there but unforunately this mix of a typical Hollywood Plot  & the sureallism that was attempted failed dismally. It's a pity though  , I felt that Thurman & Fiennes made a good Steed & Mrs Peel, pity  they had nothing to work with.",1.0
"If you have to read a novelization to fill in the plot holes, it isn't worth doing.
No matter who is to blame for this travesty, be it editor, director, screenwriters, the terribly lethargic performances from Thurman  and Fiennes (I personally would lay the blame at the feet of the lot of  them), it isn't worth the time or money.
I'm not even much of a fan of  the original, having only watched an episode or two if that, but this- this  is a pathetic film.
There is zero chemistry between the two stars, Sean  Connery hams it up (and with dialogue like his, can you blame him?) and the  plot, as has previously been stated, well.. saying it ""has holes""  is an understatement of the first order.
An amateurish effort all around.  Who would have throught that a film with Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and  Sean Connery would be so... boring?  I wouldn't even give it one star, but  I'm being told that that isn't an option.",1.0
"This film is a real treat for the eyes, especially on a properly calibrated monitor.  It is also a very satisfying audio experience in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Unfortunately, the script does not even come close to the  quality of the video transfer or the soundtrack.  The first 20-30 minutes  of the film are an amusing reminder of the charm of the old TV series, but  things fall apart quickly after that.  The perils introduced by the  antagonist, Sean Connery, are unbelievable in the extreme.  No amount of  surreal interpretation can convince the viewer that they are anything but  ridiculous.  The gross incompetence of many characters is evident as both  good and evil fail repeatedly to accomplish even the simplest of tasks to  which they set themselves.  Even if one is able to get past the silly  devices and look only at the story, the narrative is mundane and  predictable.  If it were not for the fabulous transfer to DVD and the  delicious Ms. Thurman, I don't believe I could have gotten any farther than  one-third of the way through this mess.  As it was, I only got to the  (anti) climactic end battle because I couldn't find my remote.",1.0
"as most reviewers i have had seasons 1-4 since they came out.  so far i have only watched season 5.  the picture/audio quality are definitely worse than that of those earlier releases.  i can try to ignore that, but in the end that's impossible, since the audio is horribly out of sync.  gosh darn it!!  bad job, shout.  certainly, if you have to have seasons 5 and 6, wait till they come out individually.  my impatience got me, in the end.",1.0

"I've read the various comments to the effect that the complete series is a good value at $80, and that SHOUT FACTORY should not be held accountable for  the actions of FOX.

1. SHOUT FACTORY was more than well aware of the history of the series release. Why did they choose to release the entire series rather than seasons 5 and 6? Would they have us believe they felt the majority of individuals inclined to purchase the Bob Newhart sat out the first 4 seasons in the hope that SHOUT FACTORY would come along and release the entire series at a great price? They new quite well that fans already owned the first 4 seasons, and bet that they would pay a hefty price to get the remaining two. Their offer to release seasons 5 and 6 now, after numerous complaints, is a bit lame.

2.$80 is a great price for the series if you don't already own the individual seasons, but where is this market? Most fans who are inclined to by DVD'S of the series at all, have already bought one or more seasons. Individuals who are not familiar with the show and would like to ""try it out"", may buy one or two seasons to see if they like it. I doubt they would spring for the entire series.

3. Fans are being unfairly faulted for ""jumping the gun"" , and purchasing the first 4 seasons as they were offered. We believed that the studio would act in good faith , and , in time, release all 6 seasons. They didn't. Had we not purchased the seasons when they were initially offered, further releases would have been concelled in any event.",1.0

Where there should be lightning quick  exchanges there are holes in the repartee you can drive a Mack Truck  through.
Uma Thurman was a poor choice to play Emma Peel.  Her English  accent sounds awkward and contrived.  Often she accents the wrong word  within a phrase giving the impression that 1) she doesn't understand the  meaning of the lines she's delivering 2) she's reading her lines from cue  cards.

While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!

As for this particular one:

Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!

Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone.
How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated.
Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!
..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!
_________

If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).
If time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).  There are a couple of deleted scenes that add more background to the story, so you may want to check them out.",1.0

I hated this version.  I usually enjoy Samantha Morton's work, but she declined to act in this film...and Ciaran Hinds chewed the scenery so much, I'm surprised that there were walls left standing at Thornfield...even after the fire!

There is very little character development in this script and I found myself not caring about Jane or Rochester, which is a problem when presenting ""Jane Eyre.""

Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face.",1.0

The acting was mediocre,not one of the best. Even the latest version that came out this year,that I thought was 'ok', was 100 times better than this one.  I don't know why this actor Ciaran Hinds was picked to play Rochester. I spent the entire movie wondering what Jane saw in him. He was neither attractive nor charming in any way or likeable. I can't find anything good to say about his portrayal or this version. I was not able to sympathize with him at all. I thought either Orson Wells or William Hurt were the worst as Rochester but I could not be more wrong. I can not think of a worse actor to play Rochester than this man. I didn't care much for this actress as Jane either or Adele. I think the dog Pilot was the best actor in this movie. I would not want this version even for free.",1.0
"She's the only good aspect of this rendition. Considering that there are so many other versions of this amazing story to enjoy DO NOT waste your time on this one. I'm not the type to lean on the melodramatic, I really am serious about how poopy I thought this version is.",1.0
"What makes Jane Eyre a timeless novel is it's brilliantly colorful and evocative narrative. Charlotte Bronte's true talent is in her wording and her vivid and unique characters. This movie falls desperately short on these most important fronts. The narrative to this adaptation is poor indeed and lacks any of the fiery spark of the novel. Rather than choosing to re-work the first section of the story touching on Jane's childhood, a voice-over jumps from moment to moment so that we have only brief flashes of her early life, making for a stilted and bumbling beginning. The filmography is desperately lacking, and by inserting ""imaginary"" voices and images into Jane's perception, appears to imply a psychotic rather than imaginative narrator. Samantha Morton, whose work is usually delightful and full of life, is the image of Jane without any of the spirit. Ciaran Hinds, though he has some of Mr. Rochester's manner, is lacking in the overall demeanor. Gemma Jones makes for an unnecessarily snappish Mrs. Fairfax and Timia Berthone's acting is self-conscious to the point of embarrassment.

I am deeply disappointed in A&E whose work can usually be depending upon. Overall, this was a waste of the $2.00 spent on rental fees.",1.0
"I won't write a diatribe about what I hated with this version, so I'll sum it up in as few points as possible:

-Samantha Morton too cute and young - she looked like she was 12
-Ciaran Hinds: too old and creepy for the part, came across as a raging, shouting bull during the whole movie. Rochester was an angry man but he wasn't THAT angry all the time.
-No chemistry whatsoever between the two characters. Samantha Morton looked mortified to have to kiss Ciaran Hinds in the kissing scenes. Frankly, I'd be mortified too.

Avoid this version as well as the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg versions- don't let your curiosity to see another version of Jane Eyre get the best of you. They're both awful. See the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson versions instead.",1.0
"This series reminds me of a very poorly written 3rd grade play! Props ie:walls shudder when doors are shut,, you can see the shadow of the boom above the ""actors"" etc. It was bad enough to try and get through this poorly written plot - you also have to put up with a lot of the scenes in episode one in black and white. Whoever said that ""if you love Downton Abby, you'll love this"" was sadly mistaken! Characters come and go from scene to scene and their absence is noted in passing conversation. All actors ""overact"" except for maybe ""Sarah"" and Rose.
Definitely not worth the price, had I known I would not have purchased it.",1.0
"I hated this version of Jane Eyre - it's just wrong in so many ways.  First, while I would agree that most of the actors are well cast, and Samantha Morton is a very apt Jane Eyre, I was incredibly disappointed in Ciaran Hinds.  He is horribly, horribly miscast and, as a result, I have no idea what Jane finds to love in his angry, ranting, flat, and one-dimensional characterization of Rochester.  There's no brooding sadness, no playful charm; he's just abusive and selfish and mean the whole film.

Also, the adaptation is severely lacking in purpose and sacrifices the important themes and relationships that Bronte crafted so well in an attempt to cater to our short attention spans and our desire for cookie cutter romance.  Moments are changed or left out completely, for no apparent reason, creating situations that make no sense (i.e. why does she go home to see Mrs. Reed before she dies? We never find out.) Some scenes are just creepy - like when Mr. Rochester is lustfully stroking her hand after she puts out the fire in his room - very disturbing.  And the dialog has been changed and modernized making the whole thing seem like a bad soap opera.  Please don't insult my intelligence!!!

But the worst aspect of this version is that Jane is not allowed to grow and change and become the independent woman that she needs to be before she can be equal to Rochester and come back to him on her own terms - which is the whole point of the book!  I was actually offended by the ending of the film and felt that throughout Jane is dumbed down and made into a weak, lovesick girl.

The 2006 Masterpiece Theater version is without a doubt the best, followed closely by the Timothy Dalton version.  STAY FAR AWAY from this one.",1.0
"This 1997 TV production is called ""Jane Eyre"", but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront's literary masterpiece. How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciarn Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane's character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciarn Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester's character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciarn Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.

Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Adle, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.

As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter's own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: ""I know it may sound silly but...."" No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront'! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.

This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.

Equally lamentable is the filmmakers' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot. Sentences like ""I feel that your passions are aroused"" are appropriate for ""Sex in the City"", but not for a costume drama, let alone Jane Eyre. Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel, nor about portraying the novel's era accurately. The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006.",1.0
"I didn't care for this version at all. I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.

Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet. It moves right along, and yet it keeps all the story essentials.",1.0
"This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite...
Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.

 The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.
 Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.

If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime!

However if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining...",1.0
"This version was awfully butchered.  It felt like I was fast-forwarding through the entire novel.  The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it.  The script lost a lot of the novel's ""punch"" and intensity.  This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin.  I couldn't sit through it again.

My favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.

I also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one.  Beautiful, haunting film score.",1.0
"This line just about sums up the absurdity of this A&E adaptation of our beloved Jane Eyre, which hardly bears any resemblance to the novel. Wouldn't Charlotte Bronte be appalled!

It all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane's experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.

But then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter's rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn't seem to relish the fact that she's supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.

Don't look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.

Morton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.

In the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane's originality. It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!

There are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to ""The governess,""while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!

The second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness. In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester's brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman's cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can't get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.

In the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who's marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:

""So you didn't find anyone else to marry you?"" sneers Rochester.

""I found someone who wanted to marry me."" again, the self-satisfied smile.

Good lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those.",1.0
"The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre.  I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst.  Ciarn Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man.  There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.'  I threw away this DVD after watching it.  A waste of $$$.  Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'",1.0
"Ever since I first read Jane Eyre years ago, it has been one of my favorite books, with its complex characters and wonderful writing.  Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie, however, was either completely unfamiliar with the book or thought they could do a better job than Charlotte Bronte.  Virtually none of the dialogue is from the book, and when they do keep something (like Rochester's wonderful line about the string connecting him to Jane), it's butchered.  If I weren't already familiar with the plot (or, rather, with how the plot should be), I would've been very confused by the choppiness of this movie, especially towards the end.  For example, Jane hears Rochester calling her name, the next minute she's in a carriage, and the next minute she's at Thornfield.  Wow, that was fast!

Jane's stay with St. John (who is much too nice in his proposal to her) and Diana is reduced to about five minutes, and her aunt's death is completely skipped over.  No mention at all is made of Jane's inheritance from her uncle, or of her family connections to the Rivers family.  Oh, and when Jane and Rochester go shopping in town, they run into Blanche Ingram, for some inexplicable reason.  Of course no movie can keep everything from the book, but this one simply butchered the plot.

And it butchered the characters as well.  Rochester is not supposed to continually bellow and snarl at Jane in the way Ciaran Hinds does in this movie.  (He was such a good Wentworth in Persuasion, I think the fault must lie with the director and script -- very disappointing.)  Nor is Rochester supposed to be a lust-crazed maniac who yells at Jane when she's leaving him, ""You want me!  I can feel your passions are aroused!  Say you want me!  SAY IT!""  He literally bellows at Jane all through this scene -- like when he shouts, ""Didn't I just know you'd desert me!  Really, Jane, you are SO PREDICTABLE!  Couldn't you be just a little more original?!...You're just a child who has NO IDEA WHAT REAL LOVE IS!""  And I use the capital letters because that's how the lines were spoken -- or rather, screamed.  It was impossible to see why any woman in her right mind would fall in love with this Rochester!  This aspect of the film, along with the awful script, made it difficult for me to finish watching the movie.

As for Samantha Morton, she was generally all right, but she overplays the spirited, independent part of Jane's character to the point of being downright rude to Rochester from time to time.  Still, at least her performance was less painful to watch than Ciaran Hinds'.  To summarize, the script and plot bore virtually no resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's original, and Ciaran Hinds' Rochester was a snarling bully, making this movie almost laughably bad.

If you want a good adapatation of Jane Eyre, watch the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  Yes, Dalton is too handsome to be a good Rochester physically, but more important than that is his performance, which shows the many facets of Rochester's personality -- not just non-stop anger.  The plot is kept intact (including the famous gypsy scene, which is omitted from this movie), and almost all of the dialogue is straight from the book.  I'll have to re-read the book and re-watch that adaptation of it to purge this movie from my memory!",1.0
"I am so disappointed that they made my timeless book into this crappy movie.  If I knew they would make this bad of a movie out of my book, I would not have written it!  This was the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre EVER!!!!!  There was NO chemistry between Jane and Mr. Edwards.  It was painful to watch them kiss, I'm not kidding!  The only good actress in the whole movie was Gemma Jones who plays Mrs. Fairfax and is from Sense and Sensibility.  It is definetly a made for TV movie, and should have never been made into a DVD...if you prefer watching made for TV movies then you'll like it.  I recommend either the 1996 version or the 1944 version with Elizabeth Taylor as Helen.  This version misses all the important parts, quickly runs through her childhood, and skips her Aunt's death.  There is no emotion in this movie and it has no suspense at all.  Trust me, don't rent or watch it!!  I hope this was helpful.",1.0
"I really disliked this version of Jane Eyre, so much so that I found myself skipping parts and pulling the movie out before finishing it. I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.

First off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.

Overall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.",1.0
"This version of Jane Eyre is absolutely disappointing.  It is not faithful to the novel and the acting is horrible.  There is no chemistry between Samantha Morton and Ciran Hinds and the emotions they supposedly ""tried"" to embody are so watered down that it is just embarrassing.

"If you've seen the 1983 version on VHS with Timothy Dalton as Rochester (or read the book), you will be very disappointed with this version.  Several crucial parts of the story are left out completely, such as Jane learning that she has been left a sizeable inheritance. Also, Rochester is overacted, and the growth of the relationship between he and Jane is unconvincing.  I bought this because it was on DVD, and wish I hadn't.  I'll wait for the 1983 version to be put on DVD.",1.0
"After watching three episodes we sent it back for a refund.  The quaiity of sound was not good, the scripts were boring, and the actors had very little apeal this is comparing it with Downton Abby.  I would not reccomend it to anyone.  It had thhe flavor of people acting in a school play.",1.0
"The screenwriting for this particular adaptation took extreme liberties, not with the events (which is to be expected) but the characterization of both Jane and Mr. Rochester. I assume the liberties were taken in order to make the characters more palatable to modern tastes and philosophies. A pity the writer could not trust the original material to convey the story.",1.0
"When I found out that A&E had come out with a movie version of my favorite book I was overjoyed. I enjoyed their versions of Pride and Prejudice and Emma. I was very dissapointed in their production of Jane Eyre. Key scenes were either altered, removed, or just poorly done. The entire gypsy scene was gone. How this major scene could possibly been taken out with thoughts that it would not be missed is beyond me.
This was a wonderful book but a bad movie when the two are compared. If you have not read the book then maybe you won't care about the ""alterations"", but I promise you that this is one of the greatest books ever written and will not be dissapointed by investing the extra time and effort of actually picking up a copy and reading it.",1.0
"This adaptation of the marvelous novel ""Jane Eyre"" was an absolute punishment to watch. Such artistic liberties were taken with the characters in this film as to render them virtually unrecognizable. I can't recall any of the dialogue that was actually true to the book, and this was very disappointing as the strength of the story lies in the voices of the characters. I have no doubt that Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds would have done a marvelous job in their roles, were it not for the horrid writing and equally horrid direction. Mr. Rochester is so continually flying into a rage over something or other, that one wonders how Jane ever could have tolerated his company. And Jane speaks her mind in a much more opinionated and argumentative way then Charlotte Bronte ever allowed her to in the book. I also wonder why some of the most important scenes were completely ignored. Basically all of Jane's childhood is passed over in about 5 minutes, and thus the foundation of Jane's character cannot be truly understood. Also, the deathbed scene of Aunt Reed, and all the particulars of that family were passed over. And the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy, one of the most revealing and pivotal scenes in the story, was completely excluded. I would not recommend this film to anyone who has never read the book, as it simply does not do it justice. I also would not recommend it to any true lovers of this tale, as it is more likely to frustrate than to entertain.",1.0
"I am a Jane Eyre fanatic, so it is with experience that I can say. . . this movie is not worth the time. I own the BBC and 1997 verse and those are the only two I could ever recommend(the BBC verse is the best). There is NOTHING about Mr Rochester's character that is appealing. In fact, they make him far to angry and unpleasent than he should be. The book portrays a broken man. For that reason, women are drawn to him. Not even in the most climaxtic scene am I convinced that he is truely in need of love. The whole movie felt cold and unfeeling!",1.0
"why the screenwriter decided to ditch all the most famous dialogue and many of the most pivotal scenes in this extremely pedestrian ""Jane Eyre"". All lost are the Aunt's deathbed confession to Jane, the buddha-like teachings of Helen in the hellish Lowood school, the gypsy fortune telling scene that infuriates Blanche Ingram, and even the chestnut tree cleft in half as a manifestation of God's displeasure! No sign either of ""He saw that the boy had inherited his own eyes as they once were: large, brilliant, and black""--that's one of the most famous lines in English literature, for crying out loud!!
I was more disappointed than I can say to see that Ciaran Hinds, so wonderful in ""Persuasion"", was so terrible in this. And Samantha Morton as Jane was even worse. There wasn't a hint that she had lived through the childhood Jane Eyre had to become the governess Rochester encounters in the mist.

"Rochester has been one of my all time favorite heroes. Jane Eyre one of my all time favorite books and heroines. I read it almost yearly.
I am a fan of Ciaran Hinds (believe it or not). After seeing him in Ivanhoe, where he brought such a wonderful wounded, smokey edge to Gilbert, I remarked to a friend of mine, ""wouldn't he just be the penultimate Rochester?"" I was thrilled to find out shortly thereafter that this was going to be the case. Wow!!! I couldn't wait to see it.
And then I did.
What were the director and the scriptwriters thinking? After such a subtle moving proformance in Ivanhoe, Mr Hinds turns Rochester into a strutting, bellowing, obnoxious bully. Eu[...] Our Jane would NOT want this jerk. I was embarressed for him! Not to mention disappointed and sad for such a missed opportunity with this production.
The actress who played Jane did it passably well but still no great shakes.
And *where* did the writers get this dialogue? Did they have any clue what the book was about, or did they do the Cliff Notes and then write the screenplay, 'spicing' things up a little, just because? ....
If you haven't seen any productions of JE, spare yourself this one. Instead look for the one with Timothy Dalton, or with George C. Scott.",1.0
"Jane Eyre is one of my all-time favorite stories, so I have leapt at the chance to see every  version ever filmed.
I was particularly anxious to see this one, produced by A&E, because, in my mind, they have a  deserved reputation for accuracy and for quality productions.  I have to  say, though, that this version was a terrible disappointment, not only  because of the time-constrained abridgement of the text, but because of the  portrayals of the lead characters.  In particular, the actor playing Mr.  Rochester portrayed him as a TOO angry, sneering, ranting, bellicose,  offensive man.  (I don't know whether I should blame the actor or the  director).  It was just asking too much of the viewer to believe that Jane  could find any redeeming qualities in him at all, let alone fall hopelessly  in love with him!
The most accurate and well-acted version of this  wonderful book, in my opinion, is the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version.  (It AMAZED me that someone actually found fault with this production  because that viewer thought that they took TOO MUCH script, verbatim, from  the book)! One of the most positive attributes of the Dalton/Clarke version  is that they remained true to Miss Bronte's ""script,"" and the  performances, right down through the supporting cast, were absolutely  superb!  It is the ONLY version which I've purchased for my collection; I  have also purchased three other copies to give as gifts to friends for  their viewing pleasure, and they agree that Dalton and Clarke ARE Rochester  and Jane!",1.0

Scott  version, done in the early 1970's for Hallmark Hall of Fame. Wonderful in  every way!! Unfortunately, not available yet on video. AVOID this version  from A&E, it is truly terrible.

"We love this TV series, and my wife was very excited when I gave her this complete set of the entire series for Christmas. Two episodes and untold bouts of frustration later, we are ready to return it and get our money back, all because of the idiotic default programming that I assume was created by Acorn. From the main menu, if you click ""Play,"" you find that the default setting to play the video is with English subtitles. The audio is already in English, so these subtitles would be useful only for the hearing-impaired. Why would a setting for the hearing-impaired be the default in the first place?

So you just go to the setup menu and change the setting to ""no subtitles,"" right? Wrong! It's almost impossible. There seems to be no way to return to the main menu unless you turn the DVD player completely off, remove the DVD, turn the machine back on, re-insert the DVD, and then hit play -- and even that doesn't always work. At one point I completely removed the DVD and turned off the equipment; yet when I restarted it, the DVD resumed playing again where it left off; subtitles and all.

I finally did get the subtitles turned off for Episode One after over 30 minutes of effort (and I am very equipment-savvy). But on playing the second disc we discovered the same problem: ""subtitles on"" is the default. For the third disc, I turned the subtitles off from the main menu before hitting ""Play,"" but it didn't take -- the disc still reverted to ""subtitles on."" After finally getting the subtitles turned off for that disc (and I still am not sure why it finally worked); I decided to take the time to go through all the discs and change the setting to ""subtitles off"" so we wouldn't have to worry about it again -- but before wasting any more time, I figured I'd better check the first disc again, just to make sure the setting was still ""subtitles off."" Incredibly, it had reverted to the default of ""subtitles on"" -- so, even if you do turn off subtitles, you have to do it again every single time you play the disc!!

My wife really loves the series and has decided to keep them and just endure the subtitles. But I will never watch them, and I will NEVER buy another DVD produced by Acorn!",1.0

Because the package was opened, I received only 50% of the purchase price.  How could I find out about the quality of the film unless I opened the package.  It should have been noted that this dated, poor quality DVD collection was not up to being viewed on a high definition television.  In addition, the sound quality was below par.",1.0
"Before I begin my review of the product, I would like to share something I think UpDown fans will chuckle at:

The other day I was watching an UpDown episode in which Miss Elizabeth joins the suffragettes and Rose is sent to Holloway prison. In one scene, one of the other jailed suffragettes attacks Rose, who falls against the wall.  I noticed how the wall moved (quite a bit); it looked to be made out of cardboard!

The 25 year Anniversary Special is very well done and very interesting.

Now for the review:

I would assume that some reading this have the series on VHS and want to upgrade to DVD.  My advice is: DON'T.  These DVDs were not remastered at all; I don't care what the description says.  The DVD set is no better than the VHS. The beginning intro (the music and cartoons from Punch magazine) is cut off in several episodes. There are numerous episodes where the tape (thus the DVD) jumped and the picture is momentarily distorted.  Images are fuzzy and the colors are off.

My last advice is if you can wait, wait a couple of years when it is the 40th anniversary of the series.  No doubt remastered digital DVDs will be produced at that time as most films are on anniversaries.

PBS will offer a few NEW episodes of ""UpDown"" in April 2011; Jean Marsh reprises the role of Rose Buck working for the new family at Eaton Place. I have heard rumors that new episodes are already being filmed, so popular was the new series.

"It goes without saying that ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a ""Harry Potter"" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled ""Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?"" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson ""Miss Marple""s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.

"Just what we need: a screenplay by Marxist author Howard Fast on Washington's attack on Trenton.  A waste of the considerable talent of Jeff Daniels. Washington simply did not reason the way he is portrayed by Fast. This is what might have happened had Howard Fast been leading
the Revolution.",1.0
George Washington was VERY opposed to swearing.  He was known to punish his men if they swore.  SO WHY does Jeff Daniels swear like a sailor in this film.  It might have been good if the writers had not used such foul language.  George Washington would have been appalled to view this! BAD FORM A&E.  You could have done so much better!,1.0
"The portrayal of Washington was so contrary to what we can know of the real man from his own personal writings and from that which was written of him by his contemporaries that watching it aroused in me anger and sadness.  I originally bought this movie in order to select a 30 minute clip of this relevant Christmastime topic to show to my chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The foul language made it undesirable from the beginning. But worse, was that the writer, director or actor must not have bothered researching the person of George Washington. He would not have taken the name of the Lord in vain and did not even allow his men to swear. He was known to have impeccable manners, yet this movie has him loudly belittling General Henry Knox, in front the troops, for being overweight! This was supposed to be the funny part of the movie, I suppose; making fun of a great American hero who, one year earlier, was responsible for the British evacuation of Boston after having captured 59 canon and mortars from Fort Ticonderoga and bringing them 300 miles in the worst of weather to General Washington.

Jeff Daniels played Washington with no personality whatsoever. He was expressionless throughout the movie! Impatient, rude, snide - yes. But void of positive character traits. Washington was made to look like an imbalanced, foolish man. In real life, no one would have put such a person in a position of  leadership or would have followed him. There was NOTHING admirable or endearing about Daniels' portrayal of this revered American founder.

The saddest part of all of this is that the Amazon star rating here shows that most Americans have not studied history enough to realize what was so grossly wrong with this movie",1.0
The first ten to fifteen minutes of this movie had so much cursing in it our Family could not finish it. This movie IS A VERY POOR PORTRAYAL of George Washington's character!  It makes him out to be a fool instead of the person he himself was.  We shredded it so no one else would be subject to its filth and lies.,1.0
"Just saw The Crossing tonight.  I'm a huge Jeff Daniels fan.  I thought the scenery and costumes were great, battle recreations great, but as a whole the film fell short.  Numerous historical inaccuracies and important omissions, and a seeming obsession to make sure we knew that every character in the plot was a bawdy-talking, cussing, irreverent man of the world.  It was really over the top.  No way will I show this to my kids; not just that the cussing is excessive, but it's probably historically inaccurate and the portrayal certainly unbalanced.  In fact, at times the course language seemed to become the main POINT of the film rather than the historical significance of what was happening.  And we know from numerous histories and accounts written at the time by eyewitnesses that even though Washington had a bad temper, he restrained it and only used curse words on rare occasions (historical accounts indicate the shock by his staff when he cursed out Gen. Charles Lee at the Battle of Monmouth, because it was so uncharacteristic of him to use foul language and he actually ordered his soldiers not to do so).

Historical inaccuracies and important omissions abound: After the battle, Washington orders a retreat back across the Delaware; in reality, the army stayed in NJ and laid another trap for the British which ended up in a follow-up victory at Princeton.  And the attack on Trenton also included a planned second crossing that never materialized, adding drama that this film ignored.

On top of that, Daniels' portrayal of Washington seemed off compared to what you read by men of the time, including the soldiers who fought with him.  He was known as a hard man, but a also a gentleman much loved by those around him (other than the ambitious would-be usurpers); but in The Crossing, he just comes across as a hard man, and at times a jerk.  It was not a portrayal that seemed credible--who would follow this guy into battle?

Finally, and perhaps worst, we end with a totally fictional bit of ideological, PC revisionism when American Gen. Nathaniel Greene scolds Washington for his idealism, reminding him that the Revolution is all about the Colonists' greed, which Greene says is no different than that of the Hessians.  What??  That was the last straw for me.

The Crossing isn't a good history lesson at all, other than the outdoor scenes.

"I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this book.  My son is both a writer and an historian, and this DVD was shallow and the language beyond earthy.  It was vulgar.",1.0
"TV History reveals new and fascinating facts, either hitherto unknown, or previously ignored.

Viewers are informed, twice, that at least two general officers in the Continental Army shaved with cold water, one of them being the army's commander-in-chief.

While Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton became legendary for his hospitality, and especially for the generous helpings served to guests on a groaning dinner table. His expertise in carving a roast may have originated years earlier in a small cabin on the outskirts of Trenton, New Jersey, where the inventor of American banking put aside his duties as colonel of artillery to slice up a half dozen Hessians.

Colonel Rall, commanding the Germans, certainly took his time getting dressed for work. All those enemy troops storming past his bedroom window don't seem to have distracted him from getting his necktie on straight.

By contrast, Colonel Glover is portrayed as somewhat of a fashion emergency. And at the pivotal conference prior to the Battle of Trenton, he makes a scattered, rambling, speech on wig etiquette.

Among the hardships suffered by the Continental Army's rank-and-file, a shortage of pipe tobacco appears to be a close runner-up to the shoe shortage: They're reduced to toking up cornsilk.

Bookseller turned ballistics expert Henry Knox is relegated to comic relief, a sort of Oliver Hardy in period costume.

And those poor Hessians can't seem to escape the slur that they were hung-over on duty. Not much truth to this, ditto for the ""mercenary"" label these hapless losers can't seem to shake. When it comes down to it, they were shanghaied. But never mind, movies are about entertainment. Whoever choreographed their antics must have had a sense of humor: With those outlandish uniforms, they pass for Keystone Cops. And the extras really seem to enjoy hamming it up.

After an hour and a half of loopy dialogue and low-budget props, I did manage to score a few laughs. But wait. Something was missing. This film was shot up in Canada. So why isn't there any snow and ice? Wasn't that the whole thing about Trenton? The harrowing night march and daring assault in the dead of Winter?

There is a redeeming moment. Reality intrudes when one of Washington's staff suggests that all wars are basically about money. The famously stony Father of His Country nods in grudging agreement.",1.0
"I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.

One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: ""how many killed?"" ""None"" (correct). ""How many wounded?""  ""none"". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States. Worth mentioning I would think.",1.0
"This low budget film about Washington's surprise attack on the Hessians in Trenton is probably as bad as it get's. Jeff Daniels is miscast as Washington, and what's with the Cap'n Crunch hat he's wearing? Though this picture could be nit picked to death the attack on Trenton is a huge disappointment. The Americans walk unopposed into Trenton and even have time to set up their cannons and place their troops just right. The fighting starts after the Americans practically have to wake the hung over Hessians up. It's sad that this myth was made part of the film. How anyone could give this more than two stars let alone five is mindboggling.",1.0

"I like Harrison Ford, a lot.  I grew up with the man as Han Solo & Indiana Jones, but since The Fugitive, can anyone name me ONE decent performance he's been in? Anyone? Anyone? Thats right, he's really not much of an actor.  And shamefully the talented Gary Oldman, Glenn Close,  and Jurgen Prochnow are not allowed to show off their skills.

The plot (Air Force One being hijacked by Russian terrorists) seems easy enough.  However, the linchpin of the whole plot is completely ignored, thereby invalidating the whole movie.  For the terrorist plot to succeed, it is completely dependent on one of the secret service agents to be a traitor.  Did he do it for money? power? sex? a good chocolate milkshake?  We'll never know because they don't bother to mention it!  So we're supposed to accept that a president will run around Air Force One beating up terrorists, but a secret service agent who would have to endure YEARS of training, screening, and background checks would turn on the commander-in-chief with no good explanation?  Also do we really want a president who would consider the life of his family over the well-being of the nation?  I know that sounds cruel, but that's THE JOB!

I do not expect reality from movies, in fact when done right fantasy is a great genre.  However, this movie obviously is trying to have SOME basis in reality.  So if you're going to construct a film that has to have some realistic factors, isn't worth time to review the script to make sure it even makes sense?  THIS is primary point of my critique.

I don't feel any possible political leanings are to be drawn from the film.  You're really supposed to shut your brain off, eat popcorn, and feel good about the ole U.S.A..  So should you want another overly melodramatic, cliched, bad leading man 2-hour crapfest, that's your choice.  Please just don't consider it a good one...",1.0

"This is the kind of movie that should have never gotten to a studio once the script was written. It's so fake and it would never happen.

Harrison Ford is the president and he's kidnapped aboard his plane by a terrorist Gary Oldman. He's negotating for the release of some of his comrades to the vice president played by Glen Close. Ford won't give up without a fight and he's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met.

The movie is so fake it's sad. The plane would have been destroyed by pressure. It gets laced with 100's of rounds of ammo. Come on you have to make is somewhat believable. Wolfgang Peterson should be slapped upside the head for putting something like that in a movie.

Glen Close is horrible. Her dramatics are over the top. The fact that her character negotiates for the president is stupid. We don't negotiate with terrorists and the fact that they put that in his dumb. It's so fake.

The refueling plane blowing up is dumb. There are so many saftey devices in place that would never happen like that. You have to mkae a movie at look least real if your trying to make an action drama like this and it's not.

Russia would never give up dangerous men either. They'd tell us they felt bad for the president being in danger and would tell us to shove are demands where the sun don't shine.

This movie is way to fake. I couldn't enjoy it because it would never happen. I enjoy action dramas and this is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. If they had decided to make this more a drama and not so much action I might have been able to go along with it. The cast is awesome for the movie and a drama could have worked. The cast and talents are wasted. Why this made so much money I don't know. I guess people are stupid enough to follow the story. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",1.0
"On this derivative, by-the-numbers thriller we are forced to believe that an US president (played by Harrison Ford) could actually take down a russian (what else?) group of terrorists, as if he was 007 or McGyver.

There are some twists, but they are so ridiculous and unbelievable that I stopped caring about it halfway through, given that the resolution has no surprises at all since the ""good"" guys always win. Despite some competent action sequences, this is brain-dead, mind-numbing material, cartoonish at best and completly disposable. There`s no force to be found here.",1.0
"I rewatched this movie just last night (April 13th, 2003), to see what messages it actually uses to play on people's fears and misconceptions about the world around America. At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question.
Let's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default.
Apart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public.
I cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious.
I think the scariest bit had to be the speech at the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford. I've heard it before somewhere....

"Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls, Spice World is a grossly lacking film, even for those who enjoy the music. Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"", the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized. A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members can't save the film from its own bad dialogue, poor choreography and painful lip-syncing. Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.

Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project, a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls: Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm) and Scary (Melanie Brown). While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice, the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England. Meanwhile, their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief (Roger Moore) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers, or a caress of his squealing bovine. And if that isn't enough, a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines. To top it all off, a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives, which as it turns out, is basically the very movie we're watching.

Since the story of the film is largely pointless, and little else really holds attention spans, it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that don't quite add up. For starters, the girls drive around in the Spice Bus, a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior. So impossibly large in fact, that it doesn't even pretend to make sense. Workout equipment, couches, beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus, in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus. And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows, even though the realism has long since been abandoned.

While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions, physiques and attitudes, those characteristics don't translate over to their personalities. Either they were all scripted to be ditzy, or they're just naturally that way. Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios, most of which are intended as comedy relief, despite the blatant absence of humor. Similarly, the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations, and they're choreographed with little self-respect, and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing. Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life, and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles, an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.

With brief appearances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits, a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure, and countless attempts at failed humor, Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group. And even entertaining those fans is debatable. When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off, it's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.

"Compared to '97's other action smashes Con Air and Tommorow Never Dies , this meandering nonsense is the definable example of studio overbearing. It's slightly better than Face/Off maybe,but it still very poor. The action itself is slow moving and uninvolving,and nothing that hasn't been done ten times better and to more exciting effect in earlier highjack features like Passenger 57 and Under Siege. Harrison Ford is nauseatingly mundane,routine in his leading man role,doing the usual mumbling act he's done in previous action roles. He's showing his age really badly too (but he still should have got the role as Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears instead of Ben Affleck,dagnammit!)Meanwhile,Gary Oldman is laughably OTT as the rashan terrorist ,while Glen Close and William H. Macy are totally wasted in their roles. The story itself is completely unbelievable and insults the viewer's intelligence beyond breaking point. For one example out of many others,in one scene,Ford uses a mobile phone to make contact with Close and we all know that in real life,this would cause the plane to crash. And towards the end,it doesn't half drag on like anything,just when I thought this dire mess was coming to and end,it just went on more and more until I was close to just turning it off and walking out. For an impressive instance of Ford's action man status,check out his turns as Jack Ryan in Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games. And sign a petition to get him as the lead in the new film,not Aptless Affleck.",1.0
"This movie never really appealled to me when it first came out a while back. I thought it would be an alarmingly patriotic and gung-ho affair with little thought for anyone outside of the US, with the amount of disbelief needing to be suspended astronomical. Having only recently seen it on terrestrial television, I can say that I was absolutely right.
Harrison Ford plays the President with his usual rigid sub-Schwarzenneger style, utterly emotionless and unbelievable as always. Glenn Close hams along as a cringe-inducingly patriotic vice president, with some of the most cliched and predictable lines ever. Gary Oldman is a little better, but still plays a stereotypical hollywood villian who engages in just about every deadly sin possible in this movie.
Wolfgang Petersen fails to engage the watcher or bring about any of the sweaty claustrophobia present in his previous epic, Das Boot. Even In The Line Of Fire questioned the all-American dream and morals, partly because of the presence of the brilliant John Malkovich. This film doesn't. At all.
To say that I'm not a fan of action movies would be incorrect. I've just never seen a good one. This was no exception.",1.0
"Could it be the worst film ever? Possibly.

Could it be used to extract information from even the most dangerous of spies? Definitely.

"Spiceworld: The Movie is a movie starring the Spice Girls.

What....you want a plot? Sorry, there just isn't one. Well, nothing that could be coherently described as a plot, anyway. The target audience of this movie won't realize this, but what we get is a collection of music videos very very loosely tied together around a number of dismal subplots.

To give you some idea of the looseness of the subplots, some of them involved;

A snooty bumbling reporter, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) filming a documentary on the ""real"" Spice Girls. He wanders about with his moronic crew, bumping into things and falling over a lot.

A spitulous newspaper mogul, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphreys) whose goal is to break up the Spice Girls so that he can sell more newspapers, and his associated super sleazy press photographer.

An impotent, stressed out manager - Clifford (Richard E. Grant).

A bizarre quoter of nonsense played by Roger Moore who is supposedly the big Chief.

A very pregnant friend of the Spice Girls who goes into labour whilst dancing at a nightclub.

A movie producer (George Wendt)and writer following Clifford around pitching Spice Girl movie ideas at him which he keeps rejecting until, surprise, surprise, they pitch the idea for this movie to him, and he agrees.

Aliens that have heard of the Spice Girls and want their autographs (whilst they are in the bush looking for a place to pee). I'm not making this one up, honestly.

The movie also featured a bus with a Union Jack plastered all over it which was the Spiceworld tour bus. They must have put Dr Who's Tardis somewhere in this bus, since it was an awful lot bigger inside than outside, but never mind about that. Meatloaf drove the bus.",1.0
"What a roller coaster ride of a movie. I say this not because it had me at the edge of my seat with excitement but because it made me vomit allover myself. Wow, where do I even begin? Ok how about this? You know how a movie can be so bad that in a way its actually kind of good. Well this movie was so bad that it just flew past that point quicker than Rick James' heartbeat after a 4 day coke binge, and then went back around full circle to being just plan horrible.

I don't know how this can even be characterized as a movie because a movie requires a plot of some kind. I could have taken a blank piece of paper. Conjured up the biggest loogie that I could possibly make. One with a small solid chunk in it and with a nice faint yellowish hue. Spit it on the paper and have made a better script then the one used in this movie. There must have been something wrong with either the tape I was viewing or my VCR, because about halfway through, the picture fluttered and the screen went blue for about 7mins. I witnessed more plot turns and more character development in this 7min span of blue screen, then I did throughout the whole rest of the movie.

This movie left me so violated that at the ending credits I felt like a preschooler leaving the Never Land Ranch after a week long slumber party. At one point I just couldn't take anymore. I tried to stand and walk to the TV to shut it off, but I was so mentally and physically exhausted from viewing this movie that I couldn't even make it to my feet. Watching this movie required the use of muscles that I don't usually use on a regular basis. My body actually physically ached with soreness for 3 days after viewing this sick joke of a film. During one of the musical montages I sincerely feared that my brain cells may try to euthanize themselves to avoid enduring this torture any longer. The extent of psychological damage this movie has caused me is immeasurable. I now have recurring Nam flashbacks and I didn't even fight in Nam. Sometimes I'll just start weeping out of the blue like when Richard Simmons consoles a grossly overweight woman. I developed a drinking habit. I lost my job. All the hopes and dreams I once had are now lost, just like the fat from around Jarrids' midsection, all because of ""Spice World""

Director Bob Spiers should receive a beating so bad that The Gooch wouldn't even unleash it upon Arnold Jackson, for recording these ghastly events on film. If the spermaceti that was responsible for producing Bob Spiers knew that he would later go on to make this movie. It would have screamed out kamikaze and took a fatal dive into the sticky mucus lining of the fallopian tubes, instead of fertilizing the egg. Just think about how destructive, to the whole human race, Spice World can be. This next statement may sound very farfetched but in all likelihood it's not completely inconceivable. God forbid this would ever happen, but for a moment just imagine that all intelligent life on this planet was eradicated by some sort of plague. Now imagine that after hundreds of thousands of years a new race were to discover our planet and start studying who we were and how we lived. Imagine how they would marvel at some of our discoveries and inventions. They would be mesmerized by the huge skyscrapers we erected. Our knowledge of medicine, electricity, the automobile, the computer, and the family size George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reduceing Grilling Machine with bun warmer. They would be awed by some of our great poets, artists and philosophers. Just imagine what they would learn from us. Imagine the respect and admiration they would have for us. That is until one of them were to unearth ""Spice World"". The respect they once had for our hole race would be taken back faster than a bowl of cereal from Trix The Rabbit. Where we were once hailed as kings we would now be reduced to nothing more than the butts of their jokes like blondes, the Polish and Janet Jacksons' Nipple. All because of ""Spice World"".

So in closeing. Whatever you do, do not buy or watch this movie, and if for some reason you already own it at least make sure you keep it locked up tighter then Martha Stewart. It may help preserve our good name in the long run.",1.0

Right about when these talentless hacks became popular, I was in fifth grade, and every girl in my class (plus a couple of guys...) had to have EVERYTHING with their stupid faces on it.

"The schlockmeisters, from Hollywood, have surpassed themselves with this offering. It needs more than suspension of disbelief to be entertained here, a full-frontal lobotomy is almost a prerequisite.

It is so over-the-top and patently absurd in its action sequences that it actually can't rate as a movie in the genre of a thriller; it's more like a self-parody of an action movie. What's missing is the canned laughter to give this movie some form of legitimacy and classification as to what the producer had in mind when he dished this up to the public.

Yes, every respectable critic has alluded to the spraying of hundreds of rounds machinegun fire inside a pressurised cabin of a 747, but what we have here is a President who's a  master of armed and unarmed combat; an Avionics Engineer -  a man adept at doing anything in a crisis situation. We can also add: the perfect, caring and reassuring father and husband; maybe, we can include gynaecologist to his rather impressive list of credentials as well.

This guy can hang outside a plane flying at 550mph at 38,000ft in -60 degrees Centigrade - if you're not impressed with that, we also see him standing upright on the plane's wing.

Gary Oldman has played the arch villain once too often, his  acting is becoming banal, predictable and synthetic; it's almost as if he doesn't believe in his character anymore - he's simply bored by the  monotonous, one-dimensional, stereotyped role of the baddie.

As for the role of Glenn Close as V.P. - she should know better. The scenes in the war room with the false sentiments of angst, anticipation, anxiety and, finally, overwhelming relief and joy...... it was cringingly awful.

"My whole life (I'm over 50) I've read about how great this movie was supposed to be. I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.

I already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.

After the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself ""I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act"" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.

The movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.

Unless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.

This opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.

The only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.

I couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.

"The American Film Institute rated this movie #88 of the 100 best movies of all time.  While I tend to agree with the institute on their picks, I believe the Institute was likely stoned when they rated this film.  I understand the concept of the film: disillusioned anti-establishment pothead youths dropping out to find true freedom and true expression, but the filmatic means used to reach this end go absolutely nowhere.  The director, Dennis Hopper, (also a costar in this monument to the sixties), loads at least a third of the film with mostly meaningless, boring footage of the two cyclists touring through the American west using drug-culture inspired music from the 60's as the soundtrack. Honestly, I could have filmed better footage through my childhood super-8 camera. And with perhaps the exception of one or two songs (Born to Be Wild), the music is dreadfully dated, the lyrics incomprehensible, and incredibly boring.

It seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film. His emotional range does not register on the Richter scale.  Dennis Hopper's character is one-dimensional as well - we know all about him in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Only Jack Nicholson's character lends any acting credence to the film.  Nicholson shines as the lawyer who seeks the freedom to throw off society's restraints, but even Nicholson cannot save this sinking ship.

There is a climatic scene at the end of the film when the duo reach New Orleans and celebrate Mardi Gras. They have a LSD drug trip and the camera tries to capture the ""trip"" experience.  Again, the sequence is poorly filmed, poorly edited, and is far too long.  The photographic special effects used are hopelessly antiquated and I am sure high school film students of today could surpass this effort.

As I compare this film to the great classics: Gone With the Wind, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, To Kill a Mockingbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.  It is not a film for the ages, on the contrary, it is a film for 1969, and it belongs buried in the failed American era that was the sixties.

"Anyone with heightened sensibilities will most likely find themselves offended by this movie.  Its portrayal of southerners is ludicrous, making them seem slow-witted and barbaric - an inaccurate picture at best.  Men are also characterized as dopey and non essential.

"Two men on motorcycles stop at a bar in a rural area. They test the powder they are buying. [No arms for security?] Back in the States they resell the powder to a very rich man. They hide their money and start on a long journey. No concern about time? There is no room at the inn for them. They stop to fix a flat, and are fed at a farm. Then the trip continues. When will they get to the Mardi Gras? ""Porky Pig""? They arrive at a settlement. [How successful will they be?] Do they dine on bread and beans? Do the inmates run this asylum?

There is a parade in the next town. Do they have a permit? They meet a local character in the jail. Will he go to the Mardi Gras? Is there another society that is highly evolved? Is this just pretentious babbling to pad out the movie? They stop at a small town. People make comments, and they leave. Will somebody come after them? They arrive at that house of blue light. Then they go to the Mardi Gras to see even stranger sights. We see a New Orleans cemetery (people are buried in vaults). The picture drags on as they pass around a bottle. The scenes suggest intoxication. They leave the next morning. ""We blew it."" Then there is an end to their journey due to an accidental meeting with a pick-up truck.

"This movie is offensive in the same way that any movie that is truly about hippies would have to be. What that meens is this movie does not consist of the typical slapstick hippie stereo type that we usually get in stupid cartoons. This shows hippies for what they are, degenerates, and at the same time it demonizes the south. For a hippie, this movie would seem to be a moral statement, but to me it just seems to show how awful people can be. Shame on hippies for being , lazy, pot smoking, anti-establishment degenerates. But shame on the south too, for being filled with such hatred. But while I'm sure there are some people in the south that would have no problem shooting hipppies on spot for no apparent reason other than that they looked funny, I can't help but feel that the south were exagerated to certain extent. In conclusion though, this movie was enjoyable . I don't know why, but it was. I guess its just a very amusing look into the late 60s (something thats usually sugarcoated)from the ""other side"" lol. i would like to rate it higher, but I just can't bring myself to do it.

"Well, it may have been representative of its day, but as of 12/27/05, it's grown pretty tedious.  It has one thing to say, that could be said in about 10 minutes, but it spreads the ""message"" out over way too long.

Jack Nicholson is, of course, the bright spot in the film, but he's in waaaaay to little of it.",1.0
"This is another work of liberal propoganda from the sixtys

designed to encourage children to turn on their country,

drop out and use drugs.

The story (if you can call it that) has two drug dealers riding

motorcycles across the american west.  They are smuggling drugs

the whole way.  Its less a movie than a music video because

nobody in the film can really act.  Endless motocycle panoramas

set to music followed by a seemingly endless trip-out scene

where our boys play around in a graveyard with whores and

mock the idea of religion.

The film is full of the liberal paranoid view of America.  That

Americans who work, have families, have jobs, are clean and

don't do drugs sit around all day plotting how to kill everyone

else.  Its always news to them, but real Americans are far too

busy working and living their lives to care much about what

a bunch of deadbeats are up to.

Peter Fonda spends the whole film in love with himself.  I can

imagine after every take him pulling out a mirror and grooming

himself.  The other guy (Hopper) is a dirtball.  He must have

been out of it nearly the whole time because they go out of their

way to reduce his lines down to nothing.  Nicholson is the only

person in the movie who can half-way act, and at best he gives

a B-grade supporing character actor performance.

And by hippie-liberal logic, since Nicolson is the only actor

here, he gets the least screen time and gets killed off real

quick.  As is always the case under socialism, the punishment

for showing that your better than other people is severe.

At the end of the film, our druggie heros get shot to death

out on the road by regular america for no reason.  The day

before they get shot, Fonda tells the dirty guy ""we blew it""

forshadowing that they were going to be punished and killed.

By liberal logic, Hopper and Fonda blew it (and brought death

on themselves) because as noble as liberals consider drug

smuggling, it also could be considered work.  Work for

these kind of guys is the ultimate crime against nature.

This film and its two dirtballs turn the concept of freedom

around.  Freedom was never about freedom from work or freedom

to use lots of drugs.  Freedom is about opportunity, not

being a parasite.",1.0

The American  Film Institute includes this bomb in its list of 100 greatest American  films, so I thought I'd check it out.

"This poorly made, boring flick is nothing if not profoundly patriarchal. The main story line revolves around a young woman who is willing to risk her life and die in order to produce a baby. Because the central goal of a woman's life is to make babies. Unless you can fulfill this goal, you are incomplete. So of course, the only reasonable thing to do is for a woman literally to kill herself in an attempt to produce a baby.

There are many other female characters who are mainly dedicated to endless hen-like clucking around the protagonist's attempts to have a baby, as well as interminable conversations about hair-styles, weddings, husbands, etc. In Steel Magnolias, we see women of all generations inhabiting a world of their own. It's a world of babies, beauty, and homemaking. It's a world of things that the patriarchal societies always mark as exclusively female. Men are supposed to be detached from these ""womanly"" interests and concerns, while women have no interest in the pursuits of men. The view of genders as profoundly divided by an unbridgeable chasm of difference is patriarchal.

Why this film has been hailed as a feminist classic and has become a perennial staple of ""Feminist Film"" courses is beyond me.",1.0

(Did Terri Garr ever get to portray a woman anyone could stand being around).

Top world-scientists surrounded by computers, and slide rules,  have to rip a large globe from its pedestal in order fix latitude and longitude?  Now, there's a piece of needless and embarrassing  action.

I like the concept of the film.  I like that it is mathematics, including music, that creates a universal language..  It is reasonable that, as portrayed, the government would do everything in its power to deny the arrival of extra-terrestrials, not because I believe they exist, but because governments are historically fearful of a knowledgeable public.

Even on the VHS tape of this movie, there is an interview following the movie.  Just why would there not have been air conditioning brought in to the hangar in Alabama, so that the crew and actors were not sweltering.  What was the point?  I mean, they went to India.  This is why I can't even be an extra.  I'm working.  I get fed.  I don't get exposed to conditions that could land me in the hospital.  This is all very sado-masochistic.  Very unnecessary.

If you like to see movies about Richard Dreyfus playing with carbs, then you'll love Close Encounters.  And special effects?  I don't know why they're considered so revolutionary because they're not half as good as anything I saw in ID4 (that's what I call Independence Day) or MIB II (Men in Black II) or iRobot or even Wild Wild West.

"I love Speilberg films, I really do, but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap. I just do not like it, its not my thing. I can't belive that Richard Dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in Jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense. If you want to watch it, then go ahead, we all have different tastes. However, if you want to see a real Speilberg film, watch ones like Duel, Jaws, ET, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and The Indiana Jones Trilogy.",1.0
"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is long and boring.  The main character is so easy to hate which makes the movie even harder to watch, when you wish he was dead. Not to mention the ending left me with the taste of rotting fecal in my mouth.

"The film  ""Close Encounters"" is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion.
This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal. Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch.
However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise. His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer. It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr. Spielberg?
Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire. Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future. What a pity. I have viewed every version released on video and DVD and each one changes the feel and direction of the movie in some way and none of them match the impact and intent of the original.
Be patient and stay tuned...but don't buy yet!",1.0
