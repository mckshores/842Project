"This adorable story is an all time favorite fantasy. Although at first it seems as if the story is realistic, it's not long before the teddy bear is up walking and talking.",5.0
Lisa's bear Corduroy gets lost in the laundromat.  Lisa looks for him but the manager must close up for the night.  Then Corduroy goes on his adventures.  It's a very good picture book for children 3-6.,5.0
"In this installment of Corduroy's adventures with Lisa, we see that some time has passed since she first brought him home from the department store.  She's taller, wearing her hair a little straighter, and her mom looks like she had a makeover, too.  Corduroy, however, is wearing the same green overalls he did in the first book and has managed to keep both buttons on this time.  Early on in the book, however, Corduroy decides he needs a pocket, and in the search for one gets separated from Lisa and her mom while they are in the laundromat.  They leave without him, setting him up for a meeting with a friendly stranger who washes his overalls for him, as well as encounters with such laundromat staples as powder detergent and pushcarts.
As in the first book, Lisa comes back for him the next day, and once again her needle and thread come to the rescue.
This book and ""Corduroy"" are the only two Corduroy books my daughter and I have read.  I wonder if there are others, and what kind of sartorial splendor Corduroy will be arrayed in next if the trend continued!",5.0
"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills.  With better parent-child bonding from reading,  you child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to  others.  Intellectual performance will expand as well.  Spending time  together watching television fails as a substitute.
To help other  parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our  youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were  read to her as a young child.  A Pocket for Corduroy was one of her picks.  Since the story is well summarized here at Amazon.com, I would like to  focus on why the story is an important one to share.
First, Lisa is shown  as being not such a young child.  Yet she carries her teddy bear, Corduroy,  with her openly.  No one comments on that, shames her about it, or acts as  though she is doing anything strange.  Children draw great comfort from  familiar objects, teddy bears, blankets, and other stuffed toys.  This book  endorses that connection, overcoming the stalled thinking that children  must quickly become little adults.
Second, Lisa helps her Mother do the  laundry as her primary focus.  That shows a connectedness to her Mother and  the family that is very encouraging for a child.  She can make a  contribution although she is a child.
Third, Lisa makes every attempt to  be responsible about Corduroy.  She tells Corduroy to wait in a chair and  not to move.  She tries to find Corduroy before leaving the laundromat, and  gets her Mother to agree to come back again the next day to find him.  Although she is sad, she overcomes her reluctance to be separated and  leaves.  This suggests that she can and should trust that everything will  turn out all right.  This reinforces an optimism that is good for children  to develop.
Fourth, all of the adults act in responsible ways.  Lisa's  Mother brings her back.  The artist who finds Corduroy in his laundry bag  dries his clothes for him and leaves him where he can easily be found the  next day.  The man who works in the laundry helps Lisa and her Mother find  Corduroy the next day.  This encourages the idea that everyone can and will  help one another.  This is a good role model for children as they imagine  what they should be like as adults.
Fifth, the whole misadventure  relates to Corduroy feeling bereft because he does not have a pocket.  So  Lisa sews one for him, caring for him in a nurturing way even though he is  only a teddy bear.  Caring about others is a great way to feel better about  oneself.
As you can see, the book is filled with optimistic, caring,  considerate human values expressed through the story.  You can reinforce  this by discussing with your child how s/he might care for a favorite  stuffed animal or blanket during an upcoming trip.  This can help reduce  the anxiety caused by concerns about the changes, and assist your child in  being careful so the loved connection is not lost.
You and your child  will feel affirmed and closer after you read and review this story  together.
Overcome your stalled thinking about providing affirmations  to your child with this book!",5.0
My son loves corduroy this gave us a different book to read instead of  reading the original book every night,5.0
I've read this book for years and always will love it. I read it to all my children and they live it as well!,5.0
"I was first introduce to Corduroy when I was in Kindergarten. It's funny because that particular day, I was also wearing corduroy pants. Of course, this was years before students had to wear uniforms. Nearly 30 years has passed and now I am purchasing it for my own children. Hopefully they will love the story as much as I did. This story is a great addition to any children's library, along with Corduroy.",5.0

"Charming and sweet, in the same vein as ""Corduroy.""  Just different enough to keep my girls' interest, but another wonderful story about the intrepid bear.  Great for babies on up.  If you have the first one, this one is worth it, and if you don't, I recommend every child have both!!",5.0

Every story and book about Corduroy is Fantastic. This book is great and I bought all the Corduroy books for my 2 boys and now for their total of 5 children. You have to buy a Corduroy bear for everyone who has the books. Love to hold them while the stories are read.,5.0

"I purchased this book for my first grade classroom. I read the book to the students during a math lesson. The first day, I split the students into groups and had them count how many pockets they had all together. They recorded it on a chart and answered questions like: Who had the most? Who had the least? Choose two numbers and compare using <,>,=. The second day we referenced the book and compared pockets of the boys vs the girls. They again answered questions about the numbers. They loved it! Recommend!!",5.0

"Having spent numerous years in an elementary school library, I can say with all honesty that the Corduroy books were great favorites for all the years I was there. A Pocket for Corduroy is a charming addition to anyone's collection. It is a very sweet story about the owner of Corduroy who leaves him in the laundry and has some difficulties retrieving him. Children can relate to that quite well. Getting him back is a good lesson in itself. Sewing the pocket on for him is delightful. It has a happy ending which is most enjoyable. Further note, when I read the Corduroy books to little people, I always tried to have an example of corduroy material with me - either on as pants, etc. Some of the children did not know what corduroy was. Five star book",5.0

"One day, Corduroy, a stuffed bear, goes with Lisa, his owner, and her mother to do laundry at the laundromat.  As Lisas mom reminds her to empty her pockets, Corduroy decides he needs a pocket on his overalls and sets out on a search to find one.  What might he find along the way?  Will he wander completely away from Lisa?

This is a sweet and fun book that I think I might like better than the original.  The reason for this is the creativity of what Corduroy runs across in the laundromat and what he thinks it might be.  We, of course, know better, but his guesses make perfect sense from his experiences.  The pictures are wonderful and expertly capture the story.

If you are a fan of this stuffed bears first adventure, don't hesitate to get this one.  And if youve missed Corduroy, by all means meet him soon.",5.0

I read all these books to my kids growing up. We still talk about them even now. They were my sons greatest memories of laughter and time together. Great read!,5.0
"This and its predecessor, ""Corduroy"", are probably my toddler's favorite books. She also got the plush bear and loves him too.
Simple, gentle, but not sweetish, stories of an ""ingnu"" bear and the little girl who becomes his best friend. 2 strokes of genius - nothing else by Don Freeman is anywhere near as endearing.",5.0

"This is a lovely gentle simple story of love and friendship.  It brought a smile and tears to my eyes.  Even though I am an adult, a friend read it out loud to me before giving the book to her teen-age daughter who had asked for it specially.  Just the perfect story for reading out loud.  Try it!  It's a special experience.",5.0
I had the bear and needed the book for my grandson so was pleased to find on is such good shape and priced well,5.0
"I am not a fan of sequels in any form- it seems impossible to top or equal the original. However, I am pleased to report that ""A Pocket for Corduroy"" is a sequel, and a sequel that I enjoyed. I love the urban, hipster setting highlighted by Freeman's warm, real-life details- a woman passing in a sari, hard plastic Laundromat chairs, a box of ""Swan Flakes"" soap chips. And I loved the beret and the name ""Pandro's"" on the Laundromat window- like I said, think: ""beatnik artist"" and it's not like the name on the window was ""Gonzales'""...I've never even have heard of the surname ""Pandro"" (re: previous negative reviewer). No disrespect to others' opinions; it just seems to me that everyone is too sensitive to everything today. Anyway, as you probably know by now, Cord gets left behind at the Laundromat, has a small nighttime adventure involving a dryer ride, a soap waterfall, and being rediscovered by Lisa. So, Lisa sews a pocket on Cord's overalls for him to place his namecard within in case of future loss. Not sappy at all. Read warm, gentle cycle. Copyright 1978.",5.0

I found these books and this author years and years ago.  The first is Corduroy and then A Pocket For Corduroy.  What a fun adventure for you and the one you are sharing this story with.  This is now a standard I buy for all baby showers!,5.0
I had this book when I was a little girl and now my daughter loves it too,5.0
"This book was the hit of the baby shower this book was given at.  ALL of the young mothers had forgotten about this book that they had loved themselves as children - so when the gift box with this book was opened...there was so many ooooo's and ahhhhhhhh's that went up from the room for this modern classic.  The book was passed around and everyone had to look at it for just it's nostalgia alone.  So many gals left the baby shower saying they were stopping on their way home to pick the book up to share with their own babies.  Did I mention the honored mommy-to-be LOVED her gift?  Can't go wrong with this book for young ones, no matter their age :)",5.0
"My 2 1/2 year old adores this book. In fact, I have had to make a rule of no more than twice a day. He calls it the ""laundry book"". I must disagree about the caged bear scene being frightening. My son specifically requests the caged bear scene and is obviously not scared in the least. It is a sweet tale of a little girl and her little bear. I love how the author uses some big words in a children's book. My son's vocabulary has grown exponentially!",5.0
"I can't begin to count the number of times we have read this book since finally purchasing it for Christmas.  My son loved Corduroy and loves this one just as much.  It's a book that I enjoy as well, so I don't mind reading it over and over.",5.0
This text goes through methodology of changing communities with others. I thought it had some great ideas for initiating a change to take place and ways to get others on board.,5.0
"The book provides an excellent introduction to social entrepreneurship and how individuals can play a role in creating social change.  The authors walk us through what social entrepreneurship is, the pioneers and how it is different from government, activism, and traditional entrepreneurship.  The next section covers the challenges of addressing some of societies most intractable problems through entrepreneurial endeavors. The book concludes with a discussion how to envision an innovating society where people are taking charge of making long term systemic change to society.  A must read for anyone new to the field of social entrepreneurship or wants to help create social change.",5.0
"The most comprehensive overview of social entrepreneurship yet also the shortest and most concise. Each section gives you the needed background about a topic, then summarizes what is happening now with short but insightful comments on every topic. This is, in one short book, the best primer for those who want an overview of the field but also the most penetrating analysis for practitioners. Bornstein's deep knowledge of social entrepreneurship, from the entrepreneurs to the concepts and emerging trends all shine through on every page.",5.0
"We spend most of our days taking in messages about all the problems and wrongs plaguing the world, but Bornstein provides a fresh approach -- highlighting the visionaries who are doing something to fix all those things that need fixing. Whether you're new to world of social entrepreneurship or working in the field, this book will leave you inspired to join the leaders who are showing that it is possible to do work that has lasting impact. This book should be required reading for students of all ages, and for decision-makers around the world.",5.0
"It usually takes me two months to read a nonfiction book. However in this case I read Bornstein and Davis in less than 5 days because I was completely engaged with their explanations and definitions of everything related to social entrepreneurship.
I was fully inspired by Bornstein's ""How to change the world"" and the cases he presented. In his new book with Davis I understood more about social entrepreneurship, its challenges, strengths, etc.
I have been working on an organization that promotes social entrepreneurship for more than 3 years; after reading this book I understand more about my organization and my role.
I believe that this book is crucial for everyone interested in social innovation, public service or social entrepreneurship.",5.0
"David Bornstein is the most important writer in the social entrepreneurship space.  Here he boils down what he has learned from his travel, his research, his thinking to some basics about what is so significant about social entrepreneurship today.  For anyone interested in the topic -- from a practitioner to the interested newbie -- this new volume by David Bornstein and Susan Davis is essential reading.",5.0
"This is one of the best books I've read lately, and I highly recommend it for anyone who considers themselves a Social Entrepreneur or who seeks to work in the field of Social Enterprise. I felt as though the writers knew me personally, and I gleaned much and was encouraged tremendously throughout every page of this book. Well worth the small investment of $11.53. I am putting together teams and a network of women in social enterprise and will have this on the top of the list of books that must be read. Order today and let's get the reviews going!",5.0

But seriously, this book was so powerful, inspirational, and jammed full of practical ideas, that I was constantly using the highlight feature. I'm a baby social entrepreneur, both for myself and for the nonprofit organization for which I work, and this book has encouraged, spurred me, on and given my practical steps to continue on this exciting path.

This was a really good into to social entrepreneurship.  It's a fairly quick read and I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in learning about a unique way to help others.,5.0
"This book is a nice, succinct overview of the emerging field of social entrepreneurship. It included helpful ideas on where to get started, business ideas, and examples of successful ventures.",5.0
I thought it was a great overview of social entrepreneurship and contained some good case studies. Recommend if you are interested in the topic.,5.0
"Much has been written on the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship, but this slim volume says more about it than anything else I have read.  It captures the essence of what it is the social entrepreneur does, and puts it in historical context, better than anything out there.  These are two gifted writers melding their varied experiences and perspectives into something that can give grounding and direction to a new generation of social entrepreneurs.  I give this book out to many people who pass through the doors of my office.  I look forward to the follow up volume that tracks what has happened since publication of the original edition.",5.0
"The book itself is inspiring. Its an easy and applicable read in regards to working to change the old social systems that are not working for us anymore.

Read it if you find yourself asking, ""Where are the revolutionaries?!""
Read it if you want to make change for the better of your community.",5.0
"After three decades of increasingly widespread public attention, a surprisingly large number of commentators in the field of social entrepreneurship continue to argue about the most basic question of all: What is a social enterprise, and what isn't? In this superb little book, David Bornstein and Susan Davis straightforwardly put this question to rest: ""Social entrepreneurship is a process by which citizens build or transform institutions to advance solutions to social problems, such as poverty, illness, illiteracy, environmental destruction, human rights abuses, and corruption, in order to make life better for many."" So much for all those deconstructionists who contend that a social enterprise must never turn a profit, or must always turn a profit, or must address some sorts of problems but not others!

As an introduction to the field, Social Entrepreneurship is unmatched.

Most books on social entrepreneurship feature case studies or vignettes starring some of the field's most innovative and successful individuals. This was the case with an earlier book of Bornstein's, How to Change the World, which is widely (and rightfully) regarded as ""the bible"" of the field. By contrast, the three short chapters that constitute Social Entrepreneurship ask and answer the most fundamental questions that any reader unfamiliar with the pursuit of social change might ask, first clarifying the definition of social entrepreneurship, then examining the practical challenges practitioners face, and finally ""Envisioning an Innovating Society."" In that third chapter, Bornstein and Davis discuss how government, academia, business, philanthropy, and the news media might contribute to fashioning the ""everyone a changemaker"" world posited by Ashoka's Bill Drayton.

As the authors point out, ""Social entrepreneurs have always existed. But in the past they were called visionaries, humanitarians, philanthropists, reformers, saints, or simply great leaders. Attention was paid to their courage, compassion, and vision but rarely to the practical aspects of their accomplishments. Thus, people may know about the moral teachings of St. Francis but not about how the Franciscans became the fastest growing religious order of its day. Children learn that Florence Nightingale ministered to wounded soldiers but not that she built the first professional school for nurses and revolutionized hospital construction. Gandhi is remembered for demonstrations of nonviolent rsistance but not for building a decentralized political apparatus that enabled India to make a successful transition to self-rule."" And if St. Francis, Florence Nightingale, and Gandhi exemplified the isolated and occasional social entrepreneurs of yesteryear, there are thousands of courageous individuals now walking parallel paths to institutional change on every continent -- backed up by a growing suport network that includes Ashoka, the Skoll Foundation, the Schwab Center for Social Entrepreneurship, Avina, and many other organizations. Given the enormity of the challenges facing humanity in the 21st Century, their combined efforts may represent our last, best hope to create a world in which our grandchildren can live healthy, rewarding lives.

David Bornstein and Susan Davis came to the task of writing this book with impeccable qualifications. In addition to How to Change the World, which went into a second edition in 2007, Bornstein wrote The Price of a Dream: The Story of the Grameen Bank, first published in 1996. He is the preeminent journalist in the field. Davis is a supremely accomplished activist, having served as a founding member of the Grameen Foundation and then co-founding BRAC USA, which she serves as President and CEO. (BRAC began its institutional life as a Bangladeshi nonprofit, later expanding to many other countries around the world. It is regarded as the world's largest NGO.) She also helps select Ashoka Fellows. Previously, she held a series of senior positions with the Ford Foundation, Women's World Banking, the International Labor Organisation, and other institutions.

"This book is a great place to start for anyone who wants to participate in changing the world. I know,the idea of one person changing the world may sound crazy to many, but this book isn't for ""the many"";it's for those who have the audacity to believe that the world is full of potential to be ""better"" and they could be a catalyst for that better. The book is a toolbox filled with tangible information on where to start,who to see and what to do to change things at any level you can imagine from just within you to your family or even the world.",5.0
"A group of Georgia Tech students I was a part of this year researching social entrepreneurship and design added this title to our reading list at the recommendation of one of the college of management's senior faculty and we were extremely pleased with it. Of the 20+ books and dozens of articles, white papers and essays we read on the subject, this modestly sized book held a wealth of information, resources, cases and essential guidance on current pursuits attempting to create better commerce and better societies through synthesized, creative efforts. The most compelling businesses and philanthropic organizations are not adhering to ""traditional"" modes of operation, financing, client relations or philosophies and this book tell the story of how many are doing it. A great starting point and comprehensive over view, this should be the basis for anyone interested in learning more.",5.0
"George Soros once said, ""Let business be business and philanthropy be philanthropy. Keep the two separate."" And never the twain shall meet. However, even Soros, capitalist businessman and philanthropist extraordinaire, eventually succumbed to seeing the merits of and need for social enterprise. David Bornstein and Susan Davis, two scholars of social innovation, offer a truly inspiring book about the noble, burgeoning field of ""social entrepreneurship."" They offer recognition to the countless anonymous individuals who address the world's most intractable problems, and they dole out useful advice to the ""changemakers"" who give voices to people who have none. Although this guide may be a tad basic for workers at established social enterprises, getAbstract recommends it as a wonderful source of tips and inspiration to budding social entrepreneurs in all fields who strive to change the world for the better.",5.0

"What this thing lacks in color, it makes up for in space.  I have a super giant print Holman KV Bible, 10""x7.5""x1.75"" approimatel, and had not found anything to fit.  What's cool is the inner pen loop can be used for m Bible highlighter, and there's a space for a notebook, plus 4 other pockets so Ican skip the purse if I want to when I head to church.  Gonna grab some fabric paint and decorate it to personalize it.  Since the cover is fabric instead of leather, you can use needle and thread, too, if you have the know-how.  If you have a super giant print Sword, sheath it with this bad bo, and you are golden.  Be blessed!",5.0

Great fit for my daughter's Adventure Bible.,5.0
"The Adventure Bible Cover is perfect for my 3 and 5 year old to be able to carry their Adventure Bible to church. They see mommy and daddy carry their Bibles to church and they want to also. It was a bit problematic since their Bibles are a bit heavy and a tad too big for their small hands. Now they can simply hold the cover's handle and walk nicely with their own Bible. It protects the Bible from baby sister's curious hands as well. The fabric and zipper are very sturdy, the cover overall appears to be of great quality. There is ample room in the pockets for pens, pencils, some crayons, a notepad, etc. We highly recommend this product!",5.0

"An accurate, detailed description and video are given in another review so I won't go over that info again.

I LOVE this cover.  I did not buy it as a bible cover, but as a journal cover for my beloved Leuchtturm 1917 Dotted Berry Notebook (5.75 by 8.25 inches, 249 pages).  I used a seam ripper and removed the ""Adventure Bible"" logo from the front of the cover.  It came off easily, but did leave small holes from the stitching (see photo).  It is not too noticeable, though I do plan on putting a patch or something on to cover them. I'm picky :) The fabric the cover is made out of is a bit stiff.  This causes the case to get a bit ""crunched"" looking on the outside unless it is stuffed full.  It isn't a big negative, but I have included a picture to show this.

Even if you aren't traveling, this cover is a great way to keep all your favorite journaling goodies together right where you need them.

The pockets on the outside give you plenty of room for lots of pens/ markers, post-its, big glue stick, scissors, washi tape, ruler, etc. (I have all of those things and more in mine!)  The outside pockets have a little gap on the sides where the flap doesn't quite cover the depth of the pockets (see photo).  I haven't had anything fall out yet, so it seems like it'll be ok.  If you are worried you could add a bit of velcro there.

On the inside there are two pen loops, and two slim pockets intended to hold the covers of the bible.  I keep my journal inside one of the pockets, and varying items in the other.  The pockets don't hold anything tightly, but it makes your journal not go flying out when you open it.  The inside is quite large, and would hold two of the Leuchtturm journals and still leave room for more.

For the price and features, you can't find a better journal cover.

Note - The flash caused the journal too look very shiny in my photos.  It's not.  The color (minus shine) is represented faithfully.

UPDATE:  It has been almost 6 months since I bought this and it is holding up extremely well.  Very durable.  It holds a ton of stuff, and has been perfect for the purpose of a travel cover for my art journal.",5.0

There are even 2 pen holders on the inside in which they use one for a highlighter. I love that this zips all the way around so they don't lose things out of it and there is a carry handle which is a must! The design is highly functional and I feel it is something they can use for years to come! I even got the backside monogrammed with their names and the product worked perfect for this!",5.0

"These Bible Book Covers make great covers for Boy Scout Handbooks.

The Medium in particular has several extra pockets on the front for scouting doodads.

My son uses the Medium - perfect size for even the ring bound version of the handbook (highly recommend the ring bound over the perfect bound for handbooks - spend the extra dollar or two) - and far preferable (to us) to the velcro closure BSA one (that doesn't have room for much else either).

My son thought, from pictures, that the handle was sissy (you know, purse), but he wouldn't have it without it now (it's a book pack right?)

These are also thicker so there's room - and a left side flap - for a notepad as well as every Scout should have.

These do come in sizes, and Amazon has all three, though from confusing inconsistent entries. So do get the Medium for the Boy Scout Handbook. I bought to try the XL before finding the other sizes. It's pretty big - but I'm a Scout Master - and have already stuffed it with the extra handbooks and field books a leader may use. Recommendation in general for Scouts - Medium.

Perfect fit for the adventure bible. Just wish it came in other colors. We have three boys. And so other colors would be very helpful!,5.0
I love it more than my boy because it really give protection.  And also can put an pencil in the small box.,5.0
Just what my grandson needed,5.0
"Perfect-- we did not have the workmanship issues that others have reported; perhaps one bad batch went out, and that is resolved now? It keeps up with busy and active boys, and is easily washable.",5.0
Makes my 5 year old and 9 year old's life easier. Boys are horrible at carrying anything without damaging it. They love that it has pockets! I feel like this is a MUST have with their Adventure Bibles.,5.0

"Works great for my sons boyscout book, fits great.",5.0
"We purchased this case for my son's Webelo scout book. It's perfect and I'm glad we opted for this case rather than the case offered in that scout store. Pro's: it's army green, has extra pockets on the outside, a carabiner with a compass (that doesn't work properly but looks cool to the user, so I'm happy, and a nice handle.

On the inside, the case is just as nice. It has pockets to hold the cover of the book, of course, but also pencil loops which I am particularly happy about.

Great case.",5.0
"Medium size is slightly too roomy for the Boy Scout handbook, but it works and we love the pockets for keeping advancement paperwork, permission slips, pens and more.",5.0
Fits my sons boy scout book!,5.0
"I am always on the lookout for cool products that also have a practical usage.  My son goes on a lot of Boy Scout campouts.  The boys are always bringing their scout handbooks so they can record and get signed off their new accomplishments.  However all the boys are hard on their handbooks and the notebooks they carry too.  I saw the Zondervan book cover and thought it would be good for a smaller notebook and his Boy Scout handbook, along with some pens/pencils/etc..  I ordered the Zondervan book cover and thanks to Amazon Prime, it only took two days for it to arrive.

The Zondervan book cover is very well made.  It holds the scout handbook in either the front pocket or the inside pocket.  It looks very ""scout-like"" with the greenish color.  The compass is cheap but it actually works! Nice addition!

Overall I feel the Zondervan book cover is a great value.

"I first purchased this cover in pink for my daughter.  Once I realized the excellent quality of this cover I then ordered one for my son.  He is a little bit older than my daughter but it has everything he needs in a bible cover including space for a note pad, two pen slots, and two pockets in the front.

My son loves it! Plenty of room to hold spiral Boy Scout handbook and more. The only thing that could make it more amazing is to have the big pocket on the outside zip shut in addition to the Velcro closure.,5.0

Great product. Sturdy for kids and they love the extra pocket.,5.0
We bought this for our son to go with his new Adventure bible as a baptism gift. He really loves it. It looks like a little back pack but it is a bible cover. I was worried that the bible would just slide into this but it zips all the way around so it is an actual cover. Great price and super glad we purchased it for him.,5.0

My son loves it! It fits his Adventure Bible perfectly AND has room in the pocket for little things he brings home from Sunday School,5.0
"I got this one because of all the other reviews that said it was a good size for the Boy Scout manual. I agree. It's so much nicer than the one in the Scout Ship, since this one has pockets on the outside and even comes with a little compass. The outer meet pocket is good for pencils or random papers, and the inside is plenty large enough to hold either the spiral bound handbook or the regular spined version. It has an outer handle that also makes it easier for him to carry, and it's a good forest green color which it's about the same shade as his uniform pants.",5.0
"perfect, durable, what more could you want.  It holds a lot more than the book too:  small notebook, merit badge papers, blue cards, etc.  Not big enough for the proper merit badge booklets, but print outs.",5.0
Fits my sons Scout book and 8in tablet. Still tons of room for others things. I love all little pockets and handle for easy carry.,5.0

This is PERFECT for my son's Boy Scout handbook. Holds pencil/pens and small notepad-great!,5.0
"Purchased this or my sons Boy Scout book. Awesome book cover with plenty of pockets and room for pens, pencils, his compass, and small notepad! The only drawback is the cover does not have any kind of retention system for a book to stay in the cover. Seeing how the boy scout book was the spiral bound, I punched 2 holes in the top and bottom of the spine of the cover and ran some 550 cord through the cover and the spiral of the book. Stays in place now. That would be the ONLY thing I would change on this, some sort of book retention inside the cover.",5.0
"Perfect for both my Cub Scout and Boy Scout!  They like that they can store a pencil or any extra papers, patches, cards, etc..",5.0
This bag is verstile to carry anything and protect it from Bibles to expensive books to concealed weapons to cameras radios what ever you need to transport safely and covertly.,5.0

I bought this cover for my 10 year old girl.  She really liked it! Her Bible fits perfectly and we made a cute journal notebook to take with it.  Very pleased.,5.0
The Bible cover was perfect for my son.  It is royal blue.  It has a pocket that is perfect for a small size notebook and a pencil in the spiral of the notebook.  It can also hold a small size coloring book and colored pencils.  The front pocket can hold several of the Dover Little Activity Books.  Now my son can carry his Bible and his church entertainment!,5.0
"GREAT Bible cover for my pre-teen boy.  This has been thrown around, sat on, slid across the youth room, spilled on, buried under heaps of (___?), and who knows what else.  And has come through it all shockingly well!  It's a pretty tough canvas material, and can be wiped clean when needed.  The full size pocket on the front is perfect for a study guide, book, or journal, and the pen pocket ensures that he has a pencil handy.  Don't even ask what he keeps in the 2 small pockets.  (Trinkets, treasures, whatever.)  The handle makes it wonderfully convenient to swing it around at his brother's head -- in self-defense, of course, -- but the handle is still firmly attached and shows no sign of coming loose.  All in all, a sound investment to protect what he will hopefully one day come to cherish.  Until then, I'll settle for keeping it intact.",5.0
"Works perfectly for my son's Boy Scout handbook, with plenty of room for a few extras.",5.0

"I got this for my son's Boyscout book, fits perfect and protects it during camp outs. He liked the compass and extra pockets for anything else he might need like his whittling chip, small notebook, and pen.",5.0
Kids loved it.,5.0
"I purchased for my son who is in Boy Scouts.  He really likes this cover quite a bit - better than what you can find at the Scout Shop for sure.  He has a nice Tritium compass already so relocated the compass that came with this to his first aid / survival kit.  He also got his name embroidered on the top flap.

Parent perspective: Construction quality is good.  There could have been a little more care taken in the cut of the fabric as the ""grains"" don't line up nicely with the edges, but it's a minor nit.  Overall the item is doing the expected / intended job quite well and I can honestly say I would recommend to other parents of Scouts.",5.0

My husband was so thrilled with the quality and purchase.  At the last meeting, the Scout Master's wife was checking out the book cover...she was very intrigued. :)",5.0
Perfect fit for my son's boy scout handbook.,5.0
"Got this for my son to keep his BSA handbook in, as other reviews had said it was good size for it. Love the case. Love the extra pockets and pouches for notebook, pens and a few little extras. Handle makes for convenient carry. The compass I thought would feel plasticky and cheap, but was pleasantly suprised that it seemed fairly sturdy!  The size is a pretty loose fit for his handbook, so if the book slide, the covers can slip out of the pockets. I don't know if the smaller cover would fit the book,but in either case, this is not a fault of the cover itself, as it never claimed to be made to fit my specific book.",5.0
"As a newly minted Boy Scout, my son was ecstatic to receive the Compass Med protector for his Boy Scout Handbook. Given that the Handbook must be taken to every meeting, event, and camp-out, the Compass Med will help buffer the wear-and-tear.

Positives
- Thick sturdy zipper that won't tear out
- Multiple front pockets that fit writing utensils, badge cards, money, etc.
- Camo coloring that matches the Boy Scout color themes

Negatives
- Slightly too big for a Boy Scout Handbook (not really a negative since it is intended for the ""Bible"")

My son loves the product so much that it will be the birthday present of choice for all Boy Scout friends.",5.0
Bought this for my son's boy scout book after seeing another with it. Small pockets for miscellaneous  items and it even comes worth a compass,5.0
"Perfect fit for my boys Scout book (spiral bound). It has two half size pockets on each side and a pen or pencil holder on both sides. Try full height outside pocket with Velcro flap is handy. The two buttoned pockets are of ""what not"" size. Overall good product. Now to see if will stand up to time.....",5.0
"This is a quality made Bible case, I had bought a cheaper camo one and the zipper broke within a week.  This case is very durable and the zipper is thick and tough.  The extra pockets and compass are very handy bonus. This fits my son's NKJV Bible perfectly.",5.0
"We are able to fit a regular sized Boy Scout handbook (not spiral bound), plus a leather journal for him to write anything else he needs for the merit badges he's working on. There is still room to put any other papers in there that he might need without there being too much room. It's not too big at all.",5.0

"Purchased Nov 2015 - My 12 year old son is in the boy scouts and when this product arrived, I gave it to him to open the package. He was thrilled when he saw it. This cool book cover comes with a compass carabiner, holds his official boy scout handbook, pen, money, compass, knife, and it also has mini pockets for plenty of other tiny trinkets he likes to carry. My son still carries this with him to the weekly scout meetings and it's been on camping trips and held up just fine for over a year now. It has been a really good and useful product I definitely recommend it for anyone in the scouting world. Was this review helpful?",5.0
"7 year old loves this cover, it's sturdy and fits his adventure bible NIrV great",5.0
"I purchased this for my son's Boy Scout book with spiral binding and it fits inside just right. There is also a bit of extra room to put a small notebook/planner/phonebook type booklet inside with it. It zips shut and then on the front there are a bunch of various sized pockets to store various items. My son can keep pens, a small bottle of hand sanitize, his pocket knife, some band aides and a few other things in these pockets so that he is prepared at troop meetings. The color also blends well with his uniform and he has gotten a lot of compliments from other boys and parents. The mom bonus for me is that his book isn't all dirty and falling apart like some of the other boys books! I found out quickly that the boys bring them but often toss them around, or if they see them laying around they have no problem stepping on them while running around playing. Even the older boys that should known better. For some reason they do this will plain books but not with bags or covered books so this helps to protect the book from him and the other boys!",5.0
"As others have stated, we use it for a Scout handbook cover. It is working great and allows room for him to carry stuff around.",5.0
Excellent product except for the compass which didn't seem to know which direction to go. Should leave it off.,5.0

"perfect for a boy scout hand book, zipps up a the way around to keep it from getting bumped up.",5.0
"I'm using this for a cover for a Boy Scout handbook for my son and I love it.  It protects the book completely, he's gotten a ton of compliments on it, and it conveniently holds a pen, and the merit badges I haven't had a chance to sew on yet.  Plus the compass actually works - bonus.  He also loves the carry handle.  All in all, this is a way better choice than the ""official"" cover they sell in the Scout store, which does not zip closed and therefore leaves the pages / sides of the book open to the elements.  The Medium size cover fits the Scout book well.",5.0
"This is just a tiny bit big for my son's BSA scout handbook with spiral bidning but it works great. HE is able to organize all this paperwork and blue cards, and carry pens in the front pouch. The compass part is silly, but who cares. I really like this cover.",5.0
"My son is a first year Boy Scout. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews and bought the Size Small book cover, rather than the Medium. It is slightly too large, but I am sure in time it will be filled with Boy Scout papers. The book cover itself is awesome.",5.0
"This zippered cover is GREAT!  SOOO Much better than what is available at the Boy Scout store.  My son is HARD on things in general, and the zipper on the accessory pouch came off the manual we bought at the Scout store within a couple of months.  We bought the nicer of the two covers they had too.  The velcro closure was hard to keep closed after a year or so.

This cover is very durable, has a better zipper, is a perfect fit, and has more pockets for extra stuff (blue cards, pens, compass, etc.  Would HIGHLY recommend for any Boy Scout to protect his manual.  Buying on Amazon was also easy as usual.

Suggestion to Scouts & parents of Scouts:
Buy this cover FIRST for your Scout manual and don't waste your money on what they sell at the Boy Scout store.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"My son is using this for his Boy Scout handbook at it absolutely wonderful.  Holds handbook, roster, notepad, pen, pencil, a small first aid kit and even his camera. It was so well received that some other boys in his patrol got it as well.",5.0
Bought this to be used as a cover/holder for my son's BSA handbook.  I ordered the medium size and it was the perfect fit it.  The only very minor issue was the compass that came with the cover is a little hard to use.  The floating disk doesn't float as freely as I would expect nice compasses to move.  Need to jiggle it for a while to allow it to really settle at the correct reading.  Didn't buy the product for the compass so still 5 stars from me.,5.0
Great for son's scout book.  Lots of pockets for all of the stuff he seems to need to carry around all of the time.,5.0
"Bought this for my son's boy scout handbook.

Feb 2017 update
This is an extremely durable book cover and has held up very well over the past 3 years.  My son received it at age 11, and has used the book cover for troop meetings, campouts out and summer camp.  No tears, the zipper works great, and the velcro and snaps are intact.",5.0
I bought this for my son's Boy Scout handbook and it fit perfectly (bounded not ringed). He is able to also keep a small notebook and pen inside. The two pockets on the front are perfect for storing badges until we get them sewed on. Works very well!,5.0
"I purchased this for my son's Boy Scout manual. It fits fine and has several extra pockets for other accessories. I had sprayed my son's book cover with some ""Never Wet"" moisture repellent and it is now pretty much water proof. Several other Boy Scouts asked where to get it and bought some for themselves. It's a wonderful little cover/organizer.",5.0
bought this as a Arrow of Light crossover gift for my Cub Scout going to Boy Scouts. Fits his book perfect with room for a small notebook and loose papers also. He loves that he can throw all his blue cards and things in it zip it shut and toss it in his tent and nothing gets lost. Great Scout gift. Hope it last him though Eagle!,5.0
I bought this for 11 year old to keep safe his boy scout spiral handbook. It fits perfectly and has exact room to keep pen etc,5.0
"Bought this for my son who is a Boy Scout, he has used this to carry his Boy Scout book, a small notebook and pens.  It has been on many camping trips and is still in great shape.  It is also stylish enough that kids will WANT to use it.  The ""compass"" is a novelty and all but useless--but no points off for that!",5.0
I do not Know how it is or was look at the order and it will tell you it went write to the recipient. not my home. Ask her as we are no longer specking as to the things  she pulled on facebook  right after I ordered this book for her  child for her and had it sent directly to her home thank goodness she paid for it. thank you and I am very sorry I was not able to provide much more info.,1.0
"Did not anyone see something disturbing about a little friend that gets locked in the laundromat at night, and there appears a strange man who plays with the bear, then removes his clothing washes them and then redresses the little bear friend. Well, given today's social climate regarding this type of exposure to strangers, perhaps we should reconsider this outdated story line as inappropriate for our little innocent ones.",1.0
"I hate this book. I LOVE the original Courduroy but this sequel irritates the living daylights out of me. As far as I can tell the world which Courduroy inhabits is supposed to be *somewhat* realistic - and in the original book, it is. But in this one, the caricature of the artist (in a beret? REALLY?!) is just painfully clunky, as is the name of the Hispanic-owned laundromat (""Pandro's"").  *sigh*  Since I have read it approximately a billion times, little things become impossible to ignore, like the fact that Lisa's mom tells her the laundromat is ""about to close"" but the artist has time to run an entire dryer cycle before the manager says the place is closing. And if Courduroy is too precious to get lost, shouldn't it be LISA'S name on the little card in his pocket?  It's all very sloppy and undermines any residual charm left over from the first book.  I am SO disappointed and this book might ""accidentally"" fall into the fireplcace aaaaaany day now.",1.0
"My wife and I as well as our daughter loved the original Corduroy book. We began reading this book to our daughter when she was three and a half and didn't notice anything wrong with it. Very soon after introducing the book, our daughter began having terrible anxiety about being dropped off at a children's group that she'd always loved before. Suddenly it occurred to me that it was probably the book. Lisa takes Corduroy with her to a laundromat and Corduroy wanders away into a stranger's laundry bag. Lisa and her mother have to leave without Corduroy, and the stranger throws Corduroy into a dryer. He doesn't start the machine but pulls Corduroy out and undresses him to dry the bear's overalls. Corduroy waits with this stranger, undressed, while his overalls dry. Then the stranger puts Corduroy's clothes back on and puts him up on a shelf. The attendant turns out all the lights and Corduroy is left all alone in the dark, abandoned by his loved ones, locked in a strange place. He gets into some mischief and seems to enjoy himself, but as another reviewer mentioned, the drawings reflect the darkness of a closed laundromat and it looks pretty scary. Can't believe we didn't realize the effect the book could have on a three year old until it was too late. We've been dealing with this issue for a couple of months now and it's breaking our hearts.",1.0
"Purchased this because I had bought a Zondervan LG cover and was very pleased with the construction. The LG cover was heavy canvas and lined with a nice nylon inside ( see pictures on a review of a similar item in XL size Black). This is rough cheaper canvas, front pocket does not zipper as picture shows, very flimsy construction. Have also ordered another cover and when rec'd will probably return this XXL one.",1.0
The handle is tearing away from the nylon fabric after only a few uses.  The handle should be reinforced so that children using them doesn't end in a whole or torn handle.,1.0
My daughter and I were very wxcited about this purchase but when it arrived it was too small. We looked at the dimensions online and thought it would be the correct width. When it arrived it was much too small for her bible. Super disappointed. Otherwise it was perfect! Great if you have a smaller bible.,1.0
It's a little to big for the very Bible it was intended for.  The Bible will not stay in place and falls out.,1.0
"This is a terrible cover for a Scout Handbook. I do not get all the good reviews.
The book does not stay inside and it feels really cheap.
We are disappointed with this purchase and can't recommend it.",1.0
Too small for my Bible which is a huge bummer.,1.0
"The bible cover has a nice pouch in front, but lacks a bookmark that comes with every other bible cover.  This was tolerable.  However, within 3 Sundays of using the cover, the strap tore right off.  This is completely unacceptable.  I do not recommend anyone purchasing this cover.",1.0
I ordered this Bible cover to replace one of the same manufacture that my some had used for over three years. This one however only lasted a week before the thin vinyl where the hand strap is located ripped from the inside because the heavier plastic handle backing cut right through. I will not purchase another that is not made of heavier fabric material,1.0
I really like the organizer.  I had a hard time finding one with a over the shoulder strap.  It has places to store different things.,1.0
Wasn't what I expected from description and I returned it with dissatisfaction.,1.0
We ordered it not realizing that something like a Bible cover would come in different sizes. It was an XL and waaay to big for my grandsons Bible. We reordered a mEdium but they are out of stock. We have returned the XL and are waiting to see if more come in in the mEdium size. So as of now my grandson has no Christmas gift from me. ,1.0
Handle tears off easily.,1.0
"It looks great but the handle wripped off after not much use. I would love to get a replacement because maybe it was defective, but it says it is past the return/exchange date. I hope the seller will contact me. It was my son's and he is very disappointed",1.0

I bought this cover for my husband and within a month the faux leather ripped near the handle. You'd think they would have a canvas backing inside to make it sturdier. It's just sewn through cheap plastic.",1.0
"Poor craftsmanship.  Flimsy zipper, expect it to fall apart in only a few months.  One of two pen-holders was torn out of the box.  Zondervan is giving a bad name to Christianity with this product.",1.0
Only carried a month and strap tour,1.0
Was not big enough for my bible,1.0

LOOKS LIKE PLASTIC!!!

WOULDN'T PURCHASE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND TO OTHERS!!!",1.0
Very disappointed in the look! It did not have a leather look It has a terrible plastic-look. I was going to give it as a gift but was to ashamed of how it looked!,1.0
"Misleading information.  This is not extra large as advertised.
We will keep it to hold a smaller bible.  This is the problem with buying online, you need to be able to trust what is said.",1.0
"I still love the way the cover looks, but after about 7 months of use (weekly carrying to church on Sunday/Wednesday) the handle broke.  Where it is sewn on it came apart - it was as if the thread when stitched had cut the material and it just ""cut"" through it over time.  I was very disappointed and was hoping for him to get more use than this out of it.
The rest of the case was in perfect condition, with little to no wear on it.  This was definitely something that was faulty in the manufacturing of the case.

---OLD REVIEW---
Purchased for my husband at Christmas and he absolutely loved it. The picture doesn't do it justice. It's very rugged looking, and it feels like a nicely worn leather. It's not flimsy at all, and perfect for his bible. Has a deep pocket on the outside, and pen holders on the inside. I am very pleased with the purchase I made, and the price was very reasonable.",1.0

Not what I expected and he strap was never sent. Disappointing for me.,1.0
"It was too big for my purposes, so I returned it. Probably fine for those who need anything this big.",1.0
This is so cute.  I wish I could have kept it. But my child's standard size Adventure Bible swims in this case and the Bible will get wrecked in a case like this.,1.0

"I was sad that on the first time I used this item, the handle tore. :(",1.0
Definitely not leather. Do not buy. I bought one just like it at Sams Club. Piece of junk. Lasted for 6 months and tore right where the handle was,1.0
"This was the greatest distortion of the TRUTH I  have ever seen. This was described as EXTRA LARGE!

"This is NOT leather, but  cheap embossed plastic.  I had it on my wish list and received it for a present. However, it is going back.  It is not the nice dark, rich wine color either.

"Is this truly genuine leather that you have printed a design on? I was sold another genuine leather Bible cover that was as plastic as it could be. Leather does not stretch and then pop off and it smelled just like plastic. A Bible cover. Please tell if this is genuine leather or plastic. You give no more information on it being made of leather in your extended description, I thought that very odd, not even it was made of man made materials (plastic) nothing. Like omission could be your defense ,keep them thinking it's made of leather. I hope I veiw it later with a more descipt description and others remember the old standing rule about advertising when they post their wares. God be with you.",1.0
"Even though the description stated it would fit, this is too small for my wife's Zondervan Bible and it is not made of leather. Amazon Customer Service gets 5 Stars. When informed of the problems with the product, they promptly issued a refund to my credit card for the purchase price and sent a printable return label and return authorization. As always, great service from Amazon.",1.0
Zondervan. .. via Amazon suggested this cover to go with their extra large print Bible...it is not large enough,1.0
"The cover needs to be made a smiggin larger. Could not get the covers to lie flat in the front and back pockets. So I thought I would not put the front and back of the bible in the pockets, but when I did that, I could not get it zipped.  Sent it back.",1.0

I did not find any leather in this Bible Cover.  I do like the purse style and believe it is easier on the spine of large study Bibles.  However I wanted a leather cover and returned these because they were not a discribed.  Amazon was very gracious to give me a full refund and pay for all shipping.,1.0
Reptile leather is really cheap-looking plastic. I could tell that the bits of plastic that held the handles was not going to last. Returned for refund.,1.0

text book for someone else- few years ago,1.0
where to start well I guess it would be the quoted very good condition which was a lie. the package arrived without being sealed and having little to no tape on it. the back cover of the book is near falling off and the front cover is not far behind. it is missing many pages including the first 18 pages and the pages that it did have are either written on or bent. if I didn't need it for the rest of my course I would send it back but I cant.,1.0
"I ordered the book. I knew it was a used book but I had no idea pages were missing. Not only am out the money I paid for this book. I had to buy another book.
Have a good day.",1.0
Did not hold the children's attention.  Too busy of a book.  Did not care for it at all.,1.0
"I borrowed this one from the library because I'm teaching my 2 year old the alphabet. It's nice that it features lowercase letters, but it isn't educational at all. It is a simple story with letters as characters. Little i loses its dot and the other letters help. Nothing about the sounds the letters make except one page where each letter finds an object to replace the dot and they each pick something that starts with their letter. But there is nothing in the text about that, it is only shown in the picture. The object that Little i likes best is the cherry, which doesn't even make the sound that a new letter learner knows for c. The story is not great, it is not educational at all, and for me, the computer graphics are not appealing. I would never use this book in my classroom, and won't be reading it to my daughter again.",1.0
I can't believe this product is priced at over 170.00 who would pay that much it is more like ten dollars.,1.0
this is not what the description says about it. you need to laminate them youself and figure out a way to attach the piecesfeel like this is not a finished producti would return it but it my son already tear it. not recommened but unless they lower the price,1.0
"Incomplete, no way to attach numbers, days, ect to the house. It requires a bulletin board to use. We were unaware of this and couldn't be more disappointed.",1.0
"If you're looking for something high quality don't get this. It's a piece of paper. It wasn't well wrapped in the packing and was just shoved in the box. The box was wet upon arrival and the paper was mostly ruined. I'm unable to use it in my classroom. Wish I had gone with something better quality. It looks better in the picture than it does in person, especially when wet and wrinkled and doesn't come with the necessary items to attach the arrow (that I have to cut out on my own). For what I paid for it I definitely expected more. My kids like it and like the look of it. It's just not sturdy enough for a classroom. I'm going to have to attach cardboard to the back and hope I can iron it flat now that it's dry. Not sure how long it will last. Also have to go shopping to get something to somehow attach the arrow so that it will turn when the kids change the weather each day. Ugggh. NOT my best buy. Don't recommend it. It looks great, just not high enough quality for a classroom, especially one with younger kids (K - 2nd grade).",1.0
I'm very upset because it was very wrinkled inside the package.,1.0
"why are these stories soo short $$$$$.
Going to the library....",1.0
"I have found 8 places in one medium sized city who sells these at a much lower price. I wish I could return and get different books.  I have had these a long time but was saving them for when my granddaughter was old enough to enjoy them.  Then, I kept seeing them everywhere for much less.",1.0
flimsy. don't waste your money.,1.0
At least three pages are inked out with black ink and we can't fully enjoy the book. It would've been better to buy in person to ensure none of the printed pages were damaged. Buyer beware.,1.0
The seller was fine but this book is so cheaply made it won't last a week. The paper was so this it looked like a stapled booklet. SHAME ON SCHOLASTIC! If you want this book for your child or grandchild then. Uy the board book version. The story is nearly the same. I bought it at BAM yesterday.,1.0
If you are planning to use this on Kindle - forget it. Especially on ipad..it puts two pages on wide format. Everything is soooo tiny and you can't magnify it. Horrible job at conversion to kindle,1.0

"This book was not designed by a very bright person which is a bit disconcerting because it's supposed to educate your child.  The tracing pages are fine, but when you get to the pages where the child is supposed to cut through the paper, the publisher printed lessons on both sides of the page.  For example, one page instructs the child to cut along jagged lines and the flip side of the page instructs the child to color in squares and then cut them out.  How can they do both?  You have to choose one page or the other.  This is the case on pages 26-48.  Dumb, Dumb, Dumb.
They should say in the description that you need to photo copy the whole second half of the book so the cutting lessons can be performed.",1.0
1 star for calendar being cut in half.  It's in two pieces.  You'll have to tape it together and have it laminated so it can stay as one whole piece on the wall. Which will be more money out of pocket. Overall the holiday / Birthday pieces are great! Not happy with this transaction or this item.,1.0
"Very disappointed.  Calendar comes in 2 pieces, split right down the middle of the Wednesday column.  So, I had to tape them together and then laminate but it still looks ""off"".  The squares are also a bit smaller than every calendar date add-on that I already had so it's very cramped.",1.0
I ordered this product hoping to use it for many occassions in my classroom.  Upon receiving the product it was nothing more than tagboard cutouts glued to large popsicle sticks.  Would have been nice if Scholastic could have at least laminated them.  I was hoping they would be wood cut outs to withstand being used many times by both myself and my students.  I wouldn't pay for these ever again.  I could easily print an image and laminate and glue a popsicle stick to it for much less.,1.0

"I bought this for my toddler to use. He has used the magnetic part and that works great.

"Great price for a truly beatiful map--but buy it at a brick and morter store, especially if you want to mount it for display. Ordered my first one from Amazon and found a crushed triangular cardboard box on my doorstep. The rolled map sustaind heavy creases. Shame on UPS I figured. My bad luck. And I wasn't interested in spending time and hassle to request a replacement and ship it back considering it is a ten dollar item.

The map is packaged very poorly by the manufacturer in my opinion. A loose roll of this pretty but lightweight parchment-looking paper in a flimsy plastic container. Would protect fine hanging from a display peg in a shop. But, the real issue is the way Amazon packages it in a three-sided flimsy cardboard box. Any weight from other heavy packages during transit can and will wreck the map even if the crushed cardboard isn't torn.

So several months go buy and I add another one to an order qualifying for free shipping. Only gambling 10 bucks--surely lightening won't strike twice.  Wrong! I open my door in time to see the truck drive off and a torn, mangled box sits on my porch with another creased map inside.

Obviously this long thin box has been ""folded"" in half somewhere along the line---rendering a map too damaged to be mounted and displayed. Now I see that this has been an issue with Amazon for some time. Sigh.",1.0

"The map looks just fine, but Amazon shipped it in a plastic bag. With no protection, it arrived badly crushed and bent, completely unusable. Amazon did replace it promptly, but this time used a flimsy cardboard box that still didn't protect it from damage. On a third attempt, also very prompt, they didn't even use the plastic bag, and it was badly damaged again. I appreciate the quick turnaround on the original order and the replacements, but it is absolutely ridiculous that a rolled-up laminated map would be packed for shipping without a protective tube (or without even a box, in two cases). I gave up on Amazon and will purchase it somewhere else. It looks like a nice map.",1.0
"The first time this map was delivered, it was crushed and flattened  as it was NOT shipped in a mailing tube...just a plastic wrapper. Amazon customer service was very responsive and sent out a second map...that also came without a mailing tube despite my asking that it be shipped in one. Alas, I had to return the second one as well. Looks like a nice map but I will have to find it locally. I cannot understand why Amazon cannot ship this product properly.

When the shipping container arrived it was crumpled at one end, and apparently got wet, as when I opened it the bottom portion of the map was damp and crumpled.  When I removed the map from the shipping tube there were several spots where the map look like something had been stuck to it and pulled off.  (Like when tape is removed from cardboard and the surface sticks to the tape.)  Unfortunately, I ordered through a third party vendor.  I am trying to get a hold of them to get a refund.  I will stick with National Geographic maps since they do use high quality lamination.  I would not purchase another Rand McNally wall map.",1.0

I couldn't figure out what the size of this thing was and the 31.5"" size indication with other ridiculous numbers is the height - so beware this thing is BIG. approx. 60"" wide and 32"" tall. Besides the size problem the map looks faintly printed and feels really cheap in general. It's not what I would call ""laminated"" more like ""coated with a nano layer of plastic"". Also, the slightest accidental bending while handling this huge map will likely leave a permanent crease or wrinkle in the map. Returned!",1.0

Clearly, whomever was responsible for packaging the map I ordered was far beyond incompetent.  Rather than using a shipping tube or some type of box designed for shipping posters, this person hastily taped two boxes together and slapped the shipping label on the outside.  My map arrived bent in the middle and damaged on both ends.  It was almost more trouble to repackage the item and send it back than the $12 price tag warranted.  At least the replacement item was in perfect condition, second time's a charm.  The map is exactly what I wanted and has plastic poster hanger things along the top and bottom that slide off.

"I'm sure that it's a great calendar. However, upon arrival, the packaging clearly stated ""FLAME RETARDANT.""

Really?? Flame retardant on a children's calendar?? What are you thinking, Scholastic? Flame retardants are extremely hazardous to everyone's health, and especially to young children! Did you know that young children typically have as much as four times as many flame retardant chemicals in their blood than do their parents? And that these retardants have been linked to all kinds of health issues?

I have been careful to avoid having flame retardants in my home, in my children's pajamas, and so on. Therefore, I didn't even bother to open the package. I just don't want my children using and handling something that has flame retardants on it.

I am extremely disappointed that a calendar which is being used by young children would have flame retardants on it.

On another note, I weighed out the options of the various calendar pocket charts on Amazon before settling on this one. After doing another search after purchasing it, I discovered this same calendar on several other sites for significantly less. If you still want this one even with the flame retardants, at least shop around first.",1.0

ONLY because my business is PANDA themed I went the extra mile and did not return this item. These pieces are NOT laminated and are on thinish paper so if you want to use this really for anything you have to take it to Staples or somewhere like that and have them put them on large sheets of lamination which cost me $30 + and then you have to cut the pieces out and then carefully locate how and where you want pieces to stick and then add on your own Velcro which is more cost.,1.0

In addition, all of the heroes of this self-help book/planner are CEOs, so it's bro-y capitalism the authors of this ""journal"" are touting.

She couldn't understand what I was saying after 5 minutes of me explaining what I wanted her to do. Instead she kept prodding for my personal information to register for a device!
I asked to speak to someone else for better customer service and assistance. Her response: No, you can speak with me.
I honestly do not have the patience to rant about my unsatisfactory assistance. I'd also like to mention that I sent them an email which was responded to about two weeks later.

"Look, you have to buy this because it's required for your class. It's expensive, it's unreliable, it breaks after 1 week of use (usually).

Here's a couple of tips:
1. Cover the serial number with nail polish, it will keep that scratch-off ink from disappearing so you cant sell it back.
2. If it doesn't work, check the batteries and slap it against your hand, if that doesn't work, turn it over and slap it against your hand. Keep repeating until it can either turn on or turns on automatically.
3. To change the channel, Hold down the ""ON/OFF"" key for a few seconds until it blinks, if the two digit code you type in is correct, the light will blink green.
4. DO NOT pack this anywhere it can get even light shocks, I like to keep it in the side pocket of my backpack since it cannot be hit there very easily.
5. Sell it back early, many students will try to sell it at the end of the semester so the price will drop dramatically. After the last in-class quiz (Check the syllabus or talk to the professor) run to the nearest bookstore or throw it up on eBay.
6. DO NOT BUY THE EXPENSIVE ""2.0"" version! This one works just fine (as long as your instructor allows it)

cool color, fast shipping

Why not just have people raise their hands like back in the good old days? Also, the website for iclicker SUCKS. I challenge you to go on their website right now and browse through it; try clicking through different links. I just did when I was registering my iclicker and I noticed several links that directed users to the wrong page. Lastly, they have you register your clicker with a little flimsy sticker on the back of the clicker that easily falls off and if you lose it you are screwed. They have a ""tool"" to look up your number if the sticker falls off, but it doesn't even work. Overall, this is an overpriced piece of garbage.

Be warned, it is a VERY cheap feeling piece of plastic that is made in China.  The LED lights bleed through the other LED light openings, the plastic mold isn't precise, the plastic is literally the same stuff they make disposible silverware out of.  The button springs each feel different and off... meaning the clicking mechanism built into the clicker is inprecise and will be very prone to failure.

This device was made with zero quality control or care in China out of the cheapest plastic made.  I would be suprised if it cost over $1 in total to make.  Yet students are charged nearly $40 for it.

"First off The Clicker works like it's suppose to, No problem there.

My problem is the thought of even buying a clicker in addition to the power it gives rude professors.

The price is way too high for a device that no college should ever use. I can understand using this in preschool, but not college. When did a 30 cent Scantron become outdated?  Great what's next in the money making schemes against college students?

One thing that this device does is puts the power in the hands of an instructor. For example, with a scantron, the professor hands out the test and you take the test at your own speed. However, with this junk, it allows arrogant and incompetent professors the ability to walk into the classroom and say TAKE OUT YOUR Clickers you have 20 seconds to answer question number one on the projector!!! After 20 seconds, question number one is blacked out. Ok Class, you have 15 seconds to answer question number 2 on the projector. etc etc. It takes me 15 seconds to read the question, let alone read it and chose the correct answer so this was a big problem for me, even though I passed the class with a good grade. This way of test taking is not acceptable and in my opinion it makes money off of college students while also supplying ammo for not so nice professors. Remember college is a business(worthy of fortune 500 status) that likes to see students repeat the same courses for extra money. Devices like this can help a professor and school dictate the ""Grade Curve"" that many colleges predict their students to fall in.

"This is the third year in a row that I have bought a Dilbert page-a-day calendar. I love the Dilbert comics and being able to wake up every day and read one in the morning is very enjoyable. It's always good to start your day with a smile. I loved the Dilbert calendars I used for the past couple years.

However this years calendar is beyond horrible. It looks like it was designed by a three year old and was then outsourced to China for printing and assembly. I will explain:

1. Craftsmanship - When I got the calendar in the mail, I took it out and tried to set it up. The cover and binder promptly fell off the calendar, it now has the glue backing that the pages are stuck to exposed on the top. Since the calendar attached to the plastic stand with sticky glue on the back cover, the calendar doesn't ""stick"" to the plastic stand anymore, since it only has the glue and pages left.

2. Where's Sunday? - For whatever illogical and inconceivable reason, they removed Sunday from the calendar. They combined the weekends into one page, so now you have pages for ""Mon"", ""Tue"", ""Wed"", ""Thu"", ""Fri"", ""Sat/Sun"". I can't understand why they did this. The whole reason I use page-a-day calendars is because I can never remember what the date or day of the week is. It is only through the habit of removing a page every morning that I have any clue what month/day/year I am living in. I'm serious. I don't keep track of time like other people do. So combining the weekends like this really throws me off.

3. The Font - The old Dilbert calendars had an easy to read font for the date and day of the week. They used a bold black font on a white background, something that everyone is accustomed to and can read easily. Now they have a thinner black font with a white highlight on a lime green background. It actually is harder to read, especially when you wake up in the morning. The obnoxious orange seal on the bottom right of every page with Scott Adams name only adds to the visual aggravation.

To conclude, the calendar is in almost every way horrible. I love the Dilbert strips, and the strips are the only enjoyable thing about this. I will be shopping around for another page-a-day calendar to use, and probably won't buy another Dilbert one. I think one of these days when I am bored I will go through and read all the strips in this one, and then throw it out.",1.0
"Hey Scott Adams, I have a great idea for a Dilbert strip where Dilbert unboxes his new calendar and sees that saturday and sunday are now combined into one page. I can't think of a punchline, I'll leave that to you--you're the pro at this!

I actually clicked on the one star reviews just to see what kind of whiner would generate a 1 star review. I'm glad I did so I didn't have to buy this calendar. I refuse to buy this calendar until Sunday comes back.",1.0
"What happened to this calendar??  Did the pointy-haired boss make it?  was it outsourced to Elbonia??  either way, this is the WORST Dilbert calendar I can remember.  As soon as I opened it I got excited to see everything in color.  Then I actually looked at the first page, only to find Saturday and Sunday are now just one comic.  Which means 52 less comics AND no extended Sunday comic.  Then I noticed there is no daily extra on the back.  There were days I enjoyed that as much the comic. And this was all before I even set the calendar on my desk.  Believe it or not, it got worse.  As soon as I put the calendar on the desk, it fell apart.  So now I have a poor quality calendar with less comics and less info then last year.  HUGE disappointment.

Last years calendar would have gotten 5 stars from me.  This years has less comics and less extras.  So I dropped it to 2-3 stars.

And the whole thing fell apart the moment i got it out the box. Terrible - what happened? What were they thinking when they took a great product and reduced it to this, was the pointy haird boss involved this year?

The only plus - 4 day delivery from US to UK, it's beaten my Amazon UK orders, that were placed on the same day!

The pages of the calendar are in no way connected to the backing.  To display the calendar, I just have the ""block"" of pages sitting on the ledge of the plastic stand.

"As a canine, I am generally indifferent to that succession of sounds known as music. As far as I'm concerned, it's just more of the day-to-day surface noise that amuses my masters along with the television, the cell phone and whatever appliances they are currently operating.

That said, there is one aspect of the alleged masterpiece under review in which I have a unique perspective: the period of silence at the conclusion of ""A Day in Life"" which supposedly includes a 15-kilohertz high-frequency tone that only dogs can hear. No less an authority than the redoubtable Paul McCartney has stated: ""If you ever play Sgt. Pepper, watch your dog.""

This is, alas, just the kind of information that turns my master into a first class bore, given his incessant interest in the intellectual capabilities of, ahem, the lesser animals, specifically the seven-pound Toy French poodle who is just now trying his paw at musical criticism. No sooner does the old boy read some nonsense on the computer than he has me on his lap, petting me, rubbing my belly -- all fine and well, of course -- and then queuing up the song so the two of us can have a good listen. ""Do you hear anything, Charlie, do you hear anything?"" Of course, I can't hear squat for his yammering, so he plays it over. And over. And over -- mainly because I give the occasional growl, which he soon realizes is just me warding off the mailman's daily terrorist attack.

I can fully understand his hopeful enthusiasm. I'm a poodle, proud member if the second smartest breed, and you'd think if any dog could make head it tail out of Sir Paul's little japery it would be the furry diminutive beast typing up this most brilliant review. Alas, I think I speak for all my four-footed friends in saying these fifteen seconds or so are of no more interest than the rest of the record.

Certainly, it doesn't hold a candle to my own favorite top three songs, all of which feature actual audible barking, and which continue to trip me up every time. At the top of the list, of course, is ""Dogs"" by Pink Floyd, from the art-rock masterpiece Animals. Can't go wrong with that one. Then, of course, there is the demo version of Bob Dylan's ""Every Grain of Sand"" on The Bootleg Series Vols. 1-3 - now there's a dog I'd like to meet. Also, I'm quite taken with the vocal stylings of John Fahey's beloved pooch in ""Poor Boy"" on The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death, whose alert and playful yaps are so distinct that the great guitarist has to ""shhh"" him. Now that, truly, is a dog whose rear end I would sniff heartily.

Sgt. Pepper is, by my master's standards, something on the order of brilliant, and if that's your thing, well, go for it. But dogs and masters looking for a bonding experience are best advised to look elsewhere.",1.0

"While Sgt. Pepper's is one of the most influential and well-crafted pieces of music in the modern era, this CD is to be avoided. To play it on a Windows computer requires the installation of Quicktime, a buggy piece of software that is an open conduit for malware. There are no individual audio tracks on the CD; no .wav files, no MP3s. You must use Quicktime or, on Linux the free and open source VLC player. Even then, the audio breaks up continuously during playback. The whole point appears to prevent you from getting fair use of the music you have purchased. While I have never done so before, with the nefarious and inferior nature of this CD I must recommend you buy the tracks elsewhere or pirate them. This CD is not a standard audio CD, as advertised, and isn't worth the plastic it's burned onto.",1.0

"My copy of SGT Pepper had similar quality problems as described in other reviews -- horrible surface noise, one channel cutting on/off, spindle hole off center so doesn't spin properly.  I returned it -- the second copy better but not great.

Also had similar issues with the White Album.",1.0
"I am sure that a perfectly pressed copy of this is quite wonderful. Unfortunately, mine were not one of those. I say ""mine"" because I have exchanged(3)copies of this already with no luck. I was able to hear side 2 without any issues so I know it can sound great. I have four other titles of this reissue set and I am very happy with those.

The problems with the Pepper album seem to be the same. They all seem to be on side one. Most of the other reviewers have described the same problems.

This is what I think the problem is. Most of the later albums like Pepper, Abbey Road and the White Album are the ones that seem to be having the most problems. I think that the pressing plant over pressed these records on worn stampers because these were going to be the most in demand. This historically has been a problem with hot selling records. No quality control just to get the numbers out. To the manufacturers, its all a numbers game anyway. Back in the 1970's, I had to return 10 copies of Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti before I was able to get a decent one when it first came out.

Once the dust settles, I'm sure a lot of these problems will be resolved and will go away. I am not going to give these reissues a bad rap just because of few bad pressings. I have heard enough of this record to know that I still want it. As soon as I can find another the plays properly, I am going to grab it.

I have been buying these separately to avoid the problems with trying to buy the perfect box set.

Update:

I recently ordered another copy from Amazon,(4th)copy. This was the worst one so far. I am beginning to believe that there isn't a good copy anywhere. I will give it another try before I throw in the towel.

Final Update:

""Praise Be"" I finally was able to get a hold of a good copy of this title, and it sounds good. I was beginning to think that one did not exist.

Although frustrating, I think that Rainbo should get another chance. All the other LP's of this issue that I got were superb. What all this feedback is telling me is that vinyl is truly on a comeback course. A project like this should have been spread out among several of the pressing plants. It's too much for one pressing plant, even for the likes of RTI and others to have the pressure of 100% quality control. I don't know how may vinyl pressings were actually done, but I am sure that it was way more than the normal 5000 to 10000 pressings that a regular reissue might receive. Let hope that if EMI decides to do another ""Mono"" reissue set, they will learn some of the lessons of this and spread the job out a bit.

Mystery Solved?

I had been wondering why I seemed to be the only one having problems with this pressing from the local record shops in my area. Nobody else seem to have the same problems.

 A recent event may have solved this mystery. I recently switched out cartridges and replayed my distorted copy of this record. For what ever reason, this record sounded fine with the different cartridge. The previous cartridge was an Audio Technica fitted with a shibata tip stylus. The new cartridge was a Pioneer fitted with an eliptical tip stylus. Both cartridges are in good working order.

So if you are having problems with the sound on this record and you have a cartridge with a shibata or microline tip, this may be the problem. Those tips may be picking up distortion further down in the groove. You may want to try this out using a different phono cartridge. I would be interest if anyone else comes to the same concludion",1.0

"Something that has kept recurring to me for decades (but I almost always hold my peace ... piece?):

Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band sucks.

... as bad as any disco Bee Gees, ... worse, at least you could dance to that. ... and maybe even get ... uh..lucky. But SPLHCB (jeeze, even the acronym sounds like someone losin' their lunch) is the most overrated crap ever inflicted on the music-buying public - that's millions and millions worldwide. Even me ... and I bought the CD long after I realized this. What a sap!

Let's think about this in an analytical fashion-

1. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
- A jingle, a commercial, but any 60's Fritos commerial has a better hook and more artistic integrity.

2. With A Little Help From My Friends
-The oom-pah begins. Maybe Englishmen liked this kind of crap before they heard Bo Diddly, but this is 1967, c'mon ... pure white bread with a little sugar. Joe Cocker must have recognized its wretchedness and so covered it like Coltrane ripped My Favorite Things. Not buying my bs? ....

Beatles:
[Just listen to any one of the dozen old or ""new"" ""remastered"" releases that we chumps all just keep a-buying.]

Cocker:
[Do a video search for ""Joe Cocker - With a little help from my friends"" just like that, on that popular video site, the URL of which I can't post in a review.]

Case closed on that one. (If you're still unconvinced, you need a lot more help than your friends are likely trained or qualified to give.

3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
-LSD? Lennon's childhood? ... Did Phil Spector sneak into the studio? ...Who cares?

4. Getting Better
-No, it's not. oom-pah, oom-pah, speeded up and accented ...
I'm getting sleepy.

5. Fixing A Hole
- It's warm, it's cozy, I'm asleep.

6. She's Leaving Home
-Okay (yawn). But Dylan said it far better three years earlier in just one line: ""Come mothers and fathers throughout the land, and don't criticize what you can't understand"" ... okay, two lines.

7. Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite
-Really good, ... for when you really need a good dose of circus music.

8. Within You Without You
-Best cut on the album. Damn. George Harrison noodling around on a sitar is the best damn cut on a Beatles album. ...Damn.

9. When I'm Sixty Four
-I guess this oom-pah oom-pah drivel probably WAS appreciated by folks who were 64 in '67, but the rest of us were suckers.

10. Lovely Rita
-Ground-breaking fusion of oom-pah, munchkin music, and wall-of-sound.

11. Good Morning Good Morning
-Finally, entertainment! ...but the entertainment is watching my dog go bat-shite crazy at the animal sounds. Is this a Mc Donald's commercial or something now?

12. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)
- A reprise, yet, for those who didn't get it the first time. Even Hendrix couldn't save this one.

13. A Day In The Life
- A good song. Should have been released as a single - the B-side to Within You Without You.

So, there you have it. Two keepers, 11 jokes.

It was all in the packaging: First album (LP) cover ever great for cleaning reefer. After the brilliant Rubber Soul and Revolver, in 1967, that was enough.

"This band has long since been lauded as the greatest band of their time, but with a closer look at the 60's era of music, it becomes apparent that the Beatles were surrounded by bands that were artistically superior to them. Bands such as The Rolling Stones, The Doors and The Who all displayed greater technical proficiency than The Beatles. The Beatles had some pleasant instrumental passages, but they seem pale in comparison to the transcendental instrumental passage of `Light My Fire' by The Doors. Out of all of their psychedelic music, none of it was as surreal and mind-bending as Pink Floyd's instrumental `Interstellar Overdrive' or Jefferson Airplane's hallucinogenic march-like anthem `White Rabbit'. While other bands used psychedelia as a medium to create powerful and original statements in music, The Beatles merely recycled circus music clichs and molded it into silly pop music such as they did with `Benefit of Mr. Kite'. In terms of lyrics, they seem shallow and dim-witted when contrasted to Dylan's poetry. Their messages were often trite and meaningless and reflected nothing of the revolution that was taken place during that time. Captain Beafheart, with his savage and seemingly demented - bordering on atonal - music of his masterpiece `Trout Mask Replica', painted a vivid picture of the heat of the turbulent revolution during late 60's and is a much more striking statement of that time than anything The Beatles had done. I'm not alone here. The following passage is taken from a review of `Lick My Decals Off' by Lester Bangs - who is undisputedly the greatest American rock critic:

""I'm gonna go not so very far at all out on a limb and say that Captain Beefheart is the most important musician to rise in the Sixties, far more significant and far-reaching than the Beatles, who only made pretty collages with material from the public domain, when you get right down to it""

Out of all the arguments defending The Beatles, I found none of them convincing. Most of these arguments do nothing other than illustrate very minor and insignificant technical innovations - most of which could have been easily done by just about any other descent rock band of the time. Whatever you think of these minor innovations, it doesn't change the fact that The Beatles almost always conformed to the simple verse-chorus-verse format of pop music. They placed their entire emphasis on melodic vocalization - nothing wrong with that in itself, but, with the Beatles music, it all sounds really banal. Their melodic pop songs are, for the most part, only a small step away from `Mary Had a Little Lamb'. Their voices are nice-sounding and agreeable but, to me, their vocal ranges seem very limited and their technical craftsmanship is weak. The music of the Beatles just seems dumbed-down, overly simplistic and - like a like plate of macaroni - it can be consumed without any intellectual strain whatsoever. And I think that's precisely why Beatles have risen to fame. People are taken in too easily by the Beatles `charm' but, with a closer look, it is evident that there is not much depth to their music. Serious art involves a tremendous amount of contemplation. But I wonder what there is to contemplate about with a ridiculous song like `Yellow Submarine'.",1.0

"This really is an awful album from start to finish. For a start, the title is very misleading. I thought I was buying an album called ""Beatles"" by a brass band named ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" only to learn when I got home and played it that it was the opposite!

Then there are the terrible songs, starting with the title track. The best part is the tuning up at the beginning, and then the singer says he's going to introduce us to ""the one and only Billy Shears"", but the song ends before we ever get to hear Billy sing. What a disappointment!! ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" is exactly what Ringo needs to make this song interesting. Not a patch on Joe Cocker's original! Then there is ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"", or LSD in other words. What? A song about pounds, shillings and pence? Give us a break please!! Next is ""Getting Better"". No it's not, it's getting worse! ""Me used to be angry young man. Me hiding me head in the sand""? So you should mate, with appalling grammar like that! ""Fixing A Hole"" next. Only another 3999 to go then if you're fixing it in Blackburn, Lancashire! ""She's Leaving Home"", probably after being given this album as a present by her mum & dad. Give me Billy Bragg's original anytime! ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite"". What sort of title is that? And ""The Hendersons will dance and sing"". Not Dickie Henderson I hope, 'cos he's crap! ""Within You Without You"". Er, without you thanks, George. If I want to listen to this kind of music, I'll go to an Indian restaurant! ""When I'm 64"". Sounds like you already are, Paul, on this jolly old codger's ditty! ""Lovely Rita"". ""Got the bill and Rita paid it""? You tight git!! ""Good Morning Good Morning"". Good job there is a cockerel on it. It woke me up!! ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)"". Still no Billy Shears! Finally, we have ""A Day In The Life"".

I will never understand the hype surrounding this album. It is regarded as the best Rock and Roll album of all time, a real masterpiece, a piece of art, etc, and it really is a let down to me. Rock or Rock and Roll it is not; pure pop/bubblegum stuff. I dig the cover, though. I know the majority of you Beatles fan out there will disagree with me, but this is my opinion. You must admit, as I did as a fan, that this is The Beatles at their worst.",1.0
"I ordered a brand new copy of the Sgt. Pepper's cd.  I paid the brand new price.  I received a used CD.  It had no plastic covering, and was labelled ""USED"".

I don't think this is right.  And there seems to be nowhere to complain except here.",1.0
"The 2009 remaster is not worth buying unless:

* You don't own the same album already on CD.
* You are an audiophile who is willing to pay big bucks for small improvements.
* You like collecting stuff and want the cardboard and booklets that come with the new version.

Everyone who is saying there is a dramatic audible difference between this release and the previous CD is wrong. I'm not saying their opinion differs from mine, I'm saying they're wrong. That's a strong statement, and I'll try to back it up without getting too geeky.

The Beatles remasters are a little louder than the 1987 CD releases. Music sounds better as it's turned up a little louder (up to the point where it starts to annoy the listener). Most people don't have a way to exactly volume-level the two releases to compare them. That's why they think the new ones are so much improved, when they're only slightly improved.

<geek mode on>

Conventional wisdom is that most people cannot detect a loudness change of less than 3 decibels. That's not quite right--most people cannot detect a volume change of less than 3dB AS A VOLUME CHANGE. They can hear the difference but they think it's something other than a difference in loudness. They think they're hearing more detail, better bass, etc.--and they are, because you can hear everything better when it's louder, and you'll like it better (up to that annoyance point).

When you go to an audio store to buy speakers, the salesman typically has a vested interest (commission) in steering you toward a particular speaker. The unscrupulous ones will set things up so their pet speakers are 1 to 2 decibels louder than the others.  They don't push it too far, or people will detect that it's a loudness difference and ask to turn up the other speakers that the salesman wants to steer you away from.

The differences between the old and new recordings are not large, and the new recordings certainly haven't been ruined by being made a little hotter. You can easily measure the volume differences by ripping the albums to your computer with a program that can compute replaygain values. The differences on most of the Beatles tracks are....less than 3 dB. See where I'm going with this? The new recordings are louder, but not enough louder for many people to perceive the difference as a loudness difference.

For example, the 1987 version of Come Together from Abbey Road has a track replaygain value of -2.88. The remaster is -3.93, or 1.05 dB louder. (In the replaygain scale, things get louder as the negative numbers get bigger. Many horribly limited modern pop recordings have replaygain values of -8 or worse. Uncompressed audiophile classical recordings typically have replaygain values near zero or even a dB or two above zero.)

I ripped the new Beatles remaster to FLAC lossless format, storing replaygain values, and compared the new recording to my 1987 CD copy through a Logitech Squeezebox with Smart Gain enabled. This means I was able to listen to the new and old recordings at the same volume level. I also played them against each other with volume leveling off, and done this way it's easy to see why most people prefer the new release.

<geek mode off>

When volume-matched, the difference between the old CDs and the new remasters is audible AND minimal. And occasional. The most obvious difference is a slightly less restricted lower end.

We're owed better than this for all this money and hype. At the least, we should have gotten something as good as the Yellow Submarine remixes. Nobody who has heard Eleanor Rigby from that remix will ever confuse it with the original or prefer the original. Love and the Yellow Submarine remix and Let It Be Naked and the damn XBox game prove that the people who own the original tapes can do better and they know it.

They're milking us. Are you a cow?",1.0
These remastered CD's are a rip-off.  You cannot load them into your computer as a lot of people wish to do. The stupid documentary comes up every time.  I am returning mine as the only way you can play them is on a CD player which I don't wish to do.,1.0
"Heres the thing, I LIKE the beatles. I like the majority of their music, im familiar with all they have to offer but iv come to a conclusion regarding this album. The reason ppl love it so much is that its EXPERIMENTAL. Its something ppl had not heard during that time, something grounbreaking. I give it all props for that, but heres the thing, it does not have enought hits to justify the FORGETTABLE songs that this album has. The majority of the songs are experimental but forgettable. It has a good overall feel to the album but we won't hear anyone singing half those songs.

1. sgt peppers: good song? yes, great? no
2. with a little help from my friends: good song, yes. Great? yes
3: Lucy in the sky with diamonds: great? yes one of two major hits on this album though
4: getting better: good? yes great? no. its okay
5: fixing a hole: forgetable
6: shes leaving home: forgetable
7: mr kite: forgetable
8: within you without you: forgetable
9: when im sixty-four: great song, but will you play it loud while driving with your windows down? no
10: lovely rita: forgetable
11: good morning: forgetable

13: day in the life: one of the beatles greatest songs ever

so before you DIE HARD beatles fans get your panties all scrunched up bout this review, just know its true! its just the hype of the experimentation that makes this album seem unique from other albums of its time. The only thing though, is that its got too many forgetable songs IMO....plus by the way, ABBEY ROAD is the beatles best album! hands down.",1.0
"I agree with that kid. This album is oarful. The Beatles were probably the most mainstream band ever created, and when they were tired of bubblegum pop, they tried to be all trippy when they were given acid by that awful muscian, Bob Dylan. But the only thing they could accomplish is ripping off that song from the Wonder Years, making a bad cover of William Shatner's classic, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, and overall making an album that is barely listenable unless you take some LSD. Plus the title is tl;dr and there are no music videos for MTV.

For good bubblegum pop, get the Jonas Brothers.",1.0
"I just don't get why anybody likes this album! It makes everybody's best of all time list and it is unlistenable. Does anybody that rates this or judges this actually listen to it or is it just considered great because of what it ""supposedly"" revolutionized. There's only one song worth listening to more than once (We all know that's A Day In The Life). C'mon, Lovely Rita, I'm Fixin' A Hole, Lucy, Friends. This ain't Rock and Roll and I don't like it! Give me Pet Sounds any day! Give me The Village Green Preservation Society and I can listen to it for days on end. If I had to listen to Sgt. Pepper I'd probably have to be sedated. God Save The Kinks!",1.0
"I had purchased this CD so as my wife turned 64 we could listen to the classic words of ""Will you still love me when I'm 64?"" Neither of the CD's delivered actually included the song with the original words. There were no words with the music. I was credited the purchase price back, but am puzzled why the version you stock is not the 'classic' original? Thank you if you can give any clarification. Walter Sleeth",1.0
"This alBUM and the beatles in general are way too over-rated! How can you people say this album is perfect without it having ONE GOOD METAL GUITAR PART! you people need to learn what GOOD music is.

Doesn't anyone listen to these before they are sold to the public?  The poor mixing and production were no where close to the vinyl original in what I consider a blasphemy.  I know this album by heart and as a long time musician I am sorely dissapointed.",1.0
"I just bought this CD and I dont' see what all the hype is about.  My teacher always talks about the Beatles but they have no lyrical skills, my cousin Rodney is a better song writer than these clowns.  I think they should remix these songs with 50 Cent or Snoop, then they'd really get some fans behind them.",1.0

"Sorry to offend all you Beatles loving Hippies, but the truth must be told!  The Beatles are the most overhyped, overrated, annoying band in history.  Songs like these take no talent to play, they take no talent to perform, and they take no talent to compose.

Formulaic and uninspired, the Lennon/McCartney partnership has concocted some of the most simplistic, uncreative, insipid melodies ever commited to vinyl.  I've often heard their music described as ""simple"", but I think ""simple minded"" would be a more accurate description.  After all, simplicity can be a good thing.  But the Lennon/McCartney partnership didn't write any songs that were simple in a good way.  Rather, they wrote songs that were just plain simple minded, both musically and lyrically.  Twelve barre song structures, redundant three chord riffs, and some of the most brainless lyrics imaginable:

""She loves you

Yeah yeah yeah

She loves you

Yeah yeah yeah

She loves you

Yeah yeah yeah""

Wow!  The creativity really was rolling on that song!  As you can see, the Lennon/McCartney writing team draws heavilly from the classics, such as ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", and ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" for their stunning lyrical complexity!  What ever caused their brilliant minds to think of those words!?  Sheer lyrical genius!

Can't you people put aside your nostalgia and start seeing The Beatles for what they really were?  They were nothing more than a juvenile acting, silly looking, musically amateurish garage band----hand picked at random out of a hundred other no talent bands----and forced upon an unsuspecting public by a bunch of fat, balding, cigar smoking record company executives in suits and ties.  The fact that a corporate marketing scam like The Beatles remains so massively popular thirty five years after they disbanded is a testament to the power of marketing.  If you pay good money for a Beatles album, than you my friend, are a sucker.  Just like all their fans were back in the 60s!  I think PT Barnum put it best----""There's a sucker born every minute.""  And I bet even today's suckers being born right now are going to grow up to become Beatles fans!",1.0
"Maybe i'm just too old but I bought this album due to all the praises it has received expecting to hear classic Beatles. I was very disappointed with it and gave it to my daughter for my grandkids. They didn't like it either & it now sits on a shelf. I really like the ""old"" Beatles & also have their # 1 Album which is OK. As I said, maybe i'm just too old and the fact that my favorite music is Chicago type blues by Muddy Waters. John Lee Hooker, etc. might color my music enjoyment.",1.0
"The Beatles are best yeah yeah yeah...

They are original and never ripped of anyone, not even old 50's blues songs, yeah yeah yeah.

Sgt Peppers is a great album, no, no, no

That's real Pop, this is noise

I mean they repeat the same song twice

WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why are they so rated????????????????

Paul Mcartney is the biggest egotistical man on the planet earth and has never written a decent tune since 1969, yet he is treated like God, COME ON MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

He's an average guitarist, hell he's not even a guitarist HE PLAYS BASE FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Celine Dion, My Heart Will go On, now there's a song, it's moving and makes you cry, could The Beatles do this sort of song, no way!!!!!!!

And that Drummer, did he ever do anything???

I can't even hear the drums, does Ringo Star exist?????

Wow he wrote Yellow Submarine, my 1 year old daughter could have written Yellow Submarine, and she plays the drums better too!!!

John Lennon was the only good one but sadly he's dead RIP

Oh and George Harrison RIP too...

"Just wanted to let people know that this album has some satanic ties. Myself being a lover of rock music I realized some of the messages being conveyed were satanic. Notice on the album cover of this album, there is a picture of Aleister Crowley (top left second person)the biggest Devil Worshipper who started a satanic following. Listen to the lyrics they sound innocent but listen closely. The message given is ""Start A Revolution"" ""Do What Thou Will"", Those are teachings of Crowley, also notice the statue on the cover (bottom right under the BEETLES) That statue is mentioned in many of crowleys teachings. Guess who Sgt Pepper is... Yup Crowley!! Notice the lyric ""It was 20 years ago today...Sgt Pepper taught the band to play"" Just wanted to give a warning to those who didn't know! Why do you think this band got so big!!",1.0
"I don't get it. I really don't. How come this, of all the Beatles' albums, is considered such a pop masterpiece? No, not a pop masterpiece- a work of art? During the late 60s, there were a handful of albums that revolutionised the soundscape of the period : `Trout Mask Replica', `The Velvet Underground with Nico', 'Astral Weeks', `Pet Sounds' and 'The Band.' Let's not forget the umpteen psychedelic one-offs by garage bands captured on the Nuggets compilations. Sgt. Pepper don't even come close to those. The songs are mostly trite, silly, and boring. Even Macca's Frog Chorus thing of a couple of years back had a more memorable tune than most of the tracks on here. There are a few that are okay.' With A Little Help From My Friends' is pleasant enough, although Cocker's version is far superior - and that is hardly meant as a recommendation. 'Getting Better' is listenable. The rest are excruciating. `She's Leaving Home' just has to be the most sentimental tosh you will ever here in your life. It's a wonder Cilla Black never covered it.  `Lucy...' and `A Day in the Life' are the only songs that stand up to scrutiny.

It may appear as if I have no time for the Beatles. Not true. I think the Fab Four are one of the finest pop groups of the 60s and I heartily recommend such classics as `Abbey Road' and `A Hard Day's Night.' Sgt Pepper, however, I hate. I even hate the cover, which is fussy and scrappy.  The photographic portraits of Robert Freeman are far more striking and pleasing to the eye. Avoid this album as if it had a picture of your mother on the front - your mother naked!",1.0
"Say you were to go into a record store and you asked the clerk one question. ""Hey clerk, can you hand me a couple cds that were overhyped"". He'd should go get all Beatles albums and throw them in your hands. ""Take them all, we don't want them"". Only those stupid gullable people who actually beleive the Beatles can sing are the ones that want them.
Its a good thing their entire catalogue belongs to the genius himself, Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson made true music, this band reminds me of how overhyped Jessica Simpson and Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson is.
Now that the catalogue and rights to the songs are in Michael's hands, Paul McCartney can't put out any new Beatles music/compliation out there without Michael's permission. Michael would say no and Paul wouldn't even ask because they are in a bitter fight because Michael paid over 50 million dollars for the rights to the songs as well as rights to John Lennon and Paul McCartney catalogues. Michael was ripped off due to the fact that all Beatles song are not worth one scrap of poop from a dogs a**.",1.0

"I do not understand how this album can be considered amazing. It has been declared an eclectic rock masterpiece, a statement which is simply not true. It was supposedly revolutionary because it was ""the first concept album.""  It also contained the spooky, thought provoking ending found in ""A Day in the Life"".  To each his own, I suppose.
The title track is surprisingly adequate; it is one of best songs by The Beatles (which is not saying much).  The second track is ""With a Little Help from my Friends"".  It, like most other songs from this album, is entertaining for one or two listens at best.  Then comes the random babbling entitled ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"".  ""Getting Better"" and ""Fixing a Hole"" are more of this senseless garbage,only these include chiming guitars.  There's more clich material, found in the saccharine ""She's Leaving Home"".  Then comes yet another pointless throwaway, ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"".
""Within You Without You"" is another one of those unoriginal, interminable songs by George Harrison.  ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", ""Lovely Rita"", and ""Good Morning Good Morning"" more of the stale pop lyrics that The Beatles were so often praised for. We have a brief moment of coherence again with the reprise of the title track.  Then comes ""A Day in the Life"".  Somehow this song's ending is supposed to be genius.  Hmm, seems like more pointless noisemaking to me.

"So ....
Here's my , track by track , pass / fail analysis .
1. Title Track -  Upbeat kick-off . Fairly good . [pass]
2. With A Little Help From My Friends -  Ringo's song . The usual poor singing . Usually covered much better ( Joe Cocker etc .. ) . This version nothing special . [fail]
3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds -  Imaginative lyric over a repetitive verse/chorus pop tune . The song fails to sustain through the later choruses . John later claimed it had nothing at all to do with LSD etc .......  either way .... yawn . [fail]
4. Getting Better - By Beatles standards , a pretty ordinary/dull song . [fail]
5. Fixing A Hole - Another nothing-special track . [fail]
6. She's Leaving Home -  A sentimental ballad wraps a simple rejection/separation concept . Fine , but doesn't bear repeat listening . [fail]
7. ...Mr. Kite -  Silly lyrics ride a 'funfair' soundtrack . Again , really just the one idea  . Dull in repetition .[fail]
8. Within You Without You - Crap , compared to George's later efforts ( especially 'Dark Horse' )[fail]
9. When I'm 64 - Crap .[fail]
10. Lovely Rita... - Clever . Would have made a great single . [pass]
11. Good Morning... - Nice driving tight rock sound . [pass]
12. The Reprise - Great sound on this track . [pass]
13. A Day In The Life - More 'human condition' stuff from the can-be-rather-boring Mr. Lennon . Leads to a pompous resurrection of some orchestral experimentation from the 1920s . Embarrassing .[fail]
