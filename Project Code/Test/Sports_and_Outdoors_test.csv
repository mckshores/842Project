It was as described and fit my 6 year old grand daughter perfectly. She loves to play dress-up and this is a good addition to her wardrobe. I received the item quickly and the packaging was great.,5.0
cute,5.0
My daughter loved it.,5.0
My grand daughter loved this tutu and danced around in it all day.,5.0
Her old tutu (different company) had seen better days and she was happy to replace it with this one! The color is bright. The skirt is full and the sizing was correct. Thank you,5.0
As described...this will work perfect for the event we are going to.  Bright color..soft tool...will purchase more items from this seller.,5.0
Purchased and wore these tutus for the Portland to Coast relay race.  The were a one size fits all although we cut off about 12 or more inches as they were too long for our needs.  Soft and not at all scratchy.,5.0
What a spectacular tutu! Very slimming.,5.0
Loved it and glad it came long so I could cut it to the exact length I wanted.,5.0
Exactly what we were looking for!,5.0
"I used this skirt for a Halloween costume and glued a bunch of feathers over it.  It was exactly what I needed.  I liked that the elastic waist didn't dig in (no muffin top).  Two things to note though:  (i) it is a little long; I cut about 8 inches off, but it was really easy to do; and (ii) it is see-thru b/c unlined - I had to get a pair of yellow shorts to wear underneath which I hadn't planned on doing.",5.0
Fit as expected. Daughter is over 5'8 and it worked well for her.,5.0
"Simple and Powerful! So much non-sense out there these days, and this was a breath of fresh air. Simple and easy to follow - it gives actual results -  IF you follow the plan. These guys understand how protein, and especially healthy fats, play a huge roll in not only physical health and performance, but mental clarity.

 It definitely takes dedication, but then again what in life of real value doesn't. Workout's were intense and short for my busy work schedule, and most of the foods on the plan were the foods I like to eat anyway. Definitely effects your hormones in a positive way.",5.0
"The Apollo Challange is what you've been looking for in a diet and workout plan.  I'm a normal dude, played football in high school, club sports in college.  Fair to say that I was active but by no definition was I fit.  I held onto my freshman 15 from college until I was 30!  I wanted and needed to lose fat, not just weight.  Enter the Apollo Challenge.  28 days of an easy to follow meal plan, 3 workouts a week and the best sleep you've ever had.

I lost 10+ lbs, built significant muscle mass and I look better naked.  Give this program a shot, it's built to give you results quickly and believe me when I tell you, the weight actually stays off.

Lastly, you'll be well supported.  Their website and YouTube channel show you the lifts you'll be performing, even examples of meals to cook and prepare throughout the program.

Great program with solid results.",5.0
"At age 31, the Apollo Challenge was a gamechanger for me. I started the challenge while in really poor shape, coming home from a very indulgent vacation, and battling nagging injuries. I hadn't weighed more or been in worse shape  in my life.

The Apollo Challenge provided a clear-cut structure that I could follow on my own each day and respected my time and my workouts. The system was easy to follow, shop for, and track progress. The book is a quick and easy read (it took me no more than an hour to finish reading it), and it worked great as a portable day-to-day manual to follow the plan everywhere I went. I followed the Apollo Challenge for the first 28 days religiously, and it completely changed my dietary habits.

I noticed rapid gains in the increased amount of weight I could lift and the decreased weight on the scale. Even though I did't see as much direct weight loss as I would have hoped, I dropped 3-1/2 inches from my waist, and added 1-1/2 inches to my arms. The Challenge promises a significant change in body composition, and it absolutely delivers.

Buy this book.

I still use the system, albeit on a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule, and I have maintained my progress. It keeps me eating healthy and staying active. It changed my mindset and approach to food in a manageable system.

... Yes, I look better naked.

...  No, you cannot see.",5.0
"In a time of GPS usage there is still value in a map that is so accurate and easy to follow. Sometime's you just want to see more than a 5"" screeen can show at one time.",5.0
"The product came on time, well packaged, and exactly as described.  A great shopping experience.",5.0
We have come to rely on the Gazetteer series for general navigation when an Internet connection is not available. My husband purchased the New York version for a business trip and found it to provide exactly the information he needed.,5.0
"Love the book.  Had one previously, lost it, and had to replace it.  Perfect for "" off the beaten track"" driving.",5.0
"Bought this to replace the 20+ year-old atlas we keep in the car. Much more reliable than GPS - requires no batteries, never goes out of range, still keeps working even if you drop it off a 20-foot building!",5.0
Thank you for such a detailed map.  Love It!,5.0
Arrived on time.  Nice Atlas - Easy to read.,5.0
Five Stars,5.0
"Easy to use and lists ALL the roads - so handy when you don't want to drive the freeway.  You can get off those and really ""see"" the area!",5.0
These are always great references.,5.0
I was not lost with this book on my trip to New York .,5.0
Great book!,5.0
"Comprehensive atlas. Very happy with how much detail is in here.

I do wish there was a more detailed map of Syracuse so I could use it to navigate in the city.",5.0
Delorme has always made the best book maps in the USA.  Three thumbs up!,5.0
"If you're interested in exploring any area of New York beyond the metropolitan areas, this Delorme Atlas and Gazetteer is your best bet. Over the years I've collected these gazetteers for quite a few states, and they've come in handy when exploring out-of-the-way places, as I'm fond of doing. For me, this atlas proved most useful when driving around and hiking in the Adirondacks. I was able to find ways to get to some remote areas, thanks to the fact that the maps show secondary roads and backroads, and also show hiking trails. Because the maps are topographical, I have a pretty good idea in advance as to the sort of terrain I can expect to encounter, particularly in the hillier and mountainous territory. While I've used this mostly as a guide to the Adirondacks, it also appears that it would be quite useful in exploring other parts of the state because of the detail it shows.",5.0
worked great on the trip around ny,5.0
Great book like new,5.0
"I try to hike in the Catskills 2-3 times each month. The iOS maps app is great for getting me to the proper GPS point for the trailheads. The trouble is the return trip: in the remote areas I hike, it's unlikely that I'll have data service when it comes time to head home. No data service = no navigation. Having a USA road atlas in the car is great for getting from state to state or city to city, but it does you no good on small country roads. The scale of this map, however, does let you see those smaller roads.

This is in my car and stays in my car. It's a beautifully rendered set of maps that map geeks will just love.

And now I can find my way home.",5.0
Big fan of all the state Atlas and Gazetteers I have owned. Indispensable items!,5.0
map,5.0
"Really, 4.5/5 stars. Missing a little detail when it comes to access roads and parking areas on state lands. Other than that, it's excellent.",5.0
Nothing worse on a road trip than either no service for google maps or a large scale atlas where one inch is 100 miles---solution? These awesome map books.,5.0
great help,5.0
Arrived in tact and as expected,5.0
"If you camp or get outside in the state of New York: you need this atlas. I want another one for my wife's car. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
"Big, clear, easy to read, very detailed, this atlas is really great, and for $13 it's really a great purchase. I like that it lists campgrounds, parks and other must-see's, and that it has a detailed view of cities. I bought it together with the travel guide ""Moon - New York State"" and I'm ready to go!!",5.0
"These are the best maps, I get one for any state I'm traveling in.  Need to pick one up for my Florida trip this winter!",5.0
"Per my husband , is a good publication.",5.0
"We're kayakers and these maps are invaluable by showing where boat ramps are, the area of lakes and ponds, etc.",5.0
Fast and brand new.  Nothing more to rate.,5.0
"Sure anyone can use GPS but on a road trip with 91 year old Dad you can't exactly jeep hin involved with the trip with technology. I drove, he navigated using this atlas. Easy to use. Only wish there was a whole map of NY, not the one on the back used as index.",5.0
Good atlas.,5.0
"WE have purchased other volumes, this volume was as good a all the others.",5.0
A+,5.0
"I've found these to be the best. As an avid motorcyclist seeking the challenges of tarmac, I just look for the squiggliest lines and try to get to them. I really appreciate knowing in advance whether I'm climbing a mountain or squeezing into a narrow gorge",5.0
"GPS, Mapquest, etc...are good tools to navigate with, but this kind of map book will always be my first choice!!!  Try to find unmarked mountain fire  roads in forests with your GPS!",5.0
"If you don't have this GREAT, GREAT map gazetteer you might miss the fun of the journey. There are thousands of roads and trails you never thought existed as you drive by them unseen by your regular highway map: This book is not that. New York is,afterall, quite rural on the other side of the GW.  This fills in the blanks which are far from empty. You'll find that there is something there when you get THERE (wherever THERE is).",5.0
"Great product, FAST delivery! Just what we needed for RV travel!",5.0
A must have for a newly relocated So Cal girl,5.0
delorme is the best,5.0
Nice book!,5.0
Great map - we use it to select scenic and varying routes instead of relying on the one-size-fits-all routes that our gps chooses.  Especially handy when the gps signal goes kaput.,5.0
Love these backroads maps - they get us around the nastiest traffic snarls!,5.0
A+,5.0
thank you,5.0
"Was given as Christmas present to a family member who prefers paper over plastic & glass (aka GPS).  And knowing they like detailed maps, got this.  They were enthralled the rest of the day.",5.0
If you like maps you will appreciate this atlas.  Excellent detail on nice LARGE pages.,5.0
These are great for planning road trips especially trips that will take you off the major routes or out where cell reception and data plans don't work well. They have a lot of detail. I was recently out in the country on a little one lane dirt trail that amazingly enough was labeled as a road and was in this book. It was nice to be able to plan out a way to cut diagonally across the county to get where I needed to go instead of back tracking to a major route.,5.0
"These Gazetters are amazing! I own them for NY, VT, NH and ME. Fabulous! They provide info and details that go beyond what's available online and via smartphone apps.

I use these to find waterfalls and to learn about state parks and destinations. The extra info they provide about natural features/highlights are valuable too.

The only downside - they're big if you want to carry them around or keep them handy in your car.",5.0
Very detailed,5.0
"Well drawn, with many key features and a clear layout.  This was a very easy to use atlas.",5.0
Very helpful navigating the back roads near Cooperstown.,5.0
"If you are not familiar with this and have a habit of wandering, DO NOT BUY! This book of wonder will get you into places that no one else has stepped foot in years! If you ever wondered where that dirt road goes... or must replicate ""as the crow flies"", this will show you. Now if you feel you have a need for a book of every road and trail and hill in the state buy this! I have been lucky enough to have these around in some shape or form for decades and can say that these are worth every penny. If you are one of those people that can't use a map unless it is read to you from a lil electronic box, this will be a book full of abstract art.",5.0
"The DeLorme map series is an expanded scale (1"" = 3 miles) map series that does justice to rural explorations but don't fare well on the inner workings of cities. This map is an attempt to fix that. Several pages are dedicated to the downtown city streets in just the largest cities. To understand NY state, you have to venture beyond NYC and see how it fits together. My only regret is some lack of detail of the Thousand Islands area. It looks like it'd be a hoot for a canoe holiday.",5.0
Makes it a lot easier to take a drive and not get lost. Have a GPS also. We do a lot better reading a map. Do not want to loose that ability.,5.0
I travel through New York and really enjoy seeing the routes which I find which I have not travelled.  I travel on business and pleasure and finding some new roads makes travel so much pleasurable,5.0
Great detailed maps showing cities and roads but also topography and geographic features such as rivers. GPS grids and a lot of info in chart format such as facilities at state parks.,5.0
This book was purchased to replace an earlier addition that wore out.  This edition is every bit as good as the earlier one.,5.0
"I like the layout of the maps.  Relatively easy to locate the map/page you need based on the grid pattern I have no real complaints.  Good price, and the delivery was fast.",5.0
GPS doesn't always fit the bill when you are on small back roads. The Gazeteer is a no fail tool that any outdoorsman should have in their vehicle.,5.0
This is a wonderful resource for day trips.  We love to explore back roads and find quiet places to take our canoe and relax.  This Atlas is up to date and provides necessary detail to navigate places that the GPS can't.,5.0
"Arizona is a spectacular state.  There is so much to explore, from the Grand Canyon to old mining town of Bisbee.  North to south, east to west, this atlas will get you where you want to go.  Even in you have a GPS, it helps to have a broader visual back-up.  Get yourself an atlas and hit the road.  Happy Trails!",5.0
"We are snowbirds and we kept getting ""misplaced"" with the regular maps.  This one is complete and accurate.  Thanks",5.0
"These Delorme Atlas & Gazetters are wondeful.  They show you many features not available through GPS, maps or other atlases.  It is a great feature to have the BLM lands marked as well as the back roads.  Good resources are also included in each states atlas.  A good addition to anyone's travel tools.",5.0
"Great Product! Nearly as good as having a seperate map for every county in the whole state.

I like it best because I can read the text much easier than a state map, especially in low light. My bifocals are OK for reading but not the fine details of most maps.",5.0
"I have nothing but praise for DeLorme.  We have purchased and used 5 states now (Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Colorado, and Arizona), and each has enabled us to really enjoy some spontaneous vacations.  I plan to buy one for each state I visit.",5.0
This is a must have for finding the tucked away backroads of Arizona....,5.0
"I used this map when exploring Arizona on two separate occasions.  Delorme makes these maps for nearly all states in the US.  If you're ever going to explore a state - USE THIS MAP by Delorme.  It's well organized, provides information on parks, unique spots like waterfalls, historical sites, etc.  You can also find obscure roads not normally seen on tourist maps.  I bought the Delorme maps for Colorado, New York, and Virginia as well.",5.0
"Jack Purcell is pretty thorough in his review.  As for the nitpickers, if they really want to get names and numbers of backroads, they can contact the forest service and BLM, as well as the park service, who publishes maps of logging roads, and other limited use roadways.  At 1:250,000, who could expect a name or number tag anyway of off-the-beaten trail access roads anyway?
What's nice about the new edition is De Lorme has added graphics to note relief, rather than topo lines found on previous editions (Perhaps due to competition from Benchmark Maps).  I like the DeLorme Maps because they tend to be more detailed using a smaller resolution overall than other book maps (1:150,000 up to 1:250,000), and if one needs the detail offered in a 7.5 minute map, they have only to visit TopoZone.com to get really close, after locating the general area conditions on a DeLorme Map.
A great overall set to obtain, at the very least, get your state and every state that surrounds your own, and exploit it for true getaways and area studies!",5.0

"Good product, arrived on time and as described.",5.0
"Absolutely essential for the ""back roads"" traveler.  One of the first things I do when planing a road trip to an unfamiliar area is purchase the map of the state.  I like & use GPS but there are times when it doesn't work AND it has been known to ""lie"".  In addition, GPS does not allow one to see the ""big picture"" like a map does.",5.0
I love to travel some of the really back roads and this series is very helpful.  I just wish they'd put date on the front so I could more easily tell new versions form older ones.,5.0
Always good to have in the vehicle,5.0

An excellent and very detailed map of Arizona.  I've discovered roads and byways I didn't know existed..,5.0
"The first Delorme atlas and gazetteer I ever purchased was years ago when my wife and I were planning a trip to the Keweenaw Peninsula (which juts out into Lake Superior from the U.P. of Michigan). Ever since I've made a practice of procuring a Delorme gazetteer before exploring a state. I find them most valuable for that purpose. And so, a few years back, when I knew we were going to be in the greater Phoenix area and were then heading to the Grand Canyon, I figured I would make sure I had an Arizona atlas so I could see more than just what I could observe from the major highways. With this Arizona gazetteer I discovered backroads that aren't found on a regular roadmap, hiking trails and trailheads, and other points of interest. Plus, because these are topographical maps, I knew in advance what sort of terrain we would be getting into before we headed into it. This was especially useful for when we were hiking.",5.0
"I purchased my first Delorme atlas and gazetteer several years ago when I was planning to spend time exploring parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I was so well pleased with the detail and how with its aid I was able to navigate the area that I decided to get one of these atlases whenever I was going to spend time in a state. So, when I headed to Arizona to combine a visit with my daughter in the Phoenix area with a trip to the area around the Grand Canyon I made sure I had a gazetteer with me. Like the others I have, this one proved invaluable. I was able to discover backroads that aren't shown on the typical roadmap. Plus, I was able to locate hiking trails and trailheads, thus allowing me to fulfill another passion while on my visit. I'm especially grateful that this is a topographical map, since it gives me a better idea of what sort of terrain I'll be encountering, whether I'm driving or on foot. I consider this to be an essential tool for serious exploration of an area.",5.0
"This is a very useful general purpose atlas for the entire state of Arizona.  I'm sure there are a few omissions, but, overall, it's about as complete as you can reasonably hope.",5.0
"essential for any outdoor adventure planning, everything in one place.",5.0
"I like the Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer because, like the other DeLorme travel guides, it is concise and easy to read, as well as easy to carry along with you on road trips. The maps are well detailed, providing the traveler with valuable information.",5.0

"These are great for planning routes.  This has enough detail, that you can see all the twists and turns on mountain roads.  I wish I would have had this before we took HW191 up through AZ.

"I hunt and fish in Arizona, and I need a map that shows exactly where I'm at. It clearly show National Forest, BLM and State land. It even gives the GPS coordinates so if you're using a GPS, you can see exactly where you are at on the map. I've also got the Northern and Southern California as well as the Kansas Delorme maps for the same reason.",5.0
"if you travel the less beaten path, you will love this atlas, however I like the older version better, not sure why just yet , but something is different",5.0
Got the map to cover the back country of the Arizona Strip - just south of Utah but north of the Grand Canyon. Great to have the detail of this remote and little traveled region of the USA.,5.0
Great tool. I'm a prospector and this is one of the best publications for finding all the back roads that I have found.,5.0
Helped us get around the Grand Canyon and more remote parts of Arizona where GPS systems can be deceptive or not work at all.,5.0
"I have done a lot of backroad/offroad driving in AZ in past 6 years and would not consider going without this book. We find many roads that are not on standard maps. The scale is so much greater and accuracy is unmatched. The only maps that can touch these are USFS maps.
I owned several of their Texas Atlases for 25 years while covering the state on canoeing trips for the same reasons and have checked out their New Mexico and Colorado books- same story.
They are a bit expensive but well worth the investment if you want to see parts of your area that you didn't know existed.",5.0
"Must have as a starter for general navigation. Main benefit is land status color coding - let's you know where to go to use YOUR public land. Decent off-road points of interest and features. For higher resolution, get USGS topographic maps and/or something like the Backcountry Navigator app. Also, USDI/BLM has Geocommunicator website with free topo map interface.",5.0

"I have always enjoyed the Atlas and gazeteers and purchased them for each state I have lived in, usually at least 2 copies. I keep one clean and the other gets notes and comments penned into it. Many times the field copy will get the pages carefully removed and laminated. I use them with other tools for hunting, fishing, trails, etc.",5.0
"I use this with my adventure book all the time.
Not as good as a topo, but close, and that is saying something.",5.0
"My wife and I have used these for years. I just wish they had them for other countries too. We've used the Michelin books and others, but they aren't as good because the scale is better. They are large books, but flat (18X12 inches). They wind up in my duffel bag as they can bend. I bought this one for a friend of mine coming to visit so he and his family could plan their vacation. It lists historic sites, natural scenes, camping places, etc. The maps show lighthouses which is really good as I photograph them and more importantly how to get there. They can be used with GPS though I am of the old school and have never found a real need for a GPS device. These map books and the human brain are adequate so far.",5.0
"If you do not own a GPS, or even if you do, You should have one of these.

"The DeLorme Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer is an excellent resource for trip planning.  Arizona is a deceptively big state with lots of wide open spaces and some specially rugged terrain, including the Grand Canyon.  This atlas should allow the average traveler to navigate pretty much anywhere on the road network, and to gain some appreciation for the terrain along the way.  The scale of the map is 1:260,000, which is reasonably useful for the size of the state.  Major roads are identified, and many minor roads are at least visible on the map.  The multicolored presentation enhances the terrain relief.  The map sheets are marked with latitude and longitude for GPS grids.

In addition to a locational gazatteer, this Delorme Atlas provides general information on recreational opportunities.  The listings include federal and state parks, game management areas for hunting, and locations suitable for fishing.  There is a handy listing of campgrounds and one map devoted to the Grand Canyon, a major visitor attraction.  The map scale is not suitable for off-road navigation.  Those travelers planning to do off-road route finding are advised to consult more detailed products.

The DeLorme Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer is very highly recommended for planning and navigating, whether for business or pleasure, around Arizona.",5.0
"This Delorme topographical sure beats out all the other maps I have been using. We do alot of back country riding on motorcycles and this map gives us a clear view of elevations, routes, etc.....",5.0
"i am a long time furey faithful.  his exercise programs both mental and physical have helped me become more of the person i want to be and i know that in the future they will help me even more.  i see a lot of talk about price in these reviews.  i don't care how much furey charges, if his price is too high for you, you are missing the boat.  combat conditioning is the simplest set of end all be all core exercises for complete health and fitness no matter your age, occupation, hobby or gender. his focus is getting you into great shape, cardiovascularly, muscularly and flexibly all in a one shot deal.  even better than combat conditioning the book, is combat conditioning the video/dvd where you see the man at work. visit [...] for a ton of eye opening knowledge, and if your concerned about price, don't bother.  just think of what you spend on fuel or junk food or any other such nonsense and your senses will come back to you if you are at all interested in your own health, strength and longevity.",5.0
"In this day and age of modern gyms, overpaid personal trainers and expensive workout outfits, etc., Combat Conditioning is just what I was looking for!  I got it two years ago and have established a fitness level that a gym membership couldn't do.

I'm a martial artist and the exercises in Combat Conditioning have given me great functional strength, explosive power, three times the flexibility and 4 times the stamina. The Hindu Squats were the saving-grace for my knees. I had a MCL tear a few years back and have always had to deal with pain, stiffness and instability. After getting Combat Conditioning and doing the Hindu Squats, my knees are stronger with more stability and the nagging pain has significantly decreased!

I have read some of these reviews on Combat Conditioning and there seems to be a gripe and whine about the price. But in comparison to an $800 per year gym membership, not to mention the gas to get to and from there ( I live in California), Combat Conditioning is cheap!!! It is well worth the price, in fact, it is under priced if you ask me. I'm paid something like $45 directly from Matt Furey's website and then later got the videos for $99. In total, $144 plus shipping and handling for a lifetime of fitness!! Are you kidding me?  I felt like I ripped off Matt Furey!",5.0
"Great excercises that can be interchanged for numerous workout possibilities.  I would highly suggest this title if you are interested in building functional strength.  Don't bother if you are just interested in a body builder look; this isn't about just getting the ripped look.

It is especially helpful because there are no additional weights or equipment necessary which makes it great for the traveler.",5.0
Very good information regarding fitness-the routine delivers a superior condition of fitness and strength. Furey is correct when he says the only you need to lift is your own.,5.0
Mixing this book with CC 1 and 2 and al kavadlo raising the bar its all you need.  Weight lifting is out bodyweight is in you build legendary inhuman strength.  Just remember everyday is training day!!!!,5.0
"Matt Furey's best-selling ""Combat Conditioning"" is an incredible work. It is basic and rudimentary, which may be misleading for some readers or prospects; however, the recommendations and guidelines for combining the myriad of highly effective exercises in the book, especially Furey's ""Royal Court,"" WILL aid you in your endeavors to quickly and efficiently lose excess body-fat, and build your muscular strength and endurance, as well as improve cardiovascular conditioning to a very substantial degree. It's not the most complete work on calisthenics or body-weight exercises, yet it does more than ""gets the job done.""

Personally, my neck pain (which has troubled me for years) dissipated after nearly two weeks of performing the ""Royal Court"" only five days a week in less than 10 minutes each day. Of course, if you have neck pain (or any other pain, for that matter) you should consult a physician before adopting this program.

Also, keep in mind Matt Furey is a world-class grappling champion and National title-holder in wrestling, so his methodology is geared towards conditioning, not bodybuilding or pure strength and power. It will increase strength, but is has more to do with developing muscular and cardiovascular endurance - or ""staying power"" - than it does brute strength. This type of stamina is the most important facet of physical fitness for a grappler/ wrestler because if you're physical stamina is shot, so is your mental stamina, your ability to focus and give 100%. Obviously, it should go without saying that this benefit spills over into your everyday life as well.

Basically, ""Combat Conditioning"" is all you need to get great results, especially if you're goal is muscular energy and stamina that won't quit, improved mental focus, and a new-found confidence. Follow Furey's advice in the book, and his recommendations and you'll gain the fitness you desire.",5.0
"So Mr. Furey promotes himself...I'm in great shape, and the exercises beat me down! Try performing 100 straight Hindu squats! No way! You couldn't pay me to sell this book! It's a keeper! [...]",5.0
"You can read all the good and bad reviews, but this book works. It may not be the ""best looking"" book, but who cares? If you want results, pick it up. Getting fit isn't glamorous. As for Matt's price, it's worth it. Go join a gym, get a trainer, and tell me how much you'll pay for that! This book is no frills and is GREAT!",5.0
"I just received this book, and just the first three core exercises are worth what I paid for it. The exercises is this book will kick your butt, no matter what your skill level. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",5.0
"This book rocks.  I have been training for most of my life and have competed in marathon running and kick-boxing. (Western Canadian Welter weight title in 1998) I started doing these exercises 2 years ago and really noticed the difference in my muscular endurance.  After 10 months of combat conditioning, and age 47, I climbed Mt. Rainier (14,000 feet).  While running and weights are good training, I have to admit, the combat conditioning gave me the legs and lungs to top Mt. Rainier.

I feel that this book was worth the reading and the excercises are fairly difficult but easyenough for anyone to do them,5.0
"I have a lot of Matt Furey's martial arts tapes as well as this book.
His tapes have a lot of good moves but the video quality is not all that good and they are pricey for what they show.
This book is somewhat high too but it delivers a lot of good exercises.
Matt has a web site where he pushes his goods such as Farmer Burns wrestling videos and things like inner circle memberships.
He will deliver an email to your mailbox if you sign up for it.
  All that being said I fell out a little bit when after I ordered some dvd's during a Christmas sale a few years ago and he sent me vhs tapes.  This happened on two different occasions.  It was apparent he was just getting rid of the tapes in an effort to only warehouse the way of the future, DVD's.
  I also want you to know he got big lifting weights and although bodyweight exercises are a great way to get in shape and even get strong, he is somewhat hypocritical in the way he puts down weight lifting.
  The third thing that aggravates me is the way some advocates of lifting heavy objects will also peddle their own version of goods in some of his daily emails.  They two have a bodyweight line and put down lifting weights in one set of books and advocate it in others.
  Still, this is a good book and I do recommend it.  Just know that although it is a good way to get back in shape or build up your endurance, the author is a bit two faced when it comes to his putting down weight lifting.",5.0
"Like Thomas F. Brown, I am one of the Furey Faithful.  Over the past few months, I have been using the exercises on a regular basis, and I am in the best shape I've ever been in.  I don't understand why people are complaining so much about the price.  For $30-40, you get a book full of great exercises that you can do anywhere, without any equipment.  What book are you going to get that has this much information for less?",5.0

"Ok - I am new to the world of fly fishing - but, I have spent about $5,000 on equipment and trips already since June - this is a must in your vest or fanny pack on the water - helped me enjoy my time on the water and reduce frustration with remembering the knots - buy a nail knot tool before you do anything else...",5.0

"Pocket Guides Guide to Fly Fishing Knots is a very well made little book .It's a great little book to put in your fisherman's vest, so when you need to tie a knot that you may have forgotten how, you just pull it out of your vest pocket and look up the knot
of your choice. I love it for two reasons. One:The book is made of plastic so water won't affect it. Two:It's small enough to put in your vest while fishing, so if you need to refer it,it's right there with you. Great idea with great instructions.",5.0
"I have used several different guides , however this one is by far the best. It's arranged in a logical concise manner , and it's waterproof as well. I won't head to my favorite trout stream without it.",5.0
It was referred to have by a Nevada Game Warden and is a must have if you fish as well as the other knot tying books and practice tools. Great Job Thank You ARM,5.0
It is set up for beginners and will be very helpful to them. It's not a bad reference for the more experienced fisherman either. I really liked the tab feature for quick reference.,5.0
"This book is a must-own for horse lovers, history lovers, and anyone who likes a good story.  There is a story for each of the 50 states - a unique format that suits the subject matter very well. I like the length of the stories - just right for taking a ""reading break"". You can read one story in a ten-minute sitting. The presentation is beautiful. It is a hard cover book with a beautifully designed dust jacket. The paper has a luxurious feel - it is a pleasure to turn the pages. The oblong format allows this to be displayed as a coffee table book, but the size is not cumbersome to hold as some coffee table books are. The content of the stories ranges from informative to heartwarming to thrilling. You come away from reading this book with a renewed pride in America and a new appreciation for the horse that helped make America great.

"Matt Leidecker has written a very fine guide to the Middle Fork of the Salmon.  The maps are informative and the rapid descriptions and recommended runs at different water levels are truly useful.

He has also recommended many seldom done hikes throughout the canyon.",5.0

"Usually, we don't take the time to learn things until there is an absolute need or emergency, and don't let that be the case with this book. This book will endow you with useful survival knowledge in tough situations and some of these tips can save your life before it is too late.

If doomsday ever comes (and I think it will) then you'll be glad you read this book. It is a great guide to what you need to do in order to survive should disaster occur and there is lots of great advice about the things that you could be doing now to ensure the future survival of you and your family. Will you need it? I hope not but its still worth knowing about.",5.0
"Until you read this gem of a book you have no idea just how much you need to know in the event of a disaster.  Whilst the book can't teach you every skill for every scenario, it does let you know what skills will be useful so that you can go about learning/training before it is too late.

There is no doubt in my mind that if doomsday ever comes then you'll be glad you read this book.  It is perfect as a guide to what you need to do in order to survive should disaster occur and there is plenty of advice about the things that you could be doing now to ensure the future survival of yourself and your family.

Will you need it?  I hope not but it's certainly worth knowing about.",5.0
"The book was great, especially for it's price.

The last few years have taught us all that there can be doomsday disasters, be they natural or caused by humans. This books gives you some great ideas on how to prepare and what you will need. You'll be surprised at how many things you agree with, but realize that almost no one implements it. Take a read and see for yourself.",5.0
"I found this book to be well worth the time I invested to read it.  In a world of economic uncertainity I personally have been looking for ways to be better prepared for any type of emergency.  This book was well written with an abundance of practical ideas to be better prepared for any type of man made or natural disaster.

After reading the book I have a list of things I can do starting tomorrow to get prepared.  I especially appreciated the suggestions on storing water.  Anyone regardless of your financial status can implement a water storage progarm.  The scary thing for me is I don't personally know many people who have taken the effort to have a supply of water on hand.

Overall this is a excellent book that I would have no problem recommending to my friends.  I don't usually comment on books that I read.  I felt the need however on this book because it will benefit so many people in the event of an emergency.",5.0
"I can relate with some of the situations mentioned in this book. Our place is frequented by typhoons. The roads get easily flooded and most of the time, electrical power is down. One alarming problem during such situation is the scarce supply of food and clean water. We rely on water delivery system and the nearby public market for food to eat. But when roadways are flooded, we are really helpless.

I like all the preparations related with food and water as they kind of give me ideas on how to deal with difficult situations we usually encounter during periods of strong typhoon. Those survival tips and ideas when the power goes out are practically helpful. The ideas of storing items during power outage kinda resonates with me. I have plenty of second hand books and they are really quick fix to boredom when the electrical power is down. Got some good ideas also on other ways to keep the light on during blackouts.",5.0

I really appreciated the economic approach to the book.  If you are like me there are some things you would like to do in your life but don't end up doing because of lack of money.  This book is written for those who want to be better prepared but are also tied to a budget.

Patty shares a ton of tips, that are not only extremely useful, but very entertaining to read. You will not have to break the bank, because it's mostly about what you need to do and how to do it effectively. Lots and lots of tips and tricks that will get you prepared to face any emergency situation. Highly recommended!",5.0
"Very interesting and necessary book, I should say. I am not a fan of doomsday books or anything related to the ""run for your life"" reading, but this one actually caught my attention. The writer really has laid it out in a clear, simple and full scale manner. She described all the necessary prepping procedures in case of any possible destructive nature acts, war or social unrest.
As I have experienced a little bit of doomsday happening in my country, I know very well how vital are your survival skills and knowledge in such kind of shakedowns. When it happens, you will not have time to read books on survival, that's why I recommend reading it even if your country or town is doing fine at the moment. It takes one powerful electromagnetic pulse from the Sun to wipe out electricity not only in one town, but possibly the whole nation or nations. After that the ones with the knowledge will have a HUGE advantage over those who were ""singing in the rain"".",5.0
"Things I like about it:
The back pocket is sturdy and easily keeps 20+ pages without tearing at the edges.
There are three holes across the top - not just one.  This is really helpful when the weight of the back pocket gets quite heavy.
Joanne, the calendar designer, did an excellent job of optimizing space.  Each daily block is 2 1/8 x 3 3/8 inches and had nine lines to write on.
The stickers are quite colorful.  The big ones are 9/16ths square.  The star stickers are 11/32nds of an inch and come in seven colors.  The smaller stickers fit perfectly on each line of the calendar without interfering with the other lines.

Things I wish were different:
I wish every page was full color.  The photos on some pages are largely black and white.  You children could color them in but mine do not and it makes for a blah month.
I would like to see stickers that are more relevant to my life.  Each year several stickers (i.e. road trip and hot lunch) go unused. Stickers I would like to see are the holidays (It would be nice to add a pop of color to the holidays we celebrate.), car registration/inspection due, pay bills, and check smoke detectors.
The back pocket has advertising on it.  The More Time Moms Family Meals and app are advertised here. I would pay a bit extra to have these things advertised on the back cover rather than having to look at it every time I access the pocket.

Other things you might like to know:
The moon phases, 2 - 4 spots to write lists, a quote, the previous and the following month are included on each page.
The middle of the calendar is held together by a plastic coil.
There is a small January 2016 calendar on the inside of the back cover.  This is helpful for future planning.",5.0
"I am a very busy Mom, of two boys, soccer/ cub scouts and working full time.  I tell my husband the calendar is the ""Bible"", if its on there it is for real.  Love the big squares to right in. Sticker are cute too.  I like the pocket in the very back.

"This is the world's best calendar!!!  I have been using this brand for the last seven years and wouldn't use anything else.  I refer to it as  ""my brains"" and that is not an exaggeration.  I would be completely lost without it.  It keeps our family of eight informed and prepared for what is coming next.  It has big blocks for each day and looks nice hanging on the wall in the kitchen.  There is enough space in each block that I am usually able to jot down any notes of interest about the day along with scheduled items.  It has often served as a journal where we could look back at the previous years to check and confirm dates, places and happenings.  I would highly recommend this calendar.  It is also a good deal for the cost.  I just ordered my calendar for next year and it is already hanging on the nail behind our current year's calendar.  As appointments and events come up for next year I am able to write them in so that we don't forget.  This is one of the most valuable items in our home!!",5.0

Love these calendars. Buy one every year. Plenty of room to write on each day with great stickers.,5.0
This is the only calendar I get every year. It has big squares to write everyone's schedule on and stickers for at-a-glance reminders. I keep them for a family journal for scrapbooking. They also come in handy for vacation planning and when blended family children visit their non-custodial parents.,5.0

Daughter-in-Law loved this.,5.0
My favorite calendar - I've been using it for about ten years to keep track of our family's activities.  I especially like the size of the daily boxes and that there are lines to help you neatly write in all the events of the day.  I also enjoy the variety of stickers.  I use them to make it easy to ID the reoccurring events and to make special events stand out.,5.0

The BEST Mom calendar around,5.0
"I have been using this calendar for years.  I love it!  There is enough space to write all of our activities and the specialty stickers add some fun.  I also like that there are extra lines on the monthly pages - this allows me to add reminders for things that need to happen, but aren't specific to a day.",5.0
We get this every year. Works well for our family.,5.0

"I have been using this calendar for several years now.  It is a great calendar for recording all family events. Plenty of space for recording multiple events each day. For us, the stickers are not really necessary, but perhaps more appropriate for families with younger children.  I highly recommend it!",5.0
"I've used this calendar for years. The day boxes are big enough to keep track of everyone in the family. I love that the paper isn't slick, so I can use pencil and erase as much as I need to.",5.0

"Love these calendars/planners.  I return every year for the More Time Moms version.  purchased a few years ago from Costco and they have not provided it since then.  I now get it every year from Amazon.  Keeps my busy family organized and on time for all the many events, mostly sports, that are going on daily!  The stickers provided help keep me on time for birthdays and all other occasions as well.  The size is perfect for being able to write in all the schedules that our family of 4 have.  It's a good price through Amazon as well.",5.0
I've used this calendar for my family for 5 years now.  I would never buy a different one.  I LOVE this calendar--so much space to write things down.,5.0
"I have used this calendar every year since I first heard of it, likely 10 years ago.  The squares are big enough to write multiple items legibly, and the 16-month aspect means I have flexibility in when I transfer things over to the new calendar.  Just right.",5.0
I love the calendar.  I buy them every year.  It has handy stickers and a good amount of space to write.,5.0
"I have used this calendar since 2009.  I used to be able to purchase it at our local Border's, until they closed.  Now I order it as soon as possible from Amazon to assure that I get my copy.  I would be lost without it.  My only 'whine' is that they now put a lot more color in the calendar.  It used to be that all of the illustrations were uncolored and I enjoyed coloring them with colored pencils as I spoke on the phone. The large boxes, the stickers, and the pocket are a few of the things that draw you to the calendar, but I also love that it is sturdy and well constructed.  I keep my calendars as a sort of 'diary', and the fact that it looks as good on the last day as it does when I receive it is wonderful.",5.0
"I have been using this calendar for years, ever since I discovered it on the shelf at Borders (I now order it from Amazon).  My family runs by the ""If it isn't on the Calendar It doesn't exist"" rule.  Lots of room to write in each box for appointments, reminders, celebrations, etc.  About every other month is a color pic, but that is not a problem as my daughter loves to color in the months not color printed and it makes the calendar even better.  I think, I would actually be sad if they had full color and I couldn't have her ""fix"" it for me as she has been doing this for years!",5.0
Best calendar for a busy life,5.0

Great tool for working on children's balance and coordination.,5.0
My 3 year old niece loves this. It's great and we have all played with!!,5.0
"All 3 of my boys use this in our basement.  It works well on carpet and hard wood.  It is OK on ceramic tile.  I was afraid it would scratch the hardwood, but it has not.  My oldest is almost 200 pounds, and he is still able to move it around.",5.0
The children love it.  It was a gift for my 2 of my grandsons ages 4 and 6.  My daughter-in-law has since purchased more for their friends birthdays.,5.0
"I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter to help her develop a better sense of balance. She loves to stand on it while playing wii games. I feel less guilty when she's getting screen time, b/c her balance is improving and she's getting a core workout as well. I'm not much of a skater, so I didn't get much out of this item on dry land. However, this thing is awesome on the snow. The poor-man's snowboard. I suggest getting the larger version as it will come in handy on the slopes.",5.0
Granddaughter went crazy over it.,5.0
"Kids love these, great purchase!",5.0
I purchased this for my 2 year old son as a Christmas gift. He LOVES it! The quality is great and it's easy to use. My son plays on it often. It's held up great with three kids using it!,5.0

"kids and friends (boys and girls) from 4 years to 13 years love these!!!!
I don't mind them doing tricks in the house and it keeps their bodies moving.
I didn't realize you can do so many tricks... they are a bit pricy so I was hesitant. but worth every dollar! great idea and very pleased",5.0
9 yr old Granddaughter loved it!,5.0
Our nephew loved the spooner board. No idea if he has broken any bones yet though :),5.0
Got these for our five grandchildren ages 6 to 10. The boards are a good size for the kids. They provide a nice activity for the kids inside during the winter months. Boards are very sturdy. The kids are learning new tricks all the time. Haven't tried them as sleds yet.,5.0
Got this for my 5 year old son...he loves it! I've tried it a few times as well and it's a lot of fun! Definitely recommend it!!,5.0
Very fun! Our kids love them already.,5.0
"This is a very cool board. I bought it for my six year old daughter. So far she has done little more than spin on it, but she loves to play on it. It's great for keeping her active and burning off some extra energy when she's stuck in the house. It's also quite strong. I've stood on it (200 lbs) with just a little deflection.",5.0
"I got this for my three year old last Christmas and he is still playing with it almost a year later. Right now he loves to spin, but it's a nice toy that once he keeps practicing and getting the hang of it he can do more advanced tricks as he gets older. It has lots of fun uses, inside and out. Spooner has great promo videos showcasing the types of tricks it can do so. I didn't show my 3 year old the videos last year and not even know but I can introduce the more age appropriate ideas as he gets bigger.",5.0
grandkids love it,5.0
Grandkids can't wait to play with the Spooner when they visit.  This size better for kids up to about 6-7.  Go up to next size after that.  Great toy and teaches a lot of physics and balance.....even though the kids won't know they're learning because it's so much fun.,5.0
Kids love it,5.0
Lots of fun for all ages. All my kid's friends play on this when they come over. It's a big hit.,5.0
Everyone loves them!,5.0
I bought 4 of them.  The boards were a great success.,5.0
Gave it to my 8 year old niece and she loves it.  Mom wasn't keen on it being used on hardwood floor but it didn't leave any marks. Its better suited for asphalt playgrounds or concrete driveways. I think this will catch on and be a lot safer than razor bikes and skateboards.,5.0
4 year old grandsons love this.  Very sturdy and they jump right on & go!,5.0
My son loves it!!!,5.0
"Our Grandsons, seven and nine seemed very pleased with these boards. I liked that they can use them indoors and out, and they will be able to improve balance and coordination.with these.",5.0
"Great for balancing, and fun to play on. Can be used in all kinds of situations. Snow, Ice, Carpet, tile, gravel, grass, just an all around fun toy.",5.0
"Serious fun in our house! My four year old and eleven year old like playing with this thing equally. I tried it out and was sure I'd break my neck so I only spent a little time on it. They like to sit and spin, stand and ""walk"" with it and when it's upside down, my bigger kid can flip it with his feet and land on it like a skateboard trick. The only problem was that I only purchased one - so we have to take timed turns with it!",5.0
Very popular with a very active 4yo boy.,5.0
"It has at least 20 uses.  A skateboard, a snowboard, a shovel, etc...The kids love these and use them all the time.  Great for balance.  Great for playing outside.  The kids always find another way to use it.",5.0
"This thing is awesome. It's as fun as you make it. I bought it for my 6 year old son.  So far, we've used it on the carpet, wood floor, and snow.  It's a little tricky to be able to sit on it with all the big snow gear for sledding, but when he feels comfortable enough to stand or kneel on it, i'm sure that will be fun.",5.0

"My wife purchased this for me to use with P90X.  She wanted to minimize the amount of space used to store workout equipment.  It is nice and small and fits behind the door.  I am only about 190 pounds so it holds me quite well and I never feel like I am going to fall.  The instructions were easy to follow and I had no issues during assembly.  Once all the bolts are tightened, it becomes quite sturdy.  The grips are comfortable and feel nice on my hands.  Overall I am quite pleased with the quality and use of the product.",5.0
"I ordered this product to use with p90x and am not disapointed. It assembeled very easy and is very stout. I'm 6' 1"" 220 lbs. and it has no problem supportting me. I would recomend this to anyone.",5.0
"I received this Heavy Duty Doorway Chin Up/Pull Up Bar as part of a set.  The bar was easy to put together and the addition of a link to an instructional video was awesome.  The various grips have a nice padding for your hands and are great for working the different muscle groups.  If you are concerned about it holding you don't be.  I am a 240 pound man and have never worried about it falling or ripping my door frame apart.  I think this product is a great tool to add to any workout arsenal - I use it for P90x and it is great! The other part that I must comment on is the customer service which is fantastic.  I called with a question and they actually treated me like I wasn't putting them out"" and helped me get the answer I needed.  I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to get in or stay in shape.

"I was using 'Iron Gym' regular edition  Prior to this one  but if you are seriously into Calisthenics - You need a WIDE GRIP Pull up bar
 It's well made, had no problems assembling it ; giving it 5 stars !

Update : have been using it for over a year , only one cushioning pad has recently fallen off , but considering my extensive use , I am still very satisfied with this bar,
and if it breaks in a few years I will definitely purchase another one",5.0
"This is a review of Black Mountain's Customer service.  While I purchase this item and received it unfortunately I discovered that my walls were too thick to accommodate this.  My natural instinct as an Amazon customer was to go through them entirely for returning it but felt as this was likely a smaller company I should try contacting the manufacturer first and see if I couldn't order a part that might fix it.  Rich was very helpful in assisting me and reassured me that while unfortunately their products could not solve my issue, I could very easily use a competitors product to get the results I needed, going so far as to recommend the brand, Perfect, that would solve my problem.  Very friendly reps and very sorry that I could not use this product of theirs.",5.0

"This was super easy to assemble. I was doing pull-ups within 20 min. of opening the box! It fits right in my door way and goes up and comes does literally in seconds. I like the grip options and the construction seems solid. Of course I only weigh 125lb dripping wet.
I would highly recommend this product!",5.0
"I bought this item 2/15/2012 and it arrived 2/21/2012 as estimated. The package arrived around 5pm and i had it assembled within an hour and a half going at an easy going pace. I felt compelled to write this review because of several negative reviews that I read. On comments of the screws stripping; I noticed this too, but all I had to do was use the phillips to stabilize the screw and the wrench to twist the nut. No big deal. Everything is on tight and its all good. I'm no engineer, but let me serve example that if you have any comprehensive knowledge whatsoever and a use for a solid home pull-up bar, then I cannot recommend this product highly enough",5.0
"I started the P90X program by using resistance bands but after a bit, felt I needed to really go the true Pull Up route instead.  After looking around Amazon, it made the most sense for me to go with the BMP bar.  I had previously purchased the BMP resistance bands and I'm happy with those so far.  Well, the package arrive (yay Prime) and I quickly assembled it.  Make certain that you tighten the locking nuts really well.  I didn't use the optional but included black ""L"" brackets and placed it right on the door frame to see how it felt.  It feels very solid and is in no way going to hurt the door, moulding, or surrounding wall.  I'm using a fire door from my laundry room to my garage.  The nice thing is that my garage steps down 6-8 inches so as I place the bar facing the garage, I get that additional height to work with.  Goes up and comes down in < 10 seconds.",5.0
"After purchasing Iron Man Pull up Bar I realized that didn't cut it for me. Later on progressing on my work out schedule I needed something more professional grade. Black Mountain has created a beast. This Bar is not just a regular bar, but it is very well constructed and mounts very easily on the door.

I highly recommend this bar to anyone who needs a good grade Pull Up Bar.
It may cost a little more but definitely is the best bang for the buck.",5.0
My pull-up  bar arrived quickly and on time. It works great and was not difficult to assemble. I am very pleased. I also have BMP workout bands and had a question so I ended up speaking with one of the company's owners. The customer service level went well beyond my expectation! I would definitely  purchase more of their products when needed.,5.0
This pull up bar is one of the best I've ever used.  The handles are comfortable so my hands to not get calluses like they normally would on a plain metal bar.  It fits nicely in my doorway.  The size and structure is great. I am happy with the quality as a whole.,5.0
This pull up bar fits perfectly in my doorway.  I'm actually surprised by how well it works.  I thought for sure that it was going to destroy my door frame!  Already feeling the pain from a good workout.  I didn't know I was so weak!  Looking forward to using it more.,5.0
The lighter 4 pound resistance band is a perfect resistance for many of my clients.  I run a small fitness company and this may be the most popular band that my female clients use.  Customer service has been great with this company,5.0
"BMP has made some new improvements on their products.  They are stronger and more durable, I have not had any problems with mine and they are used 5 days a week.",5.0

"I've been looking for a pull up bar that works well, meets my needs, and matches my budget for a while.  And I'm happy that I stumbled on this new product from Black Mountain Products.  It's been working out just fine for me.  I don't have a gym membership because I can't afford it on a monthly basis so I like to workout from home.  A pull up bar is exactly what I need.",5.0
"I used to use the Iron Gym pull up bar, but decided to switch to something new that had more handle positions and so far I have not been disappointed with Black Mountain Products' pull up bar.  The design even feels slightly sturdier than the Iron Gym, as I was often afraid that that product was going to eventually snap in the middle.  I'm not sure what the issue is with the negative reviews for this product.  A pull up bar is a pull up bar.  It's pretty simple to set up and use.  This one is perfect.",5.0
"I read plenty of reviews on several different pull up bars, we needed one that would support my husbands weight of 230 pounds. The reviews stated over and over that this bar would hold the weight without bending. It works great, no movement, no bending, quality construction. We use it with the P90x.  Don't bother looking around this is the best one and at the best price.",5.0
"I started the P90X and wanted a comparable chin-up bar for less--this is exactly what I was looking for.
Just like P90X bar with multiple grips, plus the main center bar is one solid piece (this was an important factor when distinguishing between some of the other look-alikes).
The price is great. Arrived earlier than promised, easy to assemble(instruction sheet was easy to follow, I didn't even need my husband's help), great all around product.
The quality seems great too...me, my husband, and my oldest son have all used it. My Husband's max weight is 180 lbs., so we haven't really tested the weight limit, but it's great for us.
Fits my 32"" door perfectly.
Definitely a good value, especially when you factor in free super-saver shipping.
Bottom line is...I recommend it.",5.0
"This is a great product!  It shipped very fast (within 4 days I received the product).  I do a couple pullups whenever I walk past the equipment.

As long as you have a wrench and screwdriver this thing is very easy to assemble.  It also comes with brackets if you needed additional support on a specific door frame.  I rotate my workout around the house, so I haven't installed the brackets yet.  But make sure everything is strong and tight.  I originally used a battery drill, but had to hand tighten to get it correct.

The directions are helpful, especially on the easiest way to assemble.

I am approx 200 pounds and this product hasn't let me down (or fall down).  It is heavy duty and made from a good product.

I also purchased the resistance bands and they work very well with this product (for P90X or regular day-to-day workouts.",5.0
"This pull up bar is exactly what I was looking for. The difference between this one and many of the other ones here is that this pull up bar has a single member that spans the door opening. It is not two pieces joined together. It is not 3 pieces (I read on one review that the pull up bar assembly required putting 3 pieces together that span the doorway!). It is one solid piece that the other pieces build off of. I looked through many other pull up bars to find one that had this exact feature, because this is what makes or breaks the design.",5.0
shipped quick and the product was very good and strong . put together easy with instruction would recommend to family friends and anyone else.....,5.0
"Great product, I have the whole family of bands for 5 years and just now had to buy a replacement purple. Most likely from hanging it over wood rafters.",5.0
"I've had the black resistance band for a while now and it has held up very well.  Just received the purple band and have used it a few times now.  I'm very satisfied with Black Mountain's resistance bands.  As a bonus, they come with a nifty little contraption that allows you to position the band at the top of your door frame, which is essential for doing pull- and chin-up mimicking exercises.",5.0
"These resistance bands exceeded my expectations. The handlebars are comfortable to hold and the band provides adequate resistance. I've bought other resistance bands before and the handles were pretty flimsy, but these bands are great.",5.0
"These bands are easy to use and are nice if you don't have free weights.
The handles have comfortable grip and they are easy to store.

There isn't anything I would specifically change.",5.0

"Bought this Feb, 2013 thinking to use it when weights not available.  Used it a few mos. Lost interest.  After my accident (fell off the roof) in Nov, 2015, I had PT for months and the therapist had me use resistance bands. He told me to do certain exercises basically forever using bands.  Dug out my band that I bought, been using it for over a year, every day, I check it over prior to using because I considered that if it snapped on me because it was old and laying in a drawer for over a year.  I don't want to re-injure myself.  So far, it works like brand new.  Very well constructed. No fraying. No small tears. It supposedly has a lifetime guarantee, but I am realistic.  I think the company made a great product. I'll update this review if and when it breaks. Until then, nothing but good to say about it.",5.0
"the best,great workout",5.0
"These are good bands, they don't have smell and are very convenient to use since the handles are already fixed.",5.0
Perfect for what I needed it for! Use it by putting it in a shut door (the piece they send is super helpful!) Use this for strengthening my back and shoulders. I'm a pretty athletic girl and I lift and this was a good resistance for me!,5.0
"Great product for someone who is just starting resistance training. I don't have time to go to an actual gym, and this is perfect for use at home. I am even planning on taking it with me during my vacation as it is very compact and light. I am planning on getting another one so I can use two for certain exercises. I'm glad I purchased this. Great value.",5.0
"I own three of these, the latest being the black because I have more strength now. I love that they don't take up much room and are lightweight, but still give me the resistance I need for basic workouts at home.",5.0
"I got the purple band,and has been working well,I feel very confident in the quality of this as I use it in a couple different exercises ,I have been into working out for years and seen other types of products and this one is made well.",5.0
Ordered 3 sizes of these resistance bands and have used them for about a month. Very happy with the quality. They feel like they will last. They came with an exercise and user guide which was helpful for a first time user like myself.,5.0
"I was looking for a new resistance band because my previous one broke. Many bands I have used tend to break away from the hand grips over time. I ordered this one because it was eligible as an add-on via Amazon prime, but it had good reviews so I decided to try it. I am very happy with the purchase. I have been using this band for almost a year, and it is still holding up. The foam hand grips are comfortable and the band itself is still securely attached to each handle. I have not had any problems with the fabric handles fraying. It is nice to use as an option when traveling. I am considering purchasing a higher resistance level, since I currently have the green, which is about 10-12 pounds resistance.",5.0
Met my expectations. Good quality ,5.0
My husband and I are loving this resistance band!  I looked at many products and reviews before going with Black Mountain and I made the right choice!  The quality is excellent.  This thing gets used almost daily and we've had no issues with it becoming less resistant or stretching.  The door anchor works well also!,5.0

"Very good resistance band, feels strong and durable. The anchor is a plus for doing extra work outs.

"I have been using Black Mountain (BM) resistance band for almost 2 months now.  My initial  experience with the band was not that great.  Here is why! I was out of shape, my arms were weak and so was my core.

Many exercises that involved using the resistance band (such as standing abdominal twists, pulls through, squats...) I could not do.  But I kept at it and I am getting better at it.  I do use the band 2 to 3 times a week.

What I like about the band:
1. Band came with door anchor so you can do many different exercise by just hanging your band over the door. Up to 18 exercises
2. The band came with a brochure containing tips/tricks on how to effectively use the band and get the most out of it.
3. Great quality
4. Using the band is another great way to strengthen your body. I don't like to do weight lifting and so the band works for me.

Any disappointment with BM band...Not really!

However, I did not get the color I wanted. I ordered orange and yellow was shipped instead. This is not a big deal, though.

When I first got the product, it took a minute to figure out how to get the bands into the handles as no instructions were provided for this (pinch the band and slide it into the handle).

So far, the bands have held up and I have yet to notice any tearing.",5.0
I searched for a while to pick perfect bands which hive you the best workout with heaviest resistance reading review after review. I settled on this company because of the different variety of bands plus the ease of switching bands to get different weights. As I do P90x I can switch bands quickly and not lose too much time from time from my workout. Highly recommended for a great P90X workout.,5.0
"I purchased two Black Mountian resistance bands sets. I like the soft handles and their flexability because they allow me to combine anywhere from 1 to all 5 bands for max. resistance. I would like to recommend that the loop on the door anchor to be made just a little larger so that one can slide the handles thru it while the bands are still attached. The bands  and handles appear to be of good quality, well made and will hold up if used properly.  I'am more than satisied with my purchase.",5.0
"I was very impressed with this set. Most of the resistance bands in the campus gym are fixed to a specific handle - you can't compound them to increase the resistance. With these bands, though, it's easy to create precisely the correct amount of resistance by mixing combinations from just a few bands. The handles are also surprisingly comfortable - more than I thought they'd be. The bands themselves also seem very durable and unlikely to age quickly.

The door anchor is sufficient for its purpose, though you do have to physically remove the handles from the bands in order to slide it on and off (of course, this is better than having the ""clipping mechanism"" some door anchors use, which almost invariably wear out and break). If you use the door anchor for pull-downs, though, you're probably using a lot more weight than you would for other exercises, so switching in and out of ""door mode"" usually requires removing the handles to change the bands anyway. Still, if the loop in the anchor were wide enough to pull the handle through, the issue would be averted entirely.

I don't usually use bands over weights, but I wanted to try them mostly as a travel-friendly alternative. They certainly fit that purpose well, especially with the bag which they give you. All together, they don't take up much room in a suitcase, and even then it's unlikely that you'd need to take all five bands with you anyway.

There was one small issue, however. The blue band had a few small spots of green rubber fused to the side (almost like the raised edge of a plastic figure that was cast in a mold - a sort of continuation of the rubber that didn't fit the rest of the figure). When I mentioned this to customer service, they profusely apologized and promised to send a replacement immediately. I can't say I mind, though - the band works just fine, and you wouldn't have noticed unless you were looking for that one spot.",5.0
I needed a band to take with me on an extended vacation to keep up some physical therapy exercises.  This was perfect.  I especially like the attachment to place in the door- it really adds quite a few more exercises.  It seems sturdy and durable.,5.0

"I live in a rural part of southern Arizona, and for many years I always took a copy of this atlas with me while 4 wheeling around the wonderful mountains and deserts. I always recommended it to anyone who spent any time whatsoever traveling. I also have copies of DeLorme's atlases of every western state.

I wore out several copies, and was looking forward to using the latest, 2008 edition, with the wonderful shaded relief and enhanced graphics.

This is not just a disappointment. It is now a dangerous book.

The level of detail is magnificent; too bad it is just plain wrong. Important dirt roads that cross mountain ranges have vanished. New roads, straight as arrows, seem to plow through rugged wilderness areas that have never, and will never, see a road of any kind. The paved county road that connects my small town with the even smaller town 6 miles away has inexplicably vanished.

If you have an older edition, keep it! Preserve it, coat it with vinyl and keep it safe. Because you cannot trust the present edition.

I went out and bought the newest BenchMark maps version of Arizona, and it appears to be correct, and it will be my new guide to getting around. The other DeLorme atlases I own? I cannot trust them, but I have spent too much to merely throw them away. So maybe I'll use them in conjunction with Benchmark atlases. But I'll never be able to trust them alone.

What a shame!

I called up DeLorme, wondering if perhaps, because I live on the border with Mexico, maybe they were cooperating with Homeland Security to confuse immigrants. But they denied it, and said that the level of detail is consistent with other DeLorme atlases. Which means they are probably all equally worthless.

So, once again, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is dangerous to rely on a map that has gone through the computer blender.",1.0
"So far, having only used this atlas a few times, I have discovered 2 critical errors. While I felt that the map was detailed and the design well done, changes that have been made to roads even before this atlas was published and inaccuracies can be frustrating or even dangerous.

The first problem. This atlas has not been fully updated to reflect changes in roads, even road changes that were made before it was published! For instance, Castle Hot Springs is a place that is north of Lake Pleasant (p. 43 of the atlas). The road to get to it, Castle Hot Springs Road, is a 2-lane, paved road with wide shoulders on either side. If my memory serves me right, this road was there before the atlas was published. According to the DeLorme atlas the roads that go south from the springs and north to it don't even meet- by a margin of three miles! Moreover, the parts of that road they do show indicate that it is no more than a roughly-graded dirt road- not a paved hgihway. Check GoogleEarth if you want to see for yourself.

The second problem. The different ""lines"" that the DeLorme has used for the roads in this atlas are inconsistent in how they are used. For example, the ride between Prescott and Crown King is pretty rough- no guardrail (sheer drops 100+ feet), unimproved dirt roads, a 4WD vehicle required. Even with an experienced off-road driver, the ride is limited to 5 mph in places and averages only 15-20 mph. However, the atlas shows that the road improves around Goodwin into an improved dirt road. The same kind of line is used on the forest road north of Payson, AZ where you can often go over 40 mph safely. Needless to say, I'm writing this bad review because of that. The road after the place called ""Goodwin"" was worse in many places. At one pint, the road had an extremely steep, angled part which we barely made past in a 4WD Explorer. We saw compact cars doing 40 on the forest road near Payson.

To add a bit of insult, the same line is used outside of Crown King on the way back to I-17. We averaged 35-40 mph down that road.

Needless to say, this atlas needs to be updated. Despite the economy, development has changed roads in Arizona a lot since 2008. However, it appears with this atlas material errors were made in representing features that existed before 2008. If you buy this atlas, understand this fact and before you go anywhere you are completely certain is 100% safe, do your homework. Though, I'm sure there are more accurate atlases out there.",1.0
"Waste of money in my opinion.  Fails to show important mountains, ridges and other terrain.",1.0
"I am rather bemused by this lame post hoc attempt by Matt Furey to put out a low quality book at textbook prices. It should be noted, first of all, that Mr. Furey has been publicly denounced, via the internet, in a hand written letter by MMA Guru Karl Gotch. He stated the following from scientificwrestling.com : ""Thanks for sending me that copy of the fat man Matt Furey's website. As you know I don't have a computer and I don't know how to use it, but as I can see he employs it for a con game to steal from some poor guys that love the sport."".... And later in this same letter Gotch also states, ""The man is a disgrace to wrestling and has no honor at all, he can walk under a snake's belly wearing a top hat."" Strong words indeed from a then 81 year old retired wrestling legend who Furey claimed was a teacher and mentor. Furthermore, Gotch says, ""I wrote you all this to show you that how can a fat slob like Furey, that doesn't know his elbow from his rear end, tell and show these poor boys that he charges an arm and a leg and a finger thrown in.""

 The book (Combat Conditioning: Functional Exercises For Fitness And Combat Sports) is as  expensive as a Franklin Library leatherbound heirloom book. The point being, that it is barely beyond Kinko's quality. The contents of this book are largley available on the internet and they are just the regurjitated methods of Gotch and Gable- certainly not a scholarly composition.  Matt Furey has been accused of shameless self promoting at a level scarcely imagined by some of the industry's brightest lights. I have now sold my copy on ebay.

There are, however, some positive qualities of Mr. Furey worth mentioning. He is a former NCAA Wrestling champ and he did train under Dan Gable at Iowa.  Also, Karl Gotch did teach him several legit techniques over a period of six months.

These credentials, unfortunately,  don't make up for his appalling marketing scheme which should be independently investigated by you the consumer. It is true that my writing is not based on irrefutable facts, however, as a Platonist who enjoys physical culture. I encourage like minded individuals to take the time to find the best possible supplement for the best possible results. Always maximize efficiency and economize.
There are various media formats currently available depicting exercises personally demonstrated and instructed by Gable and Gotch. I recommend those articles to you.

In closing, I will reference the now famous Karl Gotch letter reproduced from scientificwrstling.com: "" I hope that we can find a way to stop this misfit from fleecing those poor guys, thanks again for letting me know.

Yours,
Karl.""",1.0

To get an idea of our outside activities we ski, snowboard and go sledding every year and both children play hockey, baseball and basketball and we live in a middle class suburb of Chicago. This year we went to upper MI were my kids and their friends stay outside for hours going down hills on saucer sleds (which from our testing of all the other sleds are the absolute best). All of the 6 kids with us, ages 7-10, tried these for about 2 minutes and said they suck! The spooner's would go about 4 feet and then just stop and the kids said they tilted to the side and they couldn't stay on. As for using these during the summer if you've got a bike, basketball court, baseball field or a park field around you why waste any time tooling around on this thing? In the summer my son and daughter ride a ripstick waveboard and skateboards and these are infinitely more fun than this spooner piece of crap. As a final note what a piece of garbage this thing is: Since Christmas when my kids and their friends got these they have been sitting in a pile outside my garage and have not been touched once, the kids have absolutely no interest in these.",1.0

"I bought this when it was on sale during Amazon's pre-holiday lightning round, as I needed to replace an original Iron Gym pull-up bar that was falling apart after many years of use.  Even at the sale price, it turned out to be a waste of money!

First, the bar ends that rest against the door frame are hard plastic, not foam pads like on the Iron Gym.  The hard plastic ends will almost certainly damage a wooden frame. Heck, even the Iron Gym's foam pads eventually wore through the frame's paint, so I have no doubt that this model will do worse.

Second, the bolts that connect the top cross-bar are not recessed into the bar like they are on the Iron Gym.  In fact, on this model, the bolt heads stick out further than the rubber pad that is supposed to protect the wall!  These bolt heads will definitely leave marks on the wall above your door frame.

Third, the handles are straight, not angled as shown in the product picture.  This probably ticks me off more than the above problems, as I wanted the angled grip for wide pull-ups, and this was one of the reasons I chose this over another Iron Gym bar.

Fourth, this uses very thin bolts compared to the ones on the Iron Gym, and they are not plated like the Iron Gym's.  I bet these will rust quickly.

So, bottom line is this is an inferior design and doesn't come as advertised. It only cost me an Andrew Jackson so it's not worth sending back, but I recommend you shop around and compare the build quality before buying.  Note that most of the others that look the same probably are - look closely at the pictures and compare the bar ends that rest against the frame.  These obviously come from the same place, and are just rebranded with different names.",1.0

"I do not usually write reviews but my experience with this product was so aweful and frustrating that I felt obligated to share.

I was excited to use this pull up bar and was happy when it arrived.  Unfortunately my happiness turned to frustration moments after beginning to assemble the product.

1. There was not even close to enough of the nuts and bolts required.  I was forced to go to ace hardware to get all of the nuts and bolts that were missing.

2. After finally getting it put together I picked it up and the grips fell off.  I hadn't even used it yet and it was falling apart.

3. I do put it up in the door jam and test it out.  I try the inside bar and it works okay.  But there is a lot of creaking and stress noises from the bar(I'm 180 lbs)a little scary.. I test the outer grips and immediately after putting my weight on it the metal bent all the way downwards deforming the aweful contraption and making it impossible to use.

I built this exactly as it was supposed to be and it fell apart in one use.  Do not buy.",1.0
"I didn't have any of the problems that other reviewers had with regards to assembly.  The holes were all lined up fine and none of the nuts stripped out.  I even had a door frame that the bar fit well on too.

My main complaint is that this thing flexes and bends when I hang from it.  It claims it will support up to 300 lbs.  I weight 225 and if I use the outer handles, the entire front of the bar bends down a couple of inches or more.  I don't trust this thing to support my weight over the long haul of the P90X workout.  I friend of mine blew out his knee in college when the chin up bar he was using broke free.

The only ones it would fit properly were the ones to the outdoors, which makes it quite inconvenient. It also seemed to have too much ""give"" to it when he would allow it to bear his full weight. Since the product was assembed and tested, I didn't think I could return it.  Plus I'm too busy to bother with the hassel of insisting it was returned.

"The provided screws do not go all of the way into the provided wall anchors. The screws are too short! I am an engineer and it is clear to me that this design has not been fully considered. The purpose of a wall anchor is to have the screw enter the locking area of the anchor. I must now go to the hardware store and attempt to purchase the correct hardware to mount this piece of crap.

Also the direction are simply one picture and it is ambiguous as to the orientation of certain components. You can muddle through this but it is certainly very annoying.

Lastly, the instructions call for a 1/4"" drill bit for the wall anchor. This size drill bit is clearly too large for the wall anchors as they slide out very easily (even after the provided screws which are too short are inserted). I now have four ugly holes in my dry wall.

I strongly recommend going with a different pull up bar.",1.0

"After a few months, one handle broke during an exercise and can't be fixed.  It hadn't been used that often, so it didn't seem like the normal stretching that a resistance band goes through over time.  I wouldn't buy it again; it is worth paying a little more for something that lasts longer.",1.0

The replacement band worked fine for about a month, then suddenly snapped while in use. I don't wear these bands especially hard - I had another band from a different company that I used for five years; I only replaced it because I thought that after so many years it might not be safe.",1.0
"I got the purple band and it's actually too short. For example when I stand on it under both feet to do a shoulder press (pushing straight up), I can barely do it. I can lift a solid 100-120lbs in that position using dumbells, so I think it's just too short to do certain exercises. The green band (10-lbs one) by comparison is the correct length. The purple one is of course thicker, but also shorter (at rest).",1.0

"DO NOT PURCHASE. The Safety Instructions from Black Mountain clearly state ""Do Not, under any circumstances, use resistance bands beyond 90 days."" These bands are a scam. A product with Lifetime Warranty that is only safe to use for 90 days? Black Mountain you should be ashamed of yourselves... and so should you Amazon for even marketing their product!!! In addition, the door anchor slipped out of my locked front door with all bands at full extension striking me in the back of the neck and sending me flying to the floor. Reason: the anchor wedge is too small to adequately anchor in all door jambs. I have since purchased the Bodylastic Bands with internal safety cord, larger/stronger metal rings and fasteners, and a much larger door anchor. They also do not limit the life of their bands for only 90 days.",1.0
I used the Yellow one (least resistance) for 5 minutes once/twice a week for about a year and then it snapped - huge disappointment.,1.0
"Been excercising consistently for over ten years and recently decided to get out of the gym and workout at home more often. The metal ring attached to ankle strap broke under tension. It sling shot itself into my chin leaving a cut that lasted for nearly a month. Its a miracle I wasn't blinded in one eye.  A slightly different trajectory would have changed my life forever.
 If you want to risk being maimed, join the military. They will at least take care of you and pay for a nice looking glass eye. Returned the set and will never use bands again.",1.0
"These are all based on a simple idea of using the elasticity of bands to provide resistance for a workout. They only needed to do one thing to improve this basic idea so that it could be safe to use at home. The resilience of the elastic bands. However, these are just off the shelf bands with no improvement. As a result, these bands easily rip and tear after a few months of use. The lifetime product warranty that they are talking about covers only the first 90 days of use because that's how they define the product lifetime in the fine print. That's the product you will be paying $30 for. Beware.",1.0
The black band broke not even two weeks after I had it. It didn't snap where bands usually do this one broke off right by the handle. These bands were different then the prior ones I owned from the same manufacturer those lasted a long as I would except. These new ones don't seem to be made as well.,1.0
"Broke right out of the bag.  One of the two handles cracked just removing it from the bag, I hadn't even started using it. I regret buying it.",1.0
"I have been interested in doing some p90x for a long time now, and after seeing such a cheap set of resistance bands, decided to take the plunge. Right off the bat I was impressed with the speed in which I got the item. The only problem was it was jammed into a envelope (not even a cardboard box) that was way to small and my set of resistance bands was literally falling out in multiple places. This immediately raised red flags for me. After using the bands to start my exercise I must say there is little to no resistance in even the heaviest of band. Now I am no body builder, but if a weakling in desperate need of p90x find they offer little resistance, I imagine they would be near useless to someone in even decent physically condition. In fact, the heaviest band is so short, and yet so weak, that it snapped less than a week into use. I have since given up on this product. Buyer beware, the cheap price comes at the price of being cheaply made.",1.0
"I was terribly disappointed in this product.  The Orange (heavy) band broke a week after it arrived.  That's incredibly dangerous given the intended use of the product.  I only used this item according to the exact specifications and it is defective.

I bought it to use with my P90x program.  I love P90x and have since found other....RELIABLE...bands.

If you're looking for bands to use as a substitute for weights or pullups...DO NOT BUY THESE.  They are defective and you can get seriously hurt!",1.0
I purchased this set of Saber bands to replace the Beachbody brand bands I have been using for my P90X workouts.  The Beachbody bands gave me more than a full year of constant use before giving out. I read the great reviews on Amazon and decided to take a chance on these Saber bands.  Big mistake!!  It has now been just over a month and the green band had already snapped.  Let me tell you I am no body builder and am not really testing the tensile strength of these things.  Nevertheless the bands are worn and cracked and as I mentioned the green one broke.  Spend a couple of dollars more and get a product that lasts.  Just my two very disappointed cents.,1.0
"bought a set. Used lightly, the all have ripped !",1.0
"Lifetime Warranty, except that, according to their instructions, under no circumstances should this product be used more than 90 days. These seem like a good deal until one realizes one is risking life and limb, according to the manufacturer, short of replacing them every 3 months!

Beyond the absurdly short lifetime claimed by the manufacturer, their liability limitation page also insists on wearing safety glasses (mind you, prescription eyewear explicitly doesnt count), and under no conceivable circumstance will they accept any liability for their product (seriously: the list of things they claim not to be responsible for is long, and includes many things I very much doubt would hold up in court).",1.0
"Very disappointing to learn after one of my bands broke that ""lifetime"" means 90 days",1.0
Broke within one month of use!!!!  Not sure why so many great reviews. Works well when not broken.,1.0
"Strictly the facts. The product was used 6 times over a five month period. The stitching failed as shown in the picture causing the metal ring to slingshot into my face. Deep laceration on the cheek bone, bruised eye ball and eye lid. Required immediate attention from emergency room doctor with dermabond, medication, and eye examination. It could have been much worse. I wouldnt recommend using this product without the use of a helmet.",1.0
"The first day of use, the first round of exercises, not even 5 minutes of use & the red band snapped. Scared the crap out of me & everyone else in the house. I was going to get a replacement set, but looking back at all the reviews I should probably just pass.",1.0
"$10 Chinese product that is not made to last and can possibly hurt you badly when they will snap(and they will). I would caution everyone. Please do some research and buy heavy duty resistance bands made by reputable companies with reviews not by people who use them once and forget them,but by bodybuilders and athletes who put these bands through paces.

Please avoid the heavy set and only use the lightest bands. Do NOT use the 20+lb bands as they will snap quickly. Lighter bands will last a few months.  As others mentioned the manual says they are only designed for 90 days... well, the real ones are designed to last a lfetime.",1.0
"I am a competitive weightlifter with many years of experience with a wide range of strength training products.

Blue band broke the first time I used it. Very unhappy.,1.0
"The bands are of moderate quality but the thing that put me off from this product is that they have a ""free orange band promotion."" The leaflet in the bag says ""call this number and we'll send you a free orange (35-40# resist) band"" but once on the phone they say ""that offer is only if you leave a review online."" Nowhere does it mention it on the flyer that you'd be expected to write a review for them and I feel the tactic is a bit gross and certainly makes the high reviews you may see for this product to be questionable.",1.0
"Broken band from within the housing. Had no way of knowing it would snap. I don't use these very often and they are not exposed to any extreme temperatures or humidity levels. Snapped mid workout, luckily I or any of my family members got hurt. Do not recommend.",1.0
"After less than two weeks of use, my red band is beginning to tear. I would opt to return the items, but I'm leaving the country in three days. As one knows, once resistance bands begin to wear and tear, they are very unsafe to use. I would advise buying a more durable brand like Wodfitters.",1.0
"worked well for a little while. I keep them in my car where the air conditioning isn't always on. Eventually all the cables were covered in a white residue, and i ended up snapping one of them. Haven't had them very long. Pretty disappointing.",1.0

"My product arrived with an issue with the clasp for one of the straps. I contacted the manufacturer, and they said they would send a new one, but it hasn't arrived.  The guide within was very poorly put together, appeared careless. I also found the ""90 days of use"" concerning with regards to it also being a ""lifetime warranty"" I am open to adjusting my feedback if the manufacturer would address these issues.",1.0
Have had these for a few months and 2 bands already snapped. They are not overused or abuse and kept inside not in the sun. Disappointed to say the least,1.0
Snapped after less than one week of use!,1.0
"The strap that attaches the steel anchor to the velcro strap snapped while I was using this product. It's a great concept but poor design & fabrication. It's too late for me to return it, but not too late for the company to fix the problem for future production.",1.0
"Not so sure how this has 4.6 stars. I focused on the good reviews when I purchased when I should've read all the bad ones. The band seem to be of good quality, but the issue is the threading that they use on the ankle strap, handles, door anchor, and the peice that connects the bands to the carabiners. They are all starting to come apart which can be dangerous considering all the metal parts that they use.

I bought these for physical therapy because I was in a car accident. I'm 105lbs, in a wheelchair, and only have 1 arm that I can use. This should prove that I couldn't possibly push these bands passed their breaking point. I used this product a total of 4 times and during one of my exercises I heard the threads ripping so I stopped to check. Good thing I did because taking a metal carabiner + rubberband to my broken leg or arm would have been extremely painful.",1.0
"After 3 weeks it hit my body,Today when I workout the standing row with ankle strap it broken and hit my tummy. I used red blue and green string. Everyone should be careful about this.",1.0

"I kinda feel bad for giving this company a bad review but after my experience, I feel it my civic duty to inform others. I had two black bands and one red (I'm super strong like that) and I was doing my FIRST, that's right my FIRST workout when the tip of the red one snapped!  See Exhibit A.

Thankfully, it just scared me (not little girl scared of a bug kinda scared, more like Navy SEAL about to get dropped deep behind enemy lines kinda scared), and I didn't get whipped and I didn't lose an eye.

My personal feeling after this experience is that resistance bands are inherently dangerous. I'll be moving on to TRX and/or gymnastic rings. Any injury from those will most likely be from my own stupidity.",1.0
Returned these because the bands were so tight they didn't allow for a full stretch and didn't like the fabric strap that had to be used to hook to the door.  Plus they charged close to $8 to return it.,1.0
The cuff broke the first time I used it. I don't have much faith that the other pieces won't break as well. Really dangerous.,1.0
Very poor quality.  I bought this for my father who is 65 years old.  He was using this product exactly how it was instructed.  The strap broke and the band snapped back at him with a lot of force.  Imagine a large band like this with a lot of tension smacking back at your head.  The stap broke within the first couple of days of use.  What if it snapped back and him in the eyes.  Very dangerous due to poor quality.  Do not buy this brand.  Q,1.0

This is very dangerous, imagine if it would have taken out my eye or something! Don't buy this or any other resistance band that you would regret later on. I am throwing these in trash...im not even going to bother returning these....",1.0

This product  is not safe for moderate to heavy use  unfortunately  I cannot return the bands because the rerurn date has expired. These bands are an accident waiting to happen,1.0
The second day of use and the Red band snapped while I was using it.  Its the only band I've used so far and now I'm a little scared to try using the others.  It snapped while doing leg work and smacked me across my face - good thing it hit my cheeks and didn't blind me!  If this is any indication of the quality of materials this company uses..... then I suggest buying from a different company.,1.0
"so i received my bands.  why does the instruction manual start out with these warnings:

1. ""do not use this product without safety glasses.  eye protection equipment should comply with ANSI Z87.1 standards.""  odd that no photos of the smiling people using this product, on this page or in the very same instruction manual, feature anyone wearing any kind of eye protection whatsoever, and this warning does not appear on the product page.

2.  ""resistance bands are intended for 90 days of use.  do not, under any circumstances, use resistance bands beyond 90 days""  news to me!  again, absolutely no mention of this on the product page (i wouldn't have bothered to buy them), and it kinda makes the whole 'lifetime warranty' thing you keep mentioning a bit silly.  does your warranty mean you are going to send me replacement bands every 90 days for life?

"Don't waste your money. These are a total scam. The claim of a ""lifetime"" warranty is almost fraudulent. I don't think anyone would realistically expect these bands to last a lifetime but perhaps a few years. Nope. ""Lifetime"" apparently means the expected life span of the bands which is 90 days of usage. In fact, the instruction manual states that under no circumstances are you to use these band longer than 90 days. None of this is explained anywhere on any website selling the bands, including the maker's website, this is explained only in the instruction manual.

The disclaimer that these bands are only to be used for 90 days should be included in every website that sells these bands in bold print so that buyers can make an informed choice. I purchased these and have not even used them once I read the 90 day caveat. They are going back for a refund.

This products does not pass the test of time and by that I mean less than a year. My brothers and I use these bands just about every day and I guess you could say that we use them more than your average person.

"So I don't usually write negative reviews, but I have to for this one. I bought these to replace a Tower cable system which I used for 5 years and finally snapped. These don't even come close to it. The bands and clips feel flimsy. The door anchor is fine, but it feels like if you pull too hard it'll pull the whole door off the hinges. My two issues are the fact that really cannot do any exercise below the waist since there is no way to anchor at the bottom of the door, unless your door is hung poorly and is flush to the floor. The bands are also way too long. I'd recommend try another product, this one just doesn't cut the mustard.",1.0

"Not,what I expected",1.0
Door anchor is poorly made.. It seems like the anchor itself broke into pieces as I was using it and slapped me right on my face! Luckily I wear glasses otherwise I'm sure I would've lost an eye! This is terrible and could lead to a lawsuit ! Anyways I just want to warn others to buy a separate anchor or buy from a different merchant,1.0
I used this product for just a month or so before three of the bands broke. I now have a welt on my back due to the last one. I highly recommend NOT purchasing these items as they are DANGEROUS. If that hit my eye I would be blind. I should have learned my lesson after the first two snaps.,1.0

"They tore up after a little over a year, and I'm not very strong... Poor quality, also one of the handle got bent (but you can still work out with it).
When they tear it can be painful, so I suggest if you must buy this brand, replace every year.",1.0
"The cords tore after a year, and I'm not such a strong person. What can I say.... Careful, when they do it can be painful!
I'm not sure other products at same price point are better - if you gotta buy this brand, just change for a new one every few months.",1.0
"I got these to replace my Bodylastics (BL) which I purchased from Amazon in 2010.  The Black Mountain set is 1/3 the price of my BL set, but the hardware is not as robust.  In addition, these bands are rated a lot higher in resistance weight than the BL.  In the BL set, I used the 8 lb band for arm exercises.  With this set I use the 25-30 lb band.  Feels the same.  So if you really want a resistant band for some more strenuous exercise, these are probably not for you.  You can double up on bands if you like, but that's not the point.  The BL had two attachments which allowed you to secure the band to a closed door and pull against it.  Very good for traveling.  This one requires hardware that needs to be mounted if you are going to use them in such a fashion.  The 25-30 lb band I use provides for smooth, not jerky motion.  I like that.  This has a lifetime warranty.  We'll see.
Overall: they work.  Good for light workout.
On Second Thought: I couldn't figure out why I had ordered a set of bands that required metal brackets for a door.  If you've ever used a set of metal brackets on a door, say to just hang clothes, you know that they: 1) scar the door; 2) usually prevent closing; 3) scar the door frame.  So I rechecked the product display on Amazon only to find out that the bands were supposed to come with a cloth door anchor.  Instead, they substituted the metal brackets.  I returned the whole set.  The cloth door anchor does not mar and permits you to use the bands on trips.",1.0

"The set seemed sturdy and well-made, however the bands were too long for my body height to be of any real use and the door gadget didn't work very well.

"Looking at the reviews online I thought this would be an easy way to add some resistance workouts to my routine. After I was injured using this product a just a few minutes ago, I immediately went online to post this review. This is a dangerous product. After 10 seconds the black band BROKE doing simple shoulder press ups. The door anchor with the red band attached worked for a few reps before sliding through and the anchor HIT me like a sling shot at maximum force. Use this at your own risk. DO NOT send me a replacement.",1.0
"Horrible! Made of what can only be described as cheap, substandard material, do not buy these if you plan to use them regularly.  My wife used these 1 to 2 times per week since we bought them in June 2014.  The green and blue straps broke after only 10 months of use.  After 2 months, we noticed that the rubber had begun to deteriorate on all of the bands.  I will never Black Mountain Products resistance bands again.",1.0

Basically, while I was doing bicep curls the handle of the band lost connection with the band and it snapped and hit me in the foot! Luckily it was only a slight bruise. The peg that keeps the clip attached to the band is too small for the hole. It comes out with even minor pressure applied. I thought I had a lemon until I read other reviews with this same issue. Stay away from this product until they fix this issue!! It's seriously not safe.",1.0
"Seem to just fine, sturdy, almost professional grade, nice colors, great bag....no complaints!",1.0
"Not too terribly impressed with this product. It doesn't attach to my door properly and I fear it coming out and smacking me in the face with every pull of the bands. This product may work out for a beginner, but I am an active person in pretty decent shape (except for some areas that I need to tone) so it really doesn't do much for me.",1.0
Not for serious bodybuilders.,1.0
Upon opening the package I realize that one of the cheap clips cannot open properly in order to take it off the handle.  This renders the set unusable for me.  Now I have to deal with the hassle of returns?  Bummer.,1.0
never used these as they are not as easy as i thought,1.0
Great idea.. However it snapped as soon as I started actually trying to get any sort of resistance. BE CAREFUL. I now have a MASSIVE welt covering my entire back.,1.0

"I ordered this set of resistance bands which were delivered in a plastic bag and then placed inside a vinyl traveling bag. Upon opening the plastic bag that the bands and handles were in they were covered in mold, pollen, dust and spider egg sacks. This was disgusting. How can someone ship this item when it was so blatantly DIRTY. Very disappointed in this company and the way in which they deliver their products.",1.0
"I found 3 issues with the BMP bands.  1) The clips on the ends of the bands are just too small.  I kept pinching my fingers when removing or connecting the handles. The clips would sometimes stick open also.  I finally replaced the clips with larger ones that were made better.  2) The sides of the handles kept rubbing on my hand. I am small boned but do wear a size large glove (but not when using the bands).  Also, the rings on the handles are too small, making it difficult to attach multiple bands.  I finally replaced the handles with larger ones that also had bigger rings. 3) I tested the resistance of the bands and found that I could only get the rated resistance when the bands were doubled back and connected to the same point. On a single (end to end) arrangement the resistance measured 50 to 60% of the advertised resistance when stretched to a length of 10 feet (measured from the end of the clip to the end of the clip).  I realize all manufactures rate their bands differently so maybe BMP's tests are different than mine.  I just used a fish scale and observed the reading over a specific distance. Another manufacturer's bands measured closer to their advertised resistance however on the same end to end arrangement.  With the above modifications and knowledge of the actual resistance I am able to get the workout I want but I will not be purchasing anymore BMP products.",1.0
I keep snapping these. I've broken three of them in the last year. I wouldn't recommend them for anyone. I'll have to contact their warranty department.,1.0
"I bought these to use for the popular P90X program. They worked well enough for the first couple of weeks although I felt I wasn't getting as much as I could out of the workout using bands compared with free weights. After a couple of weeks, the red band started showing signs of tearing on both ends about an inch from where the band connects with the handle. It seemed to still hold up to stress so I didn't think much of it; however, later that week, one end snapped and whipped my back, leaving a huge red, stinging imprint in its wake lol. I wrote an email to Black Mountain's customer support address to see about using the ""Lifetime Warranty"" that's advertised to get a replacement band; it's been about a month since sending the email and I've yet to hear back from them. I went out and bought free weights to use instead and I'm MUCH happier! As suspected, I wasn't getting the most from my workout with the bands. Using the free weights provides a much more intense workout than I experienced with the bands and my muscles are actually sore the next day. If you're at all like me and contemplating using resistance bands over free weights, do yourself a favor...save yourself time and money and go with the free weights...I wish I did!",1.0
We could never get this to work worth a darn.  It was a waste of money and has sat in a closet after numerous attempts to make this work.,1.0

The company offers a 90 day LIMITED warranty. When I inquired about the warranty they told me that incidental damage isn't covered which means when they snap after normal usage BMP will NOT replace them. I'd say don't waste your money if you plan on working out with these for more than 90 days and even then the company still refuses to replace the red and black bands which both snapped at the exact same place (right next to the hand grip). Bought these for use with the p90x program and they snapped after less than 50 days of usage. Very dissatisfied.,1.0
"I brought these as an alternative to weight training for my female clients, and for myself when travelling. I was very disappointed when the red band pop it came right out of the hole, while doing a basic shoulder press they should consider better reinforcements to keep the bands lock in the hole. Will not recommend these to my fellow trainers.",1.0
"I loved the bands for about 2 weeks! My workout was much more portable.  I loved it, that is, until while doing bicep curls with the door anchor under my door frame, the bulky knob slipped out from under the door and I got hit in the face with 30 pounds worth of resistance band!  I was fortunate enough to not be seriously injured (I hope.. provided the blurry area in the vision of my right eye comes back to normal).  The bulky knob on the opposite side of the door has the capacity to compress!!! They didn't use a hard object, so it wore down over time, compressing more and more until it slipped under, resulting in a great deal of pain, and a black eye.  Word to BMP: FIX THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO SERIOUSLY INJURE SOMEONE!

As far as the bands go, they're great.  Sure.  But be careful about that anchor....",1.0

"In a split second my life changed because of this product.  I was a happy, healthy 64 year old lady just retired and looking forward to fun.  I thought I was safe.  A Certified Personal Trainer gave me the exercises and looked at this set of exercise cords.  One month later while performing one of the exercises the D-Ring came out of the handle and with full force -- slammed into my left eye!  The impact broke everything in my eye!  I couldn't see for over a week and when the blunt trauma finally cleared, the surgeon explained that in an instant the D-Ring caused severe traumatic glaucoma, cataract, broken iris, plus other injuries.  It is hard to convey to you how awful this injury has been but I am going to try because NO ONE should ever use bungee cords or exercise cords because of the danger.  Two surgeons told me that cords are quickly replacing BB gun injuries as the number one eye injury.  Instead of being healthy, I made 37 visits to the eye surgeon in 2012; had two extremely difficult and long surgeries to rebuild/repair what was damaged by this product.  Was using this product worth the potential strength benefit?  ABOLUTELY NOT!  Use weights!  I am blessed and fortunate -- I can still see.  I had 20/30 vision in my left eye...now it is like looking through frosted glass = blurry, halos around every light, and limited sight -- cannot read, cannot see most of what is on a PC screen and EXTREME Pain.  Today is the one year anniversary!  My injured eye is always uncomfortable because of the trabeculectomy surgery to rebuild the drain field so my sight would be saved.  I am truly blessed!  I had a surgeon who is gifted beyond belief and I am eternally thankful I can see.  Don't buy a product you cannot trust--these D-Rings are at best flimsy!",1.0

My kids were not around and my glasses did not crack. The plastic grip crushed (few days ago). These bands are not comfortable.

"I wish I would have taken the warnings I read in some of the other reviews seriously!

I purchased these bands and loved them the first 2 times I used them. The handles make the bands very comfortable to hold. They seemed to be high quality. I am 5'3"" and the stretch was plenty for me, though if you are tall I'm not so sure this set of bands would work for you. After my first 2 uses I would have given these bands 5 out of 5 stars, but after today's workout there's no chance!

While I was using the yellow band the hardware snapped and hit my leg. Thankfully it hit our concrete garage floor before hitting my leg. I've attached photos of the hardware issue--  as you can see one of the handles becomes disconnected even with the slightest amount of pull. It seems that the peg that keeps the clip attached to the band is too small for the hole.

All in all I would say don't waste your money! I'm going to cough up a little more money and buy actual dumbbells.",1.0
I bought set of these bands in april which lasted 3 months. I don't work out regularly but black and red bands broke. I thought it might be my fault.

"I have used these resistance bands sporadically, at best.  I generally only take these on vacation to help be consistent with my exercise routine.  Two have failed at the attachment end (to the handle).  The first was the heavy yellow and today the red.  If you have never broken an elastic exercise band, let me tell you; it hurts.  Even the small diameter bands can cause a great deal of pain.  Will try other manufacturer.",1.0
"I had only been exercising with these bands for two weeks when they began to break. Heartily disappointed.

Purchased this product in December 2011 as a present for my sister and her husband. It is now March 2012 (3 months later) and one of the metal rings of the band broke during a workout session and cut my sister's husband leg. It also bruised his foot and arm.

"The materials and construction are top notch.  I did return these however, due to the fact that the exercises for the legs are not enough for me.

"The red band(heaviest resistance) started tearing the first time I used it, so for obvious reason I stopped and tried the black one. The black one lasted fine for the exercise, but the next day it started ripping in the same place as the red one. I will not use the other colors as they simply do not have enough resistance.  A big minus is that this set has only one pair of handles and to switch from one handle to another is a big inconvenience and a waist of time.",1.0

"its a cute little knife. but it is even smaller than it seems like in the photo. I wanted a super small karambit similar to some of the hidden karambits used traditionally. While the blade is just where I want it to be the handle is so small that it makes the whole affair a joke. There is no way to get a four finger grip on this thing, and I have small girly hands. Also the ring is so small as to make it not possible to get the ring over anything but the first two phalanx of the finger. It makes for a cute little utility knife only. Something cool for a small person learning about knives would be an ok use for it.

"I rarely write reviews and almost never write negative ones, but on occasion I feel honor-bound to warn others against repeating my mistakes.  So there is no confusion: I am only reviewing Outers here, as Amazon's service and prices are both consistently excellent in my experience.

Quite simply, this Outers cleaning kit is garbage.  My first warning that I had wasted my money on a cheap kit came upon receipt of the package.  The thicker of the two included cleaning rods had its plastic handle completely broken to the point where it slid right off the brass, rendering it unusable.  From the nature of the damage, it was pretty evident that this happened at the factory, not in transit.  ""No problem,"" I figured, ""I have my one-piece graphite rod, which is the only one I plan to use anyway.""  I bought it for the brushes and jags, after all, not the rods.

So just yesterday I went out to the range with my brand new, custom-built .308 rifle and started shooting.  After a bit of shooting, I went to clean the barrel per my gunsmith's instructions.  The .30 brush went through the barrel much too easily for my tastes, but I kept going.  Then I screwed the .30 plastic jag onto the rod to push through a few patches.  Well, I doubled up the patches to give it more pressure, as the jag with just one patch was going through too easily (just like the brush did).  The jag is total cheap crap, I discovered, as it promptly broke off *WHILE* *INSIDE* *MY* *BARREL*.  The plastic threaded part remained stuck inside the graphite rod, so I couldn't even screw the rod back onto the jag and pull it out.  I had to send the now-empty rod (*very* carefully) down from the crown and push the jag and patch out that way.

Furious, I packed up all my equipment, drove to a nearby sporting goods store, and sought help with getting the threaded part of the jag out of the rod.  It took the poor guy quite a while to do it because the plastic was just so soft, but eventually he got it.  On another store employee's advice, I bought A Hoppe's brass jag and a new Hoppe's .30 brush-and-hurricane-brush combo package.  Those are all working beautifully.  Hoppe's, he told me, builds the best cleaning equipment out of all the popular, mainstream gun maintenance companies.

Well, my lesson has been learned.  I will never buy *anything* made by Outers again; their equipment is cheaply made rubbish.  Hereafter I'm sticking with Hoppe's except when and where I become convinced--from personal experience, never from others' reports--another company offers higher-quality equipment.  And for the rest of my life Outers will never get a second chance.

Don't buy. Rods are flemsy when screwed together and rod handle broke on first use. I would give a negative rating if it was possible.,1.0
I am extremely disappointed in this gun cleaning kit. The first time I used it the plastic cloth holders broke off inside the gun rods. Absolutely the worst gun cleaning kit I have ever seen.

Piece of crap. The black push rod handle cracked in half the first time I used it and the copper bristles fall out of the pieces. Lots of sizes to use but what's the point when they are all low quality garbage,1.0
"I received this but didn't use it until after the 30 day return period so no help for me. The large rifle handle was loose and broken, cheap plastic. There are too many adapters needed to use this thing, making it flimsy and potentially damaging valuable firearms. One more problem and this kit hits the garbage.",1.0
Typical chinese garbage!  Broke during the cleaning.  God help us Mr. Trump bring quality products and jobs back to the US.,1.0
Case fastens good and looks nice but the first time I put a rod together and gave the slightest pressure running it through my rifle it broke at the threads on one piece and bent at the other. I would never buy anything from this company again. I have to believe there production would be just as shoddy with everything.,1.0
"Piece of crap. First time I used it, one of the black handles broke off when I was running patches, with no pressure on handle. Waste of money, go with Hoppes.",1.0
"I bought this from Walmart for the same price as Amazon. On my first use, the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one. I will never buy anything with Outers written on it. I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit.",1.0
Within one hour the play chute had 2 large holes in the middle where the screen is sewn. Very cheap,1.0
I was totally disappointed with this.  The fabric was too stiff not like the ones we have seen in preschool. Good thing I didn't pay more than twenty dollars .  I guess you get what you paid for,1.0
this is more like a glorified round table cloth.  the kids (4 kids age ranges from 2-5) barely played with this.  so so sad bc now i have this bright round table cloth that calshed with everything in my house uuugh lol,1.0
"Be very careful.  The description of the parachute ends with the following, ""Comes with its own nylon carrying bag.  Made of 70-denier nylon.""  I interpreted this as meaning the parachute was, ""Made of 70-denier nylon.""  It is NOT.  Only the bag is made of nylon.  I hope this was not meant to mislead potential customers.",1.0
"I have two children (ages almost 2 and almost 6), we have never enjoyed this toy.  You need at LEAST 6 people in a circle in order to play any game on this.  The parachute is a fine size for indoor usage (not too small of a room), but too little to get underneath.  I've been wanting a parachute for my kids for a long time now and I regret this purchase.  In order to get SOME use out of it, we've put it over tables to use as a tent, but honestly blankets work better.",1.0
Real nice Knife. But hard to open. Broke my thumbnail trying to get it open. Open really hard!,1.0
"Looks fantastic. Fits in my pocket wonderfully.

And the absolute worst out of the box blade I've ever bought. I can't even get the blade to trim my fingernail. Both blades have a jagged, very rough finish. I have a 7 year old $20 winchester Wal-Mart knife that has never been this bad on it worst day. I was driving home and was so disgusted with it that I almost threw it out the window. I'll try and put an edge on it when I get home, but I've honestly never seen a brand new, out of the box blade with an edge that ruined. This is my first Case knife and for the money I could have gotten another tenacious from spyderco and been in heaven.
If I can get an edge on it, I'll leave another review.
Like I said, it looks wonderful and feels great in my hand and my pocket, but In over 30 years of buying knives, I've never seen a blade that bad out of the box.",1.0
The blades just tuned black after a couple of uses.,1.0
Warning! Product was used! Returning it...,1.0
"This knife is a Rust Bucked!  Yes it is beautiful.  However, if you do not wipe the blades down each and every day ( and who has time for that) it will indeed rust!  I received knife as a gift and I loved it and kept it in my pocked every day for the past 5 months.  I rarely cut anything with it for fear of messing it up!  I periodically opened the blades to admire it and  and even put some oil on blades.  Then Hot Summer weather came.  Last week I took it out of my pocked and opened the blades and to my dismay I saw several heavy rust spots!  I mean HEAVY rust.  I sanded the rust down with light 300 grot sand paper and removed it - but the rust had already etched into the blades!  Today I tried some Flitz metal polish on it and that unfortunately even removed part of the etched in Canoe with the Indian!!!!  The knife accumulates moisture on the blades merely from being in your pants pocket as you are doing outdoor work in the summer!  Few people have time to check and examine blades each and every day; besides with the sharp blades it is dangerous!  I loved the way it looked before the rust attacked it.....but now it looks like a cheap 5 and Dime imitation!",1.0
"The ad for the item got my attention, the description of the item was pretty good, but my imagination can only take me so far and the like the saying goes a picture is worth a thousand words.  I tried to find something that I could click to to the view the item clearly, but there was none.  My suggestion is a clear color picture.  That's is why you lost this sale.  Thank you.",1.0
knife case too tight ... had to return the product then ... would take superman or woman or some kind of body builder just to pull the knife out of this sheath then ... maybe i just got a lemon though?,1.0
Not sure how case put their name on this one. Tip was completely bent upon arrival and I have to pay to send this back.  I will never buy/own a case knife ever again after this product.  By far it would be the worst knife in my collection.  Couldn't even give this thing away. Do Not Buy!!,1.0

Maybe I just got a defective product but judging from another reviewer with a similar problem it seems like a reoccuring problem. I will never buy another Coleman cooler again...",1.0

Received item waited for Christmas to set up and scoring system didn't work right out of the box.  Hopeful either park and Sun or Amazon will rectify this.  To be continued.  The kids are not happy :(,1.0
"We decided to purchase this even though there were some low reviews because we couldn't find a different one anywhere else.  I wish we hadn't bought it.  Pulled from the box, the top was already broken.  We were able to fix this easily but the overall construction is very poor.  Within an hour some of the numbers on the scoreboard quit appearing.  I would return this if it was possible.  I am disappointed and don't expect it to hold up due to poor quality.",1.0
do not buy this fold a hoop.it falls apart. the box broke very poorly made..not worth the money you pay.,1.0
"Christmas morning my son tried pulling this hunk of junk out of the box only to pull out pieces.  This cabinet is beyond cheap.  Its simple glued in four corners with two staples.  We returned for another thinking this was just a bad one.  The new hoop arrived in a couple days.  The new hoop was even worse then the first.  Every corner was blown apart, nothing glued, nothing stapled.  ABSOLUTE TRASH!  Do not waste your money like I did.  In my 12 years of buying things online this is by far the worst piece of crap I have every received.  Thanks park and sun for making such a worthless product.  Oh ya one more thing, try using a couple screws in your building.  Screws are amazing technology, your company should try it.",1.0
Item stopped working within months.  First it would start to score with no one playing it.  Now it doesn't even keep score.  Now all we have is an indoor basketball hoop.  Total waste of money.,1.0
"8/15/2014 - Update
Barely been used in years now, terrible.  Going to take it down, chuck it in the garbage when I have the time.

Original review:

I was fairly disappointed in this toy.  Here are my issues with it:
1) The basketballs get stuck between the rim and the netting while you're playing.  As a result you either have to run around the side and knock the ball out, during the game, or you leave the stuck ball, and play with one less basketball and interference.
2) The collapsible / extendable ramp is extremely weak and flimsy.  The extending arm broke within the first hour of play, because my son leaned on it while knocking out a stuck ball.  See #1
3) The balls tend to roll off the ramp, because the ramp has no ""catch"" for the balls.  So you end up using only 2 balls because the 3rd keeps rolling off the ramp.
4) Fit and finish of the mounting bracket holes don't line up with mounting bracket well, so you have to force the bolts through
5) Mounting bracket is positioned right on top of the control panel, which makes it very difficult to get your fingers into the space to tighten the mounting nut
6) The instructions indicate to put the cabinet 6-7 feet above the ground, but the instructions do NOT indicate the clearance necessary from the ceiling, about 5 inches, (you need some extra space because of the way it mounts to the wall).  In my case I mounted it too near the ceiling, and then needed to remove the wall mount, lower it, and remount.  Sort of a pain in the butt.",1.0
We ordered this for a christmas gift for our 8 year old son.  After just 3 shots the basket disconnected from the rim due to a poor weld -- the joint between the basket and the plate that connects the basket to the backboard was completely rusted.  We are trying to contact the manufacturer.,1.0
This board is a piece of crap. It took me only a few tries to realize it was a bug mistake and I needed to buy the more expensive quality board.,1.0
"I know it's great because is WAY cheaper than the Indo Board or any other substitute, but it's really a bad product. I wanted a cheap board so I bought this one but after using it one day it started falling apart. Materials are HORRIBLE.

I'm now buying a more expensive one because I really liked the concept of the board, but this one would last less than a month. Too bad that is the only cheap board, but trust me, is not worthy.",1.0
The first one we received had a crack in the board. We were able to exchange it in a timely manner no problem which is the only reason it gets 1 star (also you can't give less). When we opened up the replacement we discovered the new board to be in pieces.,1.0
"I didn't realiza when I purchased that inexpensive meant poorly made and designed. It did not run smoothly, and it chewed up the ""rollers"" (which you have to assemble). I am returning it for a refund, hoping to have no issues with that.",1.0
"The board is of high quality but the cylinder is very poor.  Instead of being a solid block of wood, is a collection of pieces that leave the action when balancing inconsistent and sloppy.  Having grown up with a much higher quality balance board, I was very dissapointed.",1.0
Your preaty mush spending $50.00 on a peice of ply wood. I got this 4 days ago and its already broken and given me many splinters.,1.0
"This product is beautiful in design and I love that there is more than one game to be played.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for it coming broken.  This was supposed to be a Christmas present and I cannot tell you the importance of it to the person receiving it.  To be fair, I am sure it was probably damaged in shipping, however, if it got damaged twice then the company providing this product should package it better.  It needs to have all four corner with styrofoam pieces because someone must have dropped it before or after it left the center... TWICE! I feel that it would deserve 5 stars if the product was better packed for shipping.  The first time was damaged beyond repair on one corner making it impossible to play.  The second time there are smaller cracks in two corners and I am just not going to waste any more time shipping back and receiving a new one only for it to be damaged again.  I have lost faith in getting a quality product.  But as I have said, the importance of this product in the timing in our lives is so great that I am forced to try to glue it back together and hope for the best.  If it breaks beyond repair after that, I will just eat the money.  Thank you, whoever, for making my heartfelt gesture a failure...",1.0
"I bought this item for Christmas, but it was shattered to pieces when I opened the box Christmas morning.",1.0
"This product was purchased to counter the expensive cost of the Indo boards. The big problem with the board is the roller that you have to assemble from half a dozen pieces of cutout plywood or composite wood. After bolting the pieces together and giving it a spin, I was immediately disappointed by the performance of this. Then upon inspection of the material used for the roller, I noticed immediate wear or deformation of the pressed wood substance and expect this piece to be useless within a month of use.
I have used other boards to include the Indo boards for hours on end with no such problems. Most of the other makes use a solid piece of wood or molded plastic with great results.

If I had it to do over I would spend the extra money and get the Indo board without hesitation.",1.0
"This product looked  like it was going to be great from the picture on-line, but once we got it opened and saw how it had to be put together and the cheap wooden parts, we were very disappointed.  We did follow the instructions to put it together (the ""roller"" part is a combination of round and square pieces of wood that alternate on a metal rod)
and found that it didn't even work.  Our overall opinion is that this Balance board will be the cheapest one you find on-line, in price as well as in quality!",1.0
"I had a dangerous experience while testing this product.  I bought the balance board with excitement because it resembled others I have seen before.  I had an elementary aged child test it out.  He was so enthusiastic!  I held his hand as he got on the board, when he felt comfortable he let go.  Oh my goodness!  That board went dangerously fast left and then right.  It slid out from under him.  He landed on his side on our carpet and was---thankfully---fine.  After telling this story to an experienced skateboarder and hockey player, he asked to try the balance board on carpet as well.  He is an adult with much 'balance' in his life.  The board went wild under him and was difficult to control.  He agreed, not a good fit to use unless surpervised by an adult with elementary aged children.  It is dangerous.  I suppose if you are an adrenline junky, this might be fun.  And a good project for children.  Tell them the story above and have them problem solve how to make this balance board better.  As I believe the top is good, but the circular cylinder underneath creates hazardous curves.  Children will explore the world around them trying to figure out balance.  A wonderful thing for the brain and then maybe they can create a better balance board for the market!",1.0
"This arrived on the 7th day after ordering, but when gently removed from the box, turned out to be broken.  The pine dowels that make up one sidewall were diagonally broken through, and the lowest of them was broken in two places, and had therefore fallen off.  I could have glued them, and still put it to use, but the playing surface of the board is also split along two parallel cracks, about 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 inches inside the broken sidewall, ruining the playing surface.",1.0
Silly me I did not do my research. First of all this company's name is obviously Carrom. However it has nothing to do with the official game of Carrom. You cannot play the real game of Carrom on this board. Neither of the two sides of this board have an official layout of the real Carrom game. To bad the manufacturer does not emphasis this in their description. Maybe they think that people won't buy it if that's what they really want. I was also surprised to find that there are no YouTube demonstrations on how to use this game board from the Carrom Company. I did find two video's about the game board that were less than a minute long but they were not for instructional purposes. Maybe someone has found some non-company demo's but I could not. Regardless I will keep the board as it was cheap enough. And I do mean cheap. The cue sticks are really just dowel rods and one of mine was already warped so I just went to the hardware store and bought another one. You can buy a real Carrom Game Board from Amazon but they are not cheap. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING!!!!,1.0
"Very disappointed in the horrible quality. It took all of four uses (by grandma and 8-year-old daughter - not exactly rough users) for a dime-size part of the fake wood surface to come off, exposing some paper-like material. My husband grew up with a carrom board made out of real wood and said this is nothing like it. We will send it back. Too bad because those few rounds of play were fun.",1.0
Just got it in the mail today. Was already broken in the box. The cheap plastic corner was broken off and the wood side was coming apart from the particle board and the corner wiring was coming out. It seemed like the whole unit was flimsy and falling apart. Tried calling customer service 3ish pacific time but no answer. Waiting to hear back by email with instructions on how to return. Don't want another one. Poor quality not worth the money.,1.0
Very small! Not worth it!,1.0

"Flimsy, inadequate packaging resulted in a broken board. Embarrassed to have given away a broken XMas gift. Managed to glue it to make it usable again, but feel $30 is too much for a board that needs to be repaired before it can even be used.",1.0
"The game looks good, put came apart when pulled from the box. Once we got it out, it was evident that all of the sides were detached from the board or loose. We had to straighten it and re-glue it.",1.0
Very poor quality.  arrived damaged so I returned it.  Looked flimsy so would not have lasted very long anyway.,1.0
"I was disappointed to see my carrom board arrive broken. Of course amazon will take it back, but the effort to repackage this product and take it to a shipping company is simply a pain. I have about ten carrom boards for the recreation program that I run, and this one is definitely the cheapest as far as feel goes. Poorly crafted.",1.0
"I am not sure what this product is! It is definitely not what I grew up playing, or consider a carrom board. Not sure how it qualifies for large.

If I didn't get it on a super deal, I would definitely be returning it.",1.0
"This is not the same quality product that I grew up with. My parents purchased a carrom board in the 1960's, that received much use, and still does from the grandkids. That board of the '60's is very sturdy, is still in great shape, even though as kids we were not very kind to it. The carrom board that was shipped to us, didn't survive the shipping process intact(at least I assume that may have been the cause). We opened the box with the intent of having a fun evening of playing carroms. The board came out of the box with the frame around the board broken, two of the plastic corners were broken, of course the frame would not stay attached to the board, the corner pockets were falling out also. This carrom board doesn't seem to be very sturdy. The box that the carrom board was shipped in was undamaged, remarkable! (Maybe it was not the shipping process.) We had no inkling that the contents would be in poor shape. I packaged everything up the best I could and sent it back. So very disappointing.",1.0
"Ordered this for a gift for my niece, and it arrived broken in half and my sister said it was made out of cheap partical board. So, it goes without saying...

addendum: I called customer service to complain, and say that my sister did not want to return the item as it was too much trouble. The only thing they offered was to refund me $15 which is half the original price. Not sure I feel this was the best they could have done...",1.0
too big! way tooooo big!  cheaply made and packaged. if u are not planning on buying the quadpoid then don't bother buying this exact item.,1.0
"The game is much like what I played with at camp, except the quality.  The unit came apart as it was pulled out of the box.  The construction is really poor.  The pockets are on a flimsy wire and probably will not last.  The rails do not stay together.  I am surprised that they were not even glued in to the end corner pieces.  After several frustrating games, I screwed the corners together to keep it from coming apart.  You may be able to glue it.

As far as some of the other posts complaining about sticks and game pieces, they seem to be the same as I can recall.  So no complaints.

I gave one star due to having to screw the sides together.",1.0
"This MIGHT be a good product for a 3-5 year old who doesn't kick with much power. However, after only a few sessions from a 7 year old the cords have already broken. I wish I could get my money back for such trashy equipment and give it 0 stars. ",1.0
Didn't even make it through the summer before the net snapped on the bottom from minimal use.,1.0
"Franklin ships this soccer goal with thin bungee straps that secure the net to the frame.  As the soccer ball bounces off the net, friction causes the bungee straps to rub against the metal frame.  After a few months of an 8-year old playing with the goal a few times a week, the straps started to fray and break.  After a year, 2/3 of the bungee straps are broken and the goal is unusable.  I reached out to Franklin support and the net and straps are under warranty for only three months!  However, replacement bungee cords are available for purchase!  This appears to be an intentional design flaw to drive part replacement sales. So, if you'd like a rebounder to last more than a few months before it starts falling apart, look for a different brand that uses rubber rings instead of bungee cords.  It is well worth the extra assembly time to get a more durable product that can be left outside in the weather.  The short warranty window is indicative of how long you can expect this product to last.",1.0
"Purchased this as a gift for our grandson.  Within 30 minutes of assembly the ball went throught the net!!!  Unfortunately in getting this back to us, we missed the return deadline, so we are stuck with this and our grandson doesn't yet have a rebounder.",1.0
"Horrible experience , thought its soccer goal and found out just net with stand waste of money want to return",1.0
This broke the second time my daughter age 13 used it....we have had other rebounders in the past that last years,1.0
I do not recommend this at all! After one kick out of the box the net tore!,1.0
Really unhappy with this purchase. I purchased as a gift for my niece and nephew and they just set it up with weather clearing up. After about 10 minutes of kicking balls at the goal the net broke. This was from a 4 year old boy and 8 year old girl. I played college soccer so I hate to see what would happen if I kicked a ball at it. Because we took awhile to set it up while the weather warmed up I can no longer return it. I wouldn't recommend this goal as I am not sure it will last long.,1.0
I have not yet opened the box as it's a gift. The mailing box was undamaged but the products box was severely damaged on one side. I have pictures for documentation.,1.0
Item seems fine but package came without instructions and missing hardware. Went to Franklin sports for instructions and then relized it's also supposed to come with screws that this didn't come with,1.0
Don't buy this.  Got a hole in the net the first day.  Will try to contact Franklin sports because I waited too long to return to Amazon.  Pretty bad that a 10 year old can kick a ball through it,1.0
"Design flaw:  The lower cross-bar (along the front that sits at the bottom), bends slightly upward in the middle due to the tension of the elastics holding the net tight.  So, if you kick the ball along the ground, even with a strong kick, it hits the bar and not the net, so there is no ""rebounder"" effect.  I and my boys (ages 7 and 8) were really disappointed by this, so unfortunately, after the initial couple of trials and disappointments, it's never been used.",1.0
Net fell apart quickly.  Now all we have is the frame.,1.0

The shipment packet was all tarnished and scuffed just like a returned item would look like. This would not have been a problem in itself except that there were missing critical parts. I had to improvise to assembly the net. Unfortunately only after 3 uses the net broke. This seller clearly does not respect the buyers not only by sending used packets for what should have been a new item but also the minimum quality level is not existing. Might as well label it - One Time Use ! Do not recommend this product,1.0
"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for our children. Life has been quite busy, and we are now finally able to assemble it---or rather try to assemble it. It was missing a critical piece and is now a pile of junk. In addition, there weren't any instructions. When it arrived, the box was all taped up, as though it had been purchased, returned and then re-sold. Obviously not inspected for parts before it went out again!!! We live in the Adirondacks. Even if we could have assembled it, it would have been in May, beyond the  return point allowed. This totally stinks!!!",1.0
"I bought this for my 14 year old nephew's birthday.  He got it all set up and the netting ripped after the second time he kicked the ball at it.  Not sure if it was a defect or very cheaply made, but I was not very impressed with the quality of this product.  Unless you're buying it for a young child who can't kick the ball very hard, I would avoid this product.",1.0
"the net has already ripped. My two daughters ages 10 and 15 use it and the net now has a hole in it. I purchased this on May 8th, and the net was very thin in some places and frayed.  hoped it would be ok, but just not great quality. This may be adequate for someone learning, but for any skilled player, or someone using some decent amount of force I would say this may not be what you are looking for.",1.0
We had this up for 2 days for my 11 years old grandson when he kicked a ball and it put a hole in the net.  Would have been perfect for him if the netting material was stronger.  Why put out a product that is suppose to handle repeated soccer balls kicks if it is going to tear right away?,1.0

I'm still waiting for a response, other than the automated one I got. Maybe I'll post another review on the actual product if we ever get to use it.",1.0
"At first, the product looked as advertised. As we put it together and started using it, it became more and more of a disappointment. The bottom of frame is bending where the poles are ""clicked into place"" after cords are put on to hold net.

"I have purchased two of these. The first one when my son was 11 lasted about 1 year. For the price, we got a lot of hours of fun and it was a good product. The second one lasted about 2 months. The week link is in the bottom front pole. Even the net tension makes it warp and after some strong kicks from a 12 year old, it bends up about a foot and makes the goal unusable.

There are three real problems. It comes with only a 90 day warranty, the only available repair part is the net, and there is zero customer service. I emailed customer service to see if I could get a replacement bottom front rail and they simply never answered me.

This is an affordable rebounder for young children but stay away if anyone can kick a little bit hard or you are expecting a friendly and responsive customer service.

UPDATE: I found a solution for the lower front pole. I took two pieces of concrete rebar that was scrap from a construction site, removed the pole, inserted the rebar inside the pole, and reattached. That pole will never bend again! :)",1.0
We assembled this item on a Wednesday and by Sunday the net had already broken in several places. My kid had not even used the net before it frayed.,1.0
Very cool but it was way too small for my husband's head. Disappointing,1.0

"One of these big, heavy, griddles will fit smartly over two burners and let you make a lot of (for example) pancakes or French toast at one time. If you season as directed, and use oil or fat in addition, sticking won't be a problem.
Lodge cast iron is great, but this griddle is not well-designed. Its two-sidedness at first seems clever but in fact,  by being ""reversible,"" with both sides usable for cooking, the ""seasoning"" on the side toward the burner gets wrecked each time you cook. In addition,  being virtually handleless, it is nearly impossible to move when hot. It's meant to stay put - on your stove.  You have to leave it alone for a good hour, before washing up. Later, in the sink, the weight and size of this griddle is inconvenient. (Cast iron scratches porcelain.) I went back to my pans.",1.0
"I have another cast iron kitchen product and am very happy with that one. So I bought this griddle, seasoned it according to instructions and started using it. However, everything sticks to it, making it hell to clean up. I even reseasoned it after one big clean up job, but that didn't help either. I now bought a calphalon griddle and couldn't be happier.",1.0
"First thing I noticed is how extremely heavy this thing is!  It is very difficult to maneuver.
I followed the seasoning instructions, but on first use, my pancakes stuck like cardboard with super glue [imagine the expletives that came out of my mouth].
I also noticed that the heat does not distribute evenly, so you really can't use the entire cooking surface.
Needless to say, this thing is sitting in the garage awaiting my next yard sale.",1.0

I have used it twice and my daughter tries to use it about 3 times a week. After about 5 uses we had to tighten the hammock to the highest notch on the stand. After another week...my daughter's bottom scrapes the ground in the hammcok. She only weighs 105 pounds.

"I picked one of these up at Target for 14.99 and put it on my bike today and it is a piece of garbage.  I'll be taking it right back.

The mounting bracket is terrible and doesnt fit the lock well.

The lock itself is covered with a plastic covering that moves around when inserting on the mounting bracket and covers the locks so you cant place the U portion on the locking mechanism.

Once you finally finagle it the plastic cover around so you can secure it.  The lock itself wobbles back and forth when you ride.  It doesnt matter how tight you have it attached to the mounting bracket because it moves around inside the plastic covering.

I don't think words can say how bad this lock is.  I thought buying from Master Lock would be a good thing.  I guess I was wrong.",1.0
"Piece of junk. Waste of money. Garbage. Does not deserve one star. Zero stars. Negative stars.

It felt like a piece of garbage from the first time I put the key in, but it's for a crappy around-the-town bike that I only paid $10 for, so I wasn't too concerned about high security. I found that every time I locked or unlocked my bike I'd spend a few seconds trying to get it to open. After a month it stopped working entirely--my bike was locked up at the train station a mile from my house.

I called Master and they immediately offered to send a replacement. What about my bike, I asked. Just cut it off, they said. I cut the lock off with bolt-cutters, and the next day the new lock came it the mail. Great, I thought, that first one must have been a lemon. But the new one was just as crappy, and like an idiot, I used it for three weeks, struggling to get it open every time.

And now my bike is locked up and this piece of crap won't open. In the morning I'll call Master and they'll offer to send me a new one. I will demand my money back, and eventually buy the Kryptonite that I should have gotten in the first place.",1.0
"The lock mechanism is the worst I've ever seen. My key jammed and broke off after only two months. Even under regular conditions, it'd still take an average of 60-90 seconds to lock or unlock the bike.

"All I can say is I'm glad that the lock broke when my bike was NOT locked up with it and when I did not have to rush out to pick up my son from daycare.

I bought this lock less than a week ago. I didn't even have time to install the bracket yet. The lock appeared to be working fine, but this morning when I went to lock up my bike at work, I stuck the key in and turned it, but wasn't able to unlock the lock. So I tried again and realized something was off. I looked at the key and in the key hold and realized THE TIP OF THE KEY HAD BROKEN OFF INTO THE KEY HOLE.

This happened on a perfect, warm, spring day (i.e. not in the dead of winter when things crack all of the time) and with normal use.

I bought this product from target, actually, and they only sold this brand so I didn't have the chance to check reviews, etc, or go with a more trusted brand such as kryptonite. Don't make my same mistake!",1.0
"Spend your money on something else.

After a few weeks the lock will be nearly impossible to open. You will have to spray it down with some type of lubricant to get it to open. After that, it will always be hard to open.

And not a wise idea since I need the lock to secure my bike. How about you send me a new bracket and we try that? Nope, they won't do that! So I am going back to Target for a store credit. Very disappointed with this lock. I guess you do get what you pay for. Rating should be a 1/2 star.",1.0
Well it would have been great but did not receive the ground sleeve in the package so....,1.0

The second package came that was to replace the first and it was beat up, the poles have dirt on them so this clearly was a returned item and we are missing the black sleeve for the poles to go into the ground and the air pump! This is very frustrating as this is a birthday present for my 10 year old daughter and she has been waiting for this and very upset that this is not complete again.",1.0

We double checked the directions to see if there was some secret step we missed but bottom line the ball was defective and won't stay inflated.  I'm sending both units back - very frustrating for 8 year old who's been waiting by the door everyday for her tetherball set to arrive.",1.0
"There are two problems: 1. within two minuted I opened the box and the ball broken (gas inlet got inside the ball when try to insert the needle to pump air). 2. The pole came in with 3 segments, however, it is a kind of too long but the length is not adjustable because the locking mechanism are inconveniently on the same piece (male part of the lock are both on the middle piece).",1.0

"This is a rip-off, piece of junk.  And becuase I didn't get a chance to try to install this within the 30 days (my son received it as a gift while we were away), now I can't return it!! The pole is two pieces that don't fit well together, so its wobbly and unstable, plus the pole is smaller than the sleeve so that increases the wobble of the pole - it's impossible to assemble this perpendicular to the ground. Plus the people at Park & Sun need to bone up on their math skills...The poles together are 11 ft. The sleeve is only about 10 inches. If you assemble according to directions, you have 10'2"" of pole height (with only 10"" in the ground, that's not very stable). Regulation tetherball is supposed to be 9 ft. - it says so right in the directions. They need to improve their quality control (make pieces that really fit together) and write better directions. The quality of the rope is very poor too -- it was already frayed coming out of the box. If you go as far as buying it, keep the package, becuase without it you can't return it and you're going to want to return it.",1.0
"I was concerned about the pole being assembled from two pieces, and that was exactly what was wrong with it. Once assembled, the pole was extremely wobbly since (1) the ground sleeve was too short to keep the lower pole piece firmly in place, and (2) the top pole section, once inserted into the bottom, is very unstable.  Better solution is to just go to your local fence supplier and buy an 11 foot section of 1 5/8 inch or 1 3/4 inch fence post and matching ground sleeve (min 12 inches, or longer - just make sure to extend the pole length to accomodate the longer ground sleeve).  Then just buy the rope and ball set.  My local fence co charged $25, and that included a cap and eye ring at one end so I could connect a teatherball rope.  FYI, I tried to contact Park and Sun for their feedback about my comments and they never bothered to reply.  Don't waste your money.",1.0

"Very poor net. For something I paid for near $100, I wouldn't expect to have to worry about the poor frame quality, how the things holding the net come off easily, and how wobbly it is when you hit the frame. Also, it seems the packagers that put the parts into a box are pretty lazy, because I had a part missing. To make matters worse, it took me 2 days and 15 calls to finally reach Franklin support. Then, two weeks later, the part finally came. I recommend staying away from this net as much as possible.",1.0

"I have the same brand and model which were manufactured in Japan many years ago and they're great -.very sharp, clear, easy to focus. THIS pair is made in China and are junk.

"We bought a pair of these binoculars for our son several years ago.  Pretty decent for inexpensive binoculars.  Unfortunately, Bushnell has cheapened the design and parts used in manufacture of these now.  While they look nearly the same as the old ones, they aren't.  Way to much slop in the adjustment.  In fact, there is a point where they stick as you are going through the adjustment.  The old pair are considerably smoother in adjustment.  The lens are also a bit foggy.  The rubber around one of the eyepieces somehow got deformed when I packaged them back up, so obviously the rubber (if you can call it that - seems more like some rubber/plastic combination) isn't very good quality.

Unfortunately, these aren't even worth the cheap price.  I should have sent them back, but got lazy and missed the 30 day window.  I would definitely look for something else if you want an inexpensive pair of binoculars that have some modicum of quality.",1.0
focus is sticky no clear,1.0
"My wife was so proud that she found some binoculars at a descent price, all I was thinking was- OH NO! I opened them knowing bushnell is an ok name for cheap optics, not good, but ok. Upon viewing through them, my fear was confirmed. These were terrible and had to return them, luckily we could return them. Both pairs were the same. The parallax is completely off with no adjustment possible to fix the issue. Looking through them, you start to form an instant headache then realizing the image shift from one eye to the other is several feet off at 100'. all distances even up close the images between one eye and the other are off making these useless unless you decide to keep one eye closed at all times. Having said that, they make an ok scope, or if you have an eye patch, born with one eye, or just blind in one eye, cyclops, then it will be ok. As for anyone not in that category, you are best suited to hit your local shops and test some until you find a pair that actually work better than a mono scope.",1.0
"This is the worst purchase I've ever made through Amazon.  I trusted Bushnell as a reputable binocular manufacturer, boy was I wrong.  I haven't had this model of binoculars for even 5 months, and it is completely out of focus.  You can not use the focus roller to make a close and CLEAR view.

You will just love the double vision you get from the Bushnell Falcon 7x35 Binoculars! I would recommend sawing them in half and using them as a telescope. I read the reviews on the web and everyone says the same thing about the double vision. Harbor Freight tools has a cheap set of Binoculars better than these. I called Bushnell and they blamed me because the only way that could happen is for them to be dropped. They never were dropped and were bad out of the box. Horrible product horrible company.,1.0

So I was thinking I would wait to for my husband to come in and see if he could get them to work. But then I looked at them and noticed that the Lens on right side was positioned crooked. No way would they ever focus right, so back in the box and already printed out the return label. Best thing about Amazon, doesn't happen often but when it does it is not problem to return things. Think I am going to do a bit more research and pay a bit more. The thing just didn't look put together right even the other parts aside from the lens.",1.0
Cheap. Does not see far. Took to the rain forest and was not much help,1.0

"Simply put, anyone who bothered to look through the viewfinders would see that these binoculars are not working and have not been reconditioned. As this would be so easy to check I just do not understand how and why these would be sent out as they were.",1.0
"I don't know anything about binoculars and just wanted a pair for casual backyard bird watching. I took a risk ordering a pair that was so inexpensive and had some poor reviews... It was not worth it. The adjustment of the lenses was so off that there was about 6 feet of separation between images at 30 feet or so. They were totally unusable. Perhaps the better reviews got a good pair and I got a bad pair, but it was not worth the risk buying another pair to see. Obviously, there are some quality control issues. In general, the quality seemed really poor. If you pushed a little too much on one side (with your eye/head) it would bend the plastic hinge in the middle. Shouldn't the lenses always be aligned and not able to move? I dunno. Just seemed cheaply made. So I ended up buying the Pentax 62211 UCF-X II 8x25 at double the price instead.",1.0
"I bought these as starter birdwatching  binoculars for my son who recently got into the hobby.  I got these primarily for the price and the decent reviews, hoping that Bushnell had improved their quality over the last 20 years...  but, I wasn't surprised when my son said that the focusing mechanism broke within 2 months of his receiving them and it wasn't due to misuse or dropping them:  the plastic housing for the set-screw cracked, which no longer allowed proper focusing (and I couldn't repair it).  Actually, I should've known this would happen with Bushnell because my initial birdwatching binoculars were Bushnell and I remember them becoming fairly useless soon after I started using them on a regular basis.  It's been Nikon or Minolta for me ever since...  I guess I  should've started my son on one of those as well.  So, on to the ""store"" for something better for the new birder.",1.0
"these binoculars were shown under a grouping of SMALL binoculars.  They are so heavy, I had difficulty lifting them out of the shippng container.  Forget it!",1.0
These binoculars were a big disappointment. You can't see far or clear at all. I am sorry I made the purchase.,1.0
"It is much too hard to put together.  The directions do not provide much help. That is very frustrating. My grandaughter keeps asking if we can put it together, we need more tools i tell her, and it is a little pricey to have it put together by an outsude source- one store wanted $50 for assembly!- more than the cost of the bycicle!  I need a solution.  Darlene",1.0
We were very disappointed in the first shipment of this tricycle. The handlebars were welded on crooked and the seat was painted poorly. Reordered replacement which was fine.,1.0
"This item came to us with missing parts, only two wheels, and the seat had puncture marks from construction. Very disappointing as this was our son's Christmas gift.",1.0
"Total POS. The frame of the trike is crooked. So, my kids have a hard time keeping the trike straight and get frustrated constantly. Plus, whatever chemicals are used in the paint and/or wheel rubbers STINKS. Seriously, we bought this almost three years ago and it still smells like an animal died in a tar pit. This is not the Radio Flyer I remember from my childhood.",1.0

The tube holding the axle is bent, the the tube connecting the front fork and the platform is unusable because the axle tub is bent, therefore the fastening bolts are unusable. The front fork is seeming plumb. However, the wheel/axle on the front is either bent or defective in some other way. So, entire assembly would lean left because the yoke was bent on the left side OR the holes for the mounting bolts were drilled and located incorrectly. This the second purchase of this exact model, to makeup for the first order which was missing the plastic washers and the yoke was bent. I am truly disappointed with the consistently inconsistent defects in the product. The diminished quality expectation leads me to believe there are more Radio Flyer tricycles with these exact same issues and all around is in-congruent with expected quality and satisfactory expectations of a first, and subsequently second-time, costumer of the same product.",1.0
"This trike broke within 2 weeks of my son opening it as a 3rd birthday gift. It has split apart where the front axle meets the body. Since I bought it early, the Amazon 30 day return policy window is already over so now I have a sad kid and am out the cost of the trike.",1.0
Used for a while and wheels came off,1.0
"As others have said the handle bars don't stay tightened to the frame, the nuts won't tighten down and it tips every time. My son is 50 lbs and even he tips on it-so it isn't the weight of the kid, it's the bike design and manufacture. It's junk period, don't be fooled by the old name brand. I wouldn't sell this for $5, it belongs in a scrap yard.",1.0
"When I opened the box containing the tricycle manufacturer packaging, it was clear that this had been returned before.  There was a large rip in the side of the box that had been re-taped.  When I opened the manufacturer packaging I noticed that there were loose bolts in it.  Ultimately there were two missing nuts and bolts that made assembly impossible.  Be aware that quality control with this shipped was not a priority.",1.0
Seat crooked and moves around. Didn't feel like returning after putting together. Disappointing,1.0
"The tricycle smells like it was in a fire.  Customer service did give me half of my money back and I was hoping I could wash the smell off. No luck.  Total waste of money,  unfortunately.",1.0
Was very disappointed that the trike came rigjt out of the box with very deep scratches on the steps and that the paint was chipped off the front wheel. I didn't have time to return it and ended up gifting my grandson with a gift of lesser quality than I expected.,1.0
Assembly does not work very well. The wheel remains loose and needs to be constantly tightens.,1.0
"My son who is pretty tall at 2 years old could not be able to reach the cycling steps on the front wheel.
The sit on the tri-cylce also causes him to slide off the chair.",1.0
not as good as in the picture,1.0
heavy and my daughter seldom ride one it.,1.0
"Poorly made. I bought it because we had the small version of it (it is still in good shape) and my son out grown it, but I regret I bought it. After barely using it, the parts are worn out! And the front wheel is falling apart!",1.0
Bought this for my almost 3 year old. The handle bares do not stay aligned no matter how much you tighten it. Makes it extremely hard for her to steer.,1.0
Was very disappointed in the quality of the product.  Made in China as the workmanship was shoddy at best.  Radio Flyer Products  used to be outstanding .,1.0
"Junk -- bought for a 4-year old girl.  Very cheaply made.  Front wheel wobbles despite all adjustment and rebuild attempts.  I don't believe it will last through the summer.  On the bright side, the streamers are mostly still intact and the bell still rings but had to be repaired twice.  This trike was put into use on April 12, 2015 (approx two weeks) so it has not experienced a lot of wear and tear.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Try some other brand.",1.0
"One of the main parts, part # 102956/102978, the wheel, fender and pedals were damaged when the package arrived.  The fender is dented and wobbles.  We would like to have a replacement part.  We never buy anything but Radio Flyer Tricycle and this is the first one we have had trouble with.  Thank you.",1.0
"Before we even finished putting this product together, we noticed that something was off with the balance of the bike. Sure enough, after assembly we realized that the front wheel was off-center and would tip over whenever the wheel was turned (even without anyone on it). We tried several different ways to tighten the handlebars/wheel but it seems that the whole product is defective. We returned and purchased a Schwinn Roadster instead.",1.0
It makes squeaky noise after the bike is assembled. I could not figure out where the noise is coming from. Not a happy camper :(,1.0
"Received  in good time. Assembled and a pedal was broken. Could not contact and ask for a pedal only. I had to return the trike and then run about trying to get the trike elsewhere .
So in summary the purchase was a disaster",1.0
