And still can I read a book without disturbing their sleep (or mine...).,5.0
I bought a used fish tank from someone and it already came with ProClear Aquatics Wet dry filter. I'm so glad to find the replacement filter and media on Amazon. The water clear up overnight after I put these filter media in. Will surely buy again for future replacements.,5.0
"I use these nozzle extenders in the misting system that I have on the ground here at The Tropical Paradise. I have the line running just below ground, and these extenders bring the nozzles up just the right amount. They start off shiny and noticeable but they dull down and become almost invisible. These are ""seasonal items"" at Home Depot, so they can be difficult to find. The nozzles can be replaced, which I do regularly. The misters keep up the level of humidity in the garden for my tropical plants, and they really like it. Looks pretty cool when they come on, too! Highly recommended!",5.0
"I've had a backyard fishpond for three years, purchased as a kit with preformed pond and pump with filter.  I had never been able to find any replacements to fit until I discovered this sponge.  Very easy to rinse clean for reuse.  Thanks.",5.0
"This product was exactly as billed, and I would definitely do business with this store again.",5.0
"I bought three of these to have as spare replacements for my sump I bought here on Amazon.  I'll usually clean them under running water a couple times before replacing them, but eventually they get so clogged with algae that its easier to replace than pulling out the slime.",5.0
This works great for the over-flow tubes to my wet/dry filter,5.0
according to specifications it could not raise the water temp enough,5.0
Works well for our adaptation,5.0
"returned, decided against this product",5.0
Awesome heater for the electrical requirements! Makes an awesome preheater for my talnkless system,5.0
Works great.,5.0
"Easy install. Probably a 20-foot run from the heater to the bathroom area. Heats up water just fine at that location. Had a name brand on demand heater before, and this one heats the water quite a bit faster then the name brand model. Quite pleased so far.",5.0
"Bought this tankless water heater to replace my older tankless water heater. This heater not only does a much better job than the older one, it is the  best purchase that I have ever made! It does what the manufacturer says it would do and my family just loves it!",5.0
Product is just as described.  Installed it in series with my solar water heater and now I can count on hot water into the winter evenings.,5.0
This product has worked well for our family of 4 we always have hot water. It does help to have high water pressure.,5.0
Installed in RV.  Works perfectly.  Easy install for us.,5.0
Keeps the mist of your wood trim and on you. Bendable too.,5.0

"This product is a good trade-off of performance for the price. We can even take hot showers, at least now in summer, while the temp calibrated to only 43C (110*F). It is simple to install and use/adjust.
To get maximum performance:
1. Install this unit at the point of use, not as whole house supply.
2. Use a water-efficient/ saver shower head. I bought this thing on Amazon: B014R4W6MY, its the control valve on and off, you install right at the shower head, so for example, during shower, you are using shampoo, instead turn off both valves at shower head, you just need to switch this valve to shutoff water while doing other things...then switch on again when finish. This valve is 1.5 GPM rate.
3. Reduce the flow from the hotline (to let it build up temperature) while mixing in cold water to get more flow/pressure at the shower head or faucet.
It really works better this way.",5.0
"Replaced a 50 gallon 9kW 240v. Works perfectly. No longer paying $0.50 a kW for storing hot water here in Hawaii. I could go with IR288 POU 8.8 kW 40AMP, which has more flow rate output vs. IR260 6.0 kW 30AMP, but since I have only 1 bathroom so IR260 would be more than enough for me. One faucet at a time, and if you are planning to run multiple faucets at the same time, go with IR288 POU or IR 14K220 POU.
And also in Hawaii, we don't have clean water, and so most of the electric tankless system out there in the market could not keep up because of the corrosion and limescale, and you have to keep flushing the system regularly and replace elements. I hope this is it.",5.0
Just what we wanted. Work great.,5.0
"Excellent unit, simple to install and quite efficient. Because of my power limitations i had to get this model, has few limitations vs IR14K or IR8000 however i love it. Provide enough 1 shower at a time for me (live in Hawaii), i have to dial gatevale down a bit because it was too hot. Also, it was so inexpensive compared to replacing my water heater tank. Now I have a very large pantry were the tank use to be and this IR260 is in the top of my linen closet.",5.0
"I am totally happy and amazed this unit works so well.  I didn't think it would be able to handle heating water for a shower.  Our 40 gallon hot water heater started leaking and I needed something temporary.  We had a 220v/30 amp #10 line there already for the tank.  Hooked everything up and get hot showers consistently.  One thing that made a difference was I used 1/2"" (under-sink type) supply and outlet lines instead of the 3/4"" lines that were connected to my tank heater.  Once I changed those it was much better.  Another thing to get used to is; for hotter water turn the shower knobs in 1/8th to 1/4 turns. The slower the flow, the hotter the water!  I said this was a temporary fix until we get our gas line hooked up.  We're converting all our appliances to gas. But I might just leave this unit there since it works so well. Also need to mention we live in Hawaii, I'm sure it works so well because our tap water comes out between 65-70 degrees Fahrenheit.",5.0
does what its suppose to do.  instant hot water until water from other end of house water heater gets there.  easy to install . just getting to old to craw thru attic to run wire though. works great.,5.0
"I had this IR260 unit for around a month before I was ready to install it.  I had a little trepidation about whether it would provide enough warm water for my application (small cabin, 2 sinks, one shower) but forged ahead and had no issues with the installation process.  Following the directions exactly, I turned the unit on and opened a sink faucet.  To my delight, warm water soon came out.  But the real test came when the shower hookup was complete and I went to try my first warm shower in the cabin.  This time, I got even more warm, actually hot, water and had to turn the shower down towards cold a bit so it wouldn't be too hot.  This unit is perfect for a small cabin or home with just one or two people using hot water.  The unit takes up so little space and I found it nearly a snap to install.  If you get one of these, make sure you turn the faucet hot water handle all the way on until the temp stabilizes before backing it off.  If you turn it on just a little, you'll get a ""beep beep"" from the unit indicating that there is a ""flow restriction error"" - what this means is there is not enough water flowing through the unit.  A leak anywhere in the system will cause this error to show as well - I found this out from having a screw cap at the end of the hot water line; the male adapter threads had no teflon tape on them so it leaked, hence the ""beep beep"".

On standby, the unit shows a ""4"" where the temperature usually is displayed - it would have been nice to know this beforehand as it is nowhere in the literature that came with the unit.  At first I was wondering what kind of problem or error this might be.  Perhaps a less confusing display for standby mode would have been ""SB"" and including this in the manual or instructions would have cleared everything up anyway.",5.0
"My husband selected this model because of the reviews. He originally ordered a unit that was too small for our needs, he contacted the company. they were very helpful. told him which model he should go to. they told him if he had any problems trying to return the first one just give them a call and they would help him.",5.0
Good unit for kitchen sink,5.0
On-the-spot heat for my home dog wash sink.  We have a larger capacity for the house and wouldn't go back to a regular hot water heater.,5.0
Nice,5.0
I use this to make my matcha tea froth up.  It is easy and it is relaxing to whisk the matcha.  It froths the matcha tea well and it is very easy to clean.,5.0
"I have installed it, and day two it seems to be working great",5.0
"Good for overflow filter. Works good. White is easy to see how dirty it is. Like that fact. Works better than the course one, for catching finer particles. 100% satisfied. Will buy it again.",5.0
Just installed it this week.  At first the output was a little cool. Once the flow was rolled  way back it worked well. It only has to supply two vanity faucets and a shower with  a low flow nozzle. It relplaced a 50 gallon electric heater.,5.0
Super fast and easy to install.,5.0
"If you need to replace a standard tank type water heater, Don't hesitate to buy this jewel! Price is fair and works exactly as advertised! Install is simple if you already have 220 vac to your old tank. Talk about a space saver! I now have a closet with twice the storage area.",5.0
"We installed the unit in our homeowners club house that only has one faucet needing hot water. It really does the trick perfectly. It provides nearly instant hot water for the few times we need it a day, and we do not have to continuously heat a tank of water. It is the perfect solution. It was easy to install and worked immediately.",5.0
"These are for our new room addition with the pool table...  This is perfect, expresses exactly how I feel.",5.0
Good quality.,5.0
very nice,5.0
Was a little skeptical at first . a flow heater is a different creature than a tank but after a few lessons on how to get hot water I had to turn the beast down !  If it lasts with out service problems this will be the best buy of the year on Amazon . congrats to the designer,5.0
I like it a lot,5.0
"I bought this for my neighbor and he loves it. Came exactly as described, very sturdy.",5.0
Love this water heater!  Like it so much that id like to sell them to everyone. Its not big enough to do a whole house but its plenty good enough for running area if all water areas are close together. I have it heating water going to my poolhouse 20 feet away and can even take hot showers out there. I plan on running a solar water heater before it to preheat water to make it even more efficient.,5.0

This was a gift for my cousin who kept losing her hooks in the couch. I thought it would be perfect for her to keep them all in one place. It has been great. She's so much more organized now and doesn't have to spend time looking for hooks when its time wasted working on projects. Great product.,5.0

"Fantastic item for Morris Canal and NJ history fans.  A great amount of leg work went into verifying the route of the canal in the context of the current rail and highway alignments.

Detailed maps and descriptions allow you to trace the entire canal, as much as is possible, from Phillipsburg to Jersey City.  It is broken down in sections that can easily be covered in a series of day trips.

The maps and descriptions show you which sections are walkable, and which are driving tours. It gives turn by turn directions including where to park your car for the hiking sections.

The maps alone are worth the price, but you get so much more from the author's team of true enthusiasts who put this together.",5.0

"I'm a nurse and have been out of school since the 1980s, and I wish I'd had something like this back then.  It holds a wealth of info on what is basically 4 laminated pages.  It would be an excellent study tool for nursing, and other students taking 1st year pharmacology.",5.0

"This is the best bottle ever!.  I have filled it with water and ice in the mornings and maintained it in my car all day long, in the hot Florida summer weather, and it will be ice cold 8 hours later.  There will still be ice chips in side.  Very durable.  Everyone in the family now has their own.  I attach a careener so that they can be hung of sports bags and backpacks.",5.0
I gave it to my grandson for his birthday and he loves it.  It keeps him from putting his stickers on the walls of his bedroom.  Thank you.,5.0
"Used as a prefilter sponge on the intake tube of my AquaClear 70 filters. I cut one in half, and use it for both. Prevents small fish from getting stuck or injured. Just make sure that there's not too much suction from the bottom as the water will find the path of least resistance. As long as the pickups are close to the bottom of the tank you shouldn't have a problem. If you are using a single intake tube and its at the mid-water level, you might have too much pull from the open end. Also provides more space for beneficial bacteria and obviously keeps the filters cleaner.",5.0

"This has been a big hit. He loves putting his stickers in the book. It's a nice non-screen activity we can do together. He now saves all the stickers he gets from the grocery store and the doctor's office so he can put them in his book. It's a lovely exercise in delayed gratification and he is so adorable showing off his ""collection"" to people. Nice quality, I can see it lasting for years and there are great themed pages that make it almost read like a book once it has some stickers in it.",5.0
"Very nice, holds up well",5.0

"Plenty of room for all the stickers my 4.5 year old has and he hasn't filled it yet.  Solved the problem to our sticker table, which is now in the trash.  Love this book, has great themed pages for all kinds of stickers and a little compartment to put stickers when you need to save them.
I love the hologram on the front of the moving car too, my son loves it!  He really likes that he can change his mind and remove the stickers to put them on other pages when new stickers come in.  Highly recommend!!",5.0

"Was a bit skeptical at first mostly because the price seemed to good to be true. But after a couple of months with this product I can say that's it's a really impressive. Have to take it to a tune shop to see the full results. Fitment was perfect highly recommend buying heat tape and taping gas lines and what ever else might get hot, and painting these black with high temp spray paint. To absorb more heat.",5.0

"I don't go anywhere without one of my hydro flasks.  They really do keep things hot or cold.  I love that I can put ice water in the water bottle in the morning then leave it in the car in the sun while I go for a couple hours of errands or a long run, and come back to nice ice cold water.  It is super durable too.  I have a bad habit of dropping things, and this has taken some good drops.  It has a few dents and paint chips, but it still has the vacuum and still works like a charm.  I had to purchase the larger version because my husband would always drink my water since it was cold, so now we have a big one to share.  I love them both, and the straw lid comes in handy with the big one because it gets heavy when it is full so it is easier to use the straw then to try and tip the beast up to drink from the pour lid.",5.0

"I looked high and low for a sticker book for my son.  Others were too girly or had character-specific themes, with all the added stickers that I didn't need or want.  This book had lots of pages, some with backgrounds (ie, in the ocean, at the park, on the road, in the sky, etc.) but they also had colored blank pages.  I thought the pouch at the end of the book for extra stickers was the perfect touch.  It is pricey, but worth it. Wish the book was bigger and had more pages in fact, but its great for small hands. The lenticular image of the car moving was pretty cool. I plan on getting more for birthday and holiday gifts.",5.0

"The Brief:
This was an excellent purchase.  Well crafted. Well priced. Excellent customer service from seller. Arrived promptly and packaged with care.

The Long:
This was bought as a gift for a rail fan in need of a coat rack.  I found this piece after searching various sites and vendors and being disappointed with the design and feel of the pieces offered on other sites.  This item is well designed featuring both a rustic feel and modern simplicity that truly allows you to appreciate the beauty of the wood, the railroad spikes, and the entire piece in general.

After deciding to buy, I was able to contact the seller, who worked with me one on one to help decide which piece was right for me. He offered variations in the staining as well as an option for an entryway piece with ""WELCOME"" on it.  He kept in close contact and worked with me on my delivery date needs and was extremely helpful throughout the entire process.  You get the impression that the seller is not only eager to assist, but proud/passionate about his work (as he should be).

The piece arrived exactly on time and in excellent condition.  The hanging mounts on the back on this piece were 32inches apart which makes it easy to hang and anchor into the studs (which you'll need to do as it is a sturdy piece with some weight to it).

As a gift, this went over incredibly well; to the point where the recipient grabbed a measuring tape immediately after opening to begin planning its placement.",5.0
Great product! Great quality! My 6-year-old son thinks it is awesome. Haven't found anything else like it. Would certainly recommend :),5.0
Took a chance with this as I was in need of a very specific look/feel.  The gamble paid off in a huge way as this rack has become the focal point in a high end remodel.  Customer was ecstatic and the workmanship is top notch.  This will be a go to piece for many future customers.,5.0
Rug as advertised and I am always looking for sheep themed items.  Seems to be good quality and very nice colors.,5.0

the belt is really cool a little hard to adjust for a tight fit and a little hard to feed thru the loops but so cool and well worth every penny. fast ship i would recommend to anyone,5.0
"I searched all around for a sticker book for my children, but could only find junky ones, until this.  It is more expensive than any others you will find, but well worth the money.  It is very well-made and spiral bound, with plenty of pages and just the right size.  The pages are categorized for ""food stickers"", ""sports stickers"", etc.  For you who grew up in the 80's collecting stickers...just like we had back then.  Perfect place for all of the stickers that come from the doctor, dentist and the slew that come through the mail from Mimi and Papa on a regular basis!",5.0
This sponge is well-made and sturdy. It holds its shape and doesn't collapse under the pressure of the water flow. I'm pleased with the performance.,5.0
"Kids love to get things no one else has. Maybe a little over the top for a 10 year old but I hope he will enjoy it for years to come. I love the style of these ""seat belt"" belts!",5.0
"- Questions I had were answered in a reasonable period of time.  I was emailed pictures of several pieces of wood prior to placing my order so that I could choose the particular piece of wood I wanted.
- Packaging was superb and there was no damage when it arrived.
- The coat rack looked better than the on-line picture.  It was very obvious that quality work had gone into making this product.
Thank you!",5.0
I love these belts! After I get one for everyone I know I won't know what else to do for presents! There is a style for everyone! Super cute love it!,5.0

My 18month old sticks all his stickers inside and has no problem removing and resticking in other pages. The pages are divided into themes like: stickers with beach theme or stickers from doctors office. Too sophisticated for my son but I can see him organizing them later.,5.0
"This product works perfect, could not be better . I will be buying more .Also they do not come with mister heads , you have to supply that . There is no way this can clog up your system . It would have to be the mister head to cause a leak or a clog in the system .",5.0
love it came really quick and will be reordering again love ur products!! recomend to others make great gifts!! recomend to all.,5.0
"This book is fantastic! Bought it for my son when he had his tonsils out and he loved it! He put all the stickers that the nurses gave him on the ""doctor's"" page. I love the various themed pages like ""in the garden"", ""in the sea"", ""at the beach"", ""in the sky"", and the blank pages in different colors. It even has a little pouch attached inside the back cover for extra sheets of stickers. Definitely happy with it and would recommend!",5.0
"If your kids are anything like mine, they LOVE stickers. I have probably spent hundreds of dollars on stickers in the last 8 years. I would buy  little books or journals for the kids to put their stickers in , but then once they were stuck on the paper, there was no way to get them off.

But now I found these Sticker Solutions sticker books, they are awesome. My kids are having so much fun categorizing and sorting out their stickers on the correct pages, and now the stickers can be removed, and used again!

My kids also LOVE the cover of the books because the picture changes. Very cool idea!",5.0
"My kids have a lot of stickers that they collect from school and birthday parties.  We were looking for a book that would allow them to collect but reuse some of their stickers.  There are only a few stickers included within this book, but we were really looking for a collector's book/album with plenty of pages.  This was the best book that we have found with lots of colorful pages for them to place their stickers.  Other parents have seen this book and love the design.  Now, my boys and their friends are able to share their sticker collection with each other.  This is an excellent product!",5.0
"I purchased this book from his Etsy shop and I loooooooooove it.  It's hard to tell how big it actually is from looking at it online, but when I got it in person, I was surprised at the size.  It's massive.  The quality is great. Every picture is unique and quite different from the next. A lot of variety.  The images are extremely detailed, too, so if you like a challenge this book is definitely for you.  But even as a beginner colorist, I would recommend it.

Honestly, I would give this book six stars if Amazon would let me :-)",5.0
"This book is absolutely exquisite!
Everything about it is of superior quality - the HUGE sized pages/POSTERS, the heavy, smooth, brilliant white paper, sharp black lines, binding that allows easy removal of pages and the number of pages!
This is like a DOUBLE coloring book since each page is the size of two pages combined.
There is a wide range of subjects, all filled with precise details. You will get lost in the fantastic image while you color it!

UPDATE:  I have now purchased all 3 of Jess' coloring books - YES, they are THAT good!

The quality and subjects of this book are so delightful - I have framed several to hang in my house and give as gifts!",5.0

"This was my 3rd attempt at coloring, which as an artist, I decided to take up as ""active rest"" from my regular work. Jess Perna has a gift for balance between detail and room to freestyle... I am enthralled with his artwork and have found it perfect for my own breaks... in a word... I LOVE it!! I will be certain to buy other Jess Perna books.. that is for sure.... these are the books to buy!!",5.0

The paper is heavy and one sided and the pictures are so creatively drawn so that you have room to be creative and yet easy enough so that you can just start and feel satisfied with how clever you and your coloring actually is.... I have found a new set of coloring books by this artist and I need to buy all the rest of his stunning books. YOu will be very pleased with this book and the rest of his books.

These are the best posters to color I have came across and there is a great variety to choose from. The paper is high quality so I can use my medium of choice with confidence. One of these posters will keep me entertained for a while in my free time. It is great that as a left handed individual I can easily color these pages. I look forward to getting started.,5.0

Absolutely LOVE this book as much as the poster. I have 2 myself and purchase a couple for others. Beautiful pages to color.,5.0
"I purchased this Adult Coloring Book Variety Poster directly from their website, before it made available on Amazon.
I immediately drawn to how detailed and beautiful each page on this book. The themes varied that the hardest thing for me is to pick my favorite. From mermaid, farm, animals, fantasy, world and even beautiful ladies. This book is a must-have for anyone who loves beautiful line-art to color.",5.0
There are so many beautiful pages in this book. The pages are big so it will take me a while to finish them all. It features scenes from all around  the world and others from the artists imagination. I use both gel pens and colored pens. This book works well with both as the paper is heavy duty so the ink does not bleed through and each page is only printed on one side. Each page can be easily removed without ripping the page. They are held with glue on the edge. I bought a well known coloring book once and the pages were held with glue and string binding like a hardcover novel. It was very difficult to get the pages out of that book and some ended up ripping. Luckily I did not have any of the same difficulties with this book. I am able to remove the pages with ease so I can frame or hang with up. Everyone that loves coloring will love this book. I should get back to coloring I have lot's more to do.,5.0
I love the huge size of this book. The paper quality is great. It's easier to smear my gel pens while wet b4 the paper soaks it up.  The level of heart Jess has puts in his art is at a level that guides me to want to put more heart into my colorings. I have a higher satisfaction in my finished colorings from Jess' book than any other before.,5.0

There is a wonderful array of beautiful artwork to choose from. Absolutely something for everyone here. I had a wonderful time coloring this poster and am so pleased with how it came out that I am having it framed. Great job Jess Perna! You are a terrific artist. It is a pleasure to color your work!",5.0

Just a note. Don't for get to download the Pantone Color manager so that you can export your new books/swatches to Adobe products or the like. There are instructions in the books on how to download the color manager. To export, update all books in the manager then go to file and export to your software. I thought Pantone would update with Adobe swatches automatically but they do not. You have to add the books manually. This was kinda a pain and a bit confusing so I thought I'd let others who are purchasing know.",5.0

One thing I truly like since they are not numeric there is a index chart in the back with the numbers and the page. I never had the index on my old one and sometimes if the pms numbers were not in order it was always hard to find the number. But with this index chart is is so easy. There was a comment the card stock was not a nice as the past and that is true the card stock is thinner but still workable. I am glad I broke down and bought a new one!

Unlike other booklights - this thing really only lights up the page of your book and not the whole room.  Reading in bed - or even just in a room without good lighting is so much easier than with the clip on style light.  Sure its more expensive - but sooo worth it.,5.0
I love that you can just lay the lightwedge over the Kindle and read with no trouble at all and the case keeps it clean and free of dust so it's ready to use whenever I need it.,5.0

If you're looking for a great case at an excellent price for your Kindle, the LightWedge Paperback Soft Case is the case for you!",5.0
I've had my LightWedge for years and wish I'd bought this cover sooner. It opens completely to make it very easy to get the book light in and out. It fits the light perfectly without adding any extra bulk. It takes up almost no extra room than just the light itself. I highly recommend this cover to protect and transport your LightWedge.,5.0

I don't own a LightWedge.  I ordered this to slip over my Kindle in its leather cover (M-Edge in red) when I toss it in my purse.  I wanted extra protection and liked that it zipped closed completely.  It was on sale and the price was right so I thought I'd try it.  Perfect fit and I could not be happier!,5.0

"Update: Revision - Lightwedge makes the Verso Clip on, so I do have a Light Wedge light ;-), just not the one for this bag.

******************************************

Let me preface this to say: I don't have the LightWedge Book Lights (in fact, I don't even know how they would work).

Even though I already have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-mCover-Leather-Folio-Cover-Case-for-Amazon-Kindle-3-Fits-6-Display-built-in-inner-pocket/dp/B004E8X6FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue mCover Leather Folio Cover Case for Amazon Kindle 3 (Fits 6"" Display, built-in inner pocket)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verso-Clip-On-Reading-Light-for-Kindle-Turquoise/dp/B003FZA1OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verso Clip-On Reading Light for Kindle (Turquoise)</a>, I was reading the Kindle Forums, and someone suggested this case as an added level of protection.

I followed the link, and placed it in my cart - waiting to compile a group of objects to qualify for Free Shipping :-)  (Note the Signature - Penny Pinching)

During this time, the LightWedge went into Save (claiming it was unavailable).  I found the counterpart for $3 more, another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LightWedge-Original-Soft-Case/dp/B0001MRGKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LightWedge Original Soft Case</a>.  No one is ever happy with a price increase, but I also noted the size difference (the one available was slightly larger, and may work for others whom have bigger Kindle cases).

So I said to myself - HHMMMM.  I placed the Larger One in my Wishlist, and waited.  A couple of days later, I clicked on the one still saved in cart, and voila - it was available (however, it did not move back into cart like it was supposed to, HHHHMMM).

Since I'd acquired enough items to Freely Ship, I placed my order on 11/12.  That little case was in my hands via UPS on 11/14 (still waiting for the REST of the order to ship, lol).

The case is beautiful and Perfect.  I'm glad I chose this size.  See my image above for differences from the product description and picture shown.  This must be a newer model, but works absolutely marvelous!!

The Kindle, Cover and Light fit in the Case with room to spare.  Since the MCover comes with a Pocket, I can place extra goodies in the Pocket.  For reading, I like to hinge the front cover to the back with the band, so anything in the pocket can go in the case for safe keeping (in a Coffee Shop, Reading on the Bus, etc.)

Now, for the REAL Penny Pinchers out there - you can take a clear bubble wrap envelope (I had saved one from an Amazon Shipment, and kept my Kindle in it while waiting for the Cover), and place the Envelope in the Case.  It will still fit (but the case AND LightWedge Cover offer better protection re bumps).  The case also helps to protect against dust and - gasp, CAT HAIR (I have 3 of those buggers).

As to the fabric, it is soft, feels like Velvet, and nice enough to use as its own purse (with the Kindle and goodies stuck inside).  You can also put it in a back pack, or roll in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whitmor-6342-2779-BLUE-Rolling-Utility-Cart/dp/B001UE8ILS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whitmor 6342-2779-BLUE Rolling Utility Cart</a>.  Dust and CAT HAIR easily brushes off the case.  For a quick run, this makes an excellent looking Tote Bag (watch out Gucci).  There is a slight smell (the same as describe with the MCover), waiting to see if it goes away with time.

Highly recommended for your Kindle Travel and Protection needs.  5 stars.",5.0
This was just what I needed to store my LightWedge while I am not using it.  I love to read at night so the LightWedge is the best booklight.  No that I have a Kindle I need to store the wedge on occasion.,5.0

This is a perfect case for my lightwedge. It is soft and zips all the way around so it is easy to get it in and out of. It is very well made and very lightweight. It protects the lightwedge when not using it and is perfect for traveling.  I just stash it with my book and off we go!,5.0
"I wanted a simple travel case to protect my Kindle, but I did not like the cost and bulk of most of the cases sold specifically as Kindle cases.  In searching for a simpler alternative, I came across this case, which is designed for the LightWedge booklight.  It fits the Kindle very nicely, providing protection against bumps and scratches.  It's very light weight, very simple, and much cheaper than most Kindle cases.  I know this isn't what it was designed for, but it works great for simple, cheap Kindle protection.",5.0
"I bought this to use as a protective travel pouch for my Kindle 2. My k2 with an Amazon or Noreve or Oberon cover fits perfectly. It provides a nice cushion of extra protection for the Kindle. Also, the photo on Amazon shows the ""Lightwedge"" logo on this pouch as white, but it is actually black & barely noticible, which is a plus for a logo-phobe like me!",5.0
These little zippered pouches are an fantastic way to protect your lightwedge when it isn't in use.,5.0
My wife's Kindle with an M-Edge cover fits securely inside of the lightwedge soft case.  She carries her Kindle with her everywhere in her purse and she states it is now protected in the case from any small particles which may become lodged between her Kindle and M-Edge cover. Nice quality for the price and she highly recommends!,5.0
Much safer and more bright than candles.  Works during hurricanes!  Also good for outdoors as a flashlight.  Must have when the electricity goes out.  Keep in the car when traveling at night.,5.0
"Got this to replace a fixed arm booklight that broke too easily and had a limited range of movement.  This one, with two flexible arms, is great.  Can use one or both lights and they move and bend to whatever angle you need, including being able to sit on my end table.  Have even used one arm to light the book and the other to peer into the dark to see where the cat was scratching.  Very compact and easy to pack up or store.  The on/off switch on the top of the light is easy to use and the light is powerful enough to light up both pages of a hardback book.  The base, however, is too heavy and bulky for paperback but I don't read them anyway.",5.0
"Works great, the best book light I ever owned!  It adjust well to use with Kindle.  Can be place and adjusted so there is no glare or reflection of the light on the kindle.  Love this light!",5.0
"I bought three of these in blue (a spare for me and one for my brother) after thoroughly reading all of the comments on competitive brands. I found the comments praising this model to be right on the mark. When I read it lit up both pages at the same time using dual lights where all other brands required constant repositioning for each page, that was all I needed to know this was the best reading light for me.

I can't say enough nice things about this product. It has dual lights on a flex shaft which you can position to fully illuminate both pages of a large hardback book. You won't need to keep moving the light around to light your pages with this one and the pages ar well lit for easy reading in the dark. But the light is centralized on the book and not the surrounding area so others can sleep while you read.

You can also switch from dual lights to a single light. The flexible shaft on the light is sturdy and stable enough to firmly hold its position over the book even while you move around and turn pages. You can either clip it on the cover or use the clip to hold open the pages. It operates on AAA batteries. The higher quality battery, the longer it lasts. I use the Duracell ultra digital batteries with the blue band.

I cannot think of any negatives about this product. I'm not associated with any seller. I am just a customer who was happy to find a great product. Definitely a good buy.",5.0

"I have purchased MANY book lights in the past, but never have I owned one that was actually bright enough to read by. I usually keep moving the light around and around and around so I can see the page .  I ordered the power adapter but it hasn't arrived yet, I am using 3 AAA batteries and this is a awesome light. It has 2 lights in the head you can use both or just one, the light spreads across both pages of a paperback in either mode one light or two, I haven't tried a hard cover book yet, but I really don't think this light will have any problem at all. Very Very Bright. I definitely recommend this light .",5.0

Small circle of light, have to move it from side to side to see good. So last Christmas I went on an internet hunt for the ideal book light. After a few days of research, I decided on this one for her. Now 7 months later she wants me to buy one for our daughter, and a spare for her (in case I lose or break it) cause she says could not live a night without it now. True story. It is bright and evenly covers an area of two pages of a large book without trouble, no hot spots. Seems to be the perfect book light. Battery life is excellent with the LED bulbs.",5.0
"The company that manufactures this light is called Mighty Bright, and for good reason!  The lamp gives off more than enough light to read by in a pitch black room.  It has two brightness settings, one with both LEDs and another with just one.  The LEDs in this lamp are so bright, that only one is really needed, having two is an added bonus.  I'm not using a power adatpter, I'm running off of 3 AAA batteries.  LEDs use such a small amount of power, those batteries should last me a year or more.  Overall I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this light.  With such a fair price I didn't think it would really hold up, but I'm definitely going to recommend it.",5.0
"New technology has led to the book or craft light that will be the end to all others.

Its incredibly bright--with no shadows--, lights both pages (no shadows), is by far the brightest light (maybe double), spots only onto the book (the room remains dark), completely flexable shaft so you can direct the light exactly on what you want, AND lasts 40 hours on 3 AAA batterys!

"Not my first book light, sad to admit, but this one offers:
Two levels of brightness, adjusted by pressing the button, Batteries included, A flexible neck that makes it easy to avoid hot spots on pages, and I just love the purple color.
So I'm going to have to replace the batteries.  Big Deal!  In fact, I'm of the opinion that that's the only way to go with these devices.  If my opinion changes, I'll update my review.",5.0

I gave this to my wife and she likes how bright the light is. Also it clips on the books with ease.

I would recommend this product .,5.0

Lightweight but powerful light for reading in bed.  Does not add to the weight of the book.  The clamp is nice and sturdy and does not slide around like other book lights i have had.

Super little light that provides great illumination!,5.0
"I am very happy with this thoughtfully designed book light. The plastic clip is a little bulky as its base houses the batteries (two AAA) but it offers good tension and does stay in place. When reading at night in bed (laying on my side) I clip the light onto the back cover of my book near the center of the book at the spine/binding. If it's not a hardback I just include several pages at the back of book along with the cover in the clip and the clip stays in place. The light is very bright and lights both open pages. The lamp head is easily adjusted and stays where I put it. Because I often fall asleep while reading, the auto shut-off option/feature was very important. It blinks a '1-minute warning' so if I am awake I can add more reading time simply by pressing a small button on back of lamp head -- 1 click for each additional 15 minute up to 3 clicks/45 min. A small light is illuminated for each click so at a glance I can see how much 'timer-time"" there is. The timer is an option, and the light can be turned on/off using similar button switch on lamp head. There is also a master off/on switch on the clip (where the batteries are located.)",5.0
Nice product. Recommended,5.0
"I did not expect this small light to be so bright. It's easy to use, works on my nook simple touch, paperbacks, and hardcovers. I have trouble seeing at night, and even when this is the only light I use, I can read easily. Both settings are equally bright, so if you're looking for a really bright book light, this works.",5.0

I used to read a lot on bed at night but after marriage I kind of stopped doing that as my hubby couldn't sleep with the loghts. Then I bought this and it is perfect.

"The light is great.  I have found it has great coverage, a great light, a very handy feature that turns one light off but keeps the other on to dim the brightness (good at night while the wife is asleep), and includes batteries.  As long as it last a while it will be well worth the money.",5.0
Gives off more light and is sturdier than I expected. Does what I hoped it would do.,5.0
"I bought these so my kids can read at bedtime without fights over when it's time to turn out the lights.  There is a master switch on the main body of the lamp, and a timer switch on the light head.

Pros: The timer is easy to set - you simply push the button and it cycles from off to 1, 2, 3, or 4 red lights showing - each light indicates a 15 minute interval.  My kids can easily set it and tell how long it is set for.

General info: It takes 3 AAA batteries (included).  The battery compartment is easy to open by pushing the small black button on the bottom of the light.

All in all it's a great light and I plan to get an extra one for myself so I don't waste batteries when I fall asleep over my book at night.",5.0
"We use this amazing light above our desks.  We love the way we can move it around to shine on the paperwork we are working on.  I originally bought it for myself, then my husband wanted one too.  We have old eyes so the Mighty Bright light makes it easy to get our work done in our office...",5.0

"I've had this since 2011 and used it for many unexpected things. Of course, it's great as a book light for my Kindle, although I don't read in the dark much any more. It used to live on the bookcase to use like a flashlight finding CD's or book titles. I used it with a magnifying glass for coin collecting.  I used it when cleaning the dog's ears. He'd lay on his side on the couch, and I'd clip the light to the edge of the afghan and direct it so I could see. (A couple years ago, my wife gave me a head lamp that works even better.) More recently, I clip it to the toilet seat to illuminate the target during those nocturnal visits, improving aim without blinding me with bathroom lights.

I'm very impressed with the build quality of this light. It works as well now as when new. I truly love proven durability. Batteries last a long time because LED's use so little power. I really haven't used the optional plug-in power adapter because portability is key. The goose neck is still sturdy and the switch still works. The rubberized grip pads have stayed unpetrified and spring tension is still good.",5.0

"Works perfectly. It creates a beam of light that lights up the book just right and not the room.

Not sure how how long a battery lasts, but if it's terrible I'll adjust my rating accordingly.",5.0

I bought this little guy so I could read actual physical books in bed without waking my mate. Two brightness settings; bendy neck; and lightweight: You-know-who immediately claimed it.

I ordered the Mighty Bright after breaking the clip off of my 7-year old Mighty Bright that was still going strong.  The product is durable and I suspect that the plastic clip had become brittle with age.  It has served me well and has traveled the world with me.  The original item still illuminates well.  This is the most practical private lighting fixture on the market.  I like having the ability to determine the strength of light.  I can use either one bulb or both with one click.,5.0

"I love these book lights.  I bought some in pink and blue for my kids and came back and bought another for myself.  They are very easy to use.

"This heather not work at all
Bad purchase",1.0
This heater leaked internally  right after install.  Directions are incomplete- nothing on how the built in computer control works,1.0
I ordered this unit IR260 and was unable to install it for about. a month because I needed to install the electric to the area where I was using it . The unit did what I wanted it to do for about 3 to 4 months and stoped heating the water. I contacted the manufacturer and they said to contact the seller to get it replaced for free. When I contacted them they gave me the runaround I asked to speak to a technician  they said he would call me that day. Later that day the phone rang with that same number but when I picked up on the first ring no answer. This is not the type of seller Amazon needs.,1.0
"i installed this 10 months ago, instructions were easy and it worked well. this week, the water heater is stuck on 26/27. i tried all the different modes from 1-4, reset my circuit breakers, no changes. it won't heat water anymore.

UPDATE 1-20-18

Their warranty requires you to have a licensed installer. But that isn't my complaint. Its their useless service that renders the most possible difficulty and monetary gain on the company that disturbs me. I actually dropped off my heater to get fixed when this company was named SuperGreen, seems they changed names. Their supposed heating element that lasts 20 years was broken in 10 months. When I tried to pick it up, they made it as difficult for me to pick up as possible after 5pm at the worst traffic. They are never in the office, but if you show up they will try to make a show that they are working hard. If you call them its some VOIP callback system with really bad sound quality, the baby crying in the background gives it away pretty quickly. This product seems like some kind of repackaged Alibaba heater, as the Celsius reading is obviously not made for the USA market.

Rather than jump through their hoops to pick up my repaired heater, I just left it there because I figured it will save me more problems down the road and I really don't want to deal with their bad service anymore. I bought another company's water heater, installed it myself. Didn't require any contractor to install it and the warranty is good. The new water heater readings are in F, not C.  The Supergreen/SioGreen dial adjusting inlet where you have to manually turn wasn't required, my new water heater just worked. Less headache, more hot water. That's all I wanted, and I got it with another manufacturer.",1.0
"What can I say it broke, and forgot the warranty to send it in. So I have to pay lots of money on shipping and repair. Not going to happen.",1.0
"I bought this for $40.00, on the package it says $20. and it definitely isn't worth more than that. I didn't do my homework and shop around. My mistake. But I'm disappointed and definitely wouldn't buy it agin... except maybe for the initial $20 price.",1.0
I loved these when i first got them and have been using them non-stop. As a designer you need these! The brad that holds the swatch book together came apart and it's only been a month. My swatch book went EVERYWHERE! I had to spend a long time putting it back in order and tried putting the brad back but it won't snap into place and continues to break. Now i have to carry it around in a plastic bag! real professional right?,1.0
Piece of crap.  Fell apart right out of the box.  For over $100 you'd think they would have chosen a better quality piece of plastic (or maybe metal instead) to bind the swatch cards together.  Very disappointed with Pantone.,1.0
"Needs to be changed back to numbericql sorting,  New layout is horrible",1.0
"The seller is not providing what is promised in the description of this item. The description states it comes with color correction tool and the seller than says go to pantone wwww and download it.  The URL they provide doesn't work. Then you ask about the correct URL and they tell you to search for it. Request a refund, send back the product and never hear back. Terrible customer service and does not match description.",1.0
"I am a creative artist for a garment decoration business and Pantone books are a must-have.  But shame on you Pantone.  We pay a lot of money for these guides, but your latest books are made from cheap, flimsy paper which folds, bends and tears easily.  Colors are NOT in numerical order, which may be fine if you're just trying to eyeball tonal values, or if you are an art student, but very frustrating to professionals who need to look up a certain PMS number quickly and without a lot of hassle.  It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  I know you provided an index for color numbers in the back of the book...an index, really?!  I should be able to go right to the color, not have to look it up in an index.

I noticed that you no longer have customer reviews available on your website.  I am guessing that this is because of the hundreds and hundreds of negative reviews I read there while you still had it on your site.  Please Pantone, go back to the thick stock paper, with PMS colors in numerical order.

You poor souls reading this review, well, you are stuck with what they sell now.  I contacted Pantone and they do not sell older versions of their books.  Good luck.",1.0
"After using pantones for the last 10 yrs this is by far THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT !.

- the Stock is light and will not stand a commercial environment for any length of time.  We use these books to work with !

- The numbers of reference make no sense at all.  most people use numbers to reference in a consecutive manner. pantone was on acid when they designed this as it is just a jumbled mess with no rationale at all.

If this is this company moving forward with a new product their days are numbered and i will certainly not be buying another product from them.

RIDICULOUS !!!

"The paper quality of the stock is terrible.  I borrowed an older version from a friend and the quality was much better.  The new one is thinner and softer, making it difficult to slide open and compare colors.  This is too flimsy, not worth the price.",1.0
"If you are used to the old pantone books, you will absolutely hate the new books. The stock is literally paper thin. It is so flimsy I'm afraid to look for a color because I'm afraid I'm going to tear the book. The order is new and if your used to the old way you won't like it either. My number one reason to not get it is the stock. I called Pantone today because they came out with a new book called Designer Field Guide. I thought ""maybe they listened and made thicker stock!"". Nope. Same stock. I told him I refuse to buy a new book until they change the stock.",1.0
"Hurry if you are ordering light or case.  Both have gone up in price in last 2 weeks light by $11.00, CASE BY $4.00.  why I don't know I had them on hold, should have ordered sooner.  It wasn't on a sale before either.....",1.0
"The concept is great, but both lights flicker and have issues.  We have only used this at home about a dozen times in bed.  For this price it should be more reliable.

E-mailed their customer service dept 3 days ago to see if they will cover under warranty -- NO RESPONSE!

"This arrived on October 15, and since then, I've used it a moderate amount.  I noticed that after a couple hours of use (intermittent use over the course of several weeks), the light grew considerably dimmer.  I figured it was the battery, so I changed it, and voila bright light again....for about 30 minutes. I changed the battery again, and the same thing happened.  Fast forward to today, and it doesn't work at all.  Don't waste your money on this light; spend a little more and get something better.",1.0
"Bought it two months ago, already defective.  Bummer.",1.0
Broke after first gig.,1.0
Awful! This is the second Mighty Bright Book Light I've owned and I couldn't be more disappointed. The bulbs are so dim I can't even use the stupid thing to read.  I'd recommend trying another product....,1.0
Not worth the even low price. Not bright or stable enough for use.,1.0
"My daughter loved this. But after only a few days, the light seems to be dimming. I'm not sure if this is a battery thing, lightbulb thing or if the unit is faulty. I'll contact the company and also check the batteries. I'll update this review after. Hopefully I'll have good news!",1.0
Very disappointed with this product. It stop working while I was reading. You have sent me two and they broke. I am 51 years old and I take care of my things. Just needed to let you know. Thank you,1.0
Product did not work on arrival!,1.0
"I've been needing a reading light, and this one seemed to be the perfect option. But when I got this light, it looks completely different thank the pictures of this item or the pictures other customers posted.
I'm really disappointed by this light. It came in a plastic bag, with no brand name or any other proper packaging. It did not include any battery as described. Instead, it has a short USB cord that can connect the night to, maybe a laptop. But this light is not rechargeable, I'm lost here.",1.0
I bought one at Barnes and noble. I put batteries in and turned it on... nothing. I touched the tip and the light flickered so maybe I needed new batteries. New batteries in and same problem then comes a burning smell. This heat my batteries up to a point that it was burning my hand. I'm upset because I need a light to read and I almost burned my book.,1.0
No usb recharge. I got snaked.,1.0
"The light worked for a couple seconds, flickered and went off.  I replaced the furnished batteries with my own duracells.  Still didn't work.  i sent it back a received credit from Amazon.",1.0

Battery door will NOT stay on. awkward weight - difficult to comfortably clip onto your book.,1.0
Mega bright. Hurt my daughters eyes,1.0
"Very disappointing, especially considering the other reviews.  The light EATS batteries.  I had to change them tonight after having changed them just a few weeks ago.  Also, now one of the three battery slots is not making the right connection.  It worked when I fiddled with it, but the battery was in a position that did not allow us to put the battery cover back into place.  My daughter is so disappointed.",1.0
This light is bizarrely bright.  It's more a disturbance to my husband than just leaving the bedside lamp on!,1.0
"Update:
All are now dead. I took a chance on ""Mighty Bright 47017 Recharge Book Light""
 mostly because it's head and neck are a continuous flexible  silicon piece.
The good:
No spinning head problem - easily adjustable - seems to have long battery life - much better made than my last mighty bright 40513

The not so good:
Neck is a bit short - another inch or so would have been much better.
The clip is small - It's been fine for paper backs and medium hard covers not sure it would work for text books or a kindle.
About twice the price - (but if it last will actually save cash)

=====================================
The Good
I really liked this light - the goose neck allows you to move it about with ease and it stays where you put it...doesn't sag like my old ""hinged"" reading light did
Light is BRIGHT yet doesn't seem to spill further than my book
Clamp works on both paper backs and hard covers
The BAD:
the first one (2012)  I bought ended up with a HEAD (the part where the bulbs are) that was so loose it spun about....that was after about a year...eventually I got sick of that and ordered another, just this past Sept (2015)....the plastic was much cheaper looking and the color less to my liking (got purple both times) but the WORST part was the on/off button stopped working after about 3 months :
AND the battery compartment cover Always popped off
: (

I am debating if the third time will be the charm - or if I need to look elsewhere

Update - taped the head on the 2012 purchase - looks funky but works - don't think I'll take a chance and another one of these",1.0
"I bought this reading light in October of last year. It is now March and I have to hold it next ti the page to be able to see. I haven't used it more than 30 hours. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed, a waste of money",1.0
So horribly bright it's unusable. My eyes. This thing is supposed to replace a candle not the sun. I'm not looking for a product called candle light- wish me luck.,1.0

"I have an older Xtra Flex book Light that is wonderful, so did not hesitate to purchase this one.  However it is made of a cheaper plastic material, and after a short time of use, the clip mechanism broke, so I can no longer clip the light on my Kindle or a book to read.  The light is now useless and is not capable of being fixed.",1.0
I'm posting this review before even trying this product! I ordered a new light but I received it in an open box! This is not acceptable! I'm speechless!,1.0
"Died after less than 10 uses - changing batteries doesn't help. No online instructions for changing bulb, nor does it seem possible to do so.",1.0
NO ELECTRIC PLUG,1.0
"The first time I tried to use it, it would not turn on. Tried different batteries but still no luck.",1.0
"Delivered Tuesday January 12. Today is the 18th. It broke while I was reading. The light itself is perfect and the two light settings are nice. But while I was using it to read, I heard a crack. From the pictures you'll see I didn't have it extended too far. So buyer beware! I'm just so disappointed. This has been the best book light up until it broke. Without the clip, I can't use it for a book light anymore.",1.0
After 2 months it only works if the power cord is plugged in.,1.0
I bought two.  Each one broke after less than 6 uses.. the light came apart and wouldn't go back together.  They are cheap and won't last so don't waste your money,1.0
"This light is not bright enough to read comfortably. I had to use it with another light on as a supplemental light, which sort of defeats the purpose. I have good vision and read without glasses so it shouldn't be too dark for me. It also falls off the book frequently.",1.0
The light is bright for only a few minutes and then it dims to a level that is useless.,1.0
"After a week, dims so much that it is useless.  New batteries didn't make a difference.",1.0
"I ordered two of these lights about 2 months ago - one for my husband and one for myself. I checked them both out when they arrived  and they appeared to work. My husband's light has been great but I haven't had a need to use mine until this weekend. So I find out my light flickers continually  (varying levels of brightness) , which makes it annoying  and unusable.
 I checked out the return policy and it is 30 days only ...so I am stuck with it. Really unhappy there is no recourse after 30 days as I would have ordered a replacement.
So the message is - test it thoroughly when you receive it !",1.0
"When you first turn this on, you think to yourself this is great.  But after about 4-5 minutes you can't even tell its on.  Just a faint glow.  The length of the arm is really too short to be useful if you can't type it to your reader.",1.0
"This is a very soft white low light. Too soft and its not even close to a might bright, they advertise. Its way too low of a light to read by.",1.0
"I loved the idea of this item.  It clips onto a surface and provides reading light over a book.  It worked well for a a while but then the batteries needed replacing. We replaced the batteries and it didn't work.  We replaced them again with a new set of fresh batteries and it still didn't work.  I threw it out.  I would not purchase this product again, obviously.",1.0
It lasted only for two weeks. Not a good product. Total waste.of money.,1.0
"What a waste, not bright enough or big enough to be useful.  Like a using a magnifying glass as it does not illuminate the whole page",1.0
"Did NOT last the month.  I don't want to have to replace a battery every month, and my daughter was only reading an hour a night.",1.0
Not happy. Had one just like this and it was great. Light keeps flickering and it drives me crazy.  Can't use it.,1.0

"I do not recommend this product, I bought the purple one, and after three weeks of been using it ( not in daily bases). Its stem was too loose. The next day it was completely hanging down. It is not way to tie it up. Therefore, I cannot use it. Unfortunately I discharged the Book light's box some days after I receive it ( do not make the same mistake). And, I am unable to return it.",1.0
"I bought 2 of these, and they give off good light for a few minutes and then fade very quickly to almost nothing.  Very disappointed and I have no idea how there are so many positive reviews.",1.0

Not bright enough for studying. maybe convenient to casually read in bed but definitely not for studying. It makes you sleepy.,1.0

Stopped working soon.  New batteries didn't help.  It dims so badly that it is useless,1.0

Ugly. Big and klunky. Not discreet at all.,1.0
"I swapped out the worthless cheap batteries that came with it, replacing them with brand-new Energizers. It worked well for about 8 hours of use. Since then, it produces adequate light for several minutes after turning it on, then the light dims to the point of being useless.",1.0
It''s not bright enough to be worth anything for reading purposes. It might work as a night light to keep from running into a wall.,1.0
Product is not worth ordering. I would return but I am not certain if I have the paperwork. The light gave off a bright light suitable for reading for the first week. Then suddenly it puts out only a very low light. Useless!!,1.0

"Let there not be light?  This tiny lamp is very bright when you first turn it on.  It goes dim after a short time, and if you are reading you need a bright light that lasts for the length of the book, not just a short chapter.  It's not sturdy and topples over easily.  It's too much bother to return.  I bought an electric standing lamp that plugs into the wall, works great and finally I can read with no eye strain.  Save your money and forget about this.",1.0
"This is a serious piece of junk. Not only did it stop working after less than a month of use, the battery compartment started leaking out all over the unit. Stay away from anything this company makes.",1.0

Didn't last long now broken,1.0
Ordered this Mighty Bright from DssK and received a knock-off from Singapore that took almost a month to arrive. Was in a plain unlabeled box. It has a different style clip than pictured and no Mighty Bright logo. The light works fine in battery mode but the USB power cord does not fit into the lamp body very well causing the lamp to go out if moved at all when plugged in. Attempted to contact DssK through Amazon and they never replied.,1.0
I thought it was brighter,1.0
"I bought this light 3 months ago.  The button that turns the light on and off has stopped working so now I have to take the batteries out to turn it off--what a cheap piece of $HIT.

Stay clear of this $HITTY, Made in China light that looks good but is NOT  a quality product.",1.0
"The light I got was an apparent Chinese knock off, it was in a plain white box and is poorly constructed.",1.0
This was not the original Mighty Bright t thought I was buying. Mailed from someone in China. Not very sturdy.,1.0
The lighting is too weak. It barely brightens.,1.0
This light is just not bright enough and is made with that cheap Chinese quality that we've all come to expect. Our daughter doesn't even use it anymore. Keep looking!,1.0
"Horrible! Defective product, I never even got to use this lamp once. Soon as I put brand new batteries in the whole thing overheated......waste of money!",1.0
"Shortly after I received it, it stopped working. Amazon is having it replaced.",1.0
Junk- did not work well... Do not waste your money...sorry Amazon....,1.0
Beware!  What I received was not a Mighty Bright light.  It was a knock off that was mailed from China. I already have 2 Mighty Bright lights already (which I love).  The one I received is a bad knockoff.  I am in the process of trying to get my money back.  Buy only from Amazon.,1.0
"Battery cover came off within a few minutes... the light was floppin' around every where, which is very irritating when you just want to read in peace next to your husband without waking him... instead it was a gosh dang disco dance floor in bed. Thanks Xtraflex2 for ruining my marriage.",1.0
The light is temperamental. It only works when it wants to. Replaced the batteries multiple times & still will only power on half the time.,1.0
"I just received it. Why  one star? Well, the main reason I purchased was because after comparing price to others, I figured it was a good deal since description said ""3AAA batteries included""... well you guessed it, the batteries are NOT included. False advertising. Soooooo can't tell you if it works or not since I really didn't purchase with the intentions of plugging it in a wall socket. That's why I have a lamp. Very disappointing.",1.0
This light started out just great.  I got it about 2 months ago.  Now when I turn it on it is very bright for about 10 minutes then it dims and is not very bright at all.  I don't know if I just got a bad one but now it says I can't return it.  I have had it too long - 2 months - that is disappointing.  I bought due to all the good reviews.,1.0
"I didn't get 15 hours of use out of my light. Went dead; I tried 3 separate sets of brand new batteries. Nothing. Waste of money. And the on-off switch being in top of light, every time you adjust the arm, you hit the switch. Poor engineering.",1.0
The item arrived fast but it's not working properly.,1.0
Did not include the 3 triple-A batteries that were promised.,1.0
"Defective.  Flickered on and off the first time I used it.

This brand has a great reputation but is tough to find in stores.  Either I got a complete dud (which is possible) or this is not a genuine product that someone is trying to pass off as real to amazon distributors.  I'm very suspicious.",1.0
It' not working,1.0
"The stem of this light is not like the older model in that it will not stay in the position in which you set it, something to do, I imagine, with the construction of the stem that runs from the battery housing to the lamp itself.  Thus, it is near impossible to light the exact area you wish most to illuminate.  The manufacturer has clearly cut cost with materials and it shows.  If you want to light up the area just to the left of where you actually need the illumination, this might be the product for you.  Very frustrating.",1.0
"I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. This is a flimsy, cheaply designed problem that stopped working after a few days of normal use. I would not recommend it to a friend.",1.0
Too awkward.  Turning pages is too noisy,1.0
Broke within a day of use. Light will not turn on/off anymore. Sorry but cannot recommend this product.,1.0
"I got this as a birthday gift to my wife, and it worked great for the first 2 hours. Then the thing wouldn't turn off. In the middle of the night, to get the light off, I pulled the battery. Now the thing won't turn on (yes the battery is back in). I suspect that the problem is in the switch, maybe a lemon, or maybe its just a piece of junk. Eitherway, its junk to me now.
I'd return it if I could, but apparently since it spent 3 weeks wrapped up, I have missed the window, and now cant be returned. My only option now is to dismantle the thing and hope to fix it. MONEY WASTED.",1.0
Not enough light.  I am so sorry I listened to the reviews and purchased this light.  It is just not enough light to read by.  I did give it a try several times but I had to keep changing the position of the light attached to the  book cover.  I would have sent it back but didn't want to start up with the packing and the shipping.  Down the road I gave this concept of attached a small light to the book another try with TWO lights on the product.  That one was not as bright as this one and I got eyestrain and dizzy after trying to use it.  There are LED lights out there that are larger and stand on my headboard but have flexible stems that can be turned away from the other side of the bed.. I use one of those and it is not that much more $$.  Please don't waste your money on this item.,1.0
"The base is way too bulky, to the point that it's pretty much useless to use with a paperback book. You have to clip a big chunk of pages in order for the book to be able to hold it but even then, it will still rock to the side and requires constant babysitting.

If that wasn't bad enough, now I can't even get it to turn off. It is supposed to have 3 modes, bright (both lights on) regular (one light on) and off. Well after using a grand total of 3 whole times, mine will only switch between one light or two lights on, it won't turn off. I have to pull the batteries out to turn it off. It's turned into way too big of an inconvenience for me to keep this. I'm returning it and getting something else.",1.0
"We purchased two of these November 19th, 2013 for or 7 and 5 year olds to use as reading lights before bed.  Worked well at first.  Then my youngest was moving his lite and told me it was hot.  I checked the lite and at the base of the black cord where the cord enters into the battery pack the black cord was Very hot.  I immediately removed the batteries and did not detect anything.  Put batteries back in, the lite came on and had the same effect.  I have now removed from there room.

We did not have a similar issue with the other that we could tell, but we found blue paint on our son's bed where the lite was clipped. Again upon inspecting the lite, the paint was liquifying (?) and rubbing off the lite.  I removed this lite as well.

Long story short, I would not recommend and certainly would not provide to a child as there is clearly something going on in the quality of the mfg.  Amazon I recommend you investigate as I certainly would not want my children around products like this...",1.0
Love this double bulbed lite for reading books & magazines.,1.0
"tiny tiny tiny, and the light is very very dim. it is probably only useful if you clip this on your big book directly, if it's placed on a nightstand or a desk, because it's so short and light is so dim, it's hardly useful.",1.0
"i guess it's not a good sign when something doesn't work out of the box.
not worth my time to return.
they should pay ME for saddling me with this piece of garbage.",1.0
"Batteries lasted maybe a week.  Never again. This is a poorly contructed item that at best gave out a 5"" light.",1.0
This is not a commentary on the product itself. I am giving one star because the product is described as using small lithium batteries when instead it uses AAA batteries. For space reasons this was important to me.,1.0
did not work when I got it right away.  had to send it back immediately.  It is junk - spend a little more money on something else.,1.0
"The first one kept going off Put in new batteries same problem then quit working at all, second one worked for 30 min then the light started getting weaker and weaker. Not for me.",1.0
I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN. USED LIMITED BASIS FOR NIGHT READING AND GETTING AROUND THE HOUSE IN THE DARK WITHOUT WAKING THE FAMILY UP. I THOUGHT LEDS LASTED A LONG TIME. THIS ONE NOT SO MUCH. IT DOES HAVE A NICE DESIGN BUT I ENDED UP DONATING MINE AFTER IT CRASHED IN MONTH AND CHANGING THE BATTERIES DID NOT HELP. OH WELL. LESSON LEARNED.,1.0
"Sadly I was only able to use this book light a few times before the clamp stopped ""clamping"". The spring underneath appears to be intact, but when I press the clamp to open it and clamp it took my book it won't close again, just loosely swings back and forth. Worked perfectly fine last night. What a disappointment!!! I'm not sure I can even return it bc of Amazon.coms very tight return policy. Also the name ""Mighty Bright"" is very fitting. This light is WAY TOO BRIGHT!",1.0
"Bought this hoping that it would be the perfect light for reading in bed next to my husband while he sleeps, but it is way too bright, even with only one bulb lit.  I tried putting a thin sock over it to dim the light but then I had another problem.  A tiny part of the bulb continued to glow even after I turned everything off.  I had to remove a battery to get it to turn off completely. The clamp is way too big/bulky even for mid-size paperbacks.  Disappointed and money wasted.",1.0
This broke almost immediately - both the bulb and the bendable neck. The clip is also not able to grab on to things that are thicker than a book cover (hard cover). I was hoping my son could clip it onto his headboard but it didn't work.,1.0
This is not what I thought it would be. The clip does not hold sturdy onto any book and the arm does not steadily hold the light in one place where I set it. I would not recommend this.,1.0
The item was dead on arrival. The package was partially open. The head housing the light was loose and the someone had tried to open it. The screw holding the housing together had groove marks and scratches near it. It was definitely not new. Returned for refund.,1.0
"I purchased this as a stocking stuffer and gathered all items together last night. I took the light out of the packaging and tried it, which normally I would not do (take it out of the package).  The light does not work at all. Because I ordered the light and did not check it right away, I missed the date of return limit. I am not pleased. Faulty product but I am paying the price.",1.0
"The product description says power source is PLUG-IN.
It is not, it is battery operated.  Had I known this, I would not have bought it.
Other similar lights like this one are only $9.00.",1.0
"I have purchased two Mighty Bright Book lights in the last two years. The battery compartment must overheat, because the batteries in both lights began to corrode and leak after only a few months. I couldn't open the battery compartment of the first Mighty Bright because the batteries had leaked and corroded inside the casing. Last night while I was reading, battery acid began leaking from the battery compartment of the book light and the stuff got on my hands and face and started burning! These were not old lights -- I bought the most recent one about 6 months ago. I don't recommend this product and suggest that Amazon stop selling it.",1.0
"It appears they (China) makes a single light model because that is what I got.  The ad clearly says 2-light, but there is only one bulb and one setting, on or off. It does seem bright enough for me to read by, so I'll keep it and hope it doesn't have all the problems others have had with the two light model.

As an aside, This kind of thing is getting more common in the last year, not getting what I ordered. Some orders are hundreds of dollars and have always been fine, but in the last couple of months I have received wrong parts that the dealer clearly knew was not what was advertised. To Amazon's credit, they have always made things right in the end, but it is still a hassle for the buyer",1.0
"I received this in the mail a few days ago, the first night I plugged it in it worked.  I went to use it the next day and the light would not come on.  I tried other pluggs to see if it was because of extension cord. Nothing, I read the reviews on here and they were mixed but a product should not stop working in a day. I would not recommend this because in my opinion it is defected.",1.0
"I was so excited to open this product.  Immediately I plugged it in (so it would ""charge"") and waited until the next night to try it.  Hmmm...unplugged it...it didn't work.  Plugged it in (has an approx 6' cord) it works.  Hmmm...read the instructions.  Takes 3 AAA batteries...cool....""Remove batteries when the reader's light is not in use.""  Are you kidding me???  Every time I want to use this, unless it is plugged in (I wanted something that didn't have to be plugged in while I used it) I need to put batteries in it...and when ""done"" need to take batteries out?  I paid $25 bucks for this.  My daughter-in-law got her book light for about $10 bucks at Target.  She doesn't have to take her batteries out when her book light is not in use.  Now if putting batteries in and taking them out doesn't annoy you or you don't mind dealing with the cord--I'd rate it a 4, but for me...it's a 1.  Jan in Portland, OR",1.0
"It was so big and cumbersome I just decided to mail it back without even opening it. These lights are supposed to be handy and not  bulky--why not just use a regular lamp instead, if not?",1.0
"It would have been a great light if it lasted. Hardly used it and went to turn it on and nothing. Always plugged in but changed batteries and still nothing. So, yes, I hate it.",1.0
great little light except that it is too bright to use. i will keep it and use for a car light since my interior car light is out---but too bright for a reading light,1.0
"I loved the design of this book light but the first time I used it, after about 5 minutes one of the lightbulbs started to flicker and has continued.  It is very distracting when you are using it to read.",1.0
"The light is not that light, but OK it's small.  The problem is that IT DOESN'T WORK!  The light worked for approx.  2 hours.  I changed the batteries, but nothing!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!",1.0
I'm not sure if this is an unusual occurrence but the light I received has a constant flutter in the light with three brand new batteries and is unusable for nighttime reading. I will be returning this product.,1.0
"This item worked very well when I first opened the package. Unfortunately I have only had it a couple of months and never really used it and the first time I wanted to do some midnight reading, it didn't work. What good is it if the battery goes so quickly?

"This light is way over rated. It comes with no batteries, a somewhat bright light, and I could not recomment this to my friends.",1.0
"This light is great when it first comes on its bright, but after only a few minutes it starts to go dim.  I use it for my work to be able to see my papers I type from easier but after a few minutes it really is bad.  I guess its time to find me a brighter one that does bright.",1.0
I ordered two of these and both just arrived with defective switches.  One light does not keep burning once turned on.  The other light cannot be switched OFF and the switch is out of position. I have a Mighty Bright that is about 6 years old and still works but is not an LED.  The old one is of much more quality construction.  I am sending both of these back.  Save your time and money.

when you light it it's nice and bright for about a minute, but then it dims and it barely lightens what you're reading. I have to use my night table lamp anyway for reading, even if i have this little thing on. I would return it but i took a while from when i bought it until i actually started using it, so it was too late. I know I would not recommend it and definitely won't buy again. sorry Mighty bright!",1.0
"It is bright at the beginning, but after a few months of use, this light becomes very dim and barely usable. Very disappointing product.",1.0
I know there are only a couple of other reviews where that was a problem... but still a real bummer.,1.0
"This may be enough light if you attach it to the item you're reading, assuming its not a thick book, and the light is 6-8"" from the reading surface.  But then its a hassle every time you want to turn the page.  Its too dim for me at 18-24"" inches from the reading surface, for example, attached it to a bed board behind you.  The LED light is very bluish.",1.0
It produced a nice reading light for one day.  The next day the light wouldn't work.  I thought it was the batteries.  I put 3 new ones in today and it still doesn't work.,1.0
"this does not fit at all on the m-edge leather case i just don't know where to clip it on.
and it's very heavy to use and im not comfortable reading with this light on bed since i usually clip it on the middle portion the folding part of the leather case not on the kindle unit so it's kinda heavy and need some effort to hold your kindle.
i had a hard time using this for my kindle touch reason i ordered another brand fitted for my m-edge leather.
i was trying to save a little, but rather ended up paying for more....",1.0
"The first one of these I got didn't work at all so I returned it and go another.  It worked when I got it, but then the first time the power in my house went out and I tried to use it, it didn't work at all.  And yes, I put in a new set of batteries.

Book lights never seem to last long, but this one sets a record for shortest period of time not working.  Fulcrum makes a better reading light.",1.0
"My original review said: Design makes it easy to travel with or store, and it has worked flawlessly for me. I would definitely recommend it.

Then the button stopped working, and I couldn't turn it on or off (except by removing the batteries) or change the dimness. So, Amazon will give me a partial refund when I send it back, but if the company that sold this product to me wants to replace my broken light, I'd be happy to send it back and get one that works.",1.0
"While there are plenty of positive reviews for this thing, make sure you check all the negative reviews as well.  For 11 bucks, I guess I didn't expect much, but it came so close to being good that it made it more disappointing to see it fail.

As others noted, yes, it is bright.  The clip worked fine for me on the book I'm trying it on.  However, it flickers so much as to be really distracting.  You know how in some houses the lights go up and down a bit when the central a/c comes on?  That's this thing, the whole time, and right on top of your reading.  Pretty disappointed, and I'll probably look for another solution.",1.0
"I purchased a kindle book light from Amazon 4 days ago. This is the type that plugs in so no batteries to replace. After one day of use the on/off switch no longer works,  sending this turkey back.",1.0
"This is not a travel light - unless you want to be hauling around with you a ""portable"" light that is about as big as a small paperback. Amazon description is awful. This is NOT what you want if you're looking for discrete, small, lightweight light. It's heavier than an e-reader! Ugh! I would return but the return shipping cost is half the price.",1.0
"I barely used this light. It might have been for the length of a total of 2 hours and it flickered, then there was this a burning smell. The light suddenly dimmed, and I'm hardly able to use it to read in the dark now. I bought it from a local bookstore so I'm not even sure if I'll be able to get refunded for this horrible light... I'll have to check the warranty to see if I can get a new one or get refunded from Mighty Bright. It really is too bad since I wanted to like this light since it had the option of using an AC adapter.",1.0
"Well it worked for a while for my wife. She used frequently, not sure how many hours of use though. Then switch started shorting out. 15-20 taps to turn on, then 15-20 taps to turn off. Light still works, but they should use a more reliable switch in next version.",1.0
Ordered a new reader light with the adapter.  The adapter what the specific reason for ordering it.  Came with NO packaging and no adapter!  Extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to this little item.  Returning this within 30 minutes of receiving it.  Never had this happen to me on an amazon fulfilled order.  Amazon should dump this seller immediately.,1.0
"I bought this, thinking it was kinda high, but really needing a book light, that I didn't need to always have batteries for.  I used it it was great.  The next time I used it was a week later, and that night it wouldn't work.  I tried it with batteries and a different adaptor cord after that.  It still didn't work.  I threw it out.",1.0
"The light worked for almost a month to the day and then the on/off button stopped working properly. It would turn on sometimes and not others; other times it would not turn off - I would have to remove the batteries. The product cannot be exchanged for a new one, refund is the only return option, but considering the price of the product and how much it would cost to send it back, it doesn't make much sense to do so. I basically rented a booklight for a month for $15.",1.0
"It may have been a dud--but the light I received did not work for very long, even after I switched the battery. It gave out strong light for a few minutes, then slowly flickered, then died. I replaced the battery again, to no avail.",1.0
"liked the light very much, and just threw the paperwork out the other day.... this morning light switch came off in my hand.... not repairable.... have had less than a month",1.0
"I was so excited to buy this light because of the positive reviews it got, I probably should have read the 1 star reviews because it would have saved me from buying it, I got this light on August 13, 2011 and the light stopped working on Oct 1, 2011, I am beyond mad, I turned my light on last night to begin reading and it made this noise like the bulb in the light went out and I was like OK maybe I need to replace the batteries (even though I JUST recently changed the batteries a few weeks ago) tried turning it on and NOTHING, wow what a rip off....",1.0
"I really hate to say ""I hate it"" But from the fisrt day I received it it flickered so I did report this to Amazon
and they did refunded my money.
So thank you
Sharon Traina",1.0
"I am thoroughly irritated. I bought this light, and immediately after receiving the package, I opened it up, put the batteries in, and turned it on to make sure it worked. Light wasn't as bright as I had hoped, but whatever, I figured I'd deal with it. Played around with the different light settings, then turned it off and left it on a table. The light was probably on for a minute total. Then I got busy for a few days and didn't use it, and now - 5 days after receiving it - I sat down to read and tried to use it, and it wouldn't turn on. Tried other batteries, still wouldn't turn on. Bottomline: A useless, junky light with very little brightness, if you can even get it to work. Definitely returning it.",1.0
It fits nicely on my Kindle cover but has flickered annoyingly from day one even though the battery is new.  Very disappointing.,1.0
I purchased this to use with my Sony Pocket Edition E-reader. It does not fasten onto it. I will have to be returning it.,1.0
"The light is too bright, even on the lower setting. My boyfriend can't fall asleep next to me when I have it on. An LED reading light is not necessary, I'll look for one that has a regular light, or an even lower light setting.",1.0
"Purchased in Jan 2011, dead by the end of March. Good Flexibly but no light no matter how I positioned it on my kindle. The 2 light brightness settings became inoperative. Waste of money. Surprised that this product failed with very little usage. Changed batteries 3 times light comes on until you release the button, the light goes out. This product is not worth your time let alone your hard earned money. A ""none of the above"" category would be closer to the truth as concerns this item. The lack of real a warranty from the manufacturer of this product isn't surprising!",1.0
"The batteries on the light don't last more than 2-3 hours.  I suspect something is wrong with the off switch, it keeps sucking power even when off.  Anyway, have not been able to use it much due to poor battery life.  Tried various batteries, none worked.",1.0
This light is very poorly made and I'd skip buying one. It broke the second time I used it. The light gets stuck on and won't shut off. I have to remove the batteries in order to shut off the light. It's being returned.,1.0
"I'd like to point out that the option suggested below the product which says that customer's often buy these items together, is very incorrect. The light bulbs shown, are not for the lamp being sold.  This was confirmed by the seller by phone. Please avoid making the same mistake I did in ordering what I assumed would be replacement bulbs for the lamp being sold.",1.0
"I ordered one of these book lights and it seemed to work really well right out of the box, however the very next day one of the bulbs would not turn on at all. So I thought maybe it needed new batteries, but after replacing the batteries there was no change. Then the light stopped working altogether. It now turns on only intermittently and flickers (still only one bulb). Unfortunately I threw away the package immediately after receiving it, don't make that mistake, and now I cannot return it without the package. Also I purchased it from an outside seller that was fulfilled through amazon, so I don't even have the option to exchange it. That is poor customer service on Amazon's part.

Don't waste your money on this overpriced book light. The quality of the workmanship is poor.",1.0
"Let me say that I wish this thing worked. I'll get to that in a minute.

First, Design-wise. 1. The clip. It clips well, even to a paperback, so long as you clip some pages in with the cover. 2. The flex-arm. Seems to be flexible enough to angle the light whichever direction you'd like. Great. 3. The light itself. Very bright. It does have a slight blueish tinge to it that didn't bother me. It also covered the whole page, and since the arm is so flexible, you can move the light away from the book to increase coverage.

But, alas. About 5 minutes after I turned it on, the light began to flicker. Now this is annoying. Well, I thought, maybe it's just the battery they sent has been sitting around too long. Nope. New battery, same problem. There's a short or something in the wiring or switch. And the flickering is unbearable when the booklight is the only light in the room, which pretty much is the idea with a booklight.

Seems like if you get a functioning light, this reading light is perfectly good. I've read through just about every review on every booklight on amazon. The problem seems to be that with just about all of them, there seems to be something like a 1 in 10 chance that you'll just get a dud. Total guess on actual numbers, but you get the idea. For every booklight, there's at least a few people that get one that doesn't work. I'm that guy with this one. So, one-star.",1.0
"Be hestitant to buy this lamp, it comes with batteries and light bulbs that supposedly need no replacement.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have used this lamp and it quit working.  I tried to replace the batteries, didn't work.  Trying to decide if I should attempt to replace the light bulbs or send it back for a partial refund of my money.... either way, buy with caution.",1.0
"after 5 minutes use, it just died.  WOW!!  i bought so many products through amazon so far but i never had a product stopped working after 5 minutes.
it seemed to work well at the first time and my wife liked it for minutes then it stopped. i don't recommend this thing to anyone. NEVER!!!",1.0
"Arrived without working! :( I replaced the batteries a few times, still nothing. I tossed it.
If anyone can rec a good booklight for my K3 please advise.",1.0
I purchased this light to attach to my Kindle E-Reader. Although it is small the clip is to big and bulky for my reader. I ended up purchasing the  lighted leather book cover case. I love this-the light is less obtrusive and perfect for reading in low light areas!,1.0
"I purchased this light in late July 2010.  It now does not work at all.  Even for the price, I think it should last longer than 2 months.",1.0
This light was only good for a few hours and then needed a new battery.  The company had me return it and they sent another that wasn't any better.  They gave me a refund and I returned the second one.  I will never buy another book light using only a AAA battery.  I've given up trying to find a light for my portable book reader.,1.0
"After purchasing 2 of the older incandescent models I had to stop using them as music stand lights. Despite the convenience of wire free operation and their ability to put the beam right on the page while keeping it out of the audiences line of sight, they blew bulbs CONTINUALLY. I was ""left in the dark"" on several crucial occassions. That was not what I had in mind when I purchased them.
  So I decided to try the single LED model. I bought two of them and within a month they became intermittent. The vibrations on stage would actually cause them to go to 1/2 light or fail completely. A source of irritation both to me & MY EMPLOYER!!
  As to customer service, I had a better experience than some of the other reviewers. When I contacted them to report the problem and see if perhaps I was doing something wrong, they got back to me in a reasonable time frame and sent me a replacement. Which promptly failed as well.
  Anyway, my advice is to avoid these products as they seem to suffer some real durability issues in thier design. Just shoddy",1.0
"I have still not received this Light.  I emailed the supplier asking for a shipping reference number and they replied saying that it had been shipped; but, did not send a tracking number for it.  Disappointed.  Diane Donovan",1.0
"Purchased the silver color one from an Amazon Marketplace seller. The light just stopped working after only one month. Then the seller (Shoreline Music) told me it's over one month, so I can only get replacement from the manufacturer. I called the customer service of Mighty Blue and left a message about the situation but never heard back from them. I may try calling again later, but so far I'm very disappointed at the quality and service of this product. Would not recommend at all!",1.0
Don't expect it to last more than a few months.  It works nicely while it works but my first lasted about 6 months and the second has started to go after a couple of weeks.,1.0
"I bought the silver mighty bright flex 2.  I fastened it to a book and began to read.  Before I finished the first page, the light went out.  If I hold the button down, the light works but it is very unhandy to try to read and hold the button down.  Apparently the button has a short somewhere.  You would think that they would test the product before packaging to eliminate production defects.  I ordered it on ebay, so it will likely be quite a hassle to return it.  After reading so many 5 star reviews, I thought that I would be getting a product that I would be happy with.  Perhaps they have all been written by company employees.",1.0
"I bought and used the mighty bright light at home for reading.  The light is not all that bright but this was a minor flaw.  The real issue is after using it for a couple months the damn thing fell apart at the head.  The warranty is non existent so if it breaks the day you get it you're out of luck...

Currently I am looking for one either from a place that provides some type of warranty on electronics, or one that comes with a minimum 1 year warranty",1.0
"I have had a total of three of these booklights. The first one lasted a year before the clip broke. I ordered two the next time and within 2 months they both broke, at the same place, the clip. I managed to scavenge parts from one and put it back together, but it only lasted a week. The plastic is so brittle that either the clip itself breaks, or the hinge breaks where the clip fits on to the base. I have had it with these--they should last longer than this!",1.0
Very weak illumination of the book page - in an emergency I would read from it - but never for any length of time and never without another light source,1.0
This light worked great the first time I used it....lit up both pages of my book.  After the first time... it lights up about 1/2 sentence!  I have to keep moving the light to follow my page... I gave up and no longer use it!  Waste of money!,1.0
"My experience with the Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 contrasts with many of the other reviewers.  I received mine today and inserted new batteries and the unit would not work.  I opened the case and the batteries and the connector springs were extremely hot.  I hope you have better luck.  I will return mine.  This is another of those items made in China and somehow, I am not surprised.",1.0
"Less than a year old and it constantly blinks on and off due to loose connection, Do not recommend at all.... May be mighty bright, but mighty poor quality.",1.0
"Maybe mine is defective, but you need night vision goggles to read with this book light - provides a softy hazy glow only.  I bought this having read previous reviews and was sorely disappointed - one of the worst book lights I've ever had!",1.0
"This light didn't work when it arrived.  I thought maybe the batteries were dead, so I bought two more batteries (at 5.50 each, cost more than the light!)  The light worked when the new batteries were installed, but less than 24 hours later - again no light.

By that time I had thrown out the box, and just too much of a hassle to send back a 9.99 item.",1.0
"Worked for a few days and then quit working
We thought maybe it needed new batteries so we spent $10 on a new pack of batteries.
When we got home and put the new batteries in, the light still didn't work. Very disappointed!",1.0
"Worthless! The light was barely visible and too weak to see anything, so I changed the battery in case that was the issue and it stopped working entirely.",1.0
"light has trouble going on and now will not turn off.  We bought it early as a gift for daughter, she just opened it yesterday and unfortunately it is too late for us to return it.",1.0
"Spring busted the first week, button broke the next have to push button like 30 times to turn it on!",1.0
Does not work clip does not stay close so it keeps falling off. Second light broke and I only use it 4 times since dec. not worth the money.,1.0
"Would not recommend this product. When you squeeze the clip in order to clip it to a book, the battery cover slides off and the batteries fall out. Also, replacement batteries do not seem to work effectively in making a connection. Havent been able to use it at all since purchasing it.",1.0
"Came intact inside of the box, tried to turn on and it didn't work. We checked the batteries and still nothing. My child was disappointed,  never again.",1.0
Lasted about 3 months. In use about 20 min a night.,1.0

"This product is very good when it works. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long.",1.0
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It is now December 27, and it stopped working already. I don't expect the battery to last forever, but it should survive a 30 minute car ride!",1.0

Broke after one use..,1.0
"This book light does not work!
Extremely disappointing!
A birthday gift that made the child sad.
Should discontinue this brand.",1.0
Junk! Broke before I even had a chance to use it!,1.0
"The lights are cute, the metal neck holds its shape well, and the light is bright. The clip is strong, but a tad bulky and heavy.  However, I ordered three of these...on day 2 one no longer worked, and by day 5 the second one stopped working! So I have one light working out of three! Very upsetting. The price is expensive for such a faulty product.",1.0
The light died after using it three times. Waste of money.,1.0
It was a disappointment.  It did not give off enough light for me to read by it.,1.0
"I am very disappointed in this product. I bought it a little over a month ago and last week it died. I figured it was the batteries so I got more (which cost more than the light mind you) but it died completely a few days after changing them. Rip off, don't buy this product.",1.0
Cute light but it worked for a month. Replaced batteries and still light no longer functions. Waste of 10 bucks...,1.0
"too bright for nighttime reading, would be better with a dimmer",1.0
Does not work.,1.0
Very cute however it broke same day we opened it.  It goes for a few minutes then turns off even if your not touching it.  I would return it but my son threw out the packaging already.,1.0
Cute and convenient but the light portion broke from the adjustable metal wire after two weeks. Trashed it.,1.0
We ordered this light as a Christmas present for our 9-year-old avid reader.  It stopped working circa Day 3.  It's possible that she dropped it - but it seems to me that an LED reading light should be slightly more durable than this.  Waste of money.,1.0
"The button is so small, it is very hard to turn it on",1.0
This worked the first time we turned it on and then not again. Very disappointing.,1.0
"Received this item broken. 7 yr old opened it on Christmas morning and was ecstatic, only to be crushed when it did not work. If you really twist and bend the metal, you can get it to turn on every once in a while, but this doesn't seem safe. Very disappointed.",1.0
cheaply made,1.0
It didn't work when I bought so I returned it. I purchased a different brand from a different vendor.,1.0
"My daughter was very excited about this light, but she only had the chance to use it two times before it broke! :( The metal adjusting arm slipped out of the plastic clip and there in no way to get it back in.",1.0

Cute but the battery was dead when we received it. I went out and bought new batteries but then the light broke off. Very disappointed.,1.0
This item broke the first time we used it. It's junk. Don't order.,1.0
Received the wrong one.  Got the football one instead,1.0
Did not work out of box,1.0
"First this arrived in a blue paisley. I ordered a football one, the package said it was a football one but it was definitely not. It is just a book light so I made my kid keep it.
Then it stopped working after about 1 week.  He hardly used it and turned it off every time. Money wasted. It was a good size had it been what I ordered and actually worked I think I would have like it.",1.0
"This reading light quit working after one week of use. There was no abuse or foul play. The light was not left on over night, nor did a battery change help. Waste of money.",1.0
Died with 3 days.,1.0
"Purchased this as a stocking stuffer. It literally was out of the box for 2 minutes and the metallic  neck snapped on the ""clipping"" end. I bought this for my 7 year old daughter so naturally she was devastated. I don't know if it was shipped defective, but I watched her clip it on her book, and pull the light down and it snapped.

I'd not recommend this product.",1.0
Broke the first time we positioned light to read a book. Metal broke in half at the clip.,1.0
Would not buy again.,1.0
Battery died too fast.,1.0
"Waste of money! It was for My 8 year old, would come out of the clip easily, about the second ord third use, the contact for charging broke! She used it until it ran out of battery but i think it was pretty  expensive for a cheaply made lamp..",1.0
"Returned, it wouldn't charge.",1.0
I am not thrilled with this light.  The light part is nice and bright to read.  But the USB part that unplugs for charging easily falls off the clip.  It's hard to get in the right position in a charger for charging.  I also have a hard time getting it to the positions I would want it to be.,1.0
Did not work to charge and never had a light. Would not recommend.,1.0
The usb piece to plug into the computer to charge - it didn't work at all and it barely fit in the usb port of my laptop so I returned it.,1.0
"Very cute book light, but it comes apart very easily where the flexible neck connects to the clip and won't stay together.",1.0
"Light started acting up after only a couple weeks. It would refuse to turn off or on, seemingly at random. After another week it stopped working altogether. To charge the thing, you must insert the base of the light into a USB port. However, USB connection at the base is rather cheap and doesn't make good contact for charging, especially if the USB port is not angled just right. I had to balance the light on the port just right to get it to charge and many of my USB charging options were not conducive to this balancing act. Finally, just ordered my daughter a ""grown-up"" reading light.",1.0
"I bought this product in May and am trying to recharge it for the first time. I cannot get it to charge at all. I've tried using the USB port on the laptop, as well as a USB compatible charger straight into the wall plug, but nothing is working. No indicator lights even come on to show that it is charging. I don't know if I am doing something wrong? It seems so simple.",1.0
The item that was delivered is much smaller than what appears in the sale picture.  I really thought the decal would atleast be large enough to use 4x6 or 3x5 pics on the tree. Not at all what the picture shows! Very disappointed!,1.0
"Warm white, no.  Vegas white, yes.
Sure, it's all subjective, but I'd hate to see cool white.

advertized size was not actual. these were 2mm too long for my fixtures. sent them back for others. hope they're better.,1.0
Awful bulbs. Pins push in too easily rendering the bulb trash and constantly flickers which I assumed would happen while dimming but even when switch is full on it still flickers. Also color temperature of day light is way too stark. I had more hope with so many positive reviews.,1.0
"Terrible flicker and buzz. These say they are dimmable. I strongly disagree. They had a very intense flicker at most brightness levels. Even when it wasn't flicking with seisure inducing intensity, there was an audible buzz emitted. These bulbs are unusable for me.",1.0
"The under shelving light uses this number bulb.  However, this bulb is too thick for the light.  I can not put the cover back on.  It is a lot cheaper then the one in the store but not the right one.",1.0
"I ordered these using the data printed on the light cover. The pins are a bit too wide for the fixture. I can get them into the holes, but the bulbs don't light. Filament appears intact. Just checked the continuity through the bulb and it checks out. Checked the bulbs in a second fixture, and they also don't light in that fixture.

Note that bulbs are about twice as large as the one they were intended to replace.

Note also that the bulb glass is not frosted-- not that it matters if they don't light. $10 wasted.",1.0
"Updated 6Mar2015: these bulbs are actually not a great match for the fixture. The terminals are too long and too thin. Had to trim them, but can't really solve the thickness part :-(
Great product little skeptical of product since it was <$.80/bulb and its $3/bulb at your big box store. And those big box store bulbs were blowing every few months.",1.0
"I previously purchased a name-brand bulb for considerably more money. I just went thru the entire lot of 12 of these bulbs and every single one blew out the instant I turned on the light. Needless to say, I will go back to purchashing the more expensive name-brand bulbs.",1.0
"Yes this has a G8 Base but don't bother if your fixture does not have unlimited room for this to stick out.
The bulb itself is correct but the glass neck is twice as long compared to standard bulbs. No Idea on longevity since I only have 1 fixture this long bulb fits and I just put it in.",1.0
"Well, yes, these Bulbs are cheap. Therefore, they do work for 50 - 100 hours only, so they are not really priceworthy. I can not recommend buying them, unless you love the process of changing these bulbs at difficult places ...",1.0
At $1 a piece I thought I would try this product.  One of the 10 burned out immediately when I turned on the switch.  I have already had 2 more bulbs burn out after less than 10 days (running about 8 hours per day).  I think I would rather go for a more reliable product.,1.0
"I'm sure many folks, like me, purchased these for puck lights.  And they discovered, like me, that the bulb is too large to fit in the fixture with the protective glass lens in place.",1.0

I've purchased from CB off of ebay in the past too so they're not a new company to me.  It's been months now since this purchase was made and thought to comment on the white lights  since that is what needed to be taken down from our physical store today.

Read between the lines because I have to get back to work:

Lights are bright in one direction but one would have to twist the rope to find the direction that will focus the light application.  Maybe more lights would make it brighter or better led's I don't know.

I'm going through our 110v lights now and will hopefully be getting more of the 12v ones to put in their place.  If I recall correctly CB sells these also but the same day I ordered and noticed the error requesting that the order be changed to 12v lights (over 300dollars worth) but they said that it could not be done even thought they hadn't shipped yet.  no bigee really.

Now of the rest of the lights purchased from CB?  I'll comment on them as I get to them.  Our store will be selling all these 110v lights so I'll have rightful comments in due time.  I don't think any of CB's stuff is cheap or broken so that's a plus for the seller.",1.0
I ordered these bulbs and within 2 months I've had to change them out three times. I purchased this same brand in Jan 2016 and they lasted me all year. This set of 12 didn't even last 3 weeks before going out. I'm not sure if it was a bad batch but if you notice them going out reply right away unlike me because the return window is past due and I'm stuck having to order more bulbs....,1.0
"product break apart installing them, contents have paper inside them. do not buy, unsafe.",1.0
"Bulbs did not last long at all.  Of the 8 bulbs replaced, all went out within a days!  Never buying again.",1.0
Cam in a 12 pack and your going to need 12 of them they burn out very quickly.  One of them did instantly. It will cost you a little more but buy the name brand bulb it will save you in the long run.,1.0
"terrible quality, half are dead already.  not recommended.",1.0
"I have been using these in the bathroom for 5 months. Everything was working fine, then I went to turn it on and there was a bright flash followed by an explosion and a shower of glass across the entire bathroom. It is going to be a huge pain to clean up all those little splinters. It also destroyed part of the light fixture the bulb was in which was also made of glass. I will be throwing the rest of these away.

Also I am glad it was me and not my kid in there when it went boom.",1.0
Just got these bulbs and 2 of them konked right after installing. Horrible. I hope the seller gets me a refund.,1.0
"AVOID!  I bought these to replace bulbs that had lasted for over 1.5 years (since we moved into the house) in a kitchen where they were used for plenty of hours every day.  These bulbs last about 3 weeks before blowing out.  Yes, they are cheap and you can only expect so much, but three weeks is not acceptable.",1.0
Do not buy these light bulbs. We got a package of 12 and some of the bulbs have something wrong with their connections - they either do not work or blinking on and off.,1.0
One didn't work out of the package. And I have used about 7 when I first bought them and three of them are already burnt out and it's been a month. These are crap!,1.0

I have no way to measure the output light (or lumens as they call it) and in my fixture these are more like 35W not 50W and seem to be yellower than Feit, GE or Phillips bulbs.
Maybe these got mislabeled.
If you don't mind the lower light output and a yellower light these fit the bill.",1.0
"The first bulb lasted exactly one month (I wrote down the date installed on the box). I hoped it was a just a bad one, but the second bulb lasted 28 days. Too late for me to return them so be warned! For comparison, the much maligned Feit brand that was installed before these lasted more than a year.",1.0
Dont buy these. They keep blowing off in less than a month. Dont know if they have a replacement warranty. No life information on the box.,1.0
Totally unsatisfactory.  The wire connector pins are slightly larger than the fixture would accommodate comfortably and had to be forced in.  the bulbs did not last more than a few months in my outside fixtures.,1.0

You can look directly at the bulb and see the LEDs which are lit, but not bright.

I was looking to find LED versions of G4 bulbs to replace by 20W halogen bulbs. I was not able to find anyone who sold dimmable LED versions, except for this vendor. Turns out that these are not dimmable either.",1.0

Awful. One of the cords stopped working after 2 days.,1.0

These were super cheap and I understand why. I'm using the 3rd one in just over 2 months. My old one was bought locally and cost nearly $30 so I understand why these were so cheap. They are just that....cheap and do not last. I would NOT buy this product again. I bought it online for convenience. I will go to an electrical supply store after I use the remaining 4.,1.0
"I have purchased items for many years from Amazon, and for the most part, I've had fairly good results with my purchases.  I do have to admit, that I am not one who posts reviews on products which perform as advertised, so consider this an exception to that philosophy. That is to say until this purchase.

First of all, I originally ordered 10 watt bulbs to replace existing 20 watt bulbs which come with the original outdoor lighting I'd purchased elsewhere.  Needless to say, when you have 16, 20 watt landscape lights in your yard, it easily can be mistaken for an airport run way, hence the desire for 10 watt bulbs.  I ordered the 20 pack 10 watt bulbs from this company, and 2 days later, I received a 20 pack 20 watt bulbs.  Fair enough, everyone makes mistakes. Amazon promptly corrected this issue.  Once I did receive the correct bulbs, I proceeded to replace all the original 20 watt bulbs with the 10 watt bulbs I ordered through this company and Amazon.

According to their product description https://www.amazon.com/dp/7502175741/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 "" Product description MR11 12V 10W Precision Halogen Light Bulbs 3000 hrs useful hours 3000 k"", which I thought should be more than long enough to last through the year. I was surprised that within 2 weeks of installing these bulbs, and running less than 8 hours a night, I had 4 failures... seems a lot less than the 3000 hrs listed.  Long story short, after less than 3 months, every bulb as failed, so for a total of 20 bulbs, I received a combined use life of less than 900 hours of life for 20 bulbs... seems to me a lot shorter than the advertised 300 hours of life/bulb.

At this point, I can't say more than, you might want to really reconsider this product, though, I guess you get what you pay for, which in this case I paid for a lot more than I got.",1.0

"I purchased a 10 pack of these bulbs in 2014.  I have now used two of the 10 in my kitchen chandelier (now December 2015) and they have worked fine until they reach the end of their life span and EXPLODE sending shards of glass all over the kitchen table with great force.  I fear that these bulbs are a safety hazard and should not be allowed to be sold in the USA.  I plan to contact the Consumer Product Safety Commission and report CBConcept Brads and Amazon for selling these.  I just made an attempt to return my remaining 8 bulbs for a refund on Amazon.com, but I am now too far past the date that Amazon will accept returns.  I am thankful that my family was not harmed by this dangerous product.",1.0

"I ordered several LED ropes from CBconcept through Amazon and even directly. There are two main problems with the product and the company. First, while I ordered all the ropes as ""warm white"", I received only two warm white ropes,  I received three bright white ropes and I even received a blue rope. If you think you can order multiple ropes and have the colors matched, think again. Secondly, I had counted on connecting the ropes together, as their literature says you can do. However, the 50 foot ropes I ordered have a totally different connector than the 18 foot ropes so they don't interconnect. The source of the problem is that CBconcept doesn't manufacture their products, they purchase them probably from China and they source them from different manufacturers. This is why different lengths don't interconnect, and colors don't match (see picture). I strongly recommend staying with recognized brands that have a consistent source for their product and avoid these. If you ever count on needing to interconnect them or want the same colors to match in different ropes, forget it. Their customer service is not helpful either as they can't solve the problem.",1.0
"This product looks more yellow than green and it lights up fine if it's rolled up. Once it's unrolled, there is a section that turns off but will flicker on and off if the rope is jiggled.....not too please with this!",1.0

there is discoloration in the plastic mold on the connectors that is likely part of the reason that this never flickered any light.",1.0
"I bought 12 of these bulbs in December 2010, 6 of them have burned out so far (in about 5 months). In fact, another fixture still has the same (older) bulb working while I have replaced its neighbor six times. Be aware that the life of these bulbs is short!",1.0
"Service was okay, but the bulbs don't work.  They'll light if you hold them in the socket, but the pins are of too small a gauge to make good contact or stay securely in the sockets of my low voltage lighting.  My first clue was that the pins have sharp pointed ends like they're made of wire brads instead of electrical components of the correct gauge.  I would never order again.",1.0
"I've been looking for inexpensive alternatives to the $7 each malibu bulbs for my yard, and I was very excited when I came across these. They look very similar to the malibu and FEIT bulbs, but have a lens over the top that the others do not have. I thought this might be good, as maybe improved protection from the elements would extend their life. Upon installation they fit the fixtures fine and lit up brightly, as expected. That was the good news. The bad news is that they all failed within a month of installation, some within a few days. They simply burned out, as evidenced by the clear glass going to a frosted look. By contrast, the Malibu and FEIT bulbs would last for months and months before needing replacement (normally due to one of the posts corroding away). I will continue my hunt for a cost effective replacement bulb, but I won't be buying this one again, regardless of the price. Don't be lured in by the low cost. They're just horrible bulbs.",1.0
"These bulbs fail at an alarming rate! I've been using them in the vent hood over my stove, and the average bulb life appears to be about 3 months, so I've gone through 12 in 18 months (two bulbs at a time in the vent hood). I'm totally puzzled. I will try another brand. I would buy an LED alternative, but I don't think the LED bulbs are yet small enough to fit in this narrow orifice.",1.0
Did not work out,1.0
"I just tried putting these light bulbs in for my under cabinet lights, and they did not work. All they did was dim and kind of go on and off... Does anyone have the same problem?",1.0
"Burn out in a couple months. Same product 20 W version lasting over a year. However, they paid for themselves in energy saved, so if you do not mind frequent bulb replacement, not a bad deal. I do, hence the low score.",1.0
These bulbs were not very good at all. Lasted about 20 hours then had to replace each one. Not impressed. Better buy a new lamp instead of these replacement bulbs,1.0
"Upon receiving this order, I put one in my under cabinet light fixture and it has been working fine.  However, last week another bulb went out in a different fixture and I replaced it with an CBconceot bulb.  Almost immediately, it began to smoke so I took it out and replaced it with another CBconcept bulb and it too began to smoke.  At this point I thought the fixture itself had a problem ,but to make sure I went to Home Depot and bought a halogen bulb.  I got home and put it in the fixture and it worked fine.  I immediately threw the remaining CBconcept bulbs away and won't purchase any more of them.",1.0
"Lasted about 4 months in outside lights that run 6 hrs a day.  Will go back to a different brand.  Yes the price is great, but if you can spend 2x as much and get over a year its worth it.",1.0

"You know that this item is cheap, and you correlate that with quality. You may try to justify this purchase by thinking, even if it doesn't work as well as those you get from Home Depot, you might still come ahead with 10 of these cheap bulbs - WRONG!

"I ordered these bulbs and then they shipped from China. Two weeks later I got parts for weed eaters. I emailed the company and two more weeks I got bulbs. The box the bulbs came in said they were LED bulbs, which they weren't. The bulbs are not marked in any way. The only thing I can say is they have the correct base. Who know what watts, volts, etc. I will never order through this company again.",1.0
"They worked for a few days then burnt out. Went through 5 or 6, all the same. Not worth the bother.",1.0
"I cheaped out to buy these instead of the ones I usually buy (http://amzn.to/1YVoHLp). BIG MISTAKE. They performed well initially, but then one of them melted, damaged my light fixture and caused a fire hazard. I remove all the installed bulbs and found that many had chipped bases and blackened areas suspicious for excess heat.

Upon reporting this to the company, they seemed helpful at first: advised me to throw them all away and promised to pay for replacements. However later they refused to pay.",1.0
Light bulbs looked great.  I put them into my light bar and they were blowing out in a day or two.  Bulbs from IKEA were lasting months.  Not such a great deal.,1.0
"Issue 1: Bulb life - After blowing through half the bulbs purchased (10) I can report the average bulb life is about 100 hours (3 weeks of average use). Box says each bulb lasts 2000 hours (not even close).
Issue 2: Brightness - ""20 Watt"" - no way. Noticeably dimmer than the more expensive halogen 20 Watt bulb in the lamps surrounding this one.

Switched bulbs to make sure it wasn't a socket issue. Same result. Buyer beware....",1.0
"I ordered the CBConcept Brand Halogen Light Bulb JC G4 12volt 20 watt bulbs. They put out a small fraction of the light put out by the 12 volt 20 watt bulbs I was previously using.

When I returned to the room later that night, half the stickers were sitting on the floor and the other half were hanging off the wall.  I went WalMart and purchased a spray adhesive that is used for wall paper. The next day, I had to separate the stickers that had fallen to the ground and curled themselves together. I then spent another hour spraying and placing the stickers again.  Within two days they began peeling off the wall again. They are absolutely worthless.",1.0

"I bought this product along with other wall stickers. While the others were the usual stickers easy to remove from the paper and easy to reposition if needed, this particular one was VERY different.

"I bought these based on wattage given.  But it turns out that they do not give anywhere near as much light as the other bulbs I had purchased that were also labeled the equivalent of 25 watts.  The difference is dramatic.  So although they were so much cheaper, they do not give anywhere near as much light.  The bulbs I had purchased at our local hardware store at $7.99 each were labeled 255 lumens.  The CBConcept package does not list the lumens.  Moral of the story is to buy based on lumens, not wattage.  As for me, I am no longer purchasing any bulb that does not list the lumens.  So if CBConcept does not list lumens, I am not buying them.",1.0

But my room is light green so if I put these up with my other sticker decors I purchased hey will look cheap and the white trim will stand out.

"They looked cute online, but then when we tried to peel them off the sheet - they all split. They are really tiny and look nothing like the size in the description's photo. The tree you see in the photo is not included. It's just the cat, puppy, some leaves, flowers and clouds. When I say tiny, I mean the puppy is less than 3 inches tall. The whole thing was so fragile that it fell apart. And they don't stick well - the next morning when we went into our daughter's room, the puppy was half curled up on the wall. A waste of money for a few tiny pieces that won't stick, can't be moved and break apart easily :(",1.0

"I purchased this prop three years ago at a Halloween store in Michigan, after seeing STOCK images of it online at various shops. Being a huge fan of ""Psycho,"" I thought it was absolutely ingenious; and it is, until you plug it in and see that the manufacturing design of the prop leaves it almost *impossible* to read through a window in the dark. It literally looked like blue bulbs and a red blur in a sea of black plastic.

 Now, hanging inside on a wall, the prop is slightly more legible and somewhat usable--but who wants it inside instead of in a window, like a REAL vacancy sign? I opened mine up and tried to adjust the bulbs, even placing foil behind them to help with the reflection; it made it barely legible in a window at night.

 Ultimately, this could have been one of the BEST Halloween props I've ever seen, but the shoddy design makes it worth about $5 instead of the $25+ you usually see it priced at. A shame, really.",1.0

"Originally, I rated this as four stars, now reduced to one star.

My original review follows; revised comments appear in a separate posting below it.

""Excellent upgrade for my 20+ year old PC 690.  Fit and finish are first-rate.  Method to secure the body of the router motor is a little hokey (essentially uses a screw-tightened barrel nut that leverages a steel piece that bites into the aluminum body slightly) and not elegant at all, but it works.

The most difficult aspect for some may be in orienting this piece to bite into the motor body.  Second to that is determining how high the motor sits in the base.  You don't have to be an engineer to do it, just use logic.  Instructions are left wanting in that regard.  Once set up, it works fine.

Wipe off the excess oil from the guide posts a couple of times after cycling the router up and down to keep the oil off of your work.  My base was aligned well and did not need adjustment. The baseplate is black with large holes in it; clear plastic would have been much better.  The baseplate hole for use of collets was properly sized. Handles are round which work fine. They were tight and solid.  Control access is good and fairly natural.  Dust collection would be a nice addition.

This certainly increased the versatility of the router over when it had a standard base and gave me a package that is more handy to use in many applications than my large handheld router, especially for more delicate work like dovetails.""",1.0
"The base plate was mounted a full 1/16"" off center, causing interference with template guides.  There is no practical way to contact Porter Cable to complain, what else is new?  I could not wait around dickering for a replacement that may be no better, so I have fixed it myself, doing what the manufacturer should have done and did not.  This is not a correction that could be made accurately without machining equipment, so beware.  I am sure Amazon would have made it right; Porter Cable and their foreign manufacturing with no accountability is the problem.",1.0

"I love Amazon and my Porter Cable 314 trim saw. Got a good deal on it from Amazon and purchased several plywood blades for cutting panels for furniture.
Worked beautifully. Until I had to get several new blade replacements. Holding them side by side to compare with the original, you can see they are very different.
Same model number, but Porter Cable has changed them.
They seem like trashy ""toy"" blades. They immediately start burning the wood in the first foot of a cut. And leaving curls of ply in it's wake. The heck with it. Put the old dull blade back on to finish one cut.
I will return all the blades for a refund.

"I gave this one star only because I couldn't write a review without one. First time using it, the sander burned up!!!",1.0
"Let me preface this with saying that I'm a huge fan of Porter-Cable.

Pluses:
This product does a great job at sanding, it's not very noisy, and the vibration is pretty well isolated from the user, so one can use it for a while without the numbing effects on your hand.

Minuses:
OMG, Ouch, hot hot!  Seriously, after less than 10 minutes of continual use, this thing gets so hot, you can't touch it without causing pain.  Also, you cannot efficiently change the paper without the supplied tool.  This is only a minor inconvenience, but I imagine losing the tool would cause it to be a huge inconvenience.  Normally, when tools are critical to the function of a product, it comes with a way to attach it to the product, like in the ""good old days"" of drills with chuck keys.

DO NOT BUY unless you have insulated flame retardant hands.",1.0
It was unusable.  The screws in back that you needed to take out (J) when using as a circle guide were impossible to remove.  The screws are now stripped and still have not moved.  Make sure you look at this prior to the 30-day return policy.,1.0
"I ordered this sander in September.  In March, it fell apart while using it.  It only has a 30-day return policy, so I'm out of luck.  I have never, in my 21 years of business, had such a short-lived sander.",1.0
I bought this item because of all the good reviews that it recieved. It does not work. The grinding disc almost immediatly loads up. Then the grinder wants to bounce. This destroys whatever you are trying to strip. I  tried many different speeds and adjustments and I could not get this paint  stripper to work for more than a minute without the disc loading up. In  short- avoid this product.,1.0
"This tool does not perform as described. The discs clog instantly! I would not recomend this to anyone. I have been a professional painter for over 10 years, and was looking for an alternative to heat stripping. The power  paint remover is not it! Don't waste your money.",1.0

This way the pads last for hours.",1.0
"After 2 hours total use it started making noise and then shattered with pieces flying everywhere. One of the spring's tips were broken off, and the other spring broke in half. Poor quality, expected longer life. Going back to Amazon.",1.0
I have owned 2 others of the Speed Bloc and did not hesitate to order a replacement when the one at the cottage stopped working. Big mistake. Apparently Porter Cable has changed the insides of this sander. On first and each subsequent use it gets so hot it is difficult to continue to hold. Never had that problem with the old ones. Another fine tool lost. Won't be seeking out Porter Cable tools again.,1.0
"This is the worst shop tool I have ever ordered, I tried to set it up to do a cut but the screws are factory sealed with loctite I think, they would not break loose.  All the screw heads striped out, and yes I used the correct bit (new), do yourself a favor and do not buy this tool and I would not recommend this router guide  to any one.",1.0
"Worst shop purchase ever! I was looking for an attachment primarily to cut circles in my projects. In order to do this, you must remove 3 screws from the sliding plate and remove the edge runner. The screws were impossible to remove, and even with an ""easy-out"" they would not come out. So Now I have a tool with 3 stripped screws. Just for information, I also tried the front face screws, which also would no budge. I'm guessing that even though the instructions require their removal to add the swing pin, these screws have been chemically locked in.

And thats not all. The slide to adjust the edge position sticks badly and does not move smoothly. The minute adjustment is a joke since the overall slide binds so badly.

Overall, I'd not wish this product on my worst enemy. It is poorly made, poorly designed, and I'm sorry I wasted the money on it.",1.0
"I purchased this to go with a circular saw I purchased on the same Order.

"I have other Porter Cable products that work well. The quality & design of this edge guide shocked me. It could have easily had more than an additional 2"" of travel with a simple design change. Or you could shorten the beam by 2"" and have the same usable travel with a design change. The pins that adapt it to the router are .014"" under size and the spread between the mounting holes on the router are .025"" more on the base than on the pin location on the edge guide. Now when you tighten the screws to fasten the router to the edge guide, they will cant the pins so they are not clamped parallel to the holes. This is shoddy quality control. Even the screws are an obsolete size which hasn't been used much for more than 25 years. The screw size by the way is #12-24. Most think it is a 5mm, but it is not. I make the assumption they got an extremely good price on these obsolete screws. These damned screws if you can find them are over $2 per screw at a place that sells parts for this edge guide online. That doesn't even consider the cost of shipping and handling. My qualifications are: I have worked in the tool and die trade for 46 years. I have been a supervisor for more than 25 of those years. I have been involved with the design and fabrication of many things that have complexity far beyond this simple edge guide.
I wouldn't be so irritated if the company had the courtesy to respond to my Email, but I have waited since 1/7/2008 and seen nothing except a automatic reply on 1/7/2008 telling me I would get an answer within a few days. This has never arrived. I rate it as a 1-star only because I have the skills to make it more usable.
I have but one way to deal with complacent companies such as this who seem to have a screw you attitude with customers. I will simply never purchase another of their products.

The following is the Email I sent to them:

Where do I contact someone to talk about problems with quality control and design flaws concerning my Porter Cable Router, Bases and Edge Guide?

I was a practicing machinist, toolmaker, shop supervisor and was involved with design engineering in a research facility for over 46 years until I retired a year ago.

I would like to talk to someone who is willing to listen seriously with an open mind and correct some problems. I also have a few questions I'd like to ask from someone involved with design.

I just spent the last hour making precision measurements and find it hard to believe what I discovered.

Since I wrote this review, I have never received a response from this company. I've concluded I have no use for a company that doesn't respond to a customer's legitimate request. I won't be purchasing any of their products in the future.
