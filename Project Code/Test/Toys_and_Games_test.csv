Can't wait to use it!,5.0
This is a campaign specific DM screen meant to work with The Storm Kings Thunder adventure.  It is not a general use screen.  The reason I'm  giving it 5 stars is that every named place on the map also has the page number of locations entry in TSKT. That feature has saved me time in Adventures League play. Other AL DMs will tell you how precious every minute is in the standard 2 hour format.,5.0
Very fun game for my family,5.0
"When I unexpectedly came across a picture of Buckley on the first page of the book, and after hearing the other reviews of how difficult and advanced the techniques in the book were, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was surprised to see the face of a handsome teenager, of which my previous impression was COMPLETELY the opposite to the one I held in my hands. And this guy was a professional card magician at the age of 18, and able to do tricks infront of hundreds of people on-stage in 1908!
I have a feeling that this guy's mystery and skill probably gained him significant success with girls his age. The mysterious effects of these difficult to execute sleights are priceless and dazzling beyond belief. If a 3 columns card trick can make girls believe in magic.. then Buckley's stuff probably knocked their socks off... literally! Believe me, this guy would be able to blow David Blaine out of the water and make him look like Bob Longe.
That being said and out of the way, the book itself is amazing. There are very clearcut photos of Buckley's hands and very impressive card tricks, or as he calls them in the fourth section, ""Card Experiments"". Best of all, this book isn't like most others where the authors seem to purposely be vague (S.W. Erdnase) and not give the best descriptions. Mr. Buckley gives you every detail and is your friend throughout the book, showing you exactly how everything is done without any confusion.
And there is SO much different good stuff in here, that you'll probably never need another book for advanced materials.
It is a great book and a great reference to help you on your way to card excellence and showmanship. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",5.0
"If you've mastered Hugard and Braue's stuff, if you can do 60 classic passes per minute, if you have all the time in the world to devote to card sleight of hand, then this is the book for you!  Seriously, this is a truly excellent book.  Buckley's sleights, though not for the faint of heart, are superb.  (He must've been one heckuva cardician!) This is a serious, serious card magic book.  But if you are serious yourself, you'll get it.  Of course, you'll overlook the antiquated prose and Buckley's tremendous ego throughout.  (When you read this material you'll forgive Buckley's self-congratulatory tone.) This is a splendid work for those who want to be the best...",5.0
"I've yet to see a bad review for this book, and there's a reason. This book is terrific. There is however one issue to be addressed. This book is hard!!! Definitely not for beginners, it has some of what I believe are the greatest but hardest card manipulations out there. I definitely recommend it however to the serious card magic enthusiast. There are enough valuable ideas in here to last you a lifetime.",5.0
"I'd buy again as a gift for a young kid obsessed with pirates.  However, I never actually had any hands-on time with the tattoos.  The tattoos reminded me of my favorite Cracker Jack prize.",5.0
My young son was thrilled to have tattoos just like a real pirate.  These are easy to use and remove.  I great find!,5.0
"Gorgeous, I love the book and the pictures are beautiful!",5.0
Beautiful art work,5.0
These are intricate designs for older children and adults. This book is full of beautiful designs just waiting to be awakened by your choice of colors. Great for creativity.,5.0
"This coloring book was so much fun to color.  I love the fact that you can color both sides & blend the colors!!!!  I would recommend this book for anyone that loves Wizards & Dragons & loves to color with fantastic results!!!!!!!!!!
Sharon",5.0
The stained glass pages are pretty cool. And it is nice how the black outlines are super dark and thick. And that the dragons aren't all fighting with the wizards.,5.0
"My 11 y.o. loved this...and so do I (you know I really bought this because I wanted to see the pictures myself...I'm just lucky enough to have someone I could justify buying it as a present for.)
Dragons and Wizards...says it all!  With the wonderful see-through vellum like pages, that make it ""stained glass.""  Color it with marker, or anything else really (colored pencil, watercolors maybe), and the light shining through the page makes it look luminous and gorgeous!

Even the perfectionist that gets intimidated with art and drawing tends to find these stained glass books easy to get results they are happy with, so it tends to be an enjoyable and confidence building experience. :)",5.0
Awesome! My 8 year old's favorite Xmas gift! It's 9:15 am xmas morning and he's already colored three of these!!,5.0
"This book has wonderful pictures in it, from dragons to wizards. It is much more than just a coloring book. Very pleased and do recommend it for all ages.",5.0
I loved this book. the pictures are suitable to hang in windows or glass doors and the pictures really reflect the light. I recomend this for all ages who love art.,5.0
I bought this for my son who loves to draw.  The pictures are simply beautiful and it is a unique way to produce a coloring book.,5.0
"The pictures are great , I've done one and gave it to a friend of mine who likes dragons.",5.0
"Great buy! Can't wait to work on this book. The dragon images are lovely.  Once I'm done coloring, I will frame and hang in a window to let the sun shines through.",5.0
"Holy cow! Ok, so we use Sharpies to color, and this book is AMAZING! We color one side, and the colors transform on the other side. It's so cool, even my husband colors! The designs are great (and I'm a snob) and the price is VERY good for such a cool product.",5.0
I absolutely love this book! Its translucent paper make it super fun to use. I have been using Paint Brush Markers and Sakura Gel Pens on it with excellent quality. The only thing that I would recommend is a blank white sheet of paper to make the lines easier to see.,5.0
"Wow, great images on vellum, got this for my husband. He used a combination of colored pencil and marker for pictures, they are beautiful.",5.0
Very nice book. Just wished there was more pages. Can't wait too start using it.,5.0

I hesitated to buy this coloring book for fear I wouldn't like the majority of the images, but to my pleasant surprise, every page contains an image I like.  So, I'm posted this quick video review for anyone else like myself, who might be considering this item, but is hesitating due to not knowing what all the images are.  Hope this helps someone.",5.0
Great!,5.0
"Sometimes you need something new and special that gives you 30 minutes of piece. I used these waiting at the dentist or a graduation or something. They are small so they slip into a bag and cheap enough, especially with the 3 for 4 price on amazon.com . The robots and funny faces are a lot of fun. Probably best at 3-4-5 rather than 2 because the stickers are small.

I love all of the great not-licensed-character stuff by Dover.",5.0
"These little books are great! They are small, but perfect for birthday party favors, which is what we used them for! There is a blank page after each page of stickers, so that's where my kids made their robots. They were a huge hit!",5.0
"I was happy to find this little sticker book.  Inside were facial features & other stickers. The size was just right to use with a robot kit we had found .The grandson was very happy with the whole gift.
 I'd read another review how these little sticker books were given out as birthday party favors. For the price it's a good deal & good product.",5.0
"Nephew, age 5 loved the booker.",5.0
Very Cute!,5.0
"This is a great book to throw in your bag to have while waiting in line or at a restaurant with a small, alternately bored and energetic,person. My 3-year-old loves that she can put together robots using different parts and create her own or match the pieces to the picture on the back cover. This is a very small book -really a pamphlet almost - which is the best part actually.",5.0

Grandson loved it,5.0
This little book is so cute! My kids love it. The cover of the book is a slick surface so you can peel the stickers off and start over again. The inside of the back cover has a robot base you can use to build off of if you so choose.,5.0
This is a small book,5.0

a wonderful little sticker book that i put with the robot two sided puzzle in a busy bag for a 3 year old.,5.0

Inspiring creativity!!,5.0
Very nice product.,5.0
This create your own robot sticker book is exactly what I was hoping it would be!  I would definitely recommend this to any sticker collector (such as myself) or to any parent/grandparent/aunt/uncle buying this is a gift for a kid! Seven thumbs up!,5.0
"My four year old robot lover had fun with this.  His five year old brother loved it, too.  It didn't provide hours of entertainment, more like minutes, but it was a fun stocking stuffer and they really appreciated it.",5.0
"My 3 year old niece loves robots. She loved playing with this sticker book. It's a small pocket type book - they are inexpensive, I would advise buying more than one. Great for entertaining them on trips, outings etc.",5.0
If you have a child interested in robots this is a fun activity for them.  It allows the child to build a robot with colorful stickers.,5.0
"This is a VERY small book, but for $2, it was a fun 10 minute activity for my robot loving 3 year old.",5.0
"Very interesting. Is creative, increase knowledge and hours of entertainment. Bought for my grandson for Christmas. I know that he will enjoy it very much.",5.0
"This was a great little book for my Robot ""Boy's Night"" Party. Loved the robot craft in the back of the book:) Great price!",5.0
"Lots of ""parts"" stickers to customize your robot.  There is a sticky page that you can use to build the robot or you can just put them on paper.",5.0
"I am using these little sticker books as party favors for my son's birthday partyl. He will have a robot party. These books complement the theme quite nicely.

Why buy cheap plastic toys as party favors? They will just end up broken and in the trash a couple of days later.

I enjoy these mini-Dover books. When the kids need a quiet activity, I pull them out. I carry couple of them with me in my purse/diaper bag. The kids will use them in restaurants or at church.",5.0
"My 5 year old son loves robots, and he really loved creating his own robots with this little Dover book. As always, these are high quality for the price. The Little Activity Books are small, and will get you through a waiting room visit, or a restaurant sitting, but not longer than that. They are worth their small cost though! Love it!",5.0
"... In a little package. My 6 year old loved making little robots with the stickers. I had originally got it to bump my order up to $25 to get free shipping, but I'm glad I got it. Now I want to get the other little sticker books from Dover for my son.",5.0
love this little book for an extra little fun stocking stuffer or reward item. Bots are a big thing with little boys!,5.0
"My grandbaby is enjoying creativity with her activity book, according to her Momma. We will crank-up her working robot when I get to see her in January, but for a small package representative of robots for her latest enthusiasm, the sticker activity book is working.",5.0
It is a fun little book for those of you that have someone that loves robots in your life. Fun for all ages.,5.0
"This occupied my almost-3 year old for nearly an hour.  Stickers were durable and easy to peel.  Afterwards, he kept going back to the box to see if there were more robot stickers to assemble in there.

I'll probably drop another dollar and buy it again for his Christmas stocking.  Three cheers for the short memory of a preschooler!",5.0
This kept my 3 year old son quite entertained whilst on a lengthy flight.  Recommend it for parents whose children are into robots,5.0
"This little Dover book is like the others of the series - fun and entertaining.  I was not happy to see that the price on the back was $1.50 and I paid $2.51 with Amazon.  I am used to getting a better deal than the stores, but this certainly was not!",5.0
"My 4 year old loves this robot sticker book! Yes, it is small, but its priced right for the size.  This provided lots of entertainment for my son, as he got to create his own robots.  He loves to intermix the parts and mis-matched robots. Definatly worth 1.50.",5.0
"I bought 8 of these for my 3 year old daughter's robot themed birthday party as favors for the little ones and it was a great hit! I didn't realize that the stickers were robot parts that the kids assemble themselves to create their own robots! That was a lot of fun and for the price, it was well worth it!",5.0
Perfect for that long airplane ride for my almost 6 year old son. Small enough to fit into my handbag. The stickers can be re-used over and over again to make new robots. A must for any busy mom!,5.0
The book gives a nice feel and step by step directions. I bought thins for my son with high functioning Autism. He has been using it often.,5.0
"My son loves this.  He has drawn the most MIND BLOWING art in this book.  So good.  He is learning so much.  It is really well put together with tracing pages and all sorts of tips.  I highly recommend this, even for adults.",5.0
"Klutz X D. C. = highly engaging for pre-teen boys. We had one of our own, and a friend loved it so much we had to get him one.",5.0
This makes a great gift for anyone who loves Super Heroes and also loves to draw. Top quality pencils too. And the best part....totally affordable.,5.0

"Awesome. Starts of by showing basic stick figures and then adding more details first. Outstanding book and I would
highly recommend to anyone looking to learn the DC way to draw heroes!!!",5.0
fun stuff for the kid.. kind of messy but.. still lots of fun for them.. my kid is good at crafts so she made three dogs right away..,5.0
"My daughter is a huge fan of Klutz books and couldn't wait to get her hands on Pom-Pom Puppies. She made a Chihuahua, a Dalmation and a few mutts and they're getting cuter and cuter. The directions are really good (it can be challenging for an 8 year old to cut the yarn). I highly recommend this as a present to any kid who loves dogs, the results are really cute.",5.0
"My daughter just turned 6 and spotted this at a Scholastic book fair. I bought it for a birthday present, and so far we've made one puppy. It is definitely a collaborative effort at this age, though she can do a lot of the work -- trimming the pom poms, gluing, etc. The directions are clear, the photos are adorable and the materials are of good quality. We will definitely have to get more glue -- I think we've used half a tube on one project -- but I think it's just basic white school glue. So far, it's a big hit -- and fun for grown-ups, too!",5.0
This kit is so cute.  I have given it as gifts to two of my nieces!,5.0
Great product and clear instructions.,5.0
Kit and instructions make easy to learn the process. A basic video would be a nice resource as well.,5.0
"Great product. Took a little practice and time, but after you get the hang of it. It turns into a cute cuddly little friend. Mine didn't turn out exactly like the picture, but it adds a taste of your own sense of style. They are super cute and comes with everything it says it will.",5.0
This is a fun craft project! I just wish I could buy refills of the collars and other add ons!,5.0

Great craft day fun!,5.0
"Really cute!!! My 9yr old and I have made lots of pom poms. Best of all, theres no mess to clean up and it could be done in the car, etc too.  Love it!",5.0
"I was skeptical, but my 9 year old has had so much fun with this kit and it was her favorite Christmas present.  She pretty much made the puppies herself with minimal help from me, though I did hot glue some ears rather than use the included glue.  Only downside is the cuttings can be messy, but really wonderful instructions, well-made supplies, and can be used for many years---and maybe even making different animals if you are creative.  Highly recommend for artsy, determined 9 year olds!  I actually want to try to make one myself they are so darn cute.",5.0
Very cute and very well designed. Makes adorable puppies.,5.0
Good stocking stuffer.,5.0
My 10 year old niece loved this!,5.0
"I purchased this for my niece's 6th birthday, after her mom told me she'd seen it in a store and been interested. This is definitely a craft that needs adult assistance. Even for a bit older kids (9-10) who might be able to handle all the instructions on their own, there are parts where it's just easier to have a second person to help interpret the directions as the other person does the steps. I helped make the first puppy-- we figured out the directions for making the pom-poms without too much difficulty. Getting it the right shape can take a bit of trial-and-error, but it ends up looking fine even if the ""legs"" aren't as distinct, etc. The puppies are not a super sturdy toy, since they are glued together, but are cute for gently play or as decorations. I'd probably give 4.5 stars if that was an option, just due to that and the directions being a little tricky at first.",5.0
Kids totally enjoyed making this. This is perfect for a rainy day stuck in the house.,5.0
kids had fun with it,5.0
"I purchased this so my kids could make gifts for others - and it turned out awesome.  So adorable, the brown puppy turned out the best for us.  It took a bit to get the hang of it, but went fast after they knew what they were doing.",5.0
"Easy enough to make, very adorable, but fragile, not good for little kids. I had to hot glue the head and body together, because they kept coming apart with the glue they give you. You can mix & match colors to make a dog however you'd like. My border collie is tri color so instead of black & white, I used all the colors they sent.",5.0
Kids from 4-11 used these on a family vacation. Had them occupied for a couple hours. Adults were chomping at the bit to leave to do vacation activities.,5.0
"AWWWW, so cute",5.0
"My daughter loves this kit, definitely worth every penny as she has quit an assortment of puppies to play with. Also make cute gifts.",5.0
Super cute and fun craft- but it takes a loooooong time to make the pom poms,5.0
My daughter thought it was really easy to put these together!  She had fun!,5.0
"Girls love this kit, would buy this again",5.0
Recipient loved this and it looked like fun!,5.0
Cool craft but is a lot of work and quite messy. The puppies are cute but there is a lot to clean up when you're done!,5.0
"wonderful product , keeps my kids busy . My daughter made a YODA for her dad :)",5.0
"A Christmas gift for my 8 y/o niece & totally by surprise her 11 y/o sister got the same exact one & she told me she had picked it out for herself.  On Christmas day she sat on the couch & began making a white fluffy poodle  I could tell she was really into it & enjoyed showing us what she did before we sat down for dinner. It was purely a coincidence that both of my grandnieces now have them.  They make really cute & cuddly dogs, they are soft & not difficult to construct. I would purchase it again & highly recommend it to anyone who has a young girl who enjoys doing crafts.",5.0
"My daughter got this for Christmas and it was the first thing she wanted to play with. She's nine and fairly adept at crafts, but she did need my help to work her way through the first puppy.  She was amazed when she compared the starting materials (a big shank of yarn), with her end result (a reasonably cute, puffy, chihuahua.) The quality of the yarn is better than I expected, and there is enough to make 4 good size puppies, plus tips on making others if you go buy supplies at the store on your own. It was a good purchase, it kept her attention for a long time and the parts were better quality than I thought we'd get.",5.0
"A really fun and creative craft!  This book is full of so many ideas - I especially like the different breeds and suggestions on how to use scrap yarn for spots, etc.  I wouldn't count on this being a craft that your child could do solo, unless they're a tween or older.  My six year-old and I just finished our first pup and it is now adorned in all of the included accessories - tiara, ribbons, and collar.",5.0
Fast shipment and great product.  So cute!,5.0
"If you're patient, they come out really cute!!! Not something a young child can do, so you definitely have to help if your child is under 8 or so.",5.0
"My 5 and 7 year old daughters received the Pom Pom Puppies book as a Christmas gift.  They were both able to wrap the yarn themselves and add their own touches to the puppies.  They are adorable.  The book is a big hit for my crafty, puppy-loving girls!",5.0
"Very cute,  fun project.  Wish there was more yarn and dog accessories",5.0
Something to put a smile on the face of my niece.,5.0
"My daughter is 8 and she loves this kit. We have made 3 puppies so far and they are pretty adorable. We made the Pomeranian, the Pug, and The Scottie. We had some trouble with the heads falling off - saw in another comment they used a hot glue gun, we'll try that next. It is surprising how distinctive each breed looks! She says, ""They're awesome! And they're adorable! And they take a long time to make!""",5.0

great service...fun book to create with my ten year old granddaughter.  Thanks!,5.0
"Just as described,",5.0
"Agree with most of the reviewers.  Lovely craft for adults or for children with the help of the adults:) Most children will not be able to make the puppies without the help.  Love Klutz crafts.  Always a lot of fun! the Yorkie was made by me and the white dog was made by my DD with my help.  The head of both can turn :) Very Cute!  (Sew the head and the eyes!)
Update: Made another puppy- poodle.  Used all of my own materials except the eyes.  The thread was much thinner-resulting in a smaller puppy.  Verdict-you can use thinner thread but I believe the results are not as nice-will try to find thicker thread next time. Used hot glue-easy and strong.",5.0

"As an adult crafter who likes simple projects to relieve stress, I enjoyed this product very much, even though there are a few minor flaws. I'll list some pros, cons, and suggestions below.

Pros:
The book provides detailed directions for seven different dog breeds in addition to abbreviated suggestions for how to create an unlimited number of breeds on your own.
Book directions are clear and detailed with large, accurate pictures.
The pompom maker is sturdy and easy to use. I had no problem creating pompoms easily my first try.
The kit comes with enough basic supplies to make four adorable puppies, provided you take yarn measurements into account
I was very satisfied with how cute my puppies turned out!

Cons:
The basic school glue provided was not strong enough to hold the heads to the bodies or the felt ears to the heads.
The punch-out dog carriers were too small for all of my pups.
The kit is probably a bit too challenging for most eight-year-olds. I'd recommend it for ages ten and up.
While there is enough yarn provided to make four dogs, there is not enough to make any four you want. Some dogs require too much yarn if you want to create four dogs total.
The measuring tape on the back of the book measures in inches and centimeters, while the book directions are in yards.

Suggestions:
Use a hot glue gun to hold the dog together. I used superglue, but my puppies are a little fragile.
Take yarn measurements into account when choosing pups or just buy more yarn at a craft store.
If you wrap the yarn around the height of the book, you'll have half a yard of yarn. Use this cheat mentioned in the book instead of the confusing ruler.
When the book says to cut the yarn short, be sure to cut it quite short or your pup might look a little messy and shaggy.

Overall I really liked this kit and would definitely recommend it.",5.0
My kid LOVES this! Kept her busy for days as she loves anything she can craft.,5.0
Huge hit with my crafty 8 year old for Christmas!,5.0
My 8 year old daughter received this for Christmas.  She made four beautiful puppies from the kit and and continue to make more by just buying more yarn.  Instructions are easy to follow and with a little help she was able to make them herself.,5.0
Challenging but fun for my 12 year old daughter.,5.0
It's a hit!  Love Klutz products.  Great company.,5.0
"My 10 year old daughter loves it!  In an age of mindless technology for kids, it's hard to find gifts for them that actually engages them in a way that is creative and doesn't require them to stare at a screen.  This was a gem!",5.0
Great buy!!  My granddaughter loves it!!,5.0
"These are actually very cute!  I have to do them with my 8 year old because they are a little hard for little hands, but it is a fun family craft.  Only takes about 30 min to make one.",5.0
This is really a fun craft and fairly easy to do.  The kit includes everything you need to make cute puppies!,5.0

Cute. Great craft for my little girl,5.0
My daughter put this in the closet and forgot about it for a year.  After finally convincing her that she would like this we pulled it out and she loved it.  At 9.5 she did not feel comfortable making on her own so I was very involved.  You need very sharp scissors- ours were not and it makes is much more difficult.  The dogs we made came out really adorable and it took a good long time to make them.  She was very excited about them and wants to buy more yarn.  I think this would be perfect for a 10 or 11 year old because of the time and skill involved.,5.0
cant wait to get time to make some,5.0

I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and we BOTH had so much fun doing it. There's so much more you can make beyond the book!,5.0
"Got this for my five-year-old who was looking for a craft book and chose it because she thinks the puppies are cute. It is maybe a touch old for her: she needed someone to model it for her the first couple of times and still requires a little help here and there, but she caught on pretty quickly, and if her own pom-poms aren't as tight and neatly trimmed as the pictures (or Mom's), so what? She is having a great time with it, and so are Mom and big sister.

The instructions and photos are pretty easy to follow and the kit comes with enough yarn to make 3 or 4 pups. After that, you need to go get some more, but I didn't expect it to come with its own Michaels attached.

Adult crafters will likely find this unchallenging, and younger kids, like my 5 year-old will, likely need some help, at least initially, but for anybody in between - if this looks like fun for you, it very probably will be.",5.0
My almost 9 Year Old loves this pom-pom puppy kit!  She can do it independently and create adorable puppies.  We did have to use hot glue to get the body pieces to stay together.,5.0
"A friend of my daughters was making these pups and selling at a kids craft fair. My daughter was intrigued and wanted it for Christmas. We have already made three dogs. The instructions are clear, the photos are great.  I did think ahead and by more yarn which was a good thing because it does only come with a small starter collection of yarn. ( which I expect  with this type of book...I figure I am paying for the guide and any materials it comes with is a bonus!)
My daughter is 10 years old and very crafty. I would suspect a younger child may need assistance. Oh and it does provide fun math practice when measuring the yarn!!! Enjoy!",5.0
"This kit is AWESOME! My 5-year old daughter and I made the chihuahua dog first, and it came out looking exactly like the picture. Although I love crafts I'm not that great at them, so I was delighted with this result. This is the first project I have ever done where the finished product looked as good as the picture - and on the first try!

The book gives really straight-forward, easy-to-follow instructions. They show you how to make dogs that look like the real breed! We have made 6 dogs now, from the easiest to the most complicated in the book, and they're all great.

My daughter wraps the pom pom and cuts the pom pom. I do the tying. She cuts out the ear shapes, and decides which decorations to use. For a 5-year old, she can be quite involved, but she definitely needs my help. It's a really fun project to do together.

One thing: the glue in the kit is actually pretty good, but you'll still have to hold pieces on and wait for things to dry. We have a little hot glue gun, and this has made the process easier and probably helps keep the dogs holding together better. My daughter is playing with the ones we made and sleeping with them and they hold up like regular stuffed animals!

We made 4 dogs with the kit supplies, then promptly went to the craft store to buy more supplies to make more pups! We bought a bunch of different thick yarn types and they all worked well and gave different effects! Once you get the hang of it you can get creative too. You could easily make cats, rabbits, a turkey - whatever you want that you can imagine doing with pom pom shapes.

Pros:
Great, easy directions
Nice supplies in the kit
Variety - you can make so many types of dogs!
Fun project to do with your kids
The finished product is super cute and kids will love them like real stuffed animals
Kids could make these as gifts for their friends, or even ornaments for relatives
Lots of room for creativity
You can keep making dogs forever by buying supplies at the craft store
Price - you get to make 4 dogs, which equals out to less than what you'd pay if you bought a similar pre-made dog at the store
Amazon price- I bought this in a store and paid 20 bucks so the price here is great
This kit would make an awesome present for any young girl!

Cons:
The glue: this kit is a lot more fun if you invest in a hot glue gun
More money :) if you love this kit as much as we do, you'll end up spending a lot more in the craft store to keep going with it!

I hope you have as much fun with this project as we have!",5.0
"I'm a mental health therapist that works with kids, many of whom have anger control issues. All kids love playing Uno and this is essentially Uno with anger control tips to learn along the way. Although I felt that 20.00 was a little expensive for a card game, it's gotten more than its fair share of use. It's great to start conversation with kids who just want to play a game and aren't super interested in talking. I even had one of my clients ask his mom to buy the game so they could play at home. My one complaint is that the cards are very big! It's hard for a lot of my kids to actually hold the cards since they're like supersized playing cards.",5.0
"These are great for clients who struggle with how to control their anger.  It is actually very similar to another card game, UNO.  However, it has definite therapeutic value, as half of the cards have questions, suggestions, and activities to cope with anger.",5.0
"In the mental health field,.this is a great item to use to teach anger management and kids of all ages loves it",5.0
Really good for working with children with anger issues and a fun game that children will enjoy playing with an adult.,5.0
"This is a great game for talking about anger and having fun at the same time. My son, who is 5, gets angry very easily and usually does not want to talk about it. When playing this game, he was more than willing to talk about his anger and ways to help control it. He loves playing this game! There was actually improvement in his self control after the first day that we played it. I was pleasantly surprised. Much recommended!",5.0
"This game is really simple yet surprisingly effective in helping kids learn basic anger control strategies. I use it with 8- and 9-year-olds, and they do seem to retain and use the anger control techniques it teaches. It's an inexpensive way to help kids manage their impulses and get at least some control over their emotions.",5.0
"This game is basically UNO, but with fun ""how to control emotions"" suggestions on about half of the cards. It's a great way to have fun and relax with your kiddo and occasionally bring up anger-management ideas in a non-stressful way.",5.0
Im a behavioral health counselor at an intermediate school and play this game with my students. The kids love this game because it is played like Uno. There are plenty of opportunities to answer simple yet meaningful questions that help kids with anger.,5.0
The kids love this game. They already know how to play and enjoy answering the questions.,5.0
As a therapist who plays a lot of UNO with children who have anger impulses this is a good way to teach new coping skills that children like.,5.0
"I'm a therapist that works with children.  I play this game with my 6 - 15 year olds.  It plays like Uno, so the kids are familiar with the concept.  It has enough stops in it to discuss anger issues without slowing down the game or frustrating the kids.  I recommend this game to those in my profession.",5.0
Great game in therapy when working with children.,5.0
"This is a great resource for kids to help with their anger.  I'm a therapist and use it with my adolescent clients.  The kids love that it's a game, similar to Uno, and I love it because it's teaching them skills.",5.0
"different, kids had red faces, not sure they like",5.0
Clients enjoy it!  The card questions have brought up good discussions and insight.,5.0
Wonderful tool for use when working with children with anger management symptoms/diagnoses.,5.0
"Used in sessions. Just like playing UNO (which most children know how to play already), so the child jumps right into the game. The fact that not every card has a prompt on it makes it feel like a card game with questions; as oppose to a psychoeducation lesson with cards. I use about 3/4 of the deck (there are a lot of cards) which means that you will not go through all the prompts in one session. Highly recommended.",5.0
"So I work as a mental health clinician in a locked facility with adolescents who have some anger issues due to experiencing ALOT of trauma. They also have to deal with really really stupid rules, which triggers both them and myself. I'd say they are at ages 6-12, when it comes to controlling anger. With that said, this game was a lot of fun during session and in anger reduction group. It's just like UNO with some anger control techniques and talking points thrown in! I love it and am extremely happy I bought this. It is so much fun and helps my adolescents talk about their anger and reframe that anger in a positive way!",5.0
Great game to play for children and any other people that has anger issues.,5.0
The game was received really well by my kids. The adult facilitation helped a lot.,5.0
I have played this game with quite a few clients already and so far it is going well. The cards are made well too which is important for someone who will need to get a lot of use out of them.,5.0
"I use this game with children and families. It is very helpful for helping people to open up about feelings, especially anger. So far have used this with ages 5 and up, with great results.",5.0
I used this game a lot when I was doing in home therapy w/ kids. It's a great nonthreatening way to introduce topics and touch on some skills.,5.0
"I'm a child therapist, and I love this game. Engaging, fun, and simple to play.",5.0
"I work as a school psychologist, and my kids in counseling love this game! Such a great tool that combines social-emotional learning and fun.",5.0
Great tool #SchoolPsychologist,5.0
I love this game for my therapy sessions. Clients love it too. It's a great way to teach anger management skills in a fun way.,5.0
This is one of my top go to games during my social work sessions with kids.,5.0
It's really helping my ADD'R learn to discuss his anger constructively,5.0
"I am a social worker on an inpatient psychiatric unit for children and adolescents. This game is easy for all ages to play, and while some of the scenarios/questions are a little simplistic, it gives the kiddos a safe way to express different ways to handle anger. When playing with mixed ages or ability levels, I have found that the younger kids often push the older kids to think harder about their answers and give options to them for responses. I love using it in my groups, and almost everyone can use a little help with anger management!",5.0
this is a fantastic game great questions. Kids do need to be able to read to make it go smoother,5.0
great,5.0
"I use this with my elementary students in counseling.  It is enough like Uno that the kids catch on quickly, but also get the benefit of therapeutic interventions.",5.0
"I really like this game, it helps kids recognize anger and talk about difficult emotions.",5.0
"The game is basically Uno with discussion cues on some of the cards. It can take a long time for someone to win the game too...

Our daughter has been having anxiety and getting angry easily lately. We noticed she's been going to the red zone of anger so quickly that there isn't time to calm down and talk through what's been upsetting her. Even after she calmed down she didn't want to talk about it. The day Mad Dragon arrived, we all sat down and played it before bed. She started opening up about all the things that have been bothering her and we get to tell her about similar instances when we were growing up. We love that it also reminds her about ways to keep calm and why it's better than getting angry. Once in a while she'll tell us how she didn't get mad at school like the Mad Dragon! She asks to play it every night- so she clearly enjoys the game.",5.0
Good game--like Uno but with meaningful (therapy) content.,5.0
I like how this game helps build emotional management/conflict resolution skills while adding a play aspect. My students seem to enjoy it.,5.0
love it,5.0
Great resource for BHIS care coordinators!! Works well with kids and teens on what it says it does!!,5.0
kids LOVE this !,5.0
"If you know how to play Uno, then you basically know how to play this game. On some of the cards, there are questions that help children recognize body sensations when they are angry, problem solve what they can do if something starts to upset them and gives them tools to use. 100 cards in the deck. My six year old wants to play this every single night and this game is helping him with emotional regulation. My 8 year old likes the game too, but doesn't always want to answer the questions (depending on how his day has gone). If you are looking for a fun way to help teach the children in your life tools for emotional regulation, I highly recommend this game!",5.0
Using in one-on-one or family therapy sessions. The kids love it. Just like Uno.,5.0
"Great, fun game as an ice-breaker or group activity!

Great family game addition for child that struggles with self-control/anger.,5.0
"Satisfied, thanks",5.0
Love it,5.0
I'm a mental health clinician who works in schools. This game is played just like uno and my children love the game. I usually have then read the question and we both answer the questions. I usually go first to give the kids an idea of how to answer just in case they are stumped. This game prepares the child to know how to defeat anger and to lets them know that they are essentially in control of their anger.,5.0
"This game is great- the students ask to play it over and over.  It gets them talking much more than if I would just ask them the questions and if they are hesitant, I will answer the question honestly and model that it is ok to be honest.",5.0
good therapy tool,5.0
Easy-to-use great for anger management groups,5.0
"I love this game!! I bought this for my seven year old son who has anger issues and trouble identifying/explaining  other emotions in others or himself.  He started out being really excited to play a new game, but then it kept on talking about anger (the point of the game) he became frustrated -imagine that!  After a couple games and seeing that it is like Uno and sharing feelings isn't so bad he started to warm up.
I would highly recommend this game!!",5.0
"This game plays like UNO, but is more interactive and opens the way for players to share their thoughts and feelings about experiences.  I work with children and families in a variety of therapy settings and this game has helped open up dialogue in a way that is fun.  I have seen shy children that had a difficult time talking about their inner selves begin to open up and talk freely.  Great game and one of my favorites!",5.0
Excellent for children/adolescents with anger issues.  The game assists with developing problem-solving techniques and rationalizing.  I found that client's of all ages really enjoy playing it!,5.0
"My clients love it, arrived quickly",5.0
"This game is more fun and easier to understand than I had anticipated. (Rules are basically the same as Uno) I thought I would have to 'sell it to my students in 1st/2nd grade Resource, but they really enjoyed it and everyone had an answer for the questions posed along the way. It also encouraged my better readers to help others and share examples when they needed help 'getting it'.

I would recommend to any resource/ SpEd teacher working with social skills or behavior modifications.",5.0
Used this with several families already. The families have said they found it helpful and the questions to be easy to understand and answer.,5.0
I play these all the time with my young teenage clients.  They love it!,5.0
"This is a must have resource for any children's therapist. The game plays like UNO, so the children pick it up easily, and the questions prompt discussions regarding effective anger management skills. I use this game with kids of all ages- even the teenagers don't shy away because they enjoy the competitive nature of the game itself.",5.0
Very good game! My kids love it! The game is very similar to uno except with questions corresponding to anger and coping skills for anger. Much more pricey than some games but well worth the money.,5.0
Excellent product to use with my clients with anger issues.,5.0
My clients love this game !,5.0
Really better than expected!  Thank you so much for your speedy professional service,5.0
Great game for therapy sessions,5.0
"This is a fun game for kids. It's basically the game of Uno, but each card has thoughtful, age-appropriate questions about what happens when we get angey, managing anger in ourselves, what happens when others get angry, and the experience of anger in our bodies!  It's especially good for the younger kids that haven't ever thought about these things and don't necessarily understand their own feelings of anger!",5.0
Great game!!! Wonderful for talking about emotions and attitudes. Using experiences was very helpful. My 9 year old loved it,5.0
"I am a licensed clinical social worker and use this game a lot in therapy with kids who have difficulty managing their anger. The game is straightforward and assists in starting the conversation of how to handle anger, or to strengthen skills. I recommend this game for any child struggling to manage emotions appropriately. It uses language so that therapists, teachers or parents can all utilize it with children. Love this game!",5.0
"Very fun game to use with kids working on handling anger.  You play like Uno, but have to answer questions about anger.",5.0
I like this game for reinforcing previously learned anger management techniques. It will not stand only as the only thing that will teach children anger management skills but kids seem to have fun with it. And since it's played like Uno most are familiar with the rules already. I have used this for lower functioning adults as well.,5.0
"Game is fun, but can be very long",5.0
This is working great and it arrived on time.,5.0
"Great to use with kids who need support with self-regulation and social skills. It can be adapted and played in many different ways, depending on the age group.",5.0
"This is a good game to use even up into middle school.  The kids hardly know they are even doing more than playing the game.  The game can be slow or fast depending on how often you read the cards and do what they say.  It offers the opportunity to do a lot of processing about anger and think about potential situations where you may be dealing with anger and what you should do.  In a group, it leads to a lot of discussions.",5.0
I am a school social worker and use this game with 4th-8th graders.,5.0
Great Seller!!! Happy with my purchase!!! 5 starrrr,5.0
This is a great anger management game for kiddos and adults alike!,5.0
"My husband is a therapist and I came across these cards and suggested he give them a try in some of his sessions. I can't answer first hand since I'm not actually the one that uses them, but he said they really grasp the kids attention and makes his therapy sessions easier. He has group sessions with high school kids, and he said the kids that normally won't talk during his sessions really opened up with these cards. He is amazed at how well they work.",5.0
"I work with a broad range of kids K-6, many of whom have autism or learning disabilities in addition to emotional challenges and mental health problems. They LOVE Mad Dragon and will ask for it by name when I offer a non-therapeutic game like Uno. This is FANTASTIC for my kids with learning disabilities because they help each other read and process the cards and feel empowered and successful when they play. One started playing this with his younger brother and was so excited to work through the questions with him WITHOUT MY HELP. I don't know how I've survived at work for this long without Mad Dragon. I'll never go without it again!",5.0
My kids love love love this game. Wonderful anger tools & self awareness of their anger as well. It's played like bingo with questions in the cards. I find it's great for my clients ages 6-12.,5.0
"Helpful in my practice.  The questions are a little long for some of the younger, or less focused ones.",5.0

"This is a fun card game for helping youth talk about anger and coping... played similar to UNO, some of the cards have questions which the players answer when they play the card.",5.0
"I purchased this game to use with children in a mental health setting.  Many have been abused and most have had some exposure with foster care or child protective services.  I LOVE this game.  Previous reviewers commented on the size being a bit large and I agree. I even have trouble holding them.  The cards are repetitive and when the client comments about this, we have a discussion about how we sometimes get angry about the same thing so the cards are giving us the chance to come up with many ways to handle the same situation. I also use the cards with the parents and children.  This has been very valuable when the children see their parents admit their behavior is not always appropriate and they are working on their own anger.  I have combined this game with deep breathing.  They are getting rid of the ""Dragon's Breath"" as they exhale.  The kids love it and the parents can prompt them to practice the skill by j saying Dragon's Breath.",5.0
"I use this game on a daily basis with kids of all ages. The game plays just like UNO and the skills are easy for kids and teens to learn and use at home, in school, or out in public. I would recommend this game for anyone working with kids or teens with anger management issues.",5.0
I like that is plays out like uno which my eight year old son loves the only thing is when we are playing I have to have him put down his cards when we have a reading card cause he eager to keep playing and won't pay attention or rush the discussion card,5.0
I have used this in my groups (with 1st through 5th graders) and they love it. It is especially useful in one of my 3rd grades groups because they learn the anger strategies AND they have to practice playing cooperatively with others. It is also simple enough for the students to learn.,5.0
It is like UNO but focused on anger and coping skills. It has been a wonderful tool that i have used with the k-5 kids I work with. You can always play a simple UNO game and not use the questions. It is great to have!,5.0
"I do in-home therapy with children with serious emotional disturbances. This quickly became a favorite of most of my clients and families, even over standard Uno. I've also learned a lot about various clients and siblings by looking at which cards they refuse to play. I would love to see more of these, dealing with different emotions and behaviors.",5.0
"Great game that kids love to play, it's like Uno so most kids know how to play it already. Recommend.",5.0

This game is great!  It has lots of ideas to help kids control their anger and understand the potential consequences of their anger.  It plays like Uno but requires the kids to answer questions.

THIS IS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY WITH KIDS OF DIFFERENT AGES. IT REALLY HELPS THEM TO OPEN UP WHILE THEY ARE HAVING FUN,5.0
My 5yr old twin boys are having difficulty controlling their emotions.  This game has really helped open up the discussion in a fun way.

"This card game is easy to play, fun, and an engaging way to teach children about anger. The durable and vibrant cards and box will last a long time. Definitely recommended!",5.0
My son is 8 and he loves this game - it plays just like Uno! It is a great way to teach appropriate ways to handle his anger and empower him.  I would definitely recommend it!,5.0
"As a therapist-in-training I was looking for games to use with clients that were reasonably priced. I really like this game because it plays just like Uno and I can teach anger management skills to kids and teens while we're having fun. Even though it's geared towards kids I find that if I'm honest about the cards being a little silly for their age the teens will play the game because most people don't mind playing Uno no matter what their age. Its also a good way to help the parents talk to their kids about their expectations around appropriate ways to express anger, and the parents can learn new skills as well.",5.0
I am a therapist for children and this game is so valuable to bring out insight and solutions to deal with and identify feelings of anger. I use it frequently.,5.0

"What a fabulous idea!  I tripped across this product just the other day and had to have it for our family!!!  I'm always trying to incorporate God and His message into our daily lives, and with Easter coming up, what a great way to learn the Easter story and share the Easter story.  Our daughter is almost 7 years old, and I know she'll love these nesting eggs.  It's a perfect visual to go along with the story.

As mentioned by the creator, the nesting eggs are hard to get apart at first, but when instructions are followed, getting them apart is easy.  No twisting, but gentle rocking back and forth helped me get them apart.  Then I practiced a few times.  The more you use them (take apart, put back together), the easier it becomes.

I cannot wait to start this new tradition in a few weeks!  Pretty sure we'll be getting the nativity scene and Christmas story from this creator, too!",5.0
Precious and perfect way to read through the story of Jesus' death and resurrection with the kiddos. Hands on which they loved!,5.0
"Quality of the eggs excellent.  Did have to let them release some of the moisture before I could open, however, they all opened without damage.  Book is well illustrated.",5.0
"We purchased the Star From Afar few years ago, and were excited to see the Easter Story Egg come out this year.  The hardcover book is beautifully written in rhyme and verse with seven short stories of Holy Week from Palm Sunday through Easter.  The seven wooden nesting eggs correspond to each story with beautiful illustrations.  As the Star From Afar is a great family tradition to ""follow the Star"" for the Advent Season, the Easter Story Egg is a great addition for your family to remind us of the true meaning of Easter.",5.0
"I am so excited to have found the Easter Story Egg! I was looking for a Christ centered tradition to help my boys understand the true meaning of the Easter holiday when I came across the Easter Story Egg. We are all looking forward to reading each of the seven stories, opening the corresponding eggs and explaining the significance this Easter. The hardbound book and wooden eggs are high quality, and I look forward to many years of this meaningful tradition with my boys.",5.0
"We were SOOO excited to see the EASTER Story Egg come out this year!  We were given the Star from Afar a few years ago from my in-laws and have LOVED adding that tradition to our family Christmas celebration! We have bought it as gifts for others, as it has really helped us teach our kids the true meaning of Christmas and focus on Jesus during the busy holiday season.
The Easter Story Egg does not disappoint!  There is no doubt it will be a fun way to help us keep Jesus at the heart of our Easter celebrations, as well.  We just got our nesting eggs and book a few days ago and our kids (ages 5, 3, and even the 1 year old) couldn't have been more excited!  It was so fun for them to pull apart the eggs (a little difficult for them to open and close at first, but as promised, much easier to for them to do after a few days of playing with them!) They seem to be holding up well to their semi-rough handling, as they are solid wood, though I have tried to the limit the play so they're still new and exciting to use at Easter!
As with the Star from Afar, the art is simple, but beautiful, and clearly illustrates the message for my pre-readers.  The 7 mini-stories, matching each of the nesting eggs and intended to be read one a day from Palm Sunday through Easter, are told through original poetry in a quality hard cover book.  I appreciate that there is a Bible verse with each days story, as I can use that verse as a place to start in our daily Bible reading or choose one as a memory verse for my kids during the Easter week.  Needless to say, were super excited to start our new tradition this Easter with our Easter Story Egg! I would recommend this product to anyone with kids of any age!",5.0
"We love The Easter Story Egg! The hardcover book has beautiful, colorful illustrations and seven short stories. The wooden nesting eggs also have lovely illustrations that correspond with each story. We sat down right away and read through each of the stories and my kids took turns opening each egg. Initially some the eggs were hard to open but now they open and close easily. My kids continue to ask me to read the book to them and to play with the eggs. I purchased The Star From Afar a few years ago and it has become a Christmas tradition in our house to follow the star. I know The Easter Story Egg is going to be another great tradition!

There are not many products like this. It is such a fun and meaningful activity. I love that it helps my children understand the true meaning of Easter.",5.0
"My children have enjoyed The Star From Afar so much at Christmas, that we were wildly anticipating the arrival of our Easter Story Egg.  And of course, it did not disappoint!  The moment it arrived, my kids were thrilled to open the box and look at each egg's beautiful artwork.  As my children were admiring and playing with the eggs, I began reading the book to them.  They loved each story....and loved that each egg matched up to a story in the book.  The Easter Story Egg is beautifully written.  It is a series of 7 short short stories in one hardbound book.  The stories are written in beautiful rhyme and verse, and do a great job explaining the events leading up to Easter.  My kids really enjoyed the visual of the last egg, which is the stone, that is rolled away....and when its opened it is empty!!! What a great visual for my young children to understand the meaning of Easter.  I am very much looking forward to using this product as Easter approaches....and I know that it will be a new tradition in our home.  We have given so many new families The Star From Afar for baptisms, birthdays and Christmas and I will be adding this my favorite gifts to give to young ones too.  Another amazing product by Natalie Ard, hoping there is more to come!!!!",5.0
"We have now used this product for two consecutive Easters and it is one of our favorite new traditions!  This activity keeps the attention of both of my children, who are 7 years apart in age.  The first year, we had a problem with a couple of the eggs (one wouldn't open and one wouldn't close) but the company was fabulous and immediately sent us a replacement set.  Some of the points made in the poem don't align perfectly with our family's theological beliefs, so I did change a few of the words to more closely reflect what we want to teach our children.  The eggs are beautiful and we look forward to enjoying this tradition for years to come!",5.0
A beautiful and sentimental gift. I plan to order 2 more sets for gifts.,5.0
Wonderful product,5.0
"A beautiful story, wonderfully written.  A classic tradition for Easter.",5.0
"LOVE this! It is so hard to find Easter items that aren't just bunnies and candy and actually pertain to the real reason for Easter. This explains Easter really well for kids. It rhymes plus has a quote from scripture for each day from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday. It's like an advent calendar for Holy Week. I know this will be a GREAT tradition at our house each year. The eggs are a little hard to open, but the website from the company that makes it and the box it's packaged in both say it's normal and gets easier over time. The box is also very nice for storing it the rest of the year. And it's the best children's Easter book I've found that actually explains Easter really well for kids. My twin 4 year olds get really excited to open each egg every day but it's great for my 8 year old too! And I like that it sits out as a reminder for what Easter is really about.",5.0
"A very unique way to share the Easter Story - the nesting eggs are a really nice addition that makes the story more ""tangible"".",5.0
"This is such a nice Easter gift. Although they are a little pricey, I sent one to all 4 of my Godchildren, since I loved how it told the Easter Story, which can be a little tricky.

Unfortunately, my 3 year old lost the top of one of the eggs, but besides that, it's perfect!",5.0
"Wow! This product is incredible! I was hesitant to purchase due to the price, but the teachable moments with my little boy are PRICELESS! The eggs are perfect quality and the story is illustrated simply and beautifully to teach the TRUE meaning of Easter! This easily held the attention of my 3 year old and made his mommy emotional. This beautiful memorial to the Easter holiday will certainly be treasured as a new tradition in our home. Thank you to the artist and author!",5.0
I love this!!! My kids truly enjoy the experience and has really brought Easter back to what is was meant to be. Highly recommend. And I have 2 boys - 13 & 9. Both love it.,5.0
I really like the wood nesting egg to tell the resurrection story to children. It doesnt give too much information making it perfect. The book that goes with it is hard cover and is written in simple language. The pictures on the eggs are simple and nice. Im very happy with my purchase. It is so much nicer than the plastic resurrection eggs that I also purchased.,5.0

Great resource for sharing the Easter Story with children. We opened it yesterday and my 3 year old really enjoyed the anticipation of what was next after opening each part of the egg.,5.0
We are giving a set to each of  our families including our grandchildren. We will be able to tell better after Easter week when we hope theyll be used.,5.0
"I love this so much! It is such a fun and special way to celebrate Easter.
The first Easter story egg I received was damaged a little bit, but I sent it back and received a perfect one!
I am so excited to use this so soon!",5.0
"The 7-year-old loved the nesting eggs. I liked the story. However, the length of the ""story"" for the individual eggs was too much for her attention span. That the last egg (the stone blocking the tomb) opened up to be empty was shocking and exhilarating at the same time. Ha. One of our eggs developed a hairline crack after the first reading, and the eggs was graciously and willingly replaced by seller. I loved the careful attention to wordsmithing on the author's part; word choice was excellent. However, the book needed a good editing. All in all, this product is wonderful for the Easter season.",5.0
Such a great way to share the Easter story!  Very well made!,5.0

Wonderful for my grandson to learn the resurrection story.,5.0
"I just used the Easter Story Egg with my Sunday school grade 1-3 class and it went very well. It kept the attention of the children including 2 special needs students. I didn't use the book that comes with it. The book is illustrated and has a well written rhyming story line. I felt each section was too long to read. Also sometimes with rhyming stories the sentence construction is awkward for kids to understand since it is worded to allow for phrases to rhyme.  I could see that in a family setting one could read it and stop to talk about it. I'm very experienced as a story teller so I used each part of the egg to tell the story myself with children supplying facts from their own knowledge. I also made a strip of paper for each child with 8 eggs each smaller than the first and labeled with the days of the week and one word for each day. Sunday- Praise God and children put a palm leaf sticker on the egg, Monday- Respect God, children used a glue stick to add a small picture of the temple I had printed form clip art, Tuesday Love like Jesus did, a heart sticker, Wednesday- offer your best, rubbed a spice scent lip balm on it, Thursday- Remember Jesus added a small clip art picture of the last supper, Friday- Forgiven a cross sticker and for Saturday and Sunday the phrase Jesus rose from the dead. The Saturday egg children colored gray and Sunday left blank. At first the eggs were very hard to take apart. I left them apart for a few days , put them together and apart two more times and they were easy to use after that. Be sure to pull not twist.",5.0
This is a great way to show your kids what Easter is really about! My kids loved seeing what was inside each day after we read the story. The hand carved wood smells so good inside.,5.0
We used this for the week proceeding Easter and our kids looked forward to seeing what was in the next egg every night. It is a lovely tradition that instills the true meaning of Easter.,5.0
"Beautiful set!  I originally ordered this with my almost 4-yr-old granddaughter in mind, however, I will tuck it away and save for a couple of years.  Although the eggs could be played with now and I could explain each one at her level, the story is beyond her comprehension.

Also, as described on the box and in an email from the company, the wooden eggs were new, and needed a few days to dry out and become accustomed to the lower humidity level in our home. I carefully opened each egg, per instructions, and set them out.  At the time, I wondered if I should put the eggs back together to dry, or leave them apart.  When I tried to put the eggs back together a few days later, one egg just wouldn't fit together.  I emailed the company right away, and two days later, received a replacement.  I notice the updated instructions now say to ""Please take the eggs out of the nesting position and re-close them separately to dry.""",5.0
Love this book and the beautiful eggs.  This book will definitely be a tradition in our house every year.,5.0
"Have never seen anything like this story-the eggs are absolutely gorgeous--detailed paintings on each are well done. I am a Christian preschool teacher and I have read it to 3's, 4's and 5's--all have loved the eggs! Also a mom of two elementary aged children and they love it, too! Thank you--highly recommend this book to add to your Easter collection!",5.0
So gorgeous and love the rhyming in the book.  Perfect way to teach my kids why Easter is so special!,5.0
"Very nice set of nesting eggs and the story that goes with them, or the story that has the eggs to go with it.  Either way, this is a great item.  I wish I had ordered more, as they are now out of stock, and others are requesting them.  If they become available again, I will be purchasing more!",5.0
"Larger than I expected and absolutely beautiful!  I will be using it this week with my students at school.  I know they will love it, and then I plan to enjoy it at home.  Thank you!  Beautifully made, and I appreciate the instructions about how to gently open it the first time.",5.0
"We had received the Star from Afar set a few years ago and love being able to share the true meaning of important holidays with our girls, on a level they can relate to.

When we saw The Easter Story Egg come out we knew we wanted to purchase, so we could explain the true meaning of Easter as well.

The eggs are well made, the wood is smooth, and good quality without splinters. The painted images on each one were nice and vibrant. The eggs themselves are a good size as well, easy for an adult to hold, and my 4yr old had no issues.  The book we received is good quality as well, no binding issues like another reviewer mentioned.

The packaging for this product is great as well, it all stores nicely in the box when not in use throughout the year.

Our girls were very excited to receive it in the mail recently and we can't wait to use it.

Very pleased with this product!",5.0
"The eggs and the book are lovely, and the eggs appear to be very durable. Am looking forward to using them with our little ones!",5.0

Beautiful! We look forward to The Easter Story Egg being a regular Easter tradition! Great quality that will last through the years.,5.0
"LOVE the Easter Story Egg! Such a great way to celebrate and remember Easter and what Jesus did for us! The book and eggs are beautiful and are a great way to teach children about the days leading up to Jesus' death and resurrection. Also, the customer service fro Star From Afar Kids is EXCELLENT! We had an issue and contacted them by email. They were quick to respond and wonderful in helping us! Will recommend The Easter Story Egg to everyone I know!",5.0
"I bought this for my 3 year old (and some of the pieces would be too small for any child under that age), and she loves it...but entertainingly, so did I and quite a few people at work (all of us 30+), as we had no self control and had to open it up and play with it for a little bit before I gave it to her (uh, to ""test"" it out).  It is a lot of fun to play with either on your own or with someone else - trying to architect the house together.  This one and the cupcake/bakery set are really both adorable - and my daughter has sustained an interest in both for a long time.  We've had the bakery one for over a year, and although we've lost many of the magnets, she returns to it all the time.  (I just bought this house one recently, but I assume it will be a similar fascination).  One thing I will say - having had the cupcake one for a while - the box did eventually dent, and with both of the sets, I've found it a little frustrating trying to get the cards out of the box (as they stick in there really well)... my daughter is actually better at removing them than I am (!!!), and I'll note the company who made it was very thoughtful in scalloping the bottom to make it easier.  The magnets are pretty strong.  I really do recommend this - especially to bring to restaurants or on a plane (or maybe for an older kid, the car - but I know we would lose the pieces if I gave it to my 3 year old while driving!).  This would be fun for both girls and boys.",5.0
"This set is in a convenient box and has many many little detailed pieces. My 4 year old loves designing different types of houses! There are even great little pets that hang out in the windows and on the porches! My kiddo loves letting the pets roam around the yard and check out all the features she places, which leads me to think she'd really love more living creatures to inhabit these places. This would be a great travel toy because you can't play with it unless it's in the box. Everything sticks in there. The one gripe I have is that it looks like there are 4 different cards to play with, but there are only 2 cards front and back, and they all fit inside the box, so you can only really look at one at a time, 2 cards max if you spread it out on another magnetic surface like a fridge. Not a big deal, but just a little crowded when trying to play.",5.0
"We have several different sets of these magnetic toys.  They are self contained--no small parts all over the floor, very portabke and giid for many",5.0
"This is a very cute puzzle and I love the zipper bag for storage.  Our puzzles in boxes always seem to get destroyed and pieces get lost, but these bags make cleaning up and storage easier.",5.0
"If your little one loves puzzles and this is in her age level, these pouch puzzles are the best thing I have found to take along. Flat, fairly small, light and uses a good amount of time to put together.",5.0
"Such great quality, easy to put together because of the thick, well made pieces. My 2.5-3 year old LOVES them and can do these 12 piece puzzles by herself.",5.0
"Again, a great price for a puzzle.  The best part is the carrying case.  You can take it with you without worrying about losing pieces.",5.0
My son is 2.5 years old and was getting bored with the shape in a hole puzzles. So I got some starter jigsaw puzzles (12 pieces or so.) While he also likes the Melissa and Doug puzzles he loves the Mudpuppy puzzles so much more. For one they have bigger pieces so they are much easier to manipulate. Also the other poster is right that each piece has a referential on it so that it's easy for him to figure out how it goes together completely on his own.,5.0
My son is 2 years and 4 months.  He is a little advanced for his age on puzzles because he really enjoys doing them and practices.  He can actually do this puzzle on his own which is great for a 12 piece jigsaw puzzle.  The pieces are so well made and it has a picture he can refer to while he is building.  Love this puzzle and the dinosaur one as well.  I plan to buy some more of these if they have them!,5.0
"A great puzzle for my 3.5 year old. I have bought a few of the puzzles in this series, and they are a great jigsaw starter puzzle. The pieces are easy to manipulate, and there aren't too many. It is easy for them to finish (with a bit of help). The pictures are vibrant (and non-commercial, which is a plus). The zippered pouches work well too.",5.0
"Love the Mudpuppy pouch puzzles! My children keep up with the puzzle since there is a pouch. It's very easy to take along in a bag or backpack. Very good quality, will buy more.",5.0

My little one is happy to learn with this beautiful Alphabet letters,5.0
"The ""sweet"" pattern is absolutely adorable!  I plan on purchasing a set of matching lower case letters and numbers. The magnets are very well made, and I don't foresee any of the coated paper peeling off.  The manufacturer indicates this product is for years three and up. We are using them for decoration out of our toddler's reach until then. However, she grabs them every time she sees them. She loves the print and colors, too!",5.0

We were able to write a message from Santa on the board for a super cute presentation! The box was pretty banged up, but Amazon made it right. Though these are a little pricey, I think they were worth the splurge!",5.0
My daughter loves these. They stick to my fridge very well. They are light enough for her tiny 1 year old hands to pull on and off yet song enough to stay on when the door is opened a hundred times a day.,5.0
My 9 month old daughter loves these. I put them on my dishwasher and she stands there and plays with them.  They are a very pretty soft pastel pattern which I love because they don't stand out as an eye sore.,5.0
great for my 5 yr old,5.0
"I was hesitant to purchase these because some reviews said they were basically paper and fell apart easily. This was not the case with the magnets I received. They are really hard embossed wood/cardboard type material. My toddler has used these for a month, chewing on them, scattering them around the house, and they are still going strong. I'm really happy with these magnets and i will probably purchase the matching number too. Oh, and the colors are super cute!",5.0

"I bough these when my daughter was 2.  She really liked the beautiful colors and prints on the letters.  I did quite some research to check which product would be safe and without harmful chemicals since toddlers tend to put everything in their mouth.  Saw a lot of cheaper products with unsafe printing materials and dyes and therefore chose to spend a little extra on something that my daughter would be touching often.  I am happy with my purchase.  These are not only beautiful to look at, they are a good size and are built well.  its been many months since I bought them and they haven't worn out.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to buy safe products for their kids.",5.0

I was looking for letters to accompany my daughter's wooden easel. I am not a fan of plastic toys and wanted to find magnetic letters that were more attractive than the cheap plastic ones I've seen everywhere. These were perfect. I ended up getting a set of uppercase and a set of lowercase. We've had them for over a year and they've stood up fine to my toddler's use.,5.0
These are great quality and super cute! They are a little smaller than I expected but perfect for the 16 month old  purchased them for.,5.0
My little girl loves these! They are super cute and also stick well to the refrigerator since they entire back of each letter is a magnet rather than just one small magnet.,5.0

Love this. I am able to work one on one with a child that is struggling with mastering how to tell time.,5.0
"It's small enough to fit in my three year old's purse so she can take anywhere. Great product. She did leave the marker open and it dried out, but she had other markers that size so no biggie. We've had this product for over four months and it's held up very very well. It's difficult to bend, won't tear unless you use mega-force. A wipe will clean off the dry erase perfectly.",5.0
Has really helped with learning to tell time,5.0

"My niece really enjoyed this. We played for long periods, and it really helped her understand minutes versus hours. She caught on very quickly and I can happily say she tells time very well now!",5.0
"The other reviews are correct, there are other versions of this great game that will hold up better and are better looking. However, I would want to make sure that anyone who doesn't already own this great game is aware that the game itself is a lot of fun and there are many variations/rules variants that can also keep it fresh for long time players. If you haven't tried partnership Acquire, give it a try, it's a whole different game.

For those not familiar with the game, there are tiles that are placed on the game board. When two or more are joined, they form a hotel chain. Only 6 hotel chains can exist on the board at a time, so certain tiles can become unplayable for a period of time. When a tile is played that connects two hotels, they are merged with the longer chain taking over the smaller. If they are the same size, the person playing the merging tile determines which chain takes over.

The subtleties of the game make it one of the true gems of boardgames. Sid Sackson developed the original version about 50 years ago and hundreds, if not thousands, of games have been developed since that in same ways have employed some of the mechanics and strategic elements of this game. Each player has unique information about the future growth of the hotels and the upcoming mergers. They can each take advantage of this but of course, other players can observe what they do and infer what information they have...

If you haven't played this game, you should definitely try it out. You may later find yourself searching on ebay for one of the earlier versions, but this will certainly be a great addition to your games closet if you don't already have it!",5.0

"Love this board game!  I'm an avid board gamer and I regularly play Agricola, Puerto Rico, Dominion, and others.  The level of difficulty for this board game is pretty low - learning the gameplay is much closer to Dominion or Ticket to Ride vs. Agricola or Puerto Rico.  It's a great game everyone in the family can get into.  We also play it to take a break in between Agricola games :)

We've played it a few dozen times and it has great replay value.  It's a more entertaining version of Monopoly.  It's a turn based game, where each player places a tile on their turn that triggers a certain action in the game - adding to an existing empire, merging two companies together, or reinforcing a company's position.  Lots of fun - highly recommended if you're looking for another game!",5.0

"The classic Acquire doesn't get old, and it packs quite a punch for its price tag. It's a shame that Monopoly and Life have become synonymous with mainstream boardgames when this title was still around.

The newest version isn't the most preferred since some older prints had a different set of components that could lock in place, but ultimately it's the same game.",5.0
Well thought up game.  Challenging and satisfying.,5.0
"It's actually a really fun game. The game play is long and moves are based on strategy. You want to have the most amount of stock as well as the most amount of money by the end of the game. There are a lot of rules, so keep the Rule Book near by. I played it once with a couple of friends and now it's the only board game they want to play.",5.0

My favorite game!,5.0
"One of my favorite board games.  It's different every time and luck has very little to do with the outcome.

In this game, you're buying and selling hotel chains.  It's played on a board with tiles.  Each player puts down the tiles to make the hotels grow and can buy stock in the different chains.  The larger the hotel grows, the more it's worth.  When two hotels merge, those with the most stock get paid.  Players must try to remember which players have bought which stock in order to try to have the most stock in a particular chain.

Overall it's a great game.  It doesn't take long to learn and is a lot of fun every time.",5.0
Great strategy game that simulates the real world of buying and selling shares in a company!,5.0

i love this game one of my favorite by fare,5.0
"I don't know if Ive ever taken more delight realizing how the tiles available to me assured my victory.  I couldn't contain my maniacal laughter.  You see, I was the majority shareholder of the corporation that was poised to gobble up all the little people- all the corporations that the other players had invested their hopes of success and they were about to be heart-broken.  Notice though, the key to victory was that tiles were available to me.  I recently played again against a very capable friend and others- who were probably also capable- but the randomly drawn tiles he needed went to someone else who may have hoarded them in spite (I know I did some of that) and his power plays that would have propelled his ambitions were always pre-empted and spoiled.

While usually opposed to games that involve heavy elements of luck, I am apparently making an exception for this game perhaps for so shallow a reason as Ive been so often on the better side of luck.  That said, this game does involve a lot of card counting and positioning, even baiting other players, so frustration can be keen when your carefully laid plans flop.  It leads to a terribly tense game that will keep you from getting to sleep as your mind keeps spinning around what actions brought fruit and which did not.  This is how it works:

Game Play
Youve got a board with plain-Jane grid of numbers and letters, and a stack of tiles for each square.  You randomly draw tiles and can place one each turn and buy up to 3 shares.  If- when you place a tile- you connect previously unconnected tiles you get to start a new corporation- and you get a share- for free!  You still get to buy three more.  Sometimes when you place a tile, you will connect two separate corporations, this triggers a merger where the smaller of the two- or if its a tie, the person to placed the merging tile gets to choose which corporation is bought out.  Now the person who holds the most shares gets a payout, and the person who holds the second largest gets a smaller payout.  Now you can do one of three things:
  Trade your shares two for one into the new parent corporation
  Sell your shares
  Keep your shares in hopes that the corporation will be resurrected on the board later
Shares get more expensive as corporations get larger and corporations can get large enough that they become safe and cannot be merged.

I hate to tell you what to do but
While you can buy shares from any and all open corporations on the board, you would profit from focusing your effort on only three or four.  Because it is difficult to keep track- at least for me- of how many of each your opponents have purchased.  Its especially relieving when the other players are spending their money on shares of corporations you don't care about.

While some hotel chains are higher-rent than others, don't think that you can put all your eggs in one basket.  Even if you are at one time the majority stock holder in the ritziest corporation, you will quickly be bankrupt and others will be able to outspend and pass you.

Ignore participating in small corporations at your peril.  Players who get payouts get money.  Bankrupt is not a place you want to be in for very long in this game.

Theme
Im especially pleased- as someone who cant afford to become even a minority share holder in a real corporation- to get sucked into the world where individual jobs don't exist to me (they are conveniently outside the scope of this game) when I consider merging companies because I need that gross severance for selling out so that I can uh create more jobs with a new corporation, yeah thats it.  Its not about me getting the most money at the end at all.  This teaches nothing about the harsh realities of capitalism, and gives me no insight whatsoever into the minds of corporate giants.  But I have to admit that I love it all the same.

Balance
There are no catch up mechanisms in place in this game, so someone can run away with it, but its a game where you can always claw for second place.  That is, you're personal economy will never be destroyed beyond repair leaving you sitting watching everyone else at the table rejoice in spoils.  I find a lot of satisfaction being able to claw for second place myself.  This is because I, like you have the ability to synthesis happiness.

Interaction
Interaction is high in this game.  Nothing inspires audible grumbling like someone overtaking your position as majority share holder.  And the table is abuzz when mergers happen.

Learning Curve
Very low, The manual is very small.  The vast majority of the rules were explained above and they have a handy little lookup sheet which tells the share prices and payouts for each corporation and for what size.

Downtime
While you do have to wait your turn while others take theirs, and you can annoy people by not paying attention to what others do and when its your turn suddenly the board has changed- youll likely lose because you spent too much money buying shares when no one was competing with you and youll have no one to blame but yourself.  This never happened to me mind you, but I have a friend that  Any downtime you take during this game will be at your expense.

Whats not to Like?
The new edition that I bought is made a little cheaply.  The trays that hold the drawn tiles are cardboard that you put together- well I put mine together, not you.  Its not beautiful to look at, but whats gorgeous about corporate greed?  Dare I say the plainness is part of the theme?  That said, the share cards are easy on the eyes.

Collateral Endorsements
It gets requested by my gaming groups and my wife, who hates Monopoly, loves the game.  I can get my 5 year old to play with me with some simplified rules- we don't deal with money.  Just grow and gobble corporations.",5.0
"Hall of Fame board game. The game is easy to learn and fantastic for 3, 4 or 5 players. Games go very quickly.

This edition is a little cheap, but then that is the case for all games. If you like board games like Cataan, Axis and Allies, Risk, Monopoly or Scrabble, you'll probably really like this.",5.0

"This is one of our favorite games, we had played the vintage one at a friends and was looking everywhere for this.  The board is not as good as the original (used to have raised slots so the pieces don't move), but everything is of thick coated cardboard that should last a while.  We only wish the box was designed a bit better to hold all the components in a more organized way.

The game itself is great though, good for strategy players.",5.0
"An Open Letter to GaleForce9*:

Your unpainted miniatures are very not bad. Your spell cards are great. Your board games are ""meh"". Your DM screens, however, are freaking terrible. I'm still waiting for a single screen that isn't polluted with pointless artwork where useful, reference-able tables should be. Once again, you've created a single use screen that is only useful when running the ""Storm King's Thunder"" adventure. Even despite the fact that it's geared to that adventure path, it's usefulness negligible, at best. I massive swath of the inner panel is wasted on artwork and a bloated overland map, which could have been easily reduced to a single panel in size. And the few table you have are nigh-useless themselves.

In short, stop making crap DM screens.",1.0

Oh, and did I mention this is TINY?  The whole book is about the size of a passport (but with less pages) and there is about 4 robots total on the little pages (parts are parts, but I counted 1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 feet, and a body on each of the 4 pages).

I thought this would be similar but it was a joke. I had no problem making the pom-poms but once you get into having to cut the pom-poms to shape them into dogs it becomes pretty much impossible and the mess is out of control. If you can get anywhere close to having your pom-poms look like dogs you then have to glue all of the features on with the tiny little glue tube they give you and it just a useless sticky mess. To make matters worse the little accessories are made out of thin cheap paper - how this could be marketed as something a child could either make or play with is beyond me. So, to make a long story short, if you love getting pissed off, making a mess and having your kid cry, order this kit!",1.0
This was a huge disappointment! There was only enough material to make 4 dogs. The Pom Pom maker was a joke. We loved the Pom Pom critters kit way better and that one supplied you with a lot of accessories.,1.0
Only buy this for an adult who is super patient and likes to be covered in fuzz.  It was a frustrating project to do with an 8 year old. There will be crying when the glue doesn't hold and the puppies head falls off.  It makes a terrible mess and there is not even that much yarn included.  I would never be able to make the puppies look anywhere close to the ones in the book.  Ours turned out crazy looking.  Book went straight to Goodwill.,1.0
This is horrible! The directions are very hard for a child to read and comprehend themselves. The yarn made a mess. My daughter was so excited to get this and cried when she couldn't understand how to make them. I would not recommend this to anyone!,1.0

Why Hasbro doesn't actually produce a quality version with a separated game board, I will never understand.  The original, and the 1999 versions are extremely durable and playable.  The only redeeming quality of this version is the stock certificates, which are finally made of durable laminated paper.  Hasbro could easily sell a quality version for a premium price.  If you cannot find another version - this is still one of the best board games ever.  But spend your money on an original - readily available on auction sites.

P.S. I have almost every version available - including 2 German versions.  Great game - horrible waste of cardboard.",1.0

Predictable.  Not fun.  It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap.  Often times I thought ""this seems like d&d battle....  Just kidding"".  We never played it again after one play through.

Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga,es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.

"I had high hopes for this game, as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D&D (though if you like 3e, enjoy it! I'm not going to tell you one is better; I'll just tell you which one I prefer). I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such, so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.

Sadly, all that couldn't rescue this game. It is exceedingly repetitive. Play about 3 turns and you'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you. The game is hopelessly shallow, based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent. Despite the modular tiles, the game offers virtually no customization.

The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.

I really wanted to enjoy this game, so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts, before accepting the fact that it simply doesn't work. Extremely disappointing.",1.0

My son who's almost 5 and is very advance has no interest in this game either.  The cards are too similar and ""boring"" to look at.  Everything is orange, yellow, and black, and a few have blue backgrounds, but there is nothing visually stimulating about this game.  Spend your money on something else!",1.0

My wife and I played this game two or three times before we were utterly bored.  This is contrast to ""Word Thief"", also a Scrabble like word card game.

"What a great aid to a fun game!  Our family has played Quiddler for many years.

The only problem was that after using the dictionary for a couple of months my husband discovered that our copy was missing pages 281 to 296!!!  I e-mailed the company to no avail & then decided to telephone Arizona & speak directly to a real person.  She was very surprised & extremely apologetic for the problem.  She assured me that a new, complete copy would be sent to my home.  As that conversation only took place less than 72 hours ago, I have not yet received the dictionary, but I have every confidence that is will be sent as promised.  So beware! check your copy carefully when it arrives.  I am sure that my faulty copy is not the only one out there.  The dictionary itself, by the way, is excellent.

"This game is simply not fun as it promotes too much solitary thought and not a lot of interaction.
We played two rounds, one with 4 people and one with 2 people and never did we draw more than twice per round.
Here's how our 2 player rounds went:
3 card - lay down (i.e. called ""out"" on the initial deal with no need to draw or discard (although I drew and discarded a card to keep up with the rules).
4 card round - lay down
5 card round - lay down
6 card round - 1 draw
7 card round - 1 draw
8 card round - lay down
9 card round - lay down
10 card round - lay down

Here's how our 4 player round went:
3 card - lay down
4 card - lay down
5 card - lay down
6 card - 1 draw
7 card - lay down
8 card - 1 draw
9 card - lay down
10 card - lay down
Now, this is simply not fun.

Without the interaction and excitement of drawing/discarding and building your hand, plus the excitement that one of your opponents may call out before you, this came is no better than giving players random letters and telling them to make words.  Seriously, deal out a bunch of scrabble tiles and you have the same thing.

A typical round is shuffle, deal, first player stares at his/her cards for 10 minutes, making words and usually makes an instant lay down.  Player 2 draws a card, makes words, and lays hand down.  Shuffle and repeat.  The lack of interaction in this game is what gives it 1 star (would give it 0 if I could and would return it, except its already open).

I don't think this is a fun game and I don't see how it can have so many 5 star reviews.  This game just isn't that fun.  It's more fun to play rumy or hearts or spades or Euchre, or a number of other games that are essentially free and don't involve, long, boring, non-interactive turns.",1.0

To be fair about half the questions are not gross, just stupid.  ""WYR wear a bicycle helmet everywhere you go or carry an open umbrella every where you go?""

"Sadly, this game had questions that were actually too gross to answer, so we were unable to play the game after about five minutes. And I thought my kids had an ultra silly sense of humor, but this game took it farther than even they thought was funny.",1.0
some of the suggestions are disgusting,1.0
This game doesn t make sense.  The questuons aren t intelligent,1.0
"I bought this thinking it would be a fun family road trip game, but a quarter of the questions are just disgusting. Things like ""would you rather drink a glass of your day old spit or of your own sweat"" and ""would you rather drink liquid found leaking from a garbage bag or chew on a hairy clump found between the cushions of an old couch."" I am just disgusted that anyone could think those types of questions are humorous. This game will NOT be joining us on our trip.",1.0

"Second time out of the box, the game board is torn. Board is six pieces that hinge together in order to fold and go back in box. The ""hinge"" is flimsy paper. Appears to have dried out and cracked. Counterfeit?

Scotch taped together, but it looks like sh*t.

Update: tried to register game online and it says the serial number is invalid. Either its counterfeit or Days of Wonder produced junk and are trying to deny it's theirs.",1.0
"Only 6 cards and it was in the gray plastic bag that you see in the pictures. The box, board, instructions are missing.",1.0
"I kept reading reviews about how SUPER FANTASTIC Ticket To Ride is and how its the best game EVER!!! so I forked over a lot of money for this expensive game that turned out to be incredibly boring.  We played it once and we all pretty underwhelmed.  I mean, the internet doesnt lie, right?  We must have done something wrong.  Played it a second time.  Still, just as dull as the first time.

The only excitement the game provides is watching someone with big hands try to hold the baby sized cards.

The game would be good for children learning strategy...definitely not adults.

Lesson re-learned....dont trust the internet.",1.0

"Ive ordered this item 3 times and I got a cheap plastic key tag, a small piece of paperboard and 8 game cards. Do not buy this item.",1.0
Ordered the game as pictured. Received 5 yellow train cards. Not worth the price.,1.0
Great game but game board is not made for using more than once!  The paper map that is glued to the board is too thin and it ripped as soon as we started unfolding it and then later when we folded the board to put it away.  We have had to tape it but for the cost of this game you should get a better game board!,1.0
We were shipped a defective card deck. Missing certain colors and has double quantity in other colors... so we are unable to play the game,1.0
I got this in sept.  It was a Christmas gift. The game board is missing a piece!!!!,1.0
"DO NOT BUY THIS BOARD! This board is fake. Its missing pieces, the board is backwards, and the pieces aren't the right colors or size. My daughter owns the board already, which is why I purchased the game; however, we cant play correctly due to the amount of missing pieces. I am returning this product.",1.0
I bought this for Thanksgiving to play with family today.  We opened the sealed box to set up the game only to discover the only card included are the railroad cards. To repackage a game as new should be illegal. VERY disappointed with this seller! Window for return is closed of course,1.0
"I received a used one.. or at least it has been opened. The box was on a wrong direction, an inside plastic organizer was cracked, the game board is scratched making it look old, and missing an item!!!! I have been holding on to it for 3 months before giving it as a suprise present, which turned out to be a bad present.",1.0
"The version I received had 2 blue, one green, one red, and one black train cars. No yellow.",1.0
"Cannot register the game because the code is invalid. Yellow trains missing 3 train cars, but there were extras in the overfill bag. Game company suggested that my game was a forgery. Alternatively, this was a used game sold as new, hence the invalid code.",1.0
This is a counterfeit game. When you try to register it the serial number doesn't work. The board doesn't lay flat and it has cracks in it. My friends had the same thing happen to them. If you want this game go and buy it from a store where they are more likely to have a real one that you can actually play. In case you are wondering I bought directly from Amazon not from a third party.,1.0
"Loved the game the few times we got to play it. However, the board fell apart and it's less than a month old!",1.0
Omg this game is wayyy to complicated. This made us all frustrated rather than looking forward to game night. Takes you an hour and a you tube video to understand how to play it and even then you scratch your head.,1.0
Game arrived missing cards. Going back to Amazon. Disappointed!,1.0
"When I opened the box, I quickly realized things weren't right. I was missing multiple types of pieces, one bag of pieces was in really rough shape, and I ended up with two copies of one set of cards rather than the two different sets. Completely unusable. Putting in for a return as soon as this review is posted.",1.0
Game came with no rule book!,1.0
We loved this game when we played with friends. So I ordered it for game night. All the cards are disoriented! Cities are in the wrong states and wrong part of the map! Soo dissappointed! Would like a refund!!!,1.0
Missing half the cards so cannot even play the game.  Had saved it for a birthday present so now can't return it.,1.0
Game did not contain everything needed to play. Most of the cards were missing. Have not heard back from buyer to get a replacement or a refund.,1.0
There were no pawns included in the game to move around the board and keep score.,1.0
I'd like to upload a photo of the condition of the game box...it looks like it's been used as a soccer ball! 2 corners of the box are smashed in and on is even ripped. How am I supposed to give this as a gift without it looking like I bought this on clearance? Very disappointed.,1.0
Actual game didn't come with the correct color trains,1.0
delivery with many missing cards....disappointed!,1.0
Very complicated and too hard for my family to learn. We returned it.,1.0
"I decided to play for a bit thinking I can still have some fun but A.D. I'm playing I realized there is no blue yellow or white cards not only am I missing that but there is no black pieces so I can't have 5 players and the game isn't so fun without the special missions especially since were all fighting to build over the Orange, green, pink, and red since there is no other colors!!!!!",1.0
"Don't waste you money.  Buy Ticket to Ride Europe instead. I wish I had. Many of locations on the route cards are incorrect. They list two locations on a card and then show dots on the map on that card that are incorrect.  Very confusing when you are playing. It is surprising to see this poor quality from this game maker.  They did not include the listed number of trains in two of the bags.  Luckily,  they include a bag of extras.  The cards in the Europe version are a perfect size where the USA version they are tiny and much harder to read.",1.0
"I was so excited to receive this game, but the actual game box was crushed on one corner and the game was very very damp!! It wouldn't be that big of deal, but a portion of the game board is peeling off and the inside of the box has something on it (hopefully rubbed off ink and not mold!!!).  The Amazon shopping box was untouched and included a book I also purchased and it was fine, so I am assuming Ticket to Ride was stored inproperly and packaged damaged. I've attached pictures!",1.0
"1. Rules are poorly explained
2. Game is overpriced. It's made in China and the components don't cost more than about $3
3. Made in China quality (poor injection molding, uneven board, back sticker misapplied, plastic cards make your hands itchy)",1.0

Unfortunately, Days of Wonder is a terrible company and I could never support giving them money.  Not allowing their customers to play the most updated version of an app they own is unethical.

Obviously they didn't research very well.  Very few cities outside the US and they need to learn Minnesota geography better.  Duluth is on Lake Superior not where Minneapolis is.,1.0
Bought this game based on all the good reviews.  Just sold it for cheap at a yard sale. Hard to figure out and nobody in our family liked it.,1.0
"We were so excited about this game as our whole family loves to play games, but we found this so confusing that we couldn't get through the directions and figure it out.  We wanted to love this but were so disappointed.  the directions were long and cumbersome and made the game seem so boring, so in all honesty, we did not even get to the point of playing the game.  We are usually very patient and play many different games, some lasting several days, but we just couldn't get energized about this one.",1.0
"Tried to play with my 11 year old grandson. I never though I was stupid before but the thing is very difficult to figure out. We got the various cards sorted - which by the way are too small to handle easily - tried to do a practice play while following the instructions and got completely messed up.
We decided our only recourse is to wait for one of my genius sons' help in figuring out how to play.",1.0
"I liked this game when it first came out, but (trust me) the European version has all of the gameplay of this one plus a few extra aspects that makes our gaming group always reach for the European version. We plan to dump this boring American version on ebay.",1.0
Dumbest game ever.,1.0
I would give it zero stars if I could as the purchase fails to appear on my kindle fire,1.0
We were so excited about ordering this game.....we ordered it and got it in the mail....we opened up the box and the green marker that keeps were your points are wasn't in the box....we bought this brand new and were disappointed that we were missing pieces,1.0
"I am not a huge board game player so I am not speaking from a place of master knowledge however, I am totally dumbfounded by the amount of reviews  of this game let alone the high stars of this game. Can you say, ""boring?""  Seriously --- are people starving for stimulation in a board game since othello or risk that they would rate this 5 stars?  This game is so boring that it will put a 2 year old to sleep.  Yeah...yeah...yeah you have to look at your train cards and destination cards and figure out how do I get the most points from ""A"" city to ""B"" city but what a snore!  We did not even finish the game.  My kids love board games like monopoly, clue, life, and risk so I purchased this game for us to play over Christmas Break... We quit after playing 15 minutes---so stupid.",1.0
"I love this game, but the new version came with small playing cards and they are ABSOLUTELY annoying!  Feels like the company went cheap to save a few bucks. The game is still great...but you can tell a company is trying to capitalize on the upswing of popularity to improve profit margin....SMALL CARDS ARE SUPER LAME! I am giving this a 1 star for poor company decision making.... it's like going to your favorite restaurant and they've removed your favorite dish.",1.0
This game is awful. These reviews have to be fake. I bought the game to play on a family summer vacation and nobody in the large group enjoyed it. In fact they all joked the following year about how terrible the game was. I am seriously perplexed as to how many people actually say they want to play this boring dull and complicated game more than once.,1.0
"Beautiful game, IMPOSSIBLE to figure out.  Completely unplayable, adults and kids (ages 8 and 9) have tried and tried to figure out the directions.  What a shame, as they love trains and this game was so expensive.",1.0
"I seriously hate this game. Everyone in my group hates it. It's the most overrated game in the history of all games. If you are an avid board gamer, the most you will get out of this is using it to convince someone who hates board games to play with you. Why you would want to convince someone who hates board games to play with you is beyond me, but whatever. That's why it's a ""gateway game"" that is ""fun for all ages""--there are barely rules, so lazy folks can get in on the non-existent action.

Cons:
You get to do one thing a turn.
It's pretty much entirely luck based.
People act like it's a big deal when you block them off from completing their routes, but it's almost always just the only thing you can do because this game is boring and its objectives are boring and only getting to do one thing a turn means you don't have time to sit around and troll people.
The map is ugly and boring, the train pieces are generic pieces of plastic like Fisher Price toys out of the 90s.
Zzzzzzzzzz.

Pros:
I guess you can get people who hate games to play with you.

If you're still convinced that this is the ultimate game for you, at least don't buy it new.",1.0
"It needs changes in four of its rules, and reminds me of Risk, where I could potentially lose friends.  The game takes about 1 hour to play.  The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board.  Since I stopped playing this game, I bought Seven Wonders, which is WAY more interesting, and has no possible avenues for irritation. I did make one mistake in my review.  This game deserves ZERO stars instead of 1!!  I gave this game away, and couldn't get it out of my house fast enough!",1.0
"Package was left in a snow storm and box is now warped.  Let Amazon know, but never heard back.
Game is great to play and plan on keeping it around for along time.  However, it is pricey and disappointed that I will forever have a warped box.  :'-(",1.0
"It is a fun game, the only reason for the review is the fact that the game was wet on arrival.  The outer box was without a blemish and not wet.  The game was wet WITHIN the shrink wrap.  How that is possible, I'm not sure.  The board is slightly warped, and the instructions are damaged-box warped.  Should have bough in a store.",1.0
"The box arrived destroyed.  Not happy.  I don't even want to play it now because the box is falling apart.  I know i sound like a little baby, but I pay for prime and expect things to come on time and in one piece.  If i am going to have broken things, Id like the chance to do it myself.",1.0
"Cheap, cheap, cheap quality elf. Like something bought at a street vendor in China (and I live in China, I should know).

"I bought this product at Bed Bath and Beyond, but it's the same exact thing (just clarifying why I'm not a ""Verified Purchase"" reviewer for this specific product).

In terms of quality, I have no issues. It's well made, the quality of the book is really good. The illustrations seem like they could use a little more color and a little more skill, but they're fine overall. This book and the box it comes in along with the Elf are made to last few years.

With all that being said, I have a really big concern about the whole idea behind this ""tradition."" We did it at our house last year, and unfortunately, we're doing it again this year, although I'm trying to figure out now how to get out of it without crashing my daughter's feelings and destroying the trust that she currently has in us.

So you might want to know what my issue with this Elf is.... Well, I have a regular kid at home (to me, she is perfect, but to the outside world she is most likely just a regular kid). She misbehaves sometimes, she doesn't always follow my directions or requests (don't we all hate asking our little people in the house to brush their teeth multiple times just to discover that it was never done?!). She sometimes throws tamper tantrums, but overall, I love her just the way she is. Which is why I keep asking myself, why on earth did I ever lie to her about an Elf who tells on her everyday to Santa?! I read somewhere that it's just lazy parenting, and it really is. It feels like it. I don't like threatening my child. I like teaching her about consequences of her behavior, which is absolutely necessary, but threatening her with a toy who creepily comes alive at night and tells Santa that she was ""bad?"" That feels just cruel, and stressful to her, which brings me to my second point.

Even though my kid absolutely adores this Elf (she couldn't wait for her to come!), she is also very stressed out about it. I don't ever even say anything to her about the Elf watching or the Elf reporting bad behavior to Santa. I try to give it as little significance as I can, but she still is stressed (she is 6). Ever since the Elf came, she has trouble sleeping through the night. She tries her best to behave well for most of the day, but it's followed by a temper tantrum in the evening, because it's probably emotionally just too difficult to handle to have to be ""perfect"" all day long. Whether it's because of excitement or stress, or maybe it's just too much stimulation for her imagination (believing that objects come to life at night is a little creepy and unsettling when you think about it). She is not herself, and her sleep (and mine) is interrupted because of that. The home should be a relaxing, safe place; not a place where she is constantly watched and judged by her beloved little Elf.

And then, I already feel bad about lying about Santa. Now I'm lying about the Elf. Will this kid ever trust me when she finds out? Will she think that we lied about other things as well?

For us, adults, the elf is simply a fun toy, but to the kids, he is REAL. And that can be very unsettling for them. Just don't do it to your kid. It's not worth it, it's mean, and as a parent who has done it I can tell you that it doesn't feel good to me to have to lie to my child on daily basis and make her be so excited about something that I know is one big lie.",1.0

The felt used for the body and hat on the new one is cheaper and rougher, more of a thick, scratchy felt than the soft one we had. He just seemed so dull and cheap, comparatively. Sadly, it seems they have let the quality go in favor of mass production. Luckily, only the body of ours had been damaged, so I was able to do a full head transplant, and my kids were none the wiser. When my kids noticed these new ones in the stores this year, they actually commented on how different they looked from theirs at home! Additionally, I looked for just the elf without the book, but found that I had to repurchase the entire set, so now I have an extra book and box. I wish I could find another of the older design elf- I would pick it up now and save it, just in case I need it in the future.",1.0
Just stupid.,1.0
"I refused to buy this after seeing it at Barnes and Noble. It is a completely ugly, flimsy doll with beefed up packaging and a kindergarten level book. The doll looks like no child would ever want it if it weren't for the hype. I told my daughter I would buy an elf costume for her doll and move it around. I cannot believe anyone buys this piece of junk",1.0
"I finally decided to make the leap for the stupid elf on the shelf.  Love the elf and the concept...HATE the book.  I would have loved to have known christianity was going to be pushed through this harmless elf.  Terrible that it is part of this, preventing our family from completely enjoying this product.",1.0
"DO NOT BUY!!! Read the story of the elf carefully. Notice that on Christmas Eve the elf has to leave the house and go back to the North Pole to return next year. Many kids will find the elf amusing and will get attached to him and will cry and miss the elf on Christmas morning! Poof, your Christmas will become a tragedy and not a happy event. Your child will cry because they will miss their funny elf friend. DONT START THIS TRADITION!!! Don't say I didn't warn you!",1.0
"Sorry elf fans. I just don;t like this. The book is patronizing and at times I felt downright nasty. THe implication is that your child is badly behaved and the tone is pretty threatening. I forget the words but there was one page in particular that was the nail in the coffin for me. Christmas is meant to be fun! I expected this to be a sweet, entertaining story- I'm a preschool teacher and mum of to, of course I have used 'Santa is watching....' as gentle nudge from time to time, but this takes it to another level. Even my husband agreed with me and he is generally more 'tough love' than I. I will add that the lf itself is very poorly made. This has been returned and we are having fun with a toy elf we bought from the toy store who is much friendlier!",1.0
"I think the tradition is a great idea, but this product is nothing short of a total ripoff.

I HIGHLY suggest just ordering the $7 plush version without the book.  The plush that comes in this one is just plain terrible.  It was sewn together so poorly the elf can't even sit up without being supported.  It's dollar-store quality.  The book contains an author's blurb about how she started the tradition, making it completely 'unsafe' to have around children of reading age.  Additionally, the book is plastered with the author's name, the publishing company information/markings, UPC barcodes, etc...

Your family will find no magic from this version of the Elf on the Shelf.  Save yourself some money and buy a cheaper plush - it literally couldn't be worse than what comes in this box and doesn't come with the added burden of having to hide the book from your kids.",1.0

"First, just a niggling semantic note; the ""Elf on the Shelf"" is not a 'tradition' - it is  a marketing campaign for a product and that is all it is.

One fascinating proof of this is the ongoing battle the Elf on the Shelf Wikipedia page. When anyone edits to point out that you can't create a ""tradition"" in four years of TV marketing the proprietors of the toy swoop in and edit it back out. It goes on and on and is amusing if you are interested in Wiki wars. [...]

It is not a coincidence that one of this marketing juggernaut's creators (Christa Pitts) worked at QVC before becoming a full-time Elf-On-the-Shelf entrepreneur.

The product in question  is a cheesy, cheaply made `elf' doll (which is not actually a doll - see below) and a book of instructions (for $30!).

One of the instructions is that your child must never EVER touch this toy.

Do you not as a parent have the slightest pause when you read that?

My own conclusion is that this has more to do with what a cheap piece of junk it is and how it could never withstand rigorous actual `playing' than any manufactured rules of engagement for a spurious fake `tradition'. In fact I am certain that it does not even meet any child saftey manufacture standards, but that's not why I am revolted by it.

My reaction to this particular marketing gambit can be summed up as 'ewww, what a creepy concept'. Kids will be over supervised and monitored adults soon enough without Santa sending 'spies' into their bedrooms in childhood. George Orwell would shudder along with me I am sure.

Now the idea of toys animating themselves is not in and of itself creepy but is actually fun and pretty much an integral part of all children's fantasy life. The `Toy Story"" films obviously mine this theme but there are many other instances; the most `traditional' if you will being the story of Pinocchio.

I adore those charming parents who work deep into the night to stage vignettes with their kids' plastic dinosaurs:[...] and I don't think it would take much effort for an intuitive parent to do something like that with any toy that they chose and hold the spying part of the narrative all together ::sheesh:: Plus there would be absolutely no need to do this during the already overstimulating Christmas season but maybe save it for summer when nights are long and the imaginations might benefit from a creative nudge.

To the `Elf on the Shelf' and his marketing slaves (the parents who do this) I say `Bah, Humbug!""",1.0

"I had never heard of this story until I came to live in the US.
My mother in law brought this to our house. I didn't think much of it until I saw my 2 year old son mortified at the idea of being spied on and hiding the elf out of fear.
From that point on I took the matter in my own hands and told my son that this elf was a kid friendly elf and that he was your friend and would do things with you as a friend. He did not spy.

If we need manipulative trickery to bend our kids in behaving a certain way, we failed as parents.
Since then my son loves this elf. He is his buddy and we don't have to deal with the freaky spying thing around the house.",1.0

"I don't want to be insulting but this story isum...not smart. Wait, it's actually worse than that. Instead of a sweet Christmas magic kind of vibe (like you get from the book ""Dear Santa""), the elf in this story takes on a nasty, ""I'm going to tell on you"" annoying snitch-like persona.

Here's a creepy little elf and a book.  If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity. Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00.

"My mother in law gave us this god-forsaken thing. Unfortunately we opened it in front of the kids, so we were stuck.
Gimmicky, and just another thing for mommy/daddy to have to remember every freaking night after kids finally in bed, dishes washed and you have a few minutes to yourself before passing out. ""Did you hide the elf?"" ""No, oh god, I can't even get up, can you do it?"" , back and forth etc... Or more often as we get up in the morning ""S***! Honey did you hide the stupid elf?"", cuz we usually forget.
 Isn't the advent calendar enough for counting down to Christmas? I HATE this little annoying skinny red guy. I love when we hide him really well and my kids can't find it for a few days to give me a break. My husband and I go all out for Christmas, decorating, taking kids to special shows, ice skating, donating to charities, participating in Christmas church events... this is just cheesy and over the top and too much work.

"My mom bought this for the ""magic"" that it brings around Christmastime for my two younger siblings. I was sitting on the couch, thoroughly enjoying Archer via Netflix, and she comes in excitedly, and beckons my little brother and sister in the room. I'm not thrilled, because I have to pause the funniest show on television, but my mom does pay for Netflix, even though I still live here, so I sigh heavily and open another cylinder of Pringles.

They're a lot younger than I am; Kevin is six, and Kayla is nine, so I can see why they would be excited about an elf figurine. I believed in Santa once too, right before my parents shattered my dreams and aspirations of one day being a sleigh mechanic for Santa by telling me of his nonexistence. This is always a bitter and magic-less time of year for me, and I haven't really had a good Christmas since my 28th. I love my mom, she seems really excited about this Elf toy, but the back story she gives about ""Hubert"" explaining his existence as a pawn and rat to the big man up North is total BS. She's got this massive Cheshire cat grin on her face as she tells them how this smug little Brownie relays every action in the house to Saint Nick as 'good' or 'bad.' He can't talk, but you can talk to him. Reminds me of Uncle Owen right before they took him off life support. Kevin and Kayla are awestruck, these massive Rockwellian smiles pasted where their mouths should be, fully believing that every good thing they do will result in more Christmas loot...

 I'm a little ticked. My mom comes in, interrupts Archer, and is now lying her face off to these innocent little children, who fully believe the fabricated story she has just pitched to them. She reminds me so much of a used car salesman right now that I start having flashbacks. So she places this Product of China on the mantlepiece, sitting right above my stocking. I would move it, but I'm already halfway through this can of chips, and I don't want to wash my hands until after I've finished them.

He's been sitting there for ffifteen minutes, and I'm already sick of him. What a little snitch, tattling to Santa whether they've been good or bad. I don't know who invented this little trinket, but their interpretation of Christmas Cheer is obviously warped, rendering the morning of the 25th completely dependent on behavioral absolutes. What a tool. The two K's have gone to play Wii or something, but promised my mother they'd come back and tell 'Hubert' goodnight. She's in the back room, reading Fifty Shades of Grey for the 4th time.

So I get a bright idea to cure Hubert of his cheery smile. I don't like it, it's way too big for his face, and extremely unnatural. Really, who has cheek muscles that big? Maybe Schwarzenegger, in the middle of that phase where he would chew Double Bubble and shoot up simultaneously. So I go the the kitchen drawer, open it up, and behold, a Super Sharpie in plain sight. Popping the lid off, I make a beeline straight for Hubert and that stupid little face of his, and I draw a Stalin 'stache and some excessively sharp teeth. I'm cracking myself up as I transform this cheery little face into a bad trip of a Toy Story character. Finishing, I return the marker and go play WOW in my room.

About half an hour later and I hear my name screeched through the hallway two octaves higher than notes should go, and I sheepishly trudge into the living room. My mother is standing there, hands on hips, actual tears on her face, completely overreacting and exaggerating how I've ruined Christmas for the kids, and that she would have expected that sort of behavior out of me in my mid 20's. I sigh as I walk to the kitchen, retrieve a magic eraser, and annoyingly direct myself to the mantle, where the nightmare face of Hubert glares at me.

 I hold him in one hand, the other furiously scrubbing to remove the blatant Communism above his lip. I pause for a moment to check my progress, and his face is gone. Just gone. No smug little grin, no caricatural eyelashes, nothing. Nothing there but flesh colored plastic. Apparently these magic erasers are a little more potent than I expected. Mom's really lost it now. I get lectured, grounded, and sent to my room, where I am currently writing this review. Oh, and my mom says I have to buy a new one.",1.0

"I have no problem with creating a little ""Christmas Magic"" for children. However, this is a far-cry from anything magical; potentially causing more ""harm"" than good. Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas for all the right reasons, but this is simply not one of them.

To some, ""Elf on the Shelf"" may appear to be a harmless, charming, and ""all-watching"" doll for the fantasy and adoration of children. Remove the ""fantasy and charm"" from the equation, and you've got nothing short of a creepy ""spy"" of sorts. For me, and many others, it is an intimidating symbol for the behavior modification of children; an unwritten ""threat,"" if you will.

I must fully concede that in my childhood, I was scared of anything that I believed was ""watching me."" Having read books where animals ""come to life"" is not always a positive one. Sometimes the intent (construed by the child) may be to ""cause harm."" I know that I am not alone in this suggestion, as I've seen similar posts from others. The suggestion to move this figure around the home (or wherever) so that it can ""watch"" the children may be a very scary proposal, and one you might want to discuss before buying.  If my parents had had one of these things when I was in my childhood...I would have absolutely freaked out! No, not in a good way either.

From the vast numbers of comments (good and bad) that I've read, it appears that so many proponents of this overly commercialized franchise are using it as a psychological ""tool"" of sorts. Hey, nothing like having a ""spy-cam"" converted into an Elf, right? Whether or not you agree, that is essentially what this thing is doing. And yes, for those of you who wonder if I've even ""read the book?"" I have; cute book -- scary doll.

My suggestion to parents boils down to this - talk to your children FIRST! Don't think that this is guaranteed to be received as a ""good surprise"" for the Holiday Season. Some will, and definitely, some won't. The suggestion that this ""Elf"" will make your children ""behave well,"" is just about as misguided as the parents who buy Baby Einstein videos/books; believing their child will be the next child prodigy or Nobel Prize winner - despite the fact there's simply no evidence that they work, much less, ever been tested (which they haven't).

If you're that worried about the behavior of your children and what they're up to, invest in a wireless security camera(s). There are also ""Nanny"" programs for the computer, and the list goes on, ad infinitum.

As for me, this thing simply puts the ""Creepy"" in ""Christmas.""",1.0
"Great idea. Put a narc on the mantle and tell your kids they are under surveillance. Our elf started out following the rules, but by week 2 he was visiting my children in their dreams and asking for protection money in exchange for good reports. We didn't catch on until Santa contacted us directly and said that despite the kids amazing behavior he was going to have trouble fitting that pony into the sleigh.

When confronted, Elfish wouldn't cop to the crime, but instead offered the same deal to me. I DO want a new motorcycle, but don't want to set a bad example for the kids. Upon further consideration, we decided to take the elf out to the pine barrens and leave him there. Here's hoping he's not like Chuckie and doesn't come back to haunt us.",1.0
"The whole concept is so creepy and negative. What a great way to turn something beautiful like Christmas into something ugly and frightening. Yuck! If your parenting stinks so bad that you need this elf, may I suggest some parenting classes instead?

"With Christmas closely approaching I found myself seeking out any and all classic holiday traditions to introduce to my three-year-old son. For years I have heard the miracle stories about the Elf on the Shelf saving Christmas by turning the most ill-behaved child into an angel, halo and all. I excitedly spent $30 on the set thrilled to read this Christmas story Thanksgiving night before bed and begin a tradition I was sure we would carry on for years- and then I read the book... I was disinterested immediately but hoped it would get better. My son was not buying into this ""story"" either. Truth is, the book is not a story and they should not call it a story book. It is merely a slightly enhanced instruction manual with some narrative. My son is very into the magic of Christmas and frequently declares that he loves Santa and wants to visit the North Pole. This story however fails to bring the Elf to life even with the ""magic"" he claims to have. I decided to put the Elf perched on a plant for my son to find the next day in hopes he might get excited upon seeing him- epic fail. He did not notice him but managed to notice a picture frame out of place. Final verdict: the Elf on Shelf really is just a lifeless stuffed toy void of any magical super powers. Pretty sure this only works on children easily manipulated and extremely gullible. Save your $30 on real Christmas books that will truly bring the spirit and magic of Christmas alive by delivering something children can think about and discuss with you.",1.0
"Here's a test of how empty and meaningless your life really is.

You can either lead a productive life during the holidays, wrapping up things at work, helping the poor, and a host of other things that actually are in the spirit of the season.

Or you can buy an elf and, while the kids are sleeping, have it make messes around the house. Messes that you will have to clean up.

Seriously? Who dreams up this nonsense? More importantly, what idiot would actually look at this on Amazon or the toy store and say, ""Oh, this sounds like a good idea because I don't have enough to do as it is!""

I mean, isn't the glittering mound of presents beneath the tree enough? I mean if you really want to build anticipation for Christmas morning, why not buy a freaking Advent calendar instead?

So if you are having a hard time filling up your day as it is with manicures, tennis lessons, and your book club's in-depth discussions of Fifty Shades Of Gray, then knock yourself out. But rather than this incredible make-work book, why not use your bottomless reserves of energy to hie thyself down to a soup kitchen or start a toy drive for underprivileged children?

"I had purchased this little toy after a friend at work had recommended it to me. It sounded like a cute little game that would build up the kitty's anticipation for Christmas. A simple game where the parent hides the elf around the house and the kid looks for it in the morning. The legend is that the elf spies on the kid, and then reports back to Santa every night. Not only did it sound fun, but it was one more way to black mail the little turds into being good around the holidays. Well worth the price of 24 bucks...or so I thought.

Well, things started out as you could expect. I would come home in the evening and tell the kids to grab me a beer while I would sit down to watch TV. They would ignore me, an act that usually resulted with me yelling, and throwing my shoes at them, but with the magic of Christmas in the air, and Pedro on the shelf (the name given to our elf by the kids) my frosty malted beverage would find its way to my hand within a minute. Just when I was really starting to like the novelty (although I was still a little piffed as to why our version turned out to be a Puerto Rican elf), things took a turn for the worse.

It started when my daughter asked me one night why the elf liked to spy on her. I told her that it was because he would let Santa know whenever she was naughty. She asked what that meant, and I proceeded to explain to her that it meant that he would basically rat her out whenever she did something bad, like wet the bed. Well as luck would have it, that very night she had a little ""accident"", and because she was afraid that the elf would tell on her, she decided to hide the soiled sheet under her bed. Well about a week later the whole room wreaked of urine and tears. That was strike one for the elf.

The second strike came one morning when the kiddos were looking for the sneaky little guy. I had hid it
The night before, but by this time I had a little game of my own going on. See, I would get all crazy on wine and pain killers whenever I would hide it, that way it was a game for me to find it in the morning myself! A little way to bring some holiday magic for myself as well. Anyway, after about an hour and a half the elf was still MIA, and I had lost interest in ever finding the little SOB again. As many will agree, children are much more persistent than adults when it comes to these things, so they were still going strong trying to find the little man. It finally got to the point where I couldn't take it any longer and I howled out that Christmas was make believe, Santa was fake, the elf was a hoax, and there was no Jesus. Well they all start crying, and only stopped when they found the elf five minutes later. I had placed it in a provocative position with one of the dogs squeaky toys. I had to answer a lot of questions about the birds and the bees for the next several hours. About the least desirable thing to do when your nursing one heck of a hangover, I'll tell you that much. They were finally satisfied that old Pedro probably had a little too much tequila the night before, and had decided to find himself an unclean lady of the night. Strike two.

The third and final strike occurred when they decided to play elf on the shelf one day after school. My eldest was going to play the part of the elf, while the youngest of my brood was going to play herself (not creative in the least but what do you expect from a kid that hides her urine soaked sheets under the bed). Well, while the old one was looking for a good hiding spot, he ended up coming across my stash of Asian fetish porn. Apparently he found something he liked because I find him in the closet all the time looking at the magazines. Sick little pervert. Needless to say that we won't be carrying on this tradition because letting this elf into our home has done nothing but corrupt and taint my kids. Unless you want to ruin Christmas for the foreseeable future, stay away from this one.",1.0
"OK, I think kids have enough pressure from the world without having a fake elf sitting around watching them. I totally disagree with this concept. If you want children to enjoy life, stop with the judging threats and just teach them to be happy and to expect to make mistakes from time to time. That's how we learn what's important in life and what is not....(a ""not"" exmple would be like not planting fake elves around the house to tattle on kids being kids...)",1.0
"The worst thing, as the buyer, of this product is how ridiculously cheap this product is made.
For the price ($30-$40), this has one of the poorest made stuffed animals I have ever seen.  I expect more from a McDonalds happy meal.

The story is fine, and unfortunately, the kids love their morning routine of finding where their elf has moved.
The kids like the story, I get sick of moving it every night (or forgetting to move it each night), but bottom line, they are taking advantage of consumers with a hugely overpriced piece of china junk.

Don't waste your time and money.",1.0
"My wife had me running around looking for one of these after getting a rave review from a friend of hers.  I was sorely disappointed.  The premise is kind of cute, but the story is fairly mediocre, the elf looks cheesy and doesn't sit up by itself (my wife always has to lean it on something). If it had cost $10 I might not feel so ripped off, but unfortunately I bought it for the ridiculous price of $30.

But I think I'm most uncomfortable about the premise of lying to my child.  It's not that I expect it will cause any trauma or anything, I'd just prefer not to do it.  If this is not an issue for you, I'd recommend buying a much cooler/sweeter/prettier Christmas-themed character or stuffed animal for $5 somewhere, and spinning your own (probably better) story.  The storybook is completely unnecessary and just lays out the premise without providing much in the way of reading entertainment.",1.0
"I was unsure of this concept from the get-go and didn't think much of the looks of the actual elf but, because it appears to be so popular, I thought perhaps my misgivings were generational.  However, when I presented it to the party for whom it was a gift, they found the ""elf"" tself to be rather freakish, the book to be thoroughly boring, its graphics unappealing and the whole concept not something they wanted to introduce into their positive family dynamic.  We actually decided we could come up with a far better concept on our own but do not like the idea of a ""spy"" nor of affirming the necessity of a ruse in order to have your children behave.  All in all, we got a good laugh at the expense of this goofy-looking elf but found the whole premise not to our liking.  Ebay has a new item up for sale!",1.0
"This book is the creepiest thing I have ever seen, oh and the elf is super creepy as well!  I can't believe kids run around at christmas time thinking that this elf is going to head back to the north pole and tell santa if they are naughty or nice.  Given the political climate about wiretaps, TSA, big brother it may actually be good that kids believe they are spied on day in and day out at christmas.  Instead of a little elf we should all get the adult version-- Dick Cheney as a tiny doll who will report to the government if you have been bad or good.
But really, this book has a very negative, creepy vibe.  I really am shocked that people like it!",1.0
"I agree with the posting that dared to criticize this ""tradition"" and disagree with the posting that plans to ""pray for"" the misguided grinch who finds this elf ""creepy"".  I wonder what he is praying for?  That this parent will be enlightened to succumb to mass merchandizing?  Or that the ""terrible wrong in their lives"" will go away?  Or that this family will go to church more so that they will better understand the scriptural account of Santa and elves?  What do children make of all the ""traditions"" that marketing executives have created to enhance the meaning of our holydays?  How scary is it that most children swallow it all and become obedient clones of their parents.  I'd rather see parents concentrating on the substance of the season rather than the trite (and often trashy) appearances of it.",1.0
"Yes, children, there is a tiny being spying on you at all times... Where is it? BEHIND YOU! No, OVER THERE! Under your bed?

"I bought this book and elf doll set for my grandson.  Neither my daughter-in-law (who is an elementary school teacher) nor my grandson liked it.  When I visited them and read the book and saw the ""elf"" I was also extremely disappointed in the set.  The story was pretty lame and I felt very ripped off considering the high price that I paid for it.  Elaborate packaging and PR for a very substandard product.  I do not recommend this at all!",1.0
"We just received Elf on a shelf as a gift, I had heard of it but did not know what it was.
I read the book with my daughter and find it creepy and very negative. I immediately told her she could hold the elf and he was just fun and we would play hide and seek with him in the mornings.
I don't like the idea of scaring her into behaving because this creepy little elf is going to run off and tell Santa what she did all day. I wish I had read the reviews before opening this or even read the book myself first as I would have put it away immediately. Luckily she is only 2.5 and was too busy playing with the elf to pay close attention when I was reading the book.
I found something called the Magic Elf Shoe on another review and it seems much more positive and fun.

As someone who received this as a gift I would agree to speak with parents first as this is not for everyone.",1.0
"At the recommendation of other parents and the positive reviews on amazon, I bought the Elf on the Shelf box set. I was genuinely excited to play this game with my 4-year-old son, who is totally into the Santa concept this year.

Before showing it to him (thank goodness) I read the book and then promptly returned the box set. Besides the fact that the toy itself was kind of cheap looking, I was deeply troubled by the strong threatening consumerism/materialistic messaging ""be good or you won't get what you want for Christmas"" and that Santa won't come unless you get good reports from the elf, as presented in the book. The messaging is strongly judgmental and focused on good and bad, concepts that are important to discuss, but I don't believe in this hazy context of threats and ultimatums, as the book presents. As one commenter noted, it's creepily Orwellian.

I know there are other ways to discipline and control behavior than to threaten doom and gloom on the most exciting day of the year for many little kids. Why not focus on the positive aspects of Christmas, rather than instilling anxiety? I mean really, if your kid is bad, are you not going to give him/her the present he/she wanted anyway, that you already bought? Just some food for thought.

I realize a lot of people enjoy EOTS; to each his/her own. Like some other reviews here, I recommend asking the parents before giving this as a gift, since it does involve parenting philosophies. There are other options to Elf on the Shelf.

I went to the Hallmark store and was delighted to find Everett the Elf, a much more positive and open ended elf-centric holiday toy/game. This elf lost his shoe while scouting chimney sizes for Santa. In the accompanying story, there is no mention of good or bad behavior. Every day I put a little surprise in the magic shoe for my son. One day it was a couple of magic chocolate coins, the next day, Everett brought news that we were going to the grandparents' house to decorate their Christmas tree. Much more fun for all than repeating the threats of ""the elf is watching and reporting to Santa!""",1.0
"I was very disappointed with this product.  The premise was very cute, however, the story was an issue for me.  I am not a fan of ever telling a child that he or she is bad which this book does.  I teach my children that attitudes, behaviors, words, actions etc can be bad but people are not bad.  I also was not crazy about promoting the commercialism of Christmas which this story does.  Between labeling children as ""good or bad"" and telling children that if they are ""good"" Santa will bring them whatever they want doesn't support my values.  If I had read the story before giving it to my child, I never would have given it to him.  Lucky for me he had zero interest in the story or searching for the elf each morning, so I promptly resold the entire kit.  Perhaps a rewrite of this book to reflect current day values and terminology is in order!  I plan to focus on the true meaning of Christmas.",1.0
"I have updated my review to perhaps provide information to those of you who may be on the fence.

My five year old daughter received this as a gift.  When she first heard the story she asked questions such as ""Does the elf have batteries?"" and ""It's not real, is it?"" and commented that it doesn't look friendly.  We visited the website and she liked the animation; we had fun playing a few of the games together.  Ultimately, though, she was not interested in participating in the tradition, and after learning about it myself I am glad she didn't find it appealing.

I have seen posts where some people purchase the elf but decide not to use the elf to report to Santa every day, but rather to simply be a reminder to make good choices. For those of you that this idea appeals to, I was reading about another product, Elf Magic...you might check into that...people say it looks friendlier.

There are many blogs and reviews out there...many more that are positive than negative. Many folks say that the elf works to help improve your child's behavior during this month, that as parents we need all the help we can get, and/or that kids enjoy looking for the elf each morning. I have also read many reviews where childrens' first instinct is to be scared and afraid of the elf, and that if you are providing good direction as parents, the elf is not needed and many other Christmas traditions are preferred.

For those of you on the fence, I recommend that you read the story yourself before deciding if it's right for your home. I would also recommend that if you give this as a gift, ask the parents if it's ok first so that the parents have the chance to learn more before sharing it with their children.",1.0
Just to let everyone know I much prefer Christopher PopinKins.  He is cute and the story is well thought out.,1.0
"So, I bought this adorable elf, whom my three precious children named ""Buttface"" last year at Christmas time.  Before Buttface arrived in our home I was at my wits end.  My children would write on the walls with markers, crayons and even oil based paints.  They would swing from the light fixture above our dining room table until it finally was pulled out of the ceiling.  We had been dining by candlelight even since until Joey decided to light little Jimmy's hair on fire one night as they fought over who got the red fork at dinner.  We couldn't even have a Christmas tree because Jack would try and climb it, or we would catch Jimmy swinging at it's trunk with his Boy Scouts ax.  I didn't blame the dear child of course, he was merely using his vivid imagination to play a game of ""Lumberjack"".  Instead we would have the Christmas Shoe Box for Santa to put the presents in.  I don't care what anyone says, it was just as festive as any old tree.  Eventually though I realized that my children were not behaving in a socially acceptable way when the FBI showed up at my door because the boys had called in a bomb threat to get out of a spelling test at school.  Terribly upset, I consulted my pediatrician and we both agreed that my children's behavioral issues were no fault of my own and that the ONLY solution to my discipline problems was ""The Elf on The Shelf"".

I brought Buttface out of his box the day after Thanksgiving.  For the entire month of December Jimmy, Joey and Jack were perfect angels.  Cowering in abject fear over this tiny stuffed doll they behaved as well as the baby Jesus himself.  It did make for a few night time bed wetting accidents as they were afraid to get out of bed at night for fear Buttface would be lurking in the hallway.  Not once did they bite the dog, cut my hair while I slept or try to hotwire the car.  It was a new record in our home.  We actually got to have a tree that year and I thought my parenting troubles were over!!  Bless you Buttface!

However, on December 26th, giddy with all the loot Santa had bought, which was a lot since they had been so extra good with the help of Buttface, my children knew they were off the hook for the next 11 months!  They were back at it again, tipping over our refrigerator, trying to bathe the cat in the dishwasher and scamming old ladies out of their retirement by claiming to be princes from Nigeria in some email scam they had running.

So, in despair, I am asking that there be an elf of this nature to spy on my children and keep them on the straight and narrow year round!  I know it would make my life a whole lot easier to know that I had an inanimate object in my house that was keeping my children on the straight and narrow and could take over the parenting duties on a daily basis, not just at Christmas time.  Parenting is very hard work and we need all the help we can get.  If I don't have a toy such as this to teach my children right from wrong under the guise of spying on them and denying them presents if they behave badly, how will they ever learn??  Please, please, won't somebody think of the children!",1.0
What I ordered is not what I received. There was no book and the elf was a cheaply made stuffed toy that I would expect to sell for $6. Returning to seller.,1.0
"Yes my children loved this, but I thought it was creepy.  This sounds like a wonderful idea until you get sick of moving the stupid elf everynight.  One night you'll lie awake in bed and remember, damn it, I forgot to move the elf.  Then wait until the kids tell their other friends about ""their elf"" and their friends don't have an elf, and then they call your kid a liar.  Year after year until you can't take it anymore and you can't move the thing another 30 days another year and you finally tell them that you are the elf on the shelf and then your kids cry.  I'm not making this up.",1.0
"My mother bought this for my sons age 6 and 3, after I requested another book about Elves.  I was looking for a story about ""real"" magical elves that live in the forest and create a sense of wonder for children.  This book was written by a teacher whose job is to obviously find any way to make kids behave.  The ""songs"" and story are about behaving properly or else.....the elf will report to Santa and if you're ""bad"" no presents for you on Christmas morning!  There are examples of kids behaving badly throughout the book, no positive messages.  If you believe children are inherently bad and need to bribe them to behave you may enjoy this farce of a tradition.  I had my mother return this book.  I would never expose my kids to this teacher's school like behavior modification especially as we prepare for Christmas.  ""A Christmas Tradition?""  What a joke!

If you truly want your kids to behave, treat them with respect, or read Alfie Kohn's book ""Punished by Rewards"" to learn how this type of discipline really affects kids in the long run.",1.0
"We bought this for a new family tradition to start this year with our 5 yr old DD.And read the book to her and then let the elf appear the following morning. She didn't see the box or anything associated with it being a 'toy'.We thought this would be a lot of fun and a way to get her to make sure she was making the right choices at home.
We placed him on the fireplace on her stocking holder and it took her 2 nights to find him. Once she did we played like we didn't know what she was talking about. She kept telling us that she wanted to play with the toy elf on her stocking holder. We told her we didn't know what toy she was talking about. So we read the story again and I pointed out that he needed a name and maybe then we could see him too. She went through names and then didn't want to name the toy because that was silly. She wanted to take him down to sleep with him. I read the rules from the book over again to her and she still wasn't taking it seriously. She kept telling us that he was just a little toy elf and that she knew he wasn't real.
So much for having fun with this tradition. I hope tomorrow we can convince her that he is going back to report to Santa but I think that I wasted 30.00 on this dust collector.",1.0
"I work in a store that sells 'Elf on the Shelf'.
There is an accompanying video, which has a song:

""Elf on the Shelf is watching you,
what you say and what you do.
Elf on the Shelf is judging you,
each and every Christmas.""

Talk about accustoming a child to a moralistic police state! The video is filled with testimonials by children and adults, all of which sound just as canned and paid-off as the majority of those on Amazon.

Who would do this to their child? Only someone with severe control issues, who wishes their children to remain in a state of constant, paranoid pliancy. Big brother for the kiddos.
Do the little ones a favor, and treat them like full human beings with the capacity to learn a balanced approach to right and wrong through trial and error. Not like pets that need to disciplined through fear. They'll grow up to be better people.

(Not to mention, if you have to do this to someone-- I'm assuming you're a sadistic jerk-- then at least spring for a nicer looking elf, and not a cheap piece of plastic like this one).",1.0

Have you ever looked after a sick animal or bird. (Yes/No question. Does not encourage further conversation.)  2, What do you do if it is hard to go to sleep?  3. What do you find difficult to speak to adults about? 4. Do you have a nickname? Do you like it? (again, Yes/No questions) 5. What is the most important difference between boys and girls? (REALLY?! Ask this to a kid?!)  6. Which smell do you like?  7. Do you have chores and do you do them without being reminded? (Yes/No.)  8. Your favorite song? (poor question grammar!) 9. The first song you learned to sing? (Poor question grammar!)  10. Work and Play. What do you think is the difference?
11. Which do you get more of, praise or criticism?  For this game: Criticism.

It is the ""monopoly of wargames""... meaning that it's slow, bores people halfway through, and doesn't have enough variety to hold the incredibly long play.  There are always six teams, (if you play with only two people, you still need to have six teams, one person just plays multiple teams) so it takes a while to have your turn come around, with most of the game being waiting for tiny effects.  It is also very poorly balanced for a game, with some people having twice as many cards as other people, and once you run out of cards... you can't do anything anymore.  It also has an annoying ""quiddich"" game playing style... you can collect as many victory points as you want, and some players have this as their sole function, but it won't matter because the team that wins will be the team that captures the golden snitch - something that one team can do vastly easier than the other due to the poor balancing issues. (if you capture two enemy capitols you win the game, and geography dictates that the allies can do this easily, with two enemy capitals right next to each other, while the axis has to cross continents in order to capture a second capitol.  The allies can also just wait out the axis, since two of their three armies have twice as many cards as all their enemies).

"I thought this would be good.  A Scrabble game where the letters locked in place, so you wouldn't accidentally bump them out of place or scatter when you move the board.  Boy was I disappointed.  Not only are the tiles hard to get into place, they are easily knocked out of their squares, and bumping the board is just as catastrophic as ever.  Maybe worse

The one good thing is that the backs of the tiles are not flat, so you can't mistake the back for a blank, but that's small consolation for a board that is much more difficult to play than the standard.",1.0

Please put this product back on alibaba.com with other fake goods.",1.0

"Well my board came with a misprint. On the bottom where it should be triple letter score it has it written as a triple word score. So now my board has an extra triple word score.. Bummer. Also, the game board is cheap and it is not tile lock at all. There are just little pegs that somewhat keep the tiles in place, but most certainly do not lock. The face of the board is just a sticker put on top of plastic. I like the fact that the board is smaller than a normal scrabble board but some may not. Regretting purchase, but at least I can play Scrabble (kind of).

Cheaply Made

"I already own the deluxe board that spins and a travel board that folds up.  I asked for this for a gift because I thought ""Tile Lock"" meant the tiles stayed in place when you moved it around.

If you are looking for a smaller board, I recommend the basic travel size that folds up, it's much more convenient.",1.0

"I'm a Backer from the Kickstarter currently working through trying get this ripoff refunded.

Pro:  It's Robotech

Con: It's Palladium Books

It's made as el cheapo as possible with all possible quality shaved to save pennies.

The minis are not ""mouth watering"" nor ""high quality"", they are ABS (normally cut in 1-3 pieces for minis this size) plastic hacked into 12+ pieces on the best design and 20+ on the Valks...on figures 1.5-2"" tall!

The sculpt cuts are extremely badly done (from using the wrong...but cheap...manufacturing process) and require lots of extra time on the part of the builder to repair the highly visible seams set in the worst places.

The flight stands, instead of being standard acrylic, are opaque ABS plastic that all attach at the same place on the minis, so that any ""flying"" minis look like they have lost bowel control.

Neutral/Haven't Covered:  The rules appear to have issues, but I haven't even bothered to read them yet.  Why?

 I've got stacks of miniatures armies on my shelves made by different people at different times for different games.  Even the worst designed of any of the minis in those armies would be easier to assemble & paint with more posability and options that this dreck from Palladium.  This game went from most anticipated to least likely to ever play in the local stores.",1.0
"Mediocre game rules, lousy miniatures.  You'd be far better off with BattleTech, CAV or a half-dozen other mecha miniatures games.  Building the miniatures is not for the faint of heart with tiny, unnecessary parts, gaps and lack of interesting poses.  Company support has been dismal to non-existent; you won't be able to play the campaign listed in the core book because we are still waiting on pieces to be released (2 years later) for the game.",1.0
"As a member of the Kickstarter, I was appalled by the poor quality and corner-cutting short-cuts this game took.  The book is poorly organized with vital information seemingly not present (the required information is on a set of cards that comes with the game, not included in the rule book).  It is overly complex for a war-game, much like the miniatures.  The rules waffle between too complex and too simple as if the original rules were simply thrown out and re-written by someone who has never played a war-game, only out-dated RPGs.

I strongly recommend you look elsewhere for an entertaining game.

For those BattleTech players looking for unseen 'Mechs, don't bother.  The Veritechs are simply too large to be Stingers and Wasps.  If the parts for a Super or Armored Valkyrie were in the game, they would make good Phoenix Hawks and Crusaders, but, those parts are ""included"" in the endlessly-delayed farce that is Wave 2.

Don't bother giving Palladium Books your money for this pile of garbage.

Edit:  This company, Palladium Books, currently holds an ""F"" rating from the BBB (http://www.bbb.org/detroit/business-reviews/books-new/palladium-books-inc-in-westland-mi-13022151).  Make of that, what you will.",1.0
"The game says ""fast and easy game play"" but that's after you spend 3 months putting together microscopic miniatures that are impossible to properly assemble.
These are single pose models that lack the quality of any modern company. I supported the efforts to make this game, but the origonal picth was for pre-painted single piece minis like DnD mins. sadly we are given a 1/285 scale that is only good for the first era, and will make the rest of the series unplayable. the Logan will be less than an centimeter tall.

"After a decade of pre-painted precise miniatures available for D&D, X Wing, Wings of Glory, etc. we are treated to poor quality model sprues. A game based on a TV show that you need to be 40+ to remember watching, and they offer over priced tiny models. I no long have the time to make this many miniatures to play the game. The ones we tried to build ... some pieces are too small to pick up without tweezers, round pieces for square holes, seam lines running through almost every major piece, no identification of parts on the sprues, decals the size of a felt tip pen made period ... the Zentradi pods packs of three that come with four of one type of leg and two of the other ... terrible positioning of the Veritech battleoid legs ...

I am saving you from reading the small print on the box. If you are a modeler and love putting together Warhammer miniatures, you will love it. If you are too busy working to spend hundreds of hours fighting poor model designs or might have older eyes and hands than when you last saw the show ... avoid this. Go buy X Wing, Wings of Glory or some other table top war game, where the miniatures are finished and ready to play out of the box. The only thing you get when opening the box is frustration and hours of building badly designed models.",1.0
"Tactical miniature games have some simple requirements.

* decent rule set
* easy to assemble miniatures
* if not easy, customizable minis
* quality materials.

This game fails on every mark. The rule set has units roll a single D6 and a 1 always misses and a 6 always hits. So 1/3 times, it is pure luck for what happens. The units use true line of sight which means modeling your units closer to the ground gives them better cover.  Not that that will be easy as I explain below.

The models themselves are about 10 pieces more than needed with the seams in flat armor spots, leaving horrible lines.  Of you are lucky you will not snap the super thin antennas and cannons on some of the models.  Good luck transporting them to a game, though. They'll be broken fairly quickly from that.

On top of that, they don't even allow a range of poses, you can't easily change their poses. If you are great with knife, putty, and tweezers, you may be able to do some modeling. Maybe.

They were kind enough to include a color guide using hexidecimal codes for the colors. Of course since no paint manufacturer fire mini paints uses this, you can safely ignore that.

Overall, this thing is a complete failure as a miniature game and I feel bad for having opened it to check since I can't send it back now.",1.0

"This has to be worst thing I've ever purchased Amazon. I bought this for my one year olds birthday. It's supposed to be waterproof, it's not. After two uses it is now rusting and will not work. It was not caused by user error  when we put the batteries in it we made sure that it was put back together properly. Don't waste your money on this.",1.0
Have not put batteries in and tested yet but feels very cheap! Dont think its worth $15 for sure. I will be returning,1.0
"This toy is great when it works.  My granddaughter loves it.  But, I bought 3 of these and only 1 works.  The two that don't work had switch issues where you couldn't turn off the toy (for 1 of them) and the other would only work if you manually held down the switch.  Also, the 2 that don't work filled up with water and as a result, the wires are now corroded.  Its a shame because the 1 that does work is really fun for my granddaughter to watch as it changes colors...kind of like a light show.  I will never buy again though because of the other issues.  They are obviously very cheaply made.  ",1.0
Stopped working after just a few uses...,1.0
Lasted 2 days. My kids liked to submerge it which made it fill with water and batteries are now wet and corroding. There are 2 holes built into it so looks like it should be ok as long as not held under water.,1.0
It's very small and you only get one. Not worth 15 bucks. Sending back. Not even in a box. It was going to be a gift. Picture is very deceiving,1.0
"The single item arrives without any protective packing and it has a hole which let's the water in... In addition to the fact that this piece of plastic costs 15 a piece, and has no batteries.... It is a piece of crap!",1.0
"This toy was not waterproof. It filled with water on first use. Very disappointed, do not recommend. After looking closer, I realized many of the reviews for this item were not actually for this product, but some copied and pasted to boost ratings.",1.0
Don't waste your time and money. Broken switch. Poorly made.,1.0
"Please do not buy this for your child. Bought and it didn't work so took it apart and the wires inside were exposed and really hot. If it had been placed in the tub with child, it could have severely hurt the child. STAY AWAY",1.0
Arrived broken,1.0

Came cracked and collects water.,1.0
Just got it in today and was really looking forward to bath time tonight with my baby but it doesnt even work. Put brand new batteries in and all.,1.0
Not as advertised. It is tiny and collects water. Not good for the bath.,1.0
"Absolutely isn't waterproof. It now doesnt always turn on. I literally just got it. Perhaps I got a defective one, but just an FYI.",1.0
Water gets in the toy and can only be used a few times.,1.0
"I bought this to give as a gift, it doesnt even come in a box. Its extremely small. Im very disappointed I won't be giving this as a gift. I haven't even put in batteries to see if it works. Waste of money",1.0
piece of crap.  Got water inside and stopped working after one use.,1.0
"We received this as a gift, however, it allowed water in on the very first use.
With a battery, that is not safe at all.
I wouldn't recommend buying this for bath time.",1.0
Wasn't at all what I expected for a birthday gift for my grandson. Would not buy another for aure.,1.0
"I was so excited when I Received it but when I looked at it, I Received a broken one! Upset!",1.0

I bought this for my grand daughter's birthday. It arrived and has never worked!",1.0
Junk,1.0
I honestly don't even know what this is. It's nothing like the picture and looks so janky.,1.0
Lights up well for maybe 2 seconds then goes super dim. Definitely not as advertised.,1.0
Dont buy doesnt work !,1.0
I put the batteries in and it didn't work. Currently in the return process.,1.0
"Fake, doesn't work, extremely cheap & brittle plastic, was already cracked. Really small, takes AAA, but marked and advertised as taking AA.",1.0
It leaked during the first bath.,1.0
"If there was a -1star is what they would get. Water gens inside. Despite the package being loose inside the item was scratched and chipped. I carefully placed the batteries inside in hopes that it would all be as advertised but it just filled with water inside.
Waste of money.
What I don't understand is why this is Amazons choice and how they have do many positive reviews but after reading a few I realize some aren't even related to the item listed. Go check it out yourself.
FAKE REVIEWS!!!! Dont buy.",1.0
"the photo shows this as something much bigger than it is.  Doesn't even work 1/2 the time.  It is not worth getting for the price you are paying. If it was $3.00 - maybe, but $12.00 is really pushing the envelope.",1.0
"I am not sure where all these five star ratings came from, that led me to purchase they toy. One, it does not look waterproof at all, that being said I put batteries in and it does not work. The only other verified purchase in the comment section is from the other 1 star rating. Cheaply made and overpriced. I do most of my ordering on Amazon, but am finding an increased amount of sub-par products, and may be switching to a different online realtor if the issue persists. And to add insult to injury, apparently the item is not eligible for return.",1.0

Water immediately got inside the device near the battery compartment.  This is unsafe for children. All you see are the batteries. The photos in the advertisement are very misleading and cleverly conceal the fact that all you see are batteries.

I don't know where all the great reviews came from, possibly everyone in the small town in China where this is manufactured wrote a good review.",1.0
"2 of the monkeys aren't even finger puppets. They are sewed shut, no place for finger!",1.0
"Why don't ""finger puppets "" have a hole for your finger? They're just little dolls!!
Very disappointed.",1.0
Received item today and one of the monkeys has a rip in the material,1.0
"Another reviewer(Zambia)already explained that it was very poorly delineated how one is actually supposed to play; I would second, third, fourth and fifth that, as there were four of us trying valiantly to make it through the inconceivably poor instructions and we never did to our satisfaction. I am getting rid of the game after only one attempt (a whole year ago) as it has never been one we wanted to play again- it certainly doesn't measure up to the hopes of one who thoroughly loves the movie.",1.0
The directions are horrible... No idea how to play :(,1.0
This game is 2 complicated and hard to play.,1.0
"This game is about as mindless as it gets. With few exceptions, turns tend to churn out without player input and without fun. I tried it with a group of three, but the other two players had a hard time understanding how each turn was meant to play out. After just a few rounds, I realized that I could just play for the others rather than trying to explain the game since no real decisions were necessary!

I imagine that future versions of the game will simply include a button that, when pressed, will play a user's turn. For now, I have to manually perform this action.",1.0
"This game was ridiculously hard to learn, and I still don't understand how to play it.  My sister got this from a yard sale, and we're wondering if we're missing a part of the rules (we have a small booklet with a summary and a more in-depth book).  The rules are obscure, and don't give explanations for what some of the cards are for (for example, we still don't know what to do with the ""book"" card).  White and grey cards are supposed to allow different actions, but we couldn't find the description for that either.  We gave up once we got to Moria.  I personally don't understand how anyone can figure out these rules.",1.0
"Found this game at a Value Village for $2, seems like a good deal right?

Wrong, this game is not really a game, so much as it is interactively telling the story of Lord of the Rings.  No decisions feel important and the game forces you down the path to tell the story the way it was in the books.  If you fail at something you have to keep trying until the story works its way out, otherwise you lose.

Dumb game, ripped it apart and used the pieces for other stuff.",1.0
Well most of it is here and intact. Unfortunately missing a lot of the house cards so makes the game incomplete,1.0
This was a Christmas Gift for my brother-in-law so I do not know what it was about or how to play or if it has an educational value???,1.0
