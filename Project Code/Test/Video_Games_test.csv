"Choose your career which sets your money for the trip.  Then name how many and who will be traveling with you.  Before you leave town, you must go into town  choose wagons or Conestoga, animals and many supplies -watch your cash and your wagon weight!  On your journey you can talk with different people to make decisions about your next moves.  You also get to hunt, fish, & gather..Be careful of disease & rivers!",5.0
"It took a few hours to get this up and running on Windows 8 computer and Windows XP.  If you get an error go and download their patch.

[...]

Just the patch alone worked like a charm on Windows XP.  For Windows 8 I download the patch AND had to change the compatibility to WIndows ME.

Classic game that the kids learn so much from...worth it.",5.0
I oredered this for a daughter who is now 33 and she wanted to play the Oregon Trail that we had years ago...she and her fmily have had a blast with it..we laughed a lot as she would holler and squeal as she played the game.........so it has met all our expectations..,5.0
"Well I thought since this idem didn't have any reviews I would make on for it.

I got this game when I was somewhere around 8 1/2 Years old. I have played and beaten this game about 10 times. It's help kids learn about different types of plants which ones are safe to eat and which ones are deadly. You can geather, fish and hunt.

Graphics: The graphics are amazing very fine and sharp which doesn't happen with most games.

Sound: The sound if wonderful although it sometimes is a little slow, but other then that it's really good.

Pros: Help ppl learn about different plants, fish and wild game.
Is really fun to play and it never gets old.
Has really cool short movies that you can watch over and over again.

Cons: For some reason the rattle snakes always try to kill me.
Can sometimes be a little tricky but if you bye the right stuff you will be fine.
The disc got scratched up pretty easyly from just being in the Cd rom.

Overall it's a good game that is good for ages 6 and up.",5.0
"I got this to show my kids what I used to play in school.  The graphics are significantly better than I remember.  It's still the same decision making, problem solving, luck of the draw game it always was.  It's a fun way to share 'history' with the kids.  I use it to encourage empathy as they can see relatively quickly how their decisions directly impact others for good or bad.",5.0
Works great!,5.0

"Apparently this is a pared down version of the original, but I really enjoy playing it.  It works great on my desktop or laptop.  A fun and educational game!",5.0
"Though this game is older, I absolutely love it.  My nephew who is only 7 years old and is a big ""gamer"" really loved this game.  He also learned a great deal which is why I bought it.  Loads of fun! Seller was fast in shipping product. Will buy from them again!",5.0
Best game ever. And it came so quickly!,5.0
Looove this old game.  The 3rd generation loves it and the older ones in the family still can't help but get involved.  It's history class!!  It's fun!!,5.0

great game very fun!!!!!,5.0
"Great Game.  Although at first I could not get past the log in screen in the game.  I found a way by looking online, it was very hard to find though. So add this line to your systems host file - static3.cdn.ubi.com 87.248.207.150 - and it should connect.  Also be aware of uplay, they updated it once and the game wouldn't work.  There is a way around updates though just disconnect from the internet and start the game then when the log in screen comes up connect to the internet again and you should be good.  Hopefully, ubisoft doesn't read this and change the format cause I really love this game.",5.0
"great game, I love it and have played it since its arrived",5.0

"I picked this rating because, although this game is redundant in build, the scenarios do change. It is challenging in both multiplayer and single player. You get a world even every so often and only a limited time to do the event. You get mad experience points for it as well.

So if you like builder games that come with some serious challenges, unlike its predecessors, this game will keep you busy for hours and hours and hours. Once you start you keep pushing to get to that new level, that new tech, that new fleet of ships. Ubisoft did good by this one. Pick up a copy and if you want to play together? Just coment and we certainly can arrange that.",5.0
"I bought this game thinking it would be pretty cool and that i might play it for a  week or two and be done.  Boy was I wrong! From the moment I finally got the gamed Fired up (the other commentors on this are right, it takes forever and u are forced to create an account) I watched as it booted up I could tell right off the bat that ALOT of thought went into making this game. If you have ever played Sim city, then this game is a must try as you will easily navigate thru it and its multi layers. I have been playing htis now for a month straight, and I am STILL discovering layers of complexity in the game. There are a few things in the game that could used tweaked, but all in all this is a 5 star game.",5.0
I have played the old anno 1701 AND 1503.  this game looks great but is more complex than the previous versions of the game. I found a lot of things lacking such as the sources of power and an inability to store energy with batteries or regenertive fuel cells as buildings in the game need power. Trade is about the same. My main beef with this it requires an internet connection. Other than that it has wonderful artistry and graphics. It is the same as anno 1701 but set in a future world where global warmming as flood the land and resource scarcity has sent human kind to look to the deep ocean for valuable minerals. I recoment the deep ocean expansion or complete if you get this. I found the ai instructor a little corny but other than that the game has some real polish. I wrote my 2 cents worth on suggestions on anno 2070 wiki and you can read 3 pages on that for game ideas I had.,5.0
This is a very fun game single player is difficult but the multiplayer makes you feel like you lived a sheltered life.  It reminds me of first generation Sim City with awesome graphics.,5.0
"This game is not for everyone.  If you only enjoy constant fast paced FPS games, this is probably not for you.  But, if you've dabbled in Empire Earth, AOE, Age of Mythology, and enjoy these economy based warfare games, definitely give ANNO 2070 a shot.

There is a learning curve, particularly if you are a newcomer to the series.  Essentially, this game is about meeting the needs (food, drink, belongings, entertainment, community, etc.) of your citizens, which become increasingly demanding as they rise from the ranks of common workman to something equivalent of CEO.  With their progression brings higher taxes income, yielding a stronger economy capable of building and supporting an impressive military.  Warfare is not necessarily the focus, or even the majority of the fun, in this game, but it still gives the option for ship, submarine, and aerial combat, with several units of each type available.  You can even go nuclear.  It's pretty sweet.

There are three ""races"" of people.  It's a bit like Starcraft in that they can each build their own units, and have their own specific needs.  The first group is the ECOS - they are the liberal hippy tree huggers who care only about thee environment, and turn unhappy if the ecobalance becomes too polluted.  The 2nd group, the TYCOONS, are the seal clubbin' oil drillin' conservatives who care only about making money no matter the cost.  Finally, you have the TECHS, a faction only concerned with technological research.  The TECHS are featured moreso in the expansion (ANNO 2070: Deep Ocean), but are still important for development of ECO and TYCOON needs as they advance.  I highly recommend the expansion if you play this and find you like it - it adds so many new ways to develop your cities.

I love this game.  I've always been a fan of city builders, but this one (like ANNO 1404) has really drawn me in.  I've put in weeks worth of hours on it and am still playing.  The campaign missions are fun, but the real joy lies in a continuous game.  Once you are comfortable playing, you can spend literally hours on a hard continuous game with 3 AI players, a pirate base, and a warship hellbent on your destruction.  It is still a challenge even after playing for over a year.  I think a lot of what makes it fun is that no two games are ever played the same way.  There are different ways to power your city, different upgrades to utilize, different ways to destroy your opponents.

A quick note about DRM: It sucks that this game must be played with a constant internet connection.  There is a multi-player faction, but honestly I've never even tried it.  Single player is what I enjoy, and there's no reason to be online for that.  Still, I give it five stars, because the game itself warrants it IMO.",5.0
"This is a great real-time supply chain management game.  However, the play is novel and there is a steep learning curve.  Some reviewers have criticized the campaign for being too restrictive.  That is not a fair criticism.  The first 3/4 of the campaign is basically a tutorial.  The campaign holds your hand from objective to objective so that you can get a feel for how to succeed.

This game really eats up time.  1 hour is about the minimum amount you would want to spend per session.

If you like tinkering and optimizing and losing yourself in a complicated game, then you might really enjoy Anno 2070.

I think this game should really appeal to people with an inclination to programming who like developing and optimizing algorithms.",5.0
I cant stop playing my wife is going to through it out soon. It was worth the money to buy it.,5.0
Great game. Very complex and can get hard to handle with larger cities but i like the challenge. Interesting missions,5.0
Definitely one of the best products UbiSoft has released.  The game is very similar in its interface to its predecessor: Anno 1404 but its story line and the scope of the game is far more developed.  The player is able to vote in world council initiatives that directly affect in-game play as well as participate in random missions that earn the player career points enhancing the player's game play.,5.0
"Loved playing Dirt 2 and I thought the graphics were good.  Purchased Dirt 3 as an addition to the other...and the graphics are absolutely ""Gorgeous""  If you liked Dirt or Dirt 2...you are going to love Dirt 3.  The game was easier to configure with my Logitech wireless rumblepad...and with my EVGA GTX 580, and all detail set to full on graphics at 1920 x 1080 I get over 100 fps.  The game looks good, plays well and is a blast!",5.0
"I'm not quite finished with the game's DiRT Tour mode, but I believe I've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer.  And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.

At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.

Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.  It's the best DiRT so far.",5.0
lot of people don't like RALLY because they already tried gran turismo game. to tell you the truth gran turismo RALLY physic is just boring boring boring. gran turismo only good for racing simulation but RALLY part is suck!!!!  dirt 2 amazed me how much fun it was and now dirt 3 with 3 time more race tracks than dirt 2.  MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!,5.0
"This is a must have for any gamer. Codemasters really hit a home run on this one. I would like to see F1 2011 be this good using the ego engine 2.0 and the physics model in this game is right on the money. This game is the reason everyone should buy the best graphics card they can afford. I am using a nvidia 460 overclocked, and I have on order a 590. I want to run this game with everything on highest level. I swear to you that even with the 460 + , the graphics are very realistic and I really enjoy racing at ground level. This game makes Codemasters the king of graphics realism. BUY THIS GAME !!!!!

December 6, 2011  I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you. First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3. Thank God for codemasters and I can hardly wait for GRID 2 in the summer.",5.0
the game is amazing period. I created this review to counter the bad reviews given to the game by others.,5.0

i collect racing games so had to add this to my collection

"So much fun, so little time. Runs great on Win8, unlike sooooo many of the other great racing games. When buying Dirt3 be sure NOT to buy off steam or you miss out on all the extras from the complete edition on DVD. (You can get the extras on steam, but it costs more).",5.0
I bought this game for my husband about 2 years ago. He likes it because the graphics and the control is very realistic.,5.0

"Super fun game, graphics are fantastic! To play at highest settings including 4x anti-aliasing,(at playable frame-rate of 30+)  I would recommend: Minimum Specs- i3 & gtx 650 ti (2gb).",5.0
"Yeah, well, the interface on D2 is way more immersive, but D3 gives you many more and way cooler cars. The problem is you gotta pay for some of them. Now that ain't right. Anyway, this is a furiouse game with lots of eye candy and exciting race action (wow, I sound like a commercial.) You don't want to skip buying the xtra cars cuz they're way fine, but jeez man, that's more moola. So the camera work is still weak. Like why can't the playback just playback a good TV view. You miss a lot of action cuz you're getting a close up of a wheel spinning -- big deal (same with the playback on D2.) I'd buy it if I were you, but then there's no one like you... Right?",5.0
"Perfect for me. I used to do a lot of sim racing but it has been a while. This thing lets me gradually shed assisted driving. Easy to tune for good challenges, new skills and constant fun. I might even put another DVD drive into my computer so DiRt3 is always ready to go.",5.0
I particularly like the stadium trucks.  Fun game.  My wife likes it too.  I use a 28 dollar steering wheel and pedal set.,5.0
I have been a fan of Dirt 3 ever since Dirt 2; (my fav). In Dirt 2 I have 100% of the game completed & on level 73. I plan to do the same with the 3rd game. Racing in snow is interesting. the ONLY thing I'll miss in Dirt 3 is my favorite car from Dirt 2; the Nissan 350z,5.0
"Amazing graphics, Always better with a Wheel & pedals!

Did not like the MSN connection option or the comparisons

between other fictious drivers",5.0
"This is probably the best racing game out there at this moment. Nov. 2012. It's got a lot of fun party modes, and multiplayer modes, along with some very realistic driving. But to get the full experience get yourself a good steering wheel. Im not talking about those cheap $50 wheels that only turn half way. I got myself the Logitech GT wheel for PS3 and for PC's and it's amazing!",5.0
"I play this game with friends via LAN. It works well, and is a lot of fun to race. I like the fact it's not super serious, and the tracks are varied. It is fun to race in the snow, or on gravel, during rain, sunshine, snow, or night.

I've played some of the single player campaign, but just prefer to play it via LAN with friends. It is more fun to me, to race against people I know than computer controlled cars. Especially as the computer controlled cars don't always seem to realize that you're right beside them, and will hit you, causing you to spin out, wreck, or generally have problems.

One of the more annoying things about this game is that you have to sign up for Microsoft Live, or something like that. You get a predetermined name, which is generally nonsense. And every time you want to play this game, you have to sign into Live. The other complaint I have is that if you want more cars, you don't earn them by being good at the game. You buy them. It seems like every company is going for purchasable downloadable content route.",5.0
"can somebody tell me how to set this game on the pc with the logitech G27? i connected everything very well but still the game failed to play, i mean the car couldn't move anywhere",5.0
"Muy buena sensacin de realidad, visual y en el volante. Recomendadsimo para cualquier fan de los Rallys y de los juegos de conduccin. En orden histrico tengo GRID, F1 2010 y DIRT 3 de Codemasters, y se nota en cada nuevo juego un avance real en el concepto, en lo parecido a conducir realmente.",5.0
"I'm not sure why Codemasters didn't release the PC DVD in retail stores in the U.S., but the game is very fun. I could have ordered the PC DVD from a couple of places for $49.99, but the seller at Amazon had it at a great price. I really like racing games and this is a different format for me, because I usually choose road racing games. The in game trailers for this game, and the option to play Gymkhana in a Rally game is great.",5.0
"I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.
I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends...
Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.

As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.

Pros:
- Amazing graphics
- Amazing physics
- Challenging but entertaining races

Cons:
- Gymkhana
- Interface

What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.
I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!
Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.

Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.

Conclusion:
As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.
If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!
In spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.",5.0
"This game is by far the best driving game I've playing great graphics, incredible handling and relistic damage. The online play was also pretty good for me. Only issues I had were really minor, I prefer dirt 2 user interface, and dirt had a better soundtrack, but those are just personal preferences and not really relevant to the review. The replay and upload feature is very cool as well. I'm Jason and I drive Manual. Definitely worth the buy.

"Seriously, the game is amazing fun. It has a learning curve, and I recommend you have a really good system to make the framerate playable (I have a Pentium D 3.0, 3.5GB RAM, Radeon 4650 and I have to have it almost set to ""Ultra Low""), but I have already convinced others to buy this.

Favorite feature: YouTube publishing right from the game. Awesome.",5.0
"Installed the game. Then clicked to launch/start the game. An error message appeared saying game cannot start because ""xlive.dll file is missing"". They should have displayed a message advising the user to install ""Games for Windows Live"" program first (a free download from Microsoft), but instead they just give you an error message and leave you to figure it out on your own. Small print on the game box mentions Games for Windows Live being needed to activate your online profile and multiplayer gameplay but does NOT make clear you may need this just to get the game started!
So, installed Games for Windows Live and launched Dirt 3 for the second time. This time it says game update needed to proceed otherwise it will sign you out. Clicked OK/Proceed to get the game update. This took almost 30 to 40 minutes on my 12Mbps high-speed internet connection just to download the game update. Then you go through a fairly quick install of the game update.
Launched the game for the third time and they ask you to create Windows Live profile for online stuff then create a player name, etc.

"Amazing value. I cannot believe this set is available for this price. Everything from the packaging to the quality of the paper is stellar.  This set feels like it was put together with care in mind. Also worth noting is the fact that the Ocarina of Time guide can only be found in this set.

"This collection includes six hardcover guided guidebooks, these are reproductions of the same individual guides Prima released over the past. The only problems are some people report that the ones they received were in poor quality such as upside-down covers, damaged covers and pages, sloppy gluing, but I think if you buy directly through Amazon or Amazon fulfilled sellers then you're less likely to get a bad set.

One drawback is none of the goodies that came with these guides are in this collection, kind of a bummer really. Another drawback is the Twilight Princess guide isn't the 2008 re-release but instead the original 2007 release. A third drawback is that yes they are Prima guides and we all know how much they can leave out information. On the plus side the bookmark looks nice, the box is made of sturdy cardboard, and the Skyward Sword guide is a re-release with additional information added.

So for the Zelda fans this collection is worth owning, I love mine and will use it well.",5.0

"OMG! Talk about having a nerdgasm! These books are so worth the money! Beautifully created! The ""chest"" is just awesome and the gold bookmark and gilded edges of the books are so shiny that I can see my reflection in them and I know that I couldn't do that when I bought some of the others when they came out with the games. Oh, and the best part? These books are bigger than the copies I bought when the games came out!!
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!",5.0
"Arrived quickly and in perfect condition, very happy with how it all looks and I have to say it's definitely worth buying.",5.0
Amazing. Does kinda suck that it didn't come with the extras that it would have came with the books individually but oh well. And I'm not sure why people are complaining about the shipping if the books. Mine came in super secured.,5.0

"If you are a Legend of Zelda fan this is a great set for a collector. These guides are hard to find by themselves now, but with this pack you get guides to some of the most popular games in the series. The game guides also come with online codes so you can use a computer or mobile device to look up hints easily.",5.0
So glad I got this on sale! The books are beautiful! Everything was packed perfectly. Thank you!,5.0
Shipped great and love them!,5.0
"Let me start by saying this is the best product I've ever purchased. Only $107.89 for 6 amazing great quality guides in a well built chest and a golden bookmark. These are top notch guides, well written, and well put together!
HEADS UP: There's only 50,000 copies being released, and my number according to the certificate is around 49,400. That's how many they've sold in just over a year. If you want this, don't hesitate.
Also, these guides are going for so much seperately! I've seen used copies go for more than this set alone! Imagine in 5 years.... These will be well worth more than you pay right now.",5.0
Great,5.0
"what a great product!!! tremendous quality in the hardcover guides and comes with a really cool gold plated book mark for keeping your place in the guides and a certificate of authenticity.  have just recently got into collecting and this product really blew me away, awesome quality and quantity for the price and i am not easily impressed, worth every penny.  i only wish it had guides for the NES and SNES zelda games instead of spirit tracks and phantom hourglass",5.0

Awesome deal! My boyfriend loved it.,5.0
"There are collectors who have everything. Then there are poor collectors who window-shop online and cry over how much they would love to have these really pricy additions. I gal into the second category. Fortunately< I have been blessed with a wonderful boyfriend who purchased this set for me for this Christmas, and I kid you not, viewer, I cried. I am 18 years old, pursuing a degree in college and I cried over how beautiful this present is. I love these guides. I used to own a wind waker guide back when it was just a gamecube game and I remember that if I couldn't play the actual game, I would sit and read the guide. These are so much better. They clearly i indicate what you are pursuing in each side quest and quite honestly, I think they're worth every penny. My only complaint is that Majora's Mask, as revered as it is, is not a part of this box set. However, maybe with the release of Majora's Mask 3D, they'll release a second box set, including Majora's Mask, Legend of Zelda (Original), Adventures of Link, Link to the Past, Oracles, Link's Awakening, etc. :)",5.0
best idea to put all these books in a collectors case.,5.0

"Great Order. It has the guides that I need. Great Price, Gets down to every little detail in the game.",5.0
"This is an awesome set of deluxe The Legend of Zelda video game guides. The box it came in is just great and I'm so happy they took the time to add to some of the books. While I did have some of these books already, the new and thicker Skyward Sword guide is really top notch.

My only complaint is that the box comes full. I have other guides and Zelda books like the historia book that I can't cram inside it with the others, but that's ok. They need to sell the chest on it's own as I could fill another chest with the Zelda guides I already have.

If you're a big Zelda fan and love the hardcover deluxe guides that they release with each game, this is a great box set and totally worth it!",5.0
Great collectors addition.,5.0
"The quality in this collectors set is just outstanding. The box is a heavy duty cardboard that holds up to a decent amount of stress. All the books were we bounded and high quality. All in all, IT A MUST FOR ANY HARDCORE ZELDA FAN!!!!",5.0

i'm a collector of Zelda products and this is awesome! there isn't a thing about this product that i wish were different (aside from being free). The walkthroughs go into detail of the games and are in excellent quality. Worth every penny spent.,5.0
"I've always tried to collect game guides for all my favorite games. Have a bit of a collection of them honestly. Definitely a huge Zelda fan too! I saw this set online and just knew i had to have this! Not only do i have a game guide collection, but i have a separate collection just for Zelda! So this was literally the best of both worlds for me! The bookmark is very cool and the ""chest"" box is a nice storing unit for the books. The books are beautiful! The gold lining on the pages, and the cover of each book is different and gorgeous.  The letter of authenticity is just so exciting! LOVE LOVE LOVE this!

They need to make these for all the Zelda games!",5.0
I just got mine last night and I'm IN LOVE with them!! Absolutely gorgeous and such high quality. I haven't actually used them yet but I will very soon. Something else I love is that each book has designs specific to the game that they represent (like the OoT book has little gold Ocarinas and Shiek's harp in the corners on the front cover). I didn't pay full price for them since I got them during a sale but I certainly would pay  full price for them.,5.0
I love this set. It's the perfect gift for any Zelda fan!,5.0
Gorgeous box set full of the hardcover game books. It contains the most recent copies to go with all the newest Zelda games.,5.0
"This is a must have for a Zelda collector. Even if it just goes on a shelf to never be opened, it looks great! Some of the guides in it I never saw released (Twilight Princess) and I wonder how I missed them. Great buy for the just over $100 I paid. A lot of the guides by themselves are selling $40-50 ea.",5.0
"I'm not one to write a review, but I felt compelled to write one for this to help give people an idea of what to expect. I am an avid Zelda fan and a collector to a lesser extent. I have bought the hard cover collector's edition Prima Guide for Zelda as far back as Twilight Princess and gotten nearly every one since.

I had 4 of these books already, and 2 paperback books of the other 2 guides. So in a way I was buying a set of books I already had. Still has a collector and a fan, I could not pass it up and for me, I could not be happier I got this.

In reading some other reviews about this item, I hope to clarify a few things about this set.

1. First off, I will say that my original set did come with a damaged chest. I got a replacement from Amazon, so no biggie and I'm not going to ding a star off for that. It was just bad packaging.

2. The metal book mark is fantastic, and better than I expected. The chest is nice and having the ribbon inside to help pull out the first book is a nice touch. Note it's meant to just pull out ONE book at the back, which if you keep them in order should be Wind Waker HD.

3. As noted, this set does not come with the extra items such as cloth maps that the original individual books came with. Not a big deal to me, but it is what it is. What it does come with, and just that this set is a limited edition makes up for it to me.

4. I want to give a breakdown of these books and how they compare to the original individual ones I have, where applicable.

- The Phantom Hourglass Guide is identical to the original lone book.

- The Twilight Princess Guide IS The revised guide that apparently came out in 2007. I got my original when Twilight Princess came out and didn't even know till I read the other reviews on here that there even was a revised edition. The 16 or so new pages are mostly a greatly expanded and more detailed ""legendary checklist"" at the back of the book.

- Spirit Tracks: This one through me for a bit because the book in the set is about 1/4 an inch thicker than my original, but the contents and number of pages are identical so they must be using thicker paper. The only difference that I noticed is that the table of contents is the very last page of the book. I am honestly not sure if that is an error or intentional.

- Ocarina of Time 3D. One of the books exclusive to this set and never available as a hard cover on it's own. This is a very nice book and one of the reasons I wanted this book. In comparing in to my paper back version, the contents are the same but the page layouts are different here and there.

- Skyward Sword. I did not get this one originally in hard cover, which was available on it's own. But I have read and discovered it's a greatly changed book from the original. It say it's revised and expanded by over 100 pages, but in reading on Prima's website the making of this set, they go into detail about how this book was basically rewritten by a new author and has all new screen shots. It's much more than just expanded by 100 pages. This was my biggest surprise in this set, as I thought the Ocarina of Time book would be the only really unique book in this set, but it's really that one and this one.

- The Wind Waker HD. This book came out individually very recently so naturally the one in this set is identical to the stand alone.

And that is about it. Like a said, a very great set and I am thrilled to own it.",5.0
"This box is a must-have for any Zelda fan. Not only does it include 6 limited edition strategy guides with bonus content not available anywhere else, but it also comes with a beautiful golden etched bookmark and a certificate of authenticity with the limited number and message from the producer of the game. Each book ends up being about 20 dollars so the fact that it's all a limited release, the price is definitely worth it!

As a Zelda fan, I would definitely recommend fans to go out and spend the money because you'll be sorry if you don't! If you're not a Zelda fan, well now's the time to become one!",5.0
"The Legend of Zelda Box Set looks spectacular, awesome, masterpiece & magnificent . It's truly miracle, fantastic & unbelievable & incredible. The guide books inside are very handy & useful. I'm completely satisfied & accepted with the method & way David Hodgson authorized the Legend Of Zelda Full Box Set",5.0
"I'm a huge Zelda collector so this set was a must-buy. It's a bit of a bummer that none of the guides came with their cloth maps like in their original release, but that's a small complaint. The revised edition of Skyward Sword is a big improvement over the original, and the gold metal bookmark is a nice bonus. I'd definitely recommend this if you're a Zelda fan.",5.0
"First off, I want to say that everything about this set is gorgeous!  It all starts with the idea of now your own personal treasure chest to decorate your shelf with.  Once open, there are six hard bound strategy guides that span the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise.

1. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D (First time ever released)
2. The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks
3. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass
4. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD
5. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
6. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (Expanded by 100 pages from the original guide)

All of the books have gilded edges to give a gold sheen along each page.  Most of these guides are out of print and hard to find.  The guides are all the official Prima Games guides versions, which is a company dedicated to making video game strategy guide.  As a result, the content is undoubtedly top notch in every guide to help you find every secret and defeat every boss.

If you are a fan of the franchise, this is an absolutely awesome set to pick upl",5.0

"Great secrets for one who would seem them. Very good quality books, need another set with the rest of them!",5.0
"All the guides are the RECENT Zelda games to be Released or Re-Released
Maybe they will have anther set for the older games if they are re-made!
But for now these are just PERFECT!
Fully Colored, each one has it's own design and color through out the books!
it would have been nice if the book cover colors matched the games better.
Such as Ocarina Of Time's is purple....Why is it Purple? but it does have the original AND mirrored play though so that's good.
It's in the shadow Temple, Spirit Temple Order.
Twilight is a Nice Brown color, I can see why spirit tracks is Green.
I and my husband think Ocarina Of Time book and the Hour Glass book should have switched cover colors.

"This box set is a wonderful addition to any Legend of Zelda collection! This set includes 6 Prima Guides, a metal bookmark, a certificate of authenticity, and a magnetic-closure treasure chest. The Prima guides included are for the games: Ocarina of Time 3D, Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, Wind Waker HD, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. The guides speak for themselves, they walk you through all aspects of these games, giving you tips and help to complete the games. All of the books are high-quality hard cover, with gold-edged pages. I am a huge fan of the Legend of Zelda, and this box set was a perfect addition to my collection. I would recommend this box set to any fan of this franchise, plus the price on Amazon can't be beat!",5.0
"I was so glad when the released the guide revisions to some of the main Zelda games. Some I had, but they were paperback and falling apart from use and flipping through. These are really nice, have a nice way to keep them together, and will endue a lot.",5.0

I highly recommend getting this,5.0

"Came on time and was a great purchase. Perfect for any Legend of Zelda fan out there. Only downside is that it doesn't come with any special items if you would buy the collector's edition in stores, but still wonderful as it comes with the rare and unreleased collector's edition of Ocarina of Time 3D.",5.0

"If you're an avid Zelda collector, this is totally worth it! I am very pleased with the quality of the box and the game guides are beautifully printed. Love it!",5.0
"This is a very quality collection of these hardcover strategy guides. I already owned all of them except the Ocarina of Time 3d guide, so I don't mind not getting the other things that came with the originals. Also, I'm not sure why other reviews have complained about this, collector's editions are collector's editions for a reason. If you wanted the extras, you should buy the original version of the CE guide. The metal bookmark that comes with these guides looks beautiful though it had a couple very small blemishes on the surface of one side. Magnetic lid closes nicely. The only thing I could want more in this is if it made the sound from the games of obtaining an important item from a chest when you opened it. That would make this complete. Great product!",5.0
"I was a bit disappointed that Prima didn't redo all their Guides and include them in this set. Just because the games are old doesn't mean they are not loved and well played to this day. It frustrates me that I now have other Prima guides sitting outside this box not in the cool collector's covers that don't fit this theme at all.

I didn't take off for that though because I purchased this product knowing the older guides were not included so that wouldn't be fair. As far as what is included it is perfect!
The chest is sturdy and will last forever if you take care of it and is just an awesome touch.
The book covers are just so perfectly Zelda it is amazing.
The Gold leafed pages are just showing off a bit but Gold is a main part of the Zelda theme so it fits even if it is a bit gaudy.
The bookmark is epic and if it wasn't so big I would use it as an actual bookmark for everything I read I love it so much.
The signed certificate is a very nice feature for collectors as well even if it was signed using a machine (no way that poor guy signed 50,000 of these things).
The actual content of the guides is first rate. The are very complete, have wonderful pictures, and if you want to know how to get a specific item or sidequest or something it is in there.

Wonderful product even if it is incomplete.",5.0

"The box looks really awesome, and with my A Link Between Worlds guide, and the Hyrule Historia, it really makes the collection look great. The strategy guides helped, too. Totally worth it for the collectibility.",5.0
"This is a very beautiful box set! The way the books slide out with a pull ribbon is a nice added touch, the gold book mark, the gilded pages of each book is stunning

The down side is that it's so beautiful it's hard to want to use the books for strategy guides!
It's very intimidating!

I've heard this is the only way to get HD Windwaker guide and 3DS Ocarina of Time?
So if that is true then that will be a selling point for players

The treasure box is very adorable and the magnetic clasping is very nice

I wouldn't recommend using the Zelda bookmark...as it might tarnish easily or get handling marks on it

Even though a lot of the Prima guides don't flow well in some of the strategy : IE they leave parts out or forget to cover some events or omit some map layouts,
I still recommend this for the visual appeal",5.0
"Bought it thinking it was overpriced, well it wasn't. Totally worth my 100 bucks, the books are all amazing, the box has a better quality than i thought, the metal is amazing, super high quality, recommend to ANY zelda fan, even if you already have one of the books, the rest makes up for it!",5.0

"I keep this in my room at all times, and I haven't even opened the guides. Seriously, the thing is an honest to God work of art, even if it admittedly mass produced and manufactured. Give me more please!!!",5.0
"These books are much higher quality than the standard release strategy guides.  Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date.  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.  They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well.  Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items.  Here's hoping they also release books for Majora's Mask when it inevitably releases on the 3DS as well as the new Zelda adventure for the Wii U later this year or Spring 2015, whenever it is ready.",5.0
"I got this collection cause I needed the Phantom Hour Glass guide in hardback as well as Ocarina of Time for the 3ds cause its the only way to get it. this collection is a really great price through Amazon, I saved about 50 bucks through them.",5.0
"The collectors editions are beautiful books in their own right.  I wish they would do majoras mask as well so it would be all of them since the late 90s but such is life.

My only possible complaint is the treasure chest box should make the treasure finding sound (you all know exactly the sound I'm referring too).  And maybe have the box oversized so it could fit in the Link between worlds collectors edition strategy guide (same size and design as these so is part of the collection.)",5.0
This was a gift to my son and he was very happy with all the different zelda features these books had to offer I will purchase more items as time goes on...thank you,5.0

"Purchased for a 14 year old boy who thought it was the coolest thing ever.  The books are hardcover, sturdy, and free of defects.  The metal plated bookmark very cool, and the certificate of authenticity, while not the best selling point given the high #, was super cool by a teen boys standards.  The box that it comes in is thick cardboard.  This set would have been PERFECT if it came in some sort of wooden crate.  I would have been willing to pay extra for a deluxe version.  As it was, this set was a very good price and made for a pretty darned happy kid on Christmas morning.",5.0

"But i'm not gonna lie, it sorta just sits there, aging like the master sword. I am however perfectly fine with that. The production quality is amazing. Most of the books i've purchased in the past few months have their papers falling out of their binding. definitely a must buy for fans.",5.0

"The packaging for this item was great. Came in styrofoam and air packages.
All books are beautiful and in tack. They do NOT come with the original collectors edition extras, however I was aware of that when I purchased it.
This book set is a new collectors edition all on it's own.
I really enjoyed seeing my number of which I ordered.
I pre-ordered this item back in July but shipping was prompt and exact with dates.",5.0

"For Zelda fans, for collectors, this product is a (almost) must-have. Even if you don't use the books, they come in a neat packaging, with a note from Aonuma-san.
Prima Official Game Guides always bring every detail of the game, and these books follow that line.",5.0
"I was thoroughly pleased with this purchase.  Considering the great quality, I found that the overall price was quite affordable.  The shipping was fast, and the item was packaged very carefully to avoid damage.  The guides themselves are stunning.  The golden designs give them a very classy look.  The walkthroughs are in depth, and perfect for someone who is stuck, wanting to 100% complete the game, or just for a collector's item.  I also love the golden design of the bookmark.  It is glossy and serves its purpose well.  The chest is handy for holding all these guides, and serves as a nice showpiece. I was also very enthusiastic to receive a certificate of authenticity, included in each set.  If you're a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I would definitely reccommend this before it's sold out!",5.0

"Collectors edition box set with 6 guides for some of the greatest Zelda games ever! just makes wanting to play all of the zelda games over again just to use the guides, the gold laser etched bookmark is a nice touch as well.",5.0
As a big Zelda fan this treasure chest is magnificent and since I own all of these games it was a no brainer for me. As i've gotten older it's been harder to enjoy Zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i don't have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade. The golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from Wind Waker. The guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through. If you love LoZ and own these games get this before they're gone.,5.0
An amazing set of guides. All top notch quality.  Only downside is they don't come with a map that you would have gotten if you purchased the guide when it originally released.  Book mark is excellent as well and the gloss on the chest is epic.,5.0
just a great item to have for any zelda enthusiest. even if you don't ever use them for a play thru they just look amazing and the bookmark is awsome.,5.0
Beautiful box set. Definitely worth the money if you're a big Zelda geek like me. Really happy that the box isn't crappy. That was my only concern to be honest.,5.0
Really love this box set. Everything was as pictured and it's really well made. The only thing disappointing was that it didn't come with the extras you would have gotten if you bought the books separately.,5.0
"This is absolutely fantastic. When I picked up the amazon box at the door, I was taken by surprise by its weight...perhaps I should've looked at that in the description! I gently opened it and unsnapped the magnetic seal to reveal a gorgeous gold-plated bookmark with etched logos. The hardcover guides are beautiful with gilded edges and he certificate of authenticity is nicely tucked away in an envelope. As others have said, it would be nice if they included room for A Link Between Worlds, but it's not that big a deal. If you are a diehard Zelda fan, GET THIS WHILE YOU CAN!",5.0
"I  cannot express to you how happy I am to have received such an amazing box set. The Legend of Zelda has always been a very special franchise to me, and I could not pass the opportunity up when I saw this item. I really cannot say much more than the other 5-star reviews already have, but wow, what a great steal. BUY THESE BOOKS NOW. Seriously, right now. The price listed here on Amazon is unbeatable, and the prices will surely go up. I paid just shy of $18 for each book considering the total price I ended up paying (oh yeah, and free shipping). This is BEFORE all of the other features of the set, such as the sturdy bookmark, certificate of authenticity, and chest container. I think it is very well worth it by all standards.
Now, my set had only a few minor flaws that I felt should be pointed out but do not subtract my overall score because they are, as I mentioned, relatively minor. My bookmark has several small scratches on the back of it that I had noticed directly after I had pulled it out. It's a shame... It's quite a nice looking bookmark. Another thing to note is the fact that some of the golden gilded pages were not entirely, well, gilded. There were a few spots on various books that had tiny amounts of the golden paint missing. Where it is lacking, the edges look slightly darker than the surrounding area. Overall, just a tad bit disappointing, but nothing that will make me disregard the amazing features of the entire set.
I love these game guides and hope to find ones more like them in the future.",5.0
"Great set for any Zelda fan.
Although I am sad that the maps that came with the first prints weren't included it is still fantastic set!",5.0
"This collection is OUTSTANDING in terms of quality and appearance.  Over the years, I have purchased most of these guides and got the additional materials that were included with them (though these were not replicated for the guides in this collection unfortunately).  If ever you were looking for a nice collection of books concerning The Legend of Zelda or to aid in completing the games, this set is DEFINITELY for you.

PROS:

1)  Quality:  The outer box resembles a treasure chest, the likes of which Link finds all across Hyrule (and many other worlds connected to it).  It is a sturdy cardboard coated with a gloss-like finish, and it seems to have a magnetic clasp built in to keep the top closed.  On the roof of the top, when opened, is a slot containing a metallic (yes, metallic, not vinyl or cardboard) bookmark that has been beautifully etched by what appears to be laser.  It contains the logo of the series on one side and the crest of the Royal Family of Hyrule on the other, making for a very attractive (and unexpectedly greater quality) bookmark.  The books themselves all appear to be of slightly better quality than their original prints (which had binding problems and easily tore in some instances).

2)  Additional Goodies:  The most obvious additional item (and most sought after in time I am sure) would be the guide for Ocarina of Time 3D, which is only available through this set (of which only 50,000 exist).  I have examined it, and it is a VERY nice guide for the game, and as beautifully put together as its companion guides.  Another obvious extra is the metallic bookmark, which is really one of the nicest bookmarks I have seen honestly.  Also, something else extra that may be easy to miss is this:  some of the materials in this print of the guides have been expanded upon (the number of pages in Skyward Sword's guide has increased by 100 if that tells you anything).

3)  Collectible Status:  The set comes with a certificate of authenticity that includes a stamped number out of 50,000 and with the printed message and signature of Eiji Aonuma.  It marks the set as one out of 50,000 which indicates its collectible status and will almost certainly indicate an increase in value as time goes on.

4)  Packaging:  I have NEVER seen such good packaging for any item I have bought online as I have for this one.  The box the collection was shipped in is a good middle size containing two foam-like holding pieces that fit onto each end of the chest/box which hold it in place (and suspend it both above the shipping box's bottom and below the shipping box's top) and ensures that the package will not move around inside the shipping box at all during transport.  I intend to keep the shipping box and packaging the collection came in to transport it again when I am ready to move.  You can definitely rest assured that the collection will not suffer damage during shipping.

CONS:

1)  Lack of Previous Additional Materials:  As indicated before, the previous materials included with the previous print of these guides were not included, nor the map from the recently released Wind Waker HD guide.  This is a small complaint, as Twilight Princess's guide originally came with a cloth map of Hyrule, the Phantom Hourglass guide came with a vinyl bookmark of its own, and the Spirit Tracks guide originally came with a printed map of Hyrule.  While this is a regrettable exclusion, one should also take note that those materials were fairly cheaply made.  Hence, you're not missing out on much in that regard.

2)  Exclusion of ALBW Guide:  It is a shame that the makers of the collection did not have the foresight to include the recently released collector's guide for A Link Between Worlds in this collection, and considering they came out basically at the same time they easily could have.  This is a minor complaint, as the guide for A Link Between Worlds is of course available for purchase and comes with a collector's lithograph of the primary image from A Link Between Worlds.  Still, it would have been nice to have gotten them all together in one fell swoop, though of course this would have increased the size and weight of the package even more than it already is (and trust me, it weighs a good amount).

BOTTOM LINE:  This is an AWESOME set that will make any collector ecstatic to possess for not only its vast wealth of knowledge concerning the games it covers, but also for its beauty, craftsmanship and quality.  If you have not already gotten these guides, I STRONGLY encourage you to pick up this set while you are able to (there are only 50,000 in existence).  And if you have already gotten some of these guides as I had, I encourage you to still pick up this set and possibly sell your older copies as I plan to.  I plan to keep the extras that came with the previous printings of the guides and sell the guides themselves, as I now have this collection and no longer have any need for them.  The mere inclusion of the Ocarina of Time 3D guide (which apparently is not going to be released outside this set according to the publishers) alone should be a pretty good reason to get this collection, and after seeing it in person, I couldn't agree more that it was indeed worth it.",5.0
"Just got my set today and it is wonderful! The magnetic chest looks very nice, and the metallic bookmark is gorgeous! The gilded pages are beautiful and I love the hylian symbol on the front. The only defect (for me anyway) is the spirit tracks guide. The cover was either bound wrong to the pages, the pages were bound wrong to the cover, or the gold details on the front were put upside down - as when you hold the guide upright or what should be the ""upside"" based on the hylian symbol, the pages are upside-down and facing to the right! I still love the set though and the others are fine. But it is weird opening the guide and having either the pages or the hylian symbol upside down lol",5.0
A must have collection for any hardcore Zelda fan. Nicely put together hardcover books with certificate and metallic bookmark as well.,5.0
"Unlike the packing for the seperate collectors guides(crappy amazon book envelopes that get into bear fights with ups and ends up on your doorstep in ""used"" condition) this set comes protected to the hilt and looks great. Kudos to prima for the set AND for making sure we got it in great packaging!",5.0
"High quality magnetic chest box! This is so gorgeous and would be an excellent gift for any Zelda lover!
Hurry and get your copy before they run out. Only 50k were made!",5.0
"Came packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything.
I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I've heard that the quality for them were not that great.
The bookmark and certificate all make up for it, also the ""chest"" the items came in.
For $107, this is a bargain! The books separately are at least $30 each.
This is a perfect LoZ collectors item.",5.0
"This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.

My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.

I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.",5.0
"this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!",5.0
"JUST AMAZING! I didn't expect each guide to come with the special maps or extras that went with them on the original prints. I just knew I was getting guides, a fancy bookmark and fancy box. This is the set for the die hard. I'm super excited and glad I purchased this!",5.0
This is a very good source book for Edge of the Empire.  Gives some new species and ships and loads of info!,5.0
"The group I presently run decided early that they wanted to run a sort of loose paramilitary outfit. This is their first time playing and my first time GMing...well, anything.

1. Quality
The book itself is wonderfully bound and detailed. The art is wonderfully engaging and lightens up what can otherwise be a terribly dreary read chock full of statistics and text-walls (a la D20 system books.) It contains some great images of weapon schematics to give GMs and players a better idea of what it is they will be getting their hands on. It's new rule sets are a little vague on occasion, but that's fairly normal for such an abstract narrative focus game.

2. Content
This is a GREAT. Book for medium-heavy combat oriented groups. Even if a group isn't focused in such a way, the resources provided here are largely helpful to ideas on theme. It also helps detail mercenary groups who may be working against the PCs, so even if a GMs players aren't currently focusing on getting into big trouble, trouble may find them. It also helps lay out the RP elements for prospective Hired Guns and other mercenary types that do not conform to the class. It has a large selection of new near-military grade weapons, explosives (for which new rules have been outlined) and assault ships.

3. Complaints
One or two introduced elements are incredibly overpowered or, at the very least, raise difficult questions about their limitations. One of the mods in particular allows players to fire a weapon without using hands but does not identify whether it counts as a second or even third weapon in the case of attacking.
But really the biggest problem with both class books so far has been the infamous signature abilities. These range from nearly useless to absolutely narrative breaking, inducing instant, unstoppable mass-slaughter or near invincibility in the case of the HG. That however is my only real complaint, and it is entirely optional. I and my players decided to strike the purchase of the abilities on the grounds that they were severely overpowered for the most part.",5.0
"Breezed through a bit of it but it's extremely exciting. Finally added some new weapon and armor attachments such as the Pistol Grip which lets any blaster or carbine that doesn't have an encumbrance rating be used as a 1 handed Ranged (light) weapon with only a setback die! Targeting lasers and other optics add some cool effects and they've added a bunch of new pistols with high HP for modding out. Tons of awesome weapons and possibilities and I have just one word for armor, ""powered""...

Don't worry, plenty of ships and new attachments for those as well!

All I can say is if you've been wanting to buy a supplement book and haven't yet, this is a great one to start with!",5.0

I absolutely love this game.  You may think it is easy to find 5 differences in the pictures but it is really a challenge.  This game will entertain you for hours.  I play it every night. I am still playing the Rookie level which offers just the right challenge for me right now.  Ameteur level is a little more difficult.

Highly recommended",5.0
"As a very casual chess player, I decided to give Fritz 12 a try. The program is smart enough to obliterate just about anyone, but you can play the game at several different difficulty levels. It even has a friend mode where the computer determines how strong a chess player you are and plays at close to your level. This is one tough opponent - even in the friend mode. There are also several ""personalities"" you can play against. Each personality has preprogrammed strengths and weaknesses (including how badly it blunders). You can also change several of their attributes to make them a stronger or weaker player.

Fritz 12 is packed with training tools. You can set the game up so it suggests opening moves; warns you if a square you are about to move to is under attack; give you hints or suggested moves; tell you what your opponent is planning to do; and much more.

The free beginner training videos are good. There are also several sample videos for other topics included, in hopes you decide to purchase additional training videos.

Even at full price this is a terrific training tool and should certainly help you improve your game, even though you may get a bit frustrated if you like to win.",5.0
I'm using an older laptop with an XP os .That means there is no Microsoft Chess Titans game installed .I was having Chess withdrawal symptoms and needed a Chess game in my laptop. So I purchased Fritz 12. Excellent program with a large amount features. Inexpensive and a lot of bang for the buck. You will not be disappointed.,5.0
"This is the old edition, but it's great and a great price.  I've come from a background of playing Chessmaster and this old version is cheaper than the typical Chessmaster offering and much more of a power-user type of software.",5.0
"I just installed this a few days ago; already I love it. I've found the user interface fairly intuitive: So far I've learned how to set playing levels, find and play the tutorial videos, play tournament-style, view and print score sheets, and more. When I ran into confusion with the user interface or options, the help system provided the info I needed.

I'm running the single-core version on a dual core Thinkpad under Windows 7 Pro. Some people had trouble installing or running it on Win7, so I hope my experience will help:

To install, I ran the installer (setup.exe) in administrator mode and selected the ""allow this application to modify the hard drive"" option.

To register, I entered the product serial number from the label inside the case and the validation code displayed in the licensing dialog box. (NOTE: This step could have clearer instructions I suppose, because it took me two tries to get it. The first try, I just entered the serial number and clicked OK. That resulted in an error message but the program ran anyway. The second time I ran the app I again got the licensing dialog box, and again entered the serial number, but this time realized that the dialog box was displaying a code in large funky letters. Entering this code in the field next to it--after entering the serial number--worked.)

Now I can run the program with no license dialogs popping up, and I don't have to run it in compatibility mode either.",5.0

"The Fritz 12 Graphic User Interface is infinitely easier to use and understand than the Aquarium GUI, and you still get that totally cool 3D board option which Aquarium doesn't have. I totally agree with all the excellent things other reviewers have said, but do consider this: On June 10, 2011, World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand told Chessvibes.com his preferred engine was Houdini over both Rybka and Fritz. Deep Fritz 13 (not 12) now has Houdini 3 installed into it and is the ultimate way to prepare for an OTB tournamemnt by weeding out any inconsistencies in your favorite openings. Deep Fritz 12 is still important however since you can install the free Houdini 1.5 download (ELO 3250) or the Houdini 3 Pro version (current CCRL rating 3347) in the Fritz engine management tab under the:""create a UCI engine"" option. Why is a high ELO rating so important?Because when you go to your next OTB tournament, rest assured at least one of your opponents will have his openings down pat with many new ideas and  all inconsistancies worked out well in advance and approved by the worlds strongest engine which is Houdini. If you prefer to rely on the weak main lines and sloppy analysis found in both the ""Secrets of Opening Surprises"" or ""Dangerous Weapons"" books then you may learn the hard way (as I did)by losing many games after reaching terrible positions during the critical opening stages of the game. So I agree with all the good things said about Deep Fritz 12, but its really the excellent GUI(Graphic User Interface) provided that makes Fritz invaluable in creating a truly powerful opening arsenal that will give your opponents something to think about.",5.0
"Fritz is the best there is, that is the short and the long of it. Chess is a mind sport,and so no software can force you to become a better player without you having the right mindset. Having said that, Fritz offers you all that modern software can for chess improvement. Miles ahead of Chessmaster in my opinion. I've owned chessmaster for a while and it is worth the money, if nothing else, with the Josh Waitzin tutorials. Chessmaster has great graphics, but everywhere else, Fritz wins out. Use a combination of Fritz and chessbase light (freeware downloadable online), and use playchess.com for human vs human play and its a win win situation. Great product!",5.0
I have been a Deep Fritz user for many years.  I have others in the Deep Fritz 8 era but Deep Fritz is my favorite and I am well pleased with 12.  Fast shipping as well.,5.0
"Fritz 12 is an excellent chess program. I'm an intermediate level player (chess club strength) and I find Fritz to be an great companion for analysis, casual play, and finding out about recent activities through the ""Playchess.com"" subscription.
The installation process was very smooth and it worked right off the bat. However, the update didn't work at first (update 12). It wasn't until following updates (version 17, I think) that it was able to finally work as it should have. Sometimes the audio features get messed up (the clock continues ticking even when you are not playing, no sound comes when you move a piece, the funny comments don't work, etc.). However, these minor bugs don't affect the important stuff, i.e., the chess playing and analysis.
Playchess is a great place to go find out about news, playing with other people, and fiddling around with the tactical exercises.
In short, an excellent purchase for the price. I would recommend it 100%!",5.0

It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless, since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also, the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me, mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better, but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall, a very simplistic, yet functional, design that works well.",5.0

"Bought to use for Rock Band 4 on the ps4. Works great, sensitive to vocal changes and I didn't have to smash it against my hand for the annoying clapping/tambourine bit they do sometimes in songs like I usually have to do with mics my friends have bought.

Works great for Rockband that I play on my Wii but sometimes doesn't pick up the hit when I hate to hit it like a tambourine on my solos. Still a good product nonetheless.,5.0

"We bought it to use with Wii (not Wii U) for ABBA Dance and Grease.  Works perfectly for both games, not star-quality sound or anything, but great for kids and fun.  You will need to go into the settings for the games and turn up the volume for the microphones.",5.0

GREAT,5.0
Great. Fast delivery,5.0
"With many brands of microphones to buy and choose from this worked great and for under $10 is a steal. I have a wii and the response time was accurate,as well as the sound quality. I would definitely suggest this brand (or Konami they work well too) if your looking to play singing games. If there is concern about the length of the cord it is long enough for me to sit on my bed and sing which is about 31/2 feet from the tv.",5.0
Great sound quality and condition. I'm happy to play rock band now :D,5.0

"I bought two of these so that we could sing the harmonies for Beatles Rock Band for the Wii. They work wonderfully. In order to use 3 mics, 2 guitars, and a drum kit, you'll need to purchase a USB hub.",5.0
I love it! Use it all the time. Really works perfectly with all games that you need a mic for.,5.0
Pretty cool works well but don't get to use it  that much but glad I got it really worth it,5.0
Bought this as a second mic for our Rock Band 3 game and we love it. We constantly fight over who is going to use it so I think we may need to purchase a second one.,5.0
But for a microphone cord could be a little bit longer but for the price its just right. Thank you.,5.0

"Good Mic at a reasonable price. So far, So Good! Will see how long it lasts in the hands of 3 and 8 year olds!",5.0
"I've used this for both Rock Band 2 and Band Hero.  My wife loves karaoke and singing, in general, so she naturally loved the idea of singing in games like this while I played guitar.  However, prior to purchasing this microphone, all I had for her to use was my headset plugged into the controller.  It worked, but it was very clumsy, especially in Rock Band 2 for the parts of the song where you're supposed to tap on the microphone in rythym with the beat.
So I purchased this as a Christmas present for her and she absolutely loves it.  It took us a few minutes to realize that a controller still needed to be plugged in for her so that she can join in, but after that, it's been smooth sailing/singing.  What's really nice is that the cord is long enough for her to stand back a good distance from the tv.",5.0
This product was exactly as described and works great with my daughters Disney Kareoke XBox 360 game. Very happy with the mic sand the price was fabulous!!!,5.0
I purchased this mic to use with my Xbox version of Bandfuse and it works perfectly.  Construction is solid and the mic was well packed and timely shipped.  No complaints!,5.0
"Well, buy this microphone because we have a party soon and need one. Truth I wanted a wireless microphone but I didn't found it but this is very good, has a very long wire and it sounds super good, I recommend it for those that make family holidays!!!",5.0

Grandson and his friends received two for the holidays and use them frequently.  Lots of fun.  Mics work just fine.,5.0
I am happy with my choice to purchase the official usb logetech ea microphone for my wii. It is a fun item.,5.0
"Been using this for about a year off and on.  It doesn't get the workout that our guitar and keyboard do, but it's still hanging in there with me, a 7 year old and an 11 year old putting it through its paces.  Still works really well on our Wii.  Surprisingly so, as a matter of fact.  The only thing that is odd is that the microphone had a label on the side that said something or other about a ""Disney"" game.  I forget which one.  It doesn't actually say, ""Rock Band"" on it, but we don't care.  It still works just fine.",5.0
Works great now me n my daughter can sing together it arrived way b4 date was suppose too very happy with purchase,5.0
"No problems to be had with the mic, it's relatively cheap and works perfectly well with Rock Band (all that I have used it for).",5.0
"Great buy, Works Perfectly with both rock band and guitar hero, cord is long enough to sing anywhere in the room with out inconvenience.  I was so glad to have found this after buying a rock band set brand new from the store and the mic did not work.",5.0
"We plugged this microphone into the Wii and it just worked. We find USB easier to deal with on the Wii than using the microphone jack.

With all the noise of the games such as Rock Star, I can't really tell how good the audio quality is, but that also means that it is good enough for Wii.

It seems like it is well made, but we have only used it 10 - 20 times, so I don't know how it will hold up over time. The previous two microphones (different manufacturer) didn't last long before we had to start holding the cable in certain positions to make them work.

This microphone does what it is supposed to. Nothing lacking.",5.0
i have had no problems with this product at all. it works like i wanted it to. its great. i use it all the time. thank you a lot! its also great becuase the usb cord allows me to use it with all my games that need a mic. the wireless one do not. so thank you again for this wonderful mic.,5.0
"Works great!

Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have ""harmony"" (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active.  However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part.  Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead.  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do.  lol  It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics.  For this reason, we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in.  Just don't expect a good score ;-)",5.0
I ordered this to use with my Wii and was nervous because some many reviews said it wouldn't work with my systems. I plugged it in and it it worked!,5.0
"i got this microphone to rap because it usb and really i felt dumb for buying it cause its for a guitar hero game and its 12 dollars but it works like a pro mic i just needed a op filter and a stand and i go those the same day i bought the mic and i got them all at the same time i was impressed im a rapper and i loved this mic so i recommend this mic for podcasting,vocals,rapping,or even the real use rock band",5.0
"This microphone is better than the original that came with the Disney:Sing it game.  The audio quality may be the same, but the build is noticeably better.  Heavier feel and better cord connection into the microphone.  A definite must if you have more than one kid or if your kid's like to have friends over.",5.0
"This was one of my first purchases for the PS3 and Rock Band 2. Is very ease to use just plug into a usb port and Play!
The package arrive within the estimated date and I would buy from this seller again.",5.0
they could be a little bit more faster on the delivery but at the end it was good to make bussines with them they are 100% responsable and good quality products if i need something again i won't think it twice on buying from them.,5.0
"Excellent product. For those of you stil trying to use a headset as a microphone in GH/RB stop now and order this product. I used to fail out ALL the time on easy difficulty using a headset and now i get 5 stars very easily. Solid quality, good price, fast shipping.",5.0

"Great product. Brand new! Ships fast, and EXCELLENT customer service. They will sort out any issue that arises. They have been really helpful, and the product is flawless. Use it all the time.",5.0
We bought this item for our Wii. It does not work at all for it. :-( So that was a disapointment. We did decide to keep it though because it works wonderfully on our x-box 360.,5.0
"I bought this mic for the ps3 and i cant complain it worked just like any other mic, but wat i really was surprised by was the quality of the mic when i plugged it in the computer. This mic is good for both a rockband and amateur recording on mac/pc",5.0

I really should have made a video ... We sang Beatle Songs for five hours and we had three microphones...and it was a blast.  Works well!!,5.0
"I was initially worried that this microphone would not be compatible with our Wii Beatles' Rock Band game, but it works great with our system and the kids love it!
Now we can have three vocalists, along with the guitar players and drummer. It makes for much more fun when more people can join in the performance. I recommend this microphone with the highest confidence that your family will love it too!",5.0
My microphone stopped working in the middle of playing Rock Band with friends and I was able to replace the microphone with this version for cheap. Product works great with my wii and was shipped fast.,5.0
I got this microphone after my microphone that came with Rock Band fell apart (the wire became loose at the microphone). I like it better than the original. It is a little more sensitive so you don't have to have it right next to your mouth and easier to handle as it is shorter. I am really surprised that it cost so little and works so well.,5.0
You need a microphone to play Lego Rock Band so we recommend this one!  We also ordered the mic stand so we can play and sing at the same time!,5.0
I bought this mic hoping it was as good (if not better) then the Official Rock Band 2 Mic. I found it to be better! It keeps my voice in tune very well and is very sensitive to sound. The transaction with the seller was smooth and fast! Excellent Buy!,5.0
We use this when we want to vocals on Beatles Rock Band and it's great!!,5.0
"This was very fast shipping. The battery came in brand new and sealed. It arrived in about 4 days. The battery works fine and Ive discovered no problems, it fits very well in my PSP 2001. This is a great buy and a great replacement battery.",5.0

"I bought this battery for my psp 2000 because my last one fried.
Battery came superfast and in brand new condition.
My old battey used to last about 3 to 4hrs depending on how much

about 1 1/2x as long. Overall this battery was a very good buy. ^_^",5.0

Good product for the price. No hassle and arrived on time.,5.0
I purchased this to connect my son's Wii to the Flat screen TV. It works perfectly just like the old cable. He can play the Wii games without any  problems and also watch Hulu  Plus and Netflix clearly.,5.0
Works perfectly. The only thing is that I ran out of spots on my TV now. I should have bought the hdmi adapter instead.,5.0
"Just what I needed, back in the swing of things.....and at least I didn't have to get one from the store that would have cost about 20 plus",5.0
just what i needed,5.0
Very happy with this AV Cable -- it works very well & I'm so happy to play my old Sports Wii again on our HDTV -- I did have to move a few cables around - till I had the best picture with sound etc; -- all is well & we are thankful that we don't have to buy a whole new Wii Package. I would highly recommend this cable!!!! :),5.0
"This made it possible for me to have both my Wii and my DVD player connected to TV at the same time, rather than switching the connections every time I wanted to use one or the other.",5.0
Worked perfectly. This is exactly what I needed to get my Wii to connect to my high definition television. Thanks!,5.0
"This is exactly what I needed.  And I got it cheaper than in a store and that is if you can even find it in a store.  Would have had to wait a week for them to order it, but got it in just two days and my boys and I were off battling dragons.  :)",5.0
This works great.  It is exactly what I needed to connect my HDTV to my Wii so we do not need to switch wire between the DVD player and Wii.,5.0
It's not hi def (due to Wii limitations) but the colors are crisper and there is a LOT more detail.  The quality difference is similar to upgrading from VHS to DVD.,5.0
Cheap solution to improve video quality for the Wii on HDTVs. The picture quality is better than what we get from component cables from our DVD player.,5.0
"This was exactly what was needed and has worked flawlessly since being received. I recommend it, if you need one.",5.0
"Fits the wii perfectly, nice and tight.  The rca jacks are little cheap, but they the grab and hold just fine.",5.0
Great alternative to 1080 Tvs. I upgraded my TV but the old connectors made the connection look fuzzy. With this cable I can get 480p which makes games and netflix look great (dvd quality) on my 50 inch HD Tv.,5.0
If you need an rgb interface this really works good. My new tv didn't have the yellow video hookup. Just use it for Netflix I only play xbox,5.0
I needed this to connect to my LCD LED VIZIO. It works.  Not much more to say than that. I found no fault with it.,5.0
"This cable is something Nintendo should include when buying brand new Wii. Product is made well, easy to connect and works great!",5.0
This pair of component cables are great! Affordable and works just as good as those $30.00 Nintendo Wii branded component cables! Save yourself some money and buy these if your needing some component cables for your Wii!,5.0
"It has been over 1 year since I bought this cable.  No problem at all. Quality is very good. There is no difference between this cable and Nintendo branded ones, except for the price.",5.0
"This cable is working as expected and for the price was an excellent purchase, I couldn't be happier with it.",5.0
"I rated this product as I have because it exceeded my expectations. Also, I would recommend this product to others.",5.0
i got this to hook up me will to my 72inc h/d tv it set it up to 1080i not 1080p but besides that it's a grate cable!!!,5.0
"the cable is of good quality, and the package came quickly.  no complains here.  it also gave the tv a better picture compared to the standard AV cables.",5.0
great component cable for the Wii.  makes hookup easy and can be used for other components...heavy duty...quality...shipped fast and was a great price...,5.0
"Original:

The cord arrived quickly and just comes in a plastic bag inside the box. I bought this cord to have a spare cord and decided to try component cords instead of composite.  The cord works and does help make the picture a little crisper than the regular Nintendo Wii cord. Between the cheap price and the picture quality I get I'm definitely happy with my purchase.

Update May 7, 2013

After using the cables for a while I occasionally get a green tinted screen when I load my Wii, although I've been able to get it to go away restartig the Wii and replugging in the cords. Also after using my Wii to watch Netflix more I can say that the color hasn't bee great and is not very accurate to when the show is watched on my laptop or through original broadcast. I also can't really say that its the cords or the Wii that is going bad and making the color go bad. At some point I'm going to try to borrow cords for a friend and test it out. Ultimately though the cords were dirt cheap compared to other I looked at and I would not be surprised or even mad if they went bad after being used for a while.",5.0
This cable is well made and designed to last. The cable is better then the product it is used to attach as WII does not support 1080p.,5.0
"The movers packed my Wii cables in a separate box so I couldn't find them. I ordered this as it would be quicker and I wasn't disappointed. It is inexpensive and it works. I did have my Wii setup manual so it was no problem to get up and running right away. Sometimes you get what you pay for, and sometimes it is better.",5.0
"This component cable was exactly what I was looking for and was a great price! Instead of having to get an A/V component box for my gaming systems, I was able to find this. It was a great buy :)",5.0
This is a good component cable for Wii. The picture is much improved. Connected to Sony 46inch 1080p LCD. I would recommend this product.,5.0
"I'm glad I purchased this cable, it doesn't necessarily make your games look amazing, but it does allow you to do 480p instead of just 480i, so for how inexpensive they are I think it's a worthwhile investment! I've also read that it makes movies look noticeably better, but I haven't played any to confirm/deny that.",5.0
I purchased this Wii HDTV cable to hook up to my brand new HD TV. Easy installation and I wanted to get the most out of my gaming unit.,5.0
This product is very good and works fine. Buy it if you want it. it lets your we display in HD format of 480p which looks alittle better than normal Av cable it comes with. To the untrained eye you might not even notice the diffrence.,5.0
I used to play this game years ago and loved it. I found this did not work on my computer even though it said it would work with Windows 7.,1.0
"The product description should state this clearly. The CD, the box, and the product description suggest that the game is compatible with all Macs. It is not.",1.0
I cannot get this game to install on my computer no matter what I do.,1.0

"Doesn't work on any computer in the house, tried Mac and windows.",1.0

Didn't work in my computer so it went to the garbage an hour after I got it!,1.0
"The version I played as a child was way more fun than this version. There's a bunch of small problems this game has that bring down the over all fun level of it. Waste of money, I won't be playing it anymore.",1.0
Does not work on Mac OSX. Save your money. Don't buy this game.,1.0
My son got this for Christmas and we couldn't get this to work on any of our computers. Such a disappointment.,1.0
This item would not work on my Windows 8 computer. Waste of money.,1.0
"What a bore! I love this game, but so far only the third edition. The only redeeming feature about this version is that I could play it using Windows 8. (Not that I'll be playing this version ever again. The original on floppy disk back in the '80's was more exciting than this version.) So here's hoping they come out with third edition for Windows 8.",1.0
"I was sooooo excited to find this game!! And it worked great, until I tried to exit out of the game, and it froze my computer. For 2 days we have been working on the poor laptop. Still a black screen. Nothing.",1.0
"If you buy this game, you will regret it.  If you change any major component in your computer 3 times, the game will stop working permanently. And it will never work again. So, if you plan to play this game a few years from now, you will not be able to do so.  Is this some horrible bug? No - this is intentional. It is a scheme to get people to buy the same game over and over again.  This should be illegal.  So, if you want to actually play games you buy, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!",1.0
"The game installed okay but in trying to link to registration, it has failed every time.  So I don't know if I like the game or not since I haven't been able to play it.",1.0
"I have 3 computer's and will not play on any of them, one with windows XP, one widows 7 and one windows 8.",1.0
"When will I ever learn. So like others here, I install it, and can I just go ahead and play??? No, I have to first run some updater, OK, I do that, says I need to register on some website, I click cancel because I don't want to do that nonsense nor should I have to, so the game starts over again, says I need to update again, I do, just takes me back to the register online screen.

Really would like to review the game itself but unfortunately I cannot even play it. I know there are other Anno titles out there and was interested in them if this one was fun, but I won't be forced into registering online just to play a game I paid for.",1.0
The game would not load.  There was a file missing from the CD that would allow it to complete.,1.0
"I'm an avid gamer, but Anno 2070 is an INSULT to gaming.  It is so buggy and half-finished that the first campaign doesn't even work properly and the DRM is INCREDIBLY frustrating to deal with.

Once you manage to work your way past the massive amounts of bugs and get through the DRM, HOURS later you finally figure out that the game has no real tutorial, so you stuck just clicking around randomly.

Sad, sad, sad, example of a game that could have been great but FTW.",1.0
"I got this game on Amazon because it had a very good price, but upon receiving it i downloaded the game, but it would not run. It said it needed updates but the auto updater would not work. I was able to get a full refund very quickly and I am happy about that but very disappointed that the game i had anticipated so long would not run.",1.0
"A bit of a snoore-fest. I played it for a few hours but felt like I was back in kindergarten.

Perhaps I didn't give it enough of a chance, but when I have nearly nil motivation to keep playing it, I just cant waste the time on this title that it may need or deserve in order to want to keep going.",1.0
"The DRM is atrocious.  No one should buy a game with such a cynical and invasive wrapper.

The game itself seems solid.  The interface is extremely cluttered; their UI/UX designers didn't do nearly as good of a job as they did with previous Annos.  If hell freezes over and Ubisoft decides to buck the AAA trend of putting their games in garish, grotesque cages, I'll be first in line for the DRM-free rerelease.",1.0
"I have been unable to play this game.  Unisoft has made it unplayable if you are not a techno whiz. ( I have tried several times to get it up and running.)  I just want to play in my home not on the internet and for some reason it will not load on the computer.  I probably will never buy another UNI-SOFT game or product.

I was thrilled to see another installment released, but I absolutely will NOT pay for something that limits my hardware changes and installs.

Wake up UBI, look at all of your other software title reviews, both here on Amazon and on gaming sites. People are not as stupid as you think, and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software.

By adding DRM you've actually promoted the use of piracy instead of reduced it, because those that really do want to play it will find a way.",1.0
This might be a decent game if it didn't start a massive stutter every few minutes that requires alt tabbing to get out of. This is a widely known issue and I have tried numerous suggested fixes to no avail. I have never had an unfixable issue like this with a game before. If I could return it for my money back I would.,1.0
"I'm sure I would love the game, if I could play it, I have loved all the Hitman games thus far.  The one star is due to steam.  Steam is absolutely beyond annoying and they do NOT help you if you ask them.  I found out after I purchased it that windows xp does not support direct X-10.  I do have a high end video card but it doesn't make a difference.  I recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam.  Perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business (my favorite option).  I am very good with computers (built mine) so that is not the problem.  As always it's a steam issue.",1.0
"Update June 2013:
Deeply disappointed at the lack of a non-linear open-world environment. But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie.

As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.

I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game.

==================================================================

Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!

I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?!

Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense!

You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!

The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.

Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design. It gives me confidence that I might have something better to bring to the table.",1.0

"DiRT 2 was like this.  I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.

CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating ""music"" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).

PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.

I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.  Anyway,  just my opinion...",1.0
"This game was a rip-off.  It has less terrain, less tracks, and less features than DiRT 2.  The graphics are about the same.  Not worth the money, at all.",1.0
I insert the cd into my pc and I have being waiting  35 minute and it only install about 25%,1.0
"I wish I had read the forums before purchasing this game.  I bought the DVD version because I didn't want to deal with downloading on slow internet, but I see similar issues reported on steam forums.  I buy games on Amazon or Steam because I don't want to deal with the hassle of pirating.  I thought it wouldn't be worth the time, but this game makes me have second thoughts.  This game was not worth the time, and I've yet to be able to actually play a full race.

It took two evenings from when I got home from work until after midnight just to get this game installed.  I wanted to try playing video games, so I bought a computer and some games.  The installation takes hours, crashed my computer multiple times, required many dependencies (like ""MS games for windows live"") that must be installed separately.  The only way to find out you need this other software is to search the forums... If you don't have some dependency, after an hour of waiting the install finishes but the game doesn't start.  I even had to edit XML configuration files to get the program to start at all.

The game can't be played unless I am *both* logged into xbox live *and* have the DVD in the drive.  I find that DVD's scratch easily, I consider them transfer media not a reliable way to store data.  Since they already have the DRM of a mandatory windows-live service, I don't see why they would cripple the game even further with the disk requirement.  For this reason, if you ignore my advice, at least get the downloadable version.  I'll probably copy the dvd image to disk as an iso with CloneDrive, but it's an extra 7gb of data that has already been installed on my hard disk for a game that... can't be played anyway.

Once I finally ironed out the installation issues, and was actually able to get the game started, 2 minutes into each attempt at a car race the entire computer would crash.  Black screen, unresponsive, numlock doesn't even change the lights on my keyboard, needing a hard-reboot.

I know some will assume I just don't know how to install software, or that I have an old computer, or that I have viruses.  I'm a software engineer with over a decade of software development experience.  All of the other games I bought on Amazon or Steam worked fine (including one other that also required the windows live service).  My computer is two weeks old and fast, i5, 8gb of ram, a discrete graphics card, nearly brand new.  Even if this was a resource issue, the game shouldn't consistently crash my entire computer to the point of needing a hard reboot.  The price for the game isn't high, but don't waste your *time* on the PC version of this game.

If you're a young kid and you've got all of your summer vacation to play around with figuring out installation issues, maybe this will be a good learning experience for you.  If you have a job, and just want something fun to to do once in a while on a PC, look elsewhere.",1.0

"I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is. Like everything else Microsoft makes- it doesn't work. When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time.

If you want another disappointment from Microsoft, buy some ""Games for Windows Live"" games.  I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting. If that's what you want, don't buy this.

"As an avid SCCA rallyx driver, I was hoping to get something that was even a little bit like actually rally driving, but was severely disappointed.  There is absolutely no relationship to driving this ""car"" to anything in real life, other than when you step on the gas it goes forward.

In actual rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the car; its the defining quality of racing on dirt.  To do that you need to be able to keep the steering wheel straight, and use the brake to shift weight forward and back to control car rotation. But in the game the car is impossible to steer straight going 5mpg on a straight road, let alone hit racing speeds.  I tried every single possible controller setting, and even bought a brand-new wheel. Both had the same problem: turning the wheel 5 degrees results in the steering inputs reacting as if I turned the wheel 10, or 15, or 20, or 30 degrees depending on the speed.

The only workaround I could find was the ""dead zone"", making the wheel inoperable while centered, and then it violently overracts when turned outside of the dead zone.  Using that I could steer straight and then sharply turn, then go straight, then sharply turn.  Ridiculous, yes, but if you watch videos of people driving on youtube.com that's how the game was apparently designed.

You'd think that a driver-oriented game would have a multitude of options for the most important aspect of driving: controlling the car.  Instead, the game is horribly slowed down by useless eye-candy graphics and a ridiculously obtuse interface.  Just starting the game and getting to the point of driving a car takes 10 minutes while you frantically hit the enter key trying to tell it to skip the fancy graphics and storyline and get on with the darn game.

If its racing you want then iracing.com is still the only realistic option.  This is worse than even Mario Kart!",1.0
"I bought this game earlier this year and was working ok, but when I filled out the xbox live profile this game runs on. It already had a profile name. I thought it was odd, but didn't think too much into it since the game was shrink wrapped and all and was still playing on my pc. It was my first time using xbox live and existing account name had some racing type ring to it, I figured it was part of the game set up for you to personalize screen name if you wanted to change it. Either way the game stopped working, wouldnt load anymore, and a window telling me that game copy was not origanal. So to me, with the other reviews saying game will not load. Im wondering if people are paying attention to windows saying why it will not load. Im guessing the seller or somebody who works there is taking the games number pass code and making copies. With the low  price of the game whos gonna go through the hassel and demand a refund after 3 or 4 months of having this game. I never bothered to bring this up to the seller, because in the end with the games low price I can see the seller accuse me of the copying. Try and google the seller and its reviews (its been some time since I did this. Dont know if they still have origanal name). I did and they were not good. Who knows this review could have been different if I had contacted them, but with the games low price and what came up after google'n the seller. I doubt it.",1.0

Some championship races and cars can only be ""unlocked"" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.

I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.

I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.

"I have never in my life paid money for a game this buggy

First up, my computer is awesome, it crushes anything I though at it with ease.  I have an AMD II X4 925, 4GB RAM with Raedon 6900, my computer IS NOT the problem

Problems with this game:

#1. The DVD doesn't read properly.  My DVD drive, which has NEVER had an issue with anything before takes about 2 minutes to register the DVD.  Clearly whatever factory they used to burn this disc along with the DRM rubbish did a real fine job.  You must have DVD in drive to play game, so need to wait 2 minutes before can play - assuming it reads disk, which it only does 1/3 of the time ;-/

#2. Windows Games for Live was a friggin nightmare to get going.  By the way I'm a computer programmer by day so I know how to operate technical things.  Ended up disabling anti-virus software, good luck getting a non-technical person to realise they must do this

#3. Game absolutely fries my computer.  I have a friggin Raedon HD 6900!!!  My GPU went to 85 degrees and my CPU to 105!! WTF!?  Ended up turning down graphics level right down to stop my fans going mental

#4. You win a race in career mode and you get spoken to like you're a 12 year skate boarder.  ""That was awesome driving dude, you should totally upload your replay to youtube!!!"".  Um, how about get lost?

#5. Get up a short distance through career mode to a snow track with other cars on it - graphics start stuttering like crazy even though i have graphics on ""low"" on a Raedon 6900!!!! wtf!!?!?  Getting about 10 FPS.

#6. Give up on career mode.  Decide to only play time trial.  Oh game automatically downloads ghost replays of ""world record holders"" - they're all cheats who hack!!  3 minute races won in 26 seconds ummm hello??

#7. Finish a time trial, OK that was fun, now replay it.  Oh graphics start stuttering again!!!  Not as bad as snow race but still annoyingn as hell.  Only way to fix is to exit to main menu and then reload entire race, so can't use replay.

Un friggin believable

WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PURCHASED",1.0
"So you just want to buy and play this great rally racing game?  Good luck.  I have a typical Windows XP system with an nVidia video 8600 series card and 4GB ram.  Decent but nothing tricky. I am also quite resourceful and capable of doing things like ""deleting .dll files"" running special installers from third party websites, etc.

YOU MAY VERY WELL NEED TO BE AS WELL.

If your install does not work and the game gives you and error, you may be on your own.  Codemaster's tech support?  Responded twice total. I spent another $30 on a registry and .dll fixer, nothing, then they told me to uninstall a bunch of other stuff I had on my machine and then when I did, wouldn't return my response that their help did not resolve my problem.  Poof, gone.

There is no phone number and their home page is on Facebook.

So I used Google and found their official forum and posted a lengthy message with the details as requested by their forum guide and got NOTHING, no help.

I was able to eventually get it to run through more Google searching for related problems in other games.  Problems that should not exist in today's games.  I had to download and run special installers from a sound card manufacturer and ""drill into"" the Dirt 3 game folder and delete a specific file.

How stupid is this?  And nothing?  No help?  No FAQ?  No fix or patch?  Even more remarkable is that their forum is filled with demands that Codemasters fix the bugs.  Demands for many months now, apparently gone unanswered, literally.

This IS THE FIRST AND LAST CODEMASTERS GAME I will ever buy or help someone with.

I gave it one star for the horrible ""welcome aboard, have fun installing"" for this game and ""one star"" for game play as it has been a week and countless hours spent, with no help from Codemasters, getting it to run, which is not much ""fun."" So One star for fun.

It now works, maybe I'll come back and reassess my fun score, maybe not.

I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D. Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that didn't help either, which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim.",1.0

"I have been a long time Chessbase user all the way back to Fritz 5.32.  And until Deep Fritz 12 I have been very satisfied with their product.  However Chessbase has decided to release this new version of software without the ""2 Computer Match"" feature.  I used this feature a lot to play my other computers with earlier software against each other.  When I emailed Chessbase and inquired why they removed a great feature they replied that it was too much trouble for them to support.
Just lazy German programming.

I thought that software evolved to more features not less?  Isn't that what justifies buying upgrades every year?  Hmmmm...  Well Chessbase ceretainly isn't giving a break on the price.  Oh yeah thats another thing, why are they still selling a ""DEEP"" version?  All cpu's today have multi-cores and the programming for parrallel processing is already done.
I guess Chessbase just wants your money and not give you any features.  I wonder what they will cut next?

The Fritz 12 chess engine is only marginally stronger than Fritz 11.  Rybka 4.1 just mops the floor with Fritz 12 in Engine match, it so embarrassingly bad.  One recent engine match had Rybka winning 24 straight games and no draws.  This was with the same book for both engines.

Do to the fact the Chessbase doesn't care to listen to their customers and continue to support features established for over a decade and it's poor showing against Deep Rybka 4.1 I would have to say that Deep Fritz 12 is just not worth buying.

"The battery fits my 3000. It does not hold a charge longer then the factory one. Most times it does not warn you before shutting down the game on low battery, with no chance to save your progress. The factory one puts the game in standby so that you can plug in and save your progression. Very disappointed.",1.0
I have a 3000 series psp. I bought this because the advertisment says that it is for the 2000/3000 psp. When i recieved it and put it in it wouldnt work. would not even charge in the psp.,1.0
"This battery is a waste of money.  After only 1 week of using it (charged it 4 times) and on the 5th charge- it stopped charging.  The light would go on my psp 3000 and after 5-10 minutes- it would go off and not charge.  Do NOT buy this product.  I should've listened to the other negative reviewers before purchasing this item.

I returned it back with no hassle.  Thank-you Amazon, but please stop selling this item.  Too many people with the same problems will only lose you money.",1.0
"DONT BUY THIS!!!... I thought this would of been an awesome buy and a great deal, but man was I wrong. I was so happy when I got it in the mail and It worked on my PSP 3000 for about a week and 1/2, but then while I was charging my psp with USB cable it shut off on me and the battery did not work... so it basically short circuited. At least it wasn't too much money, but still I basically paid $5 for a paper weight... hope this review helped!",1.0
"The main problem is that the battery is too big to fit and keeps popping out when i try to put it in. i have a psp 2000 and compared to the original battery this one is slightly bigger, and thus, will not fit.",1.0
This battery does not work with PSP 3001. Check your cereal number on the bottom edge of the device itself to see your specific model number. It fits perfectly but does not do anything. Returned with no hassle.,1.0
I bought this battery for use with a brand new psp 3001. It acts like it's going to take a charge for about 3 minutes then the charging light randomly shuts off and the psp cannot be powered on again until the battery pack is removed and replaced with the one from the factory... Thanks for nothing amazon.,1.0
"After hooking this up to my Wii, I encountered buzzing audio and slight video glitches. At first I thought it was simply a connection problem, or else a problem with my television, but after purchasing the far more expensive Nintendo brand component cables, I came to the realization that my bargain brand cable was either defective or simply too sensitive to other devices electro-magnetic interference.

"cable arrived in timely manner. Hooked it up to TV but did not work properly. Wii picture was close to black and white only. Appears that the leads were mislabeled or misaligned as sound only came on when the green video connection was plugged in. Would suggest buying different cable. Not sure if will return, cable very cheap relative to cost of shipping return",1.0

"Ubisoft has made a number of excellent flight simulators/arcade games in the past. I found the original HAWX, while definitely on the arcade side of the spectrum, to be fun and engaging.

After eagerly awaiting the release of Hawx2 (PC version) for a number of months, I received it from Amazon (no local stores had it) to find that it required a permanent Internet connection to play; not just to install, but for actual game play. Since I do not play games on the Internet, and my larger gaming (flight sim) PCs don't even have an Internet connection. I had to return the game, unopened.

While the majority of PC gamers do play on line, there are some of us who don't and have no desire to. I fully understand Ubisoft's concern over piracy, but they are excluding a number of previous and potential customers by attempting to lock down their product in this way. Honestly, it seems like all it will accomplish is to force ""hackers"" to come up with a crack for it sooner rather than later.

After doing a few Internet searches, it seems that A. Ubisoft has done this with several games in the past and B. that there is a fairly loud voice of outrage over it, not only by those, like me, who don't play over the Internet, but those who would like the option of using the game when an Internet connection isn't available. Oddly enough, the same game for Wii or Xbox doesn't have this requirement.

If the game plays like Ubisoft's previous sims, I'm sorry I won't be able to see it. Thanks Ubisoft.",1.0
"THE GAME IS CRAP!
I WONDER WHY THIS GAME IS STILL ON SALE IF YOU CAN'T PLAY IT
I F**KING NEED MY MONEY BACK!
I'M NEVER THIS PISSED OFF AND VULGAR",1.0
"I really enjoyed the previous version of Hawx and other Ubisoft flight ""sims"", however I wasn't thrilled about this game needing permanent Internet connection. Since it's been out for nearly 4 years, I figured ""what the heck"", the bugs would have been patched and it might be worth a try - it wasn't.

The game doesn't work on my PC. Installation was fairly long, but smooth, however as soon as you try to load the actual gameplay, you are rewarded with a ""Failed to restore network connection"" error message. Ubisoft has several solutions for this, including opening the PC's firewall, turning the PC into a DMZ (via the router) or opening several ports on the router. These are fairly easy to do, but despite several attempts and reconfigurations, it still didn't work!

The only other option would be to download a ""crack"" to bypass the Internet requirement, but using unauthorized cracks isn't something I care to do.

I understand that some people have gotten this game to work, and that's great. I tried it on a fairly simple PC which met or exceeded the game's requirements and had a strong Internet connection - still no dice.

Apparently the games current following is pretty limited and the company has lost interest; unfortunately so have I.
Thanks Ubisoft.",1.0
They work great for awhile but now I have had 3 break and stop working completely.,1.0
"I bought this thing, it didn't work, then discovered after much Googling that it is not compatible with Vista.  Great.

On the ""help page"", it says (and I quote verbatim), ""BUT for the N64 joypad, isn't ALL joypad can working steady since the structure of N64 joypad is very complex, so we can't 100% guarantee your N64 joypad can 100% work. You have to think over it before you decide to buy this device.""

"It's a cool piece of hardware in theory, but it needs to be re-worked. I found out the hard way that this didn't work. I was hoping to play SSB64 online but wasn't able (even after hours of research and searching for drivers) to get it to work on my Windows 7 PC.

I does not work properly. It only gives some functionality to the N64 controller and the PS2 controller it doesn't work at all. The Logitech controller for PC is an adequate replacement for PS2 but the N64 controller is a custom device. With the right driver this adapter could work.,1.0
"This adapter has not worked at all for me with any N64 controller (I tried two), and barely works with a PS2 controller.

"I got this thing several years ago and I must say it is junk. The ps1 controller aspect worked fine but I bought this for the n64 adapter. That was a nightmare, when trying to calibrate it, the button detection and throddle were all over the place. I just today found that the power port to the n64 female was broken, I resoldered it and to my horror it was outputting 4.13 volts! The range should be 3.20-3.40 volts otherwise you risk damaging the controller. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1.0
"This thing is cheap and defective, DOES NOT WORK on N64 side, When calibrating, says random buttons are being pressed, DO NOT BUY",1.0
"Do not buy from this joke. It says it was new, it was not, I plugged it in, it does not work, I asked for a refund, no response, asked to send it back for my money back, no response. this person is a joke and a looser",1.0
"Look, I went into the configuration to set the controller to the game, but all of the button signals were being sent through the device all at once! Basically, it was pushing every button at one time! Good for those who bought it and it worked. Amazon sells another kindof device that had WAY higher ratings and MUCH MUCH better customer satisfaction rate. May Flash N64 Controller Adapter for PC USB.",1.0
"This thing doesn't work.  It comes with no instructions.  It comes with a ""CD"" with all the drivers on it but nothing works even when you install it.  It doesn't have any configuration instructions or even gives a general idea on what to do.  Don't buy it.  Just buy a used N64 instead.  Waste of money.  I am waiting to return mine.

"The shipping on this thing was fast and reliable, but, as others have discovered, it doesnt work. I bought it mainly for the N64, and it will not calibrate under XP. Ive got the same random button press issues everyone is talking about. I can't understand how this thing got any good reviews, but I noticed all the good reviews are from a year or two ago. All the recent ones say it's crap. I'm inclined to agree. The CD is a confusing hodgepodge of Engrish, Chinese, and a few .inf driver files from 2002 here and there. And mine had a piece of broken plastic rattling around inside to top everything else off. I want to send this back for a return, but I doubt they'd give me my money back. I'd avoid this like the plague.",1.0
This adapter requires some stupid software that is for Windows XP 32-bit only and is in CHINESE. There was no indication of this whatsoever. You're a con artist.,1.0
"This is easily the worst thing I have ever ordered! when i first plugged it in Vista recognized it and installed the drivers just fine, and the emulators would recognize the controller, but it would not work. AT ALL!!! Don't buy this!",1.0
"I was interested in this product for the n64 part.  Retrolink makes SNES and NES controllers for PC but no N64.
Trying to get a PS2 controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS2 copy of their controller that goes through native USB.

I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP3 32 bit and GNU/Linux Kernel 2.6+, same results.

PS1 Controller: (Both official Sony controllers)
Dualshock (Analog sticks): Worked, but the back L and R buttons (L2 and R2) would not trigger.  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly.
Original (No Analog sticks): Worked perfect.  Back L and R buttons work.

PS2 MadCatz Controller:
Didn't work at all.  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller.
Had no authentic ps2 controllers to test.

N64:
I had two controllers to test with it.
Transparent purple:  Every button worked, but the analog stick would not go %100.  Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it %100.  Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly.
Gray:  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly.

Maybe I got a bad one, but I really think this thing sucks.

"The product arrived, and like others I had problems. I had the random button press issues, and it was definitely on the right toggle setting (on the other toggle setting, it got constant input regardless of state, whereas sometimes I could track which buttons were being pressed on the current toggle). After playing for a little bit, I pulled the four screws out of the plastic and looked at the board. The wire soldering was not well done, and by pressing down on some of the connections I was able to stop some of the noise. Unfortunately, releasing pressure goes right back to random button presses. I'm sure some of these are well put together, but if you order it you're basically going for a crap shoot, at least on the n64 side. I don't have any PS2 controllers to try, so maybe that was done more reliably but I doubt it.",1.0

"I received the game controller converter pretty quickly, considering it's the holiday season.  There was a mini-cd inside the box with drivers and a manual.  I didn't need it though, since I had windows 7 64-bit, which already includes the drivers.  Windows recognized it as a 4-axis 16-button controller.  When I initially tried to use the N64 controller, the calibration test went bonkers, with buttons randomly being pressed and the crosshairs all over the place.  I plugged in a PS2 controller and flipped the switch to the PS2 port.  I had success with this one for about a day, it worked beautifully.  The following day, I couldn't get it to work at all.  Re-installed the driver, reset calibration, even plugged in the N64 controller at the same time, nothing made a difference.  Sumoto had no tech support of any kind that I could find.  I've spent an hour or 2 trying to troubleshoot this thing, and I think I'm done with it.  Time to go shopping for another converter... this time, doing some research on how successful the converter works.",1.0

DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! they take a the case (as seen in picture) and put a 64 mb save card in it expecting you not to find out! these are NOT 128 mb card! they are 64mb cards with a case that tells you its 128!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL END UP WITH A TERRIBLY MADE 64 mb CARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS PRODUCT IS AS MUCH OF A SCAM AS CAN BE!!!!!!!!,1.0
This card never worked...online help sites say to only use Sony brand memory cards.  Don't fall for the large capacity and low price...you will waste your money.,1.0
"Duplicate, cheap product. Won't recommend unless you are looking for a cheap backup to store, play. Retuned these product immediately.",1.0
"I tried using the memory card when I got it and it would not read the card. After a while of researching about how to use a memory card, I found a suggestion to untighten some screws on the back. THAT DOES NOT WORK!! This company is a joke and needs to refund money for this scam!",1.0
"I purchased this product and I give it no stars. It is defe,tive. The information on the card kept corrupting through no fault of my own and now won't even format any information. Am very disappointed in this product and for having wasted my money.",1.0
This memory card did not work can not save any gaming on this card. There is something wrong with the desk,1.0
t he memory card says it has 128mb but won't let me put on 99kb of free space for a game,1.0
"It works only when wanting to, I thought it was initially cause the console was old, so i purchased a new one last week, and it acts the exact same way. sometimes it loads up, sometimes it don't, sometimes it loads up but says its unformated, others, it says it doesn't have enough space for a save, when it has more than 90% of the 128mb still available. and also sometimes it will say no memory card in slot available.  This is so worthless, I think I'll rather use this for a databank sort of holder, and just play off of a normal 8mb one, copy and pasting within the ps2 browser option, cause this is to frustrating to deal with on a regular playing basis.",1.0
Not worth the trouble....this device is very frustrating because everytime you reset the consule you would have to take out memory card again and replace it back in for it to work again...,1.0
The memory card could only save PS2 data on it but the PS2 couldn't read from it. I don't know if it's because Sony's stamp isn't on this or if the PS2 was just dirty. But this product did not work the way it's suppose too.,1.0
"The seller was fine and not misleading but the product is not good.  Easily corruptible data and though the size is good, it's not useful when you can't save anything on it.  Just go get a Sony memory card.",1.0
"When I bought this card, it said Sony 128MB memory card for Playstation 2.....but when arrived, I noticed that it wasn't a Sony card, plus it didn't work!",1.0
didnt work do not buy i shouldve read other comments first wasn't reconized by ps2 couldn't save any game is not a sony brand its a 3rd party piece of junk save yourself and do some research 1st sony never made a 128mb only 8mb their 128 was a 128k,1.0
Not much more to say about this. The product just simply does not work. It really is very unfortunate. Sigh,1.0
Did NOT work (Memory Card was filled with corrupted data that I could not erase). Get what you pay for I suppose. Would be better to buy one sold by Sony.,1.0
"i ordered & paid for 128mb memory card. what i got was a 64mb memory card. thats 1/2 the memory. dispite that, 12 bucks for a 64mb is still a great deal so i'll just keep it and save the hassle of returning it. but i'm still only giving 1 star because i got screwed out of half the memory that i paid for.

so be advised, if you order this product, you might receive a 64mb card instead of the 128mb card. so don't be shocked if you do.",1.0
"I bought this thinking that an 8MB card would be to small. So I figured getting a larger one would be alright. I was wrong. One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this.
 The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time.

So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB. Besides 8MB will go a long way.",1.0
"The amount of data this can store is amazing but I had one huge issue with it that makes me regret buying it. My PS2 only recognizes it for some games. Other games like Genji always say that there is no memory card in the slot. And when it does recognize that there is a card in the slot, it says that it is unable to save the game onto it. Don't get this card if you plan to actually use it as your main memory card.",1.0
"i bought it for the kid's christmas.  they FINALLY tried to use it yesterday.  it was chipped at the connector.  i HATE having to take things back, sending or taking things back to the store (especially inexpensive stuff) wastes gas and/or postage.  (and also it wastes my time).  so i'll just use it as a paperweight.  however, i won't be buying this type again.  i live in a rural area.  it's quite a drive to the post office.  i wish that amazon would come up with some policy that you didn't have to send a broken thing back.  just more trouble than it's worth.",1.0
"This memory card is absolutely horrible... It loses saved games, misreports its storage size and is completely incompatible with various third-party products and software.",1.0
"I would highly recommend anyone looking for a memory card not made by Sony for the Playstation 2 to cease and desist! I purchased one of these for the additional memory so I wouldn't have to purchase additional memory cards in the future other than a backup.  This card has so far has cost my son and I the entire game of Lego Star Wars Original trilogy and half of Lego Batman due to corrupted data on this card. I still have and use memory cards from the mid to late 90s that I have never experienced corrupted data issues that caused me to lose 20 cars and 8 million dollars in Gran Turismo 1 & 2, and too many levels in many other games along the way.  I cannot truly say wether this is a PS2, game software, or a memory card issue for certain in all fairness. But it's certainly the only time this has ever occurred in 15 years of game play by using a non-Sony made card.

Our PS2 is on a UPS, battery side, and has had no power surges or electrical issues to put forth for additional consideration; we unplug everything during thunderstorms and other occasions of bad weather (Florida).

Please consider before purchasing this product; it's a complete bummer to see everything you've earned wiped clean over two games. It does however give you a great excuse to replay the games to leave it on a positive.",1.0
"At first it worked fine, Then all of a sudden it lost all the memory, My ps2 didn't even know it had the card in. Don't buy this I returned the one I got.",1.0
"this is a waste of money!! it wouldn't save my game,the memory card is empty and it said that i didn't have enough memory to save it. don't waste your money on this piece of crap!",1.0
"The review about a PS2 not reading the card is accurate. I tried the ""screw trick"", but it did not work for me. My PS2 does not recognize the card. This may not be typical of ""ALL"" PS2's, but this 128MB card does not work with my PS2. In my opinion, you are better off buying a Sony PS2 Memory Card. If the card is genuine Sony, You know it will work.",1.0
Fake! Doesn't work on ps2 at all! Don't buy this product! Get the original 8MB SONY version!!!,1.0
"Be warned... the information page indicates that this is a Sony item, but not only is it a third-party item, but nowhere on the packaging does it indicate just who made it!  (Stupid me for not carefully reading the reviews beforehand...)

  By putting the package model number (HC2-10080) into a Google search, I found that nobody else seems to know the manufacturer either!

  Plus, there are multiple reports of the memory being slow and unreliable.  I might just have to return this... $20 for a knockoff, and a probable junk one at that?  Hmm...

Amazon, change your manufacturer line... the Sony name doesn't belong there!",1.0
"this item wasn't great. i thought it would be awesome because it was 128MB but it hardly worked. i felt like i was using an old nintendo console where i had to take the memory card out, blow on it, and put it back into the memory slot on my PS2 and repeat this process until my PS2 will recognize the card. not recommended",1.0
This is not liscened by SONY. Do not get this. It will fail on you at one point or another!!!!!!,1.0
This item does not work with my son's PS2.  How do we return it?????,1.0
"A 128MB card sounds great. And it would be, if it actually worked. I read a few 1 star reviews, but bought one anyway. First I tried to move the game saves from my old 8MB card over. Some copied over, but others wouldn't (with no explanation). Then I tried to play GH: Metallica. Wouldn't let me create a save. I tried another game. Same problem. Waste of my money. Don't waste yours.",1.0
"Ok, so I read the reviews and thought to myself I shouldn't buy it..Well I found it for as low as $11.00 as it retails for like $90.00 on some websites so I thought what the heck for that cheap price, I'd try it anyway..I'm so dissapointed, I don't know where to start?? The box says stereo quality music??So I thought it would be like listening to the radio, um no..It was like listening to a video game..Who gets motivated with music like that?? Then the dance pad is cheap and hardly works right..Its bad really bad..I thought I was getting a good deal and would have fun with it, no..Please don't waste any money..Its not worth a penny...Listen to this review as I should have listened..Very unsatisfied..Its not worth the star I gave it but I had to put at least one or the review wouldn't take..",1.0
I bought this as a gift to my nieces and I was very disappointed.  It did not come with any instructions so we had to try to figure out how to use it.  It seemed very cheaply made and not worth it!,1.0
Was advertised and even referred to as a Dance Dance Revolution tv pad and its not a brand name as advertised. If you are going to refer to a specific product and use the name of the product then sell THAT product not a knock off....just before christmas when there is no other option. We were disappointed that we didn't have an authentic brand name product. It is obviously a lesser quality as far a workmanship and the music and graphics leave a lot to be desired. We will be very careful from now on when purchasing something online to make sure the product is what it is being sold as.....,1.0

"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this one. We had gotten an equally awful version for Christmas and my daughter discovered the real DDR system in her vision therapy class at school. It is supposed to be great for cooridination issues. We thought we'd get a ""real"" ddr for home this summer. THIS IS NOT IT. It is even worse than the Christmas one. You can step exactly the same on the pad in the exact same time and way and you'll get random results. Once it says you were PERFECT, next MISSED. Horrible for coordination training since it gives innacurate feedback. False advertising since it is a cheap knock off.",1.0
"This is only an imitation of the DDR, there is not even the name of the maker on the box. I own a kiddie version of the DDR-TV (no console) by Kunami, and the quality of sounds and graphics are way above this one. Here, the ""music"" is barely an electronic tempo, and the welcome screen says 2004...  Don't waste your money, and look for something else.",1.0

"I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me, I decided not to spend the money on a new one. However, I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement. I should have spent the money on a new Xbox. This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box. Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated ""beeping"" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality. It wasn't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home. I wish I had sent it back without opening it. Now I'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take.",1.0
I feel completely misled by the ads for this product.  This is NOT the same dance dance revolution I constantly see on Nintendo ads and in the arcades like I thought it was.  I should have read the reviews first.  I only hope to get my money back easily from the seller.  I was waiting for this for a week after learning what a great workout DDR is.  This particular product has graphics I haven't seen since the early 90s and you can barely tell what the songs are because the audio is like from an Atari game from the 70s.  There's only one speed and the dance pad doesn't do anything!  DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!,1.0
"This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 ""songs"" all sound the same.  They are not ""radio"" or ""stereo"" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!!",1.0

Over four months later it still smells just as bad. I highly recommend NOT BUYING THIS!",1.0
"The shipping was prompt, but the product is crap! Nothing like what was advertised, infact this is VERY false representation. The game has an original nintendo look to it, and no well known songs, also the music is such bad quality, seriously like listening to atari. DONT buy this product, you will regret it. I only wish I had read the reviews, before buying it. It would have saved me from the extreme disappointment.",1.0
"This game pad was wretched- it has very limited sensitivity and the graphics were broken. The music was in midi format- (Like listening to atari) and not at all fun.
Also: it only takes batteries. If you buy it in the store, it includes an AV converter to plug it in, but the cheap-o's at this company remove that from the box.
DO NOT BUY THIS!",1.0

It might as well be labeled DDR for you cellphone, the graphics and music are horrible. At least your cell phone could play decent music. Doom had better music to dance too. As I too bought this not wanting to spend the money on a console it not worth it. You'll be sorely disappointed. mannyman",1.0
"I wish i would have read more customer reviews before i wasted my time waiting for this game.  I was trying to avoid buying a playstation because i don't play video games but this is just sad.  Horrible horrible graphics, songs don't have any kind of beat. do not waste your time.",1.0
If you're looking for an atari quality video game then this is your game. I thought that the graphics as well as the music was absolutely horrible.,1.0
"This is a very cheap version of DDR.  It shouldn't be worth paying anything at all for it.  Most of the time it doesn't register the steps and even though there are 50 songs, they have no distinguishable beat and are really cheaply produced.  I cant think of one good reason to buy this game.",1.0
"I had an understanding when I purchased this item that it would not be as good as the PS2/Xbox versions (esp. concerning the graphics) but I thought that the sound (advertised as ""stereo quality"") would make it worth saving money. I was dead wrong. I don't know how sensitive the pad actually is because the songs were too indiscernable to find a beat. Don't waste your money on this product.",1.0

I bought this for my two daughters (7 & 8at the time) for last Christmas.  They were not excited about it.  They tried it once and could not keep up.  They felt very frustrated and never played it again.  The music and graphics stink.,1.0
This is one of the cheapest made products I have ever purchased in my life. The music is not real songs just a bunch of electronic noises and the graphics are so 1980's. It reminds me of an Atari game I got when they first came out. I purchased two for gifts but then ended up sending them back. One even looked like it had been used then reboxed as new. The seller has no phone number so you have to email them. They won't pay for return shipping nor will they refund original shipping charges to you. Make sure you pay with the Amazon payment system because you can us their A-Z Gtd to get your money back.,1.0
Some people believe it was a mod that added content to the GTA:SA. but the mod wasn't a mod at all but unlocked content that was already in the game. Without the mod however there was no way to get the hidden scene. On the console version you have to use a gameshark or similar device.,1.0

"This switch is very poor quality, but the thing I really didn't like about it is that from a cable management point of view it just couldn't be worst. The cables come in from four different directions which turns your system into a cable rats nest. I used it for about a week until the Cables to Go 28750 4x2 SVideo/Composite/Stereo Audio Selector Switch arrived from Amazon. This unit has 3 of the input  connectors and the 2 output connectors on the same side of the box with the switches and the other input connector on the other side of the box. This is a much cleaner approach to cable management and works much better from the user standpoint.",1.0
"I find the quality very lacking an am afraid to swithc it from one system to the other as the switch is so flimsy if you don't hv just right the quality of the picture is compromised and unsatisfactory. for the cost it isn't worth sending back, but I definitely wouldn't recomend this purchase to anyone",1.0
"The item did not work at all.  After plugging in all of the cords, nothing happened.  The idea is good, but the product is junk.",1.0
I didn't think for the price this was going to be the best product. It did not work properly for me; I believe only one of the switches actually worked. It was not worth the hassle of trying to get it replaced or a new one. I noticed only later that Amazon carries more expensive but I am guessing better products also.,1.0
This switch is a piece of junk. Both the video and audio output terminals are intermittent. I can see why they lowered the price. It should be zero.,1.0
"Bought three of these pretty cheap.  didn't have high expectations based on proice.  Took 6-8 weeks to get to me.  I forgot that I even ordered them.  They lived up to my expectations, but the the price was right.  I'll have to spend a little more money next time.",1.0
It arrived broken and never worked. Can tell that it is a super cheaply made product. Spend a little more money to get one that will actually work.,1.0
"Did not work. Took forever to get here, did not work. Would have cost more to return it and get a replacement or refund than it was worth. Went to the trash.",1.0
"When I first hooked up the item, things worked very smooth. It did exactly what I needed it to do without any hassle...
But shorty after (a few weeks) the item is having major problems.. It might be the cord it shipped with, or the signal it's sending out, but it's not working like it should any more. I have a new TV with more hookups and don't exactly need this product anymore, so it just sits around, broken.",1.0
"I must have received a faulty product. I'm glad to see it worked for others, however, it didn't work for me. I've tried the suggested configuration on the diagram shown on the product encasing. Didn't work. I've tried different cables (thinking it could be a faulty cable) but no, it still didn't work. All I get is a half-way, static sound connection and no video. I'm assuming one of the sound connections (either the Left or Right) and the Video doesn't work. The product is a great idea but with poor execution and cheap materials (including the flimsy encasing.) I'm quite unhappy with it. Just a warning to those who would like to purchase this. Most unfortunately, it is a case of ""you get what you pay for"".",1.0
"I was able to sometimes get the video and occasionally one of the audio sides to work, but if I switched to a different component and back I would often lose what I had working.

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032ANC8M/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 is what I got instead and everything is working fine with it.  So spend a few ($6-7) more dollars and get one that actually works!",1.0
Not worth shipping back as a return because it costs less than shipping. The item did not work out if one side which defeated the entire purpose of the item. Waste of effort. Made of cheap materials. Didn't even want to bother writing this but I don't want other people to be as pissed off as I am,1.0
"To say that this barely works is to give it a kindness of which it is unworthy. It literally did nothing when it was fresh out of the box, but at five dollars, what do you expect? Not only did this do nothing, it was also scratched up before I so much as opened it. The whole thing is utterly pointless, the single most efficient way of wasting money short of ordering blu-ray players and sending them to strangers.",1.0
This item did not work.  The video port was OK but neither of the Audio Ports worked at all.  I have junked it.,1.0
"I usually wouldn't tell someone not to buy from a company, if I received a defective product. It's going to happen w/ electronic devices. However, when I received this A/V switch and opened the box, the switch was already falling out of the packaging. It was obvious that it had been opened previously because someone stapled it back together. Further, the a/v cords were just bunched up and shoved back into the package (no twisty tie or anything). However, I still figured I'd plug it in and give it a go, as it looked new. If it worked fine, no worries. However, I plugged my compenents into the switch and only the audio would work... no video. Tried all 3 inputs... audio but no video. So, I could only conlude that the video output jack was bad or not soldered correctly. Then it infuriated me that someone must've discovered the same issue and returned it... only for this company to repackage it and ship it out to me. For that, I would recommend not ordering from this company. The company is YNF Trading Inc. (Abco Deals).",1.0
"I haven't even made it to the testing stage to see if all 3 inputs work. There are several reviews saying 1 or 2 or even all 3 inputs don't work so we'll see. I'm doubtful. The RCA cables provided with the product are the thinnest and cheapest feeling I've ever seen. I plugged the video cable into the back of the TV without applying much force at all. Didn't move it perpendicular to the jack in the slighest. The end of the pin snapped off in the jack, creating a very frustrating situation with the TV's future at risk. Thankfully they don't call me MacGyver for nothing. I had to heat up the end of a needle while holding it with pliers, push the red hot needle tip into the plastic middle of the stuck pin and wait for it to cool and then pull it out with said pliers.

I find it ridiculous that the cheapness of this product nearly cost us a TV, or the expense of taking it somewhere and having someone else deal with it. A real piece of crap.",1.0
"Easy plug and play, all outputs work, but all of them caused background horizontal lines traveling through my TV.  Tried direct from my cable, and it was fine.  Plugged it back through the switch box, and lines come up, and they're there from all of the outputs.  Also the RCA cables that came with it very very thin and flimsy.  Perhaps they're the cause for the lines.  I think I'll try connecting with better cables before returning the product.",1.0
"Purchased this product on the 9th of September, didn't receive it until the 29th, and it was broken. The selector switch was loose, the right audio output refused to put out anything.  Total waste of time and money. Save the frustration, and don't buy this product, and not from this company. When I let the company know i haven't received the adapter(9/26), they sent me the tracking #, which said there was no est. delivery date. that tells me it was never sent. On the 27th i received another email stating it arrived on the 27th, and would i verify. Again I didn't receive it until the 29th. They lied to me, or they don't know what they are doing. Either way I strongly suggest NOT doing business with CE Compass",1.0
This product is incredible poor quality. Its super flimsy and just plugging in the RCA Cables you get a feel for how cheap the product is. At last when you actually test the performance after you've made all your connections is when you realize you bought a first class piece of junk!,1.0
The design of the AV switcher is nice and what appealed to me. Output ports in the back and the inputs forward facing. Everything else is trash. The AV ports don't hold the cables in. The cables just keep falling out. The selector switch is flimsy to say the least. There's no resistance to it so it slides to another input on its own.,1.0
i was happy that order couple of this product becaouse the first one broke so easy at the time i was connecting the sys. ????????????? will not recomended,1.0

"Well, one of the cords lasted almost a day, the other is still working, however, I had to secure it myself due to the lack of quality on this product.

The wiring is not shielded, but so far, no interference. The wiring goes into the connection harness, however, it is a push through hole and has no anchoring. The only thing holding the connector to the wiring is the soldering points. I have not even put any pressure on the wire, and it fell apart. The other I taped up so that the wiring would not be constantly pulling on the connection points.

I pulled apart the one that broke and found the connectors to be made of a poor quality that had oxidation and corrosion. The wire guage is so small that a soldering iron will melt right through the wiring. 3 of the connections were broken at the pin/wire soldering point, and the others were broken pins themselves.

"I was only 5 years old my first time playing this game back in Christmas of 1997. I was never able to get past the first couple levels then. But I always loved this game. It was magic back then. The graphics were also great THEN. Second time around, I was 12 and it was 2004. I was able to finally finish the entire game and find all the secrets to. Now in 2012, I had the urge to replay this game again. To get those feeling of being so young. I'm 19, and the magic is completely gone, and for ONE REASON.

BE WARNED...... if you have a full HD TV and have a PS3, and bought a physical copy of this game......the playback visuals of this game will be absolutely HORRIBLE! It completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because EVERYTHING is so pixelated if you will. Like I NEVER remembered this game looking so bad before, but I have to assume it had always looked this way but I was in a different era of technology then. HD TVs are completely unforgiving to these types of games. I'm not sure if the the digital copy available on the PSN is any better, but the actual physical copy is not meant for a HD display even in it respective aspect ratio. Maybe just playing this game on standard definition TV might help, but I haven't tried that either. I will just have to remember the game like when I was young as the best PS1 game I ever played and then later the only one I ever beat. To the future gamers!",1.0

"I *hate* this game.  Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.

You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing.

You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.

It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.

Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.

The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it.

WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.

WWF War Zone also started the popular ""create a wrestler"" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.

I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.

If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.",1.0
"There's several things I want to say about this ""limited edition"" ogre battle. It is ""like"" the super nes versioin the way that you still control the battle from over head and you get the tarot cards etc...but they ""updated"" the graphics and make some changes in the way the battle map is displayed, gave the characters a little battle action movement, meaning: they give the fighters a little more swing in their sword and the spells have a little more action in them. You are also given the option of watching the battle action movement of character (how they swing etc) different formations for your ""stock"" including listing by str, agi, ali, charisma and more. That sounds great right? not so much and here's why...

They (meaning Atlus) changed the size ratio and now the map won't your TV screen, the game lags and sputters (you can watch the battle curser aka sword sputter like a old nissan across the battle map, the reputation bar is so skinny and tall you cant really see where you stand in reputation cuase it looks like you are at neutral at all times. The time it takes to save or load your game is ridiculous! Several times I thought the game had frozen when it was really just saving. There's also the loading time to each map which is also too long and when you are searching for treasure and the game keeps giving you baddies and you need to reset/reload the game you can plan on taking up a second hobby to fill in the time to reload the game AND the area map. They changed the intro music to the game and it now sounds like tactics ogre?? Identity crisis? Hey Atlus maybe you should recall all the people from ""quest"" and then redo the game. THE BEST part instead of the original ogre battle where the troops would take whatever land movement they were best suited for and come for other towns and your troops, NOW The enemies go straight to your base???!!!??? What the hey! Just stand at your base and defend it. No strategy required.

I call this atlus "" Perfecting the already perfect"". If you want to play ogre battle re-buy a SNES and get the real deal.",1.0

"Where to begin with this train wreck of a game.  Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better.

Story and Characters
They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game.

Play Control
Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity.

Stages & Backgrounds
The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring.

Challenge
This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid.

Verdict
Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.

"...in order as I did and were old enough to discern the difference in quality between the first two and this game you may despise this game as much as I did/do. My main problem with TM3 is that it has terrible physics for a fast action game. Flipping over every two seconds during high adrenaline moments was not fun for me. It felt too loose, like every car was some giant 70's mobile or something. In my view the best Twisted Metal experience can be had with TM1, TM2, and TM: Black. I also highly recommend Rogue Trip, the game most of the same developers made after making TM2.",1.0

I found none of these things.  There are only 4 new characters, Club Kid, Auger, Flamethrower, and my favorite new driver, Flower Power.  The levels, especially Washington DC, is a small open level, which is no fun.  The North Pole is annoying, and I hate the boring London level.  The graphics are cheesy, and 989 studios tried to make them look too real.  The cars flip over with every tight turn you make, when another car hits you, or you drive onto a hill.  This game is not realistic.  This game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the TM title.  I warn you, do not even look at this game.  It is the worst.  The car combat genre is in shame.",1.0

I can say on honestly, on a positive note Amazon and Galactics resolved my issue immediately which I appreciate very much. I wish I had the opportunity to play the game I always wanted as a child.",1.0
"Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good.  I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.

If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the ""running around half-naked female shooter/adventure"" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.

Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)

It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.

By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.

At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.

Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.

BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.  Let the series END already.",1.0
"It was difficult to get it to work. Once it finally started, it continued to freeze. Does not match the quality listed",1.0
"This game is ok, but mostly mediocre. This is the best that the N64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2? Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark. The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage.  This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be. The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission.
Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance.  Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category, especially the funfactor.
So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title. Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre - your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least. They haven't made anything decent since though",1.0

"I adore the TR games & I have completed them all except for this one.  I have tried to get into it and have started it on 3 separate occasions.  I just do not find it fun.  The most frustrating aspect is the save crystals.  This game is unreasonably hard in some sections yet you are afraid to save and waste a save crystal in case you need it more later on.  I don't feel the crystals add to the challenge of the game.  They just make the game annoying.
Don't waste your time and money.  Just enjoy the rest of the TR series and pretend this one didn't happen.",1.0
"When I first got the game a few months ago, I was really excited and played the heck out of it, but I ended up having to take a break due to life getting busy. When I come back to play the game, it turned out that it had erased my save that I had put 30 hours into. It was really depressing and I am very unhappy that my time was wasted. I wouldn't recommend buying it from this seller, as they obviously don't check their games for these issues.",1.0
"Though I ordered this two months ago I just now able to try it out. At first I thought my N64 was broken, but it turns out the game doesn't work. Because I didn't have a chance to play it until now I have to bite the bullet and take a loss on this bogus purchase.",1.0

I thought Red Alert was a pretty fun game. This was just a clone of red alert though. The people that make C&C need to come up with some more ideas. All the C&C games are exactly the same. I didn't like Red Alert to start with so Tiberian Sun has to be worse.,1.0
"Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money. Uneven gameplay,and few options plague this game,it is also way too short even at this reduced price.

"oooohhhh ahhh, New Graphics, New Weapons. God, ALL they did was change the environment. The Characters look worse then the original C & C games.

If you haven't played the original C&C I  guess you can give it a try, trust me there are better games anyways.",1.0
"To all thoses who like C & C Tiberian Sun, get Earth 2100and you will see what a disappointment C & C TS is. How do you turn such a fantastic game (C&C of old) into a $5 bin game.

"The last two weeks prior tom the release of this game made my anticipation grow to herculian proportions. I was a big fan of the first two releases, so...  Damn, was I dissapointed when I played the game at first.  Basically  not much has changed since red alert and it's add-ons. Graphics and  userinterface are unchanged but for a few minor details. The game would be  top of the bill about three years ago, but it was outperformed by several  titles even before TS came out. And all I could think was: is this what  they have been working on for three years?",1.0

When I ran the grand prix as the most pretentious character in this game as a four year old against my dad I never conceived the notion that it would one be worth $60 just because its a Mario Kart game. I'm not sure how to feel about that because it sure as hell isn't a rare game that justifies such a price tag. My advice to anyone who wants this game is to go prod garage sale and get it for a buck. Its not rare or special in any way what so ever and you will find it if you look around enough.,1.0
"When i rented this i returned it after about a half hour. It's the worst game i've ever played besides the sequel or donkey kong 64(which is basically Banjo-Kazooie with a different liscense). To like this game, I'd say you have to have the brain capacity of a dead cow! I appologize to all dead cow enthusiasts for that comment, let me correct myself. You'd have to have the brain capacity of a dead snail to enjoy it. Once again I apologize for the dead snails who wouldn't even like this game.",1.0

Terrible graphics, especially compared to the PS Triple's, no voice acting, boring puzzles, and above all, it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game.

For a good Zelda game, I recommend Link: The Faces of Evil, The Wand of Gamelon, or Zelda's Adventure.",1.0
mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think]. I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i don't like racing games. The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified.,1.0
this game has no plot and its gameplay [is bad] you don't do anything else but ride things to the top of some tower and once you get to the top its the end of the game so don't get this game.,1.0
This game is overated. I got this game I got this for christmas this year and i was disapointed with goldeneye. All you have to do is run past stupid guards. The guns don't have real names. PP7? Its PPK. You even hear that in the movie. The guards all have the same faces. This is more like a russian massacre. I once put a happy face infront of a gaurd and he didn't notice. The solo missions are boring. Bond is not supposed to go to the bunker. The multi player is boring unless there are 3 or 4 players. This game is only good for people who really like bond,1.0
"If anyone knows how to escape from the giant magic tree, please god contact me. Ive been stuck there for 6 years and its causing sleep loss, dperession etc. Anyways, i don't like this game very much, although probably becauase ive lost many friends due to the thousands of hours ive commited to its luminous glow and wind boggling theme tune. Overall, its a bit wick.

"I found Half-Life to be somewhat interesting, although it started to run thin by the ending levels. Not many of the levels were amazing, either. Just long hallways, small rooms, and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up. I like 3D games that let you be outside, looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles. Half-Life just didn't cut it in this  arena.
Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  gore/violence that is present throughout the game. When your science  project goes wrong, you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor! Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what? When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts (who are the best  enemies), it gets even more grotesque. If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy, expect to see a wall covered with blood. Sure, you can  turn it off, but it does very little good. The blood is still very  disturbing. This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable.  I am not a parent saying this, either, I'm a teenager.
Aside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels, the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities. If you want a weekend of pure hell (both keeping you  stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely) then buy this game.  Otherwise, don't bother.",1.0
