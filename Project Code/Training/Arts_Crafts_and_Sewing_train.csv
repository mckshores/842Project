"I have several quilting books and this is my favorite by far.  How she lays out the cutting and fabric yardage is really nice.  I like to make my baby quilts a little bigger than what she allots for, but it is very easy to adjust her instructions.  I pretty much use this book to make all of my quilts, no matter how big or small.  Plus her ""general directions"" are wonderful for the beginner quilter.",5.0
"Here's my problem -- I work full time, and have an active family.  Now a very close family friend is having a baby shower for her daughter in the next month.  So far so good -- I can get one quilt done that fast.  But then she announces that it is twins.  I don't want to take shortcuts and make 'blah' quilts. And I do want to make quilts rather than purchase a gift.  So I bought this book and I love it.  The quilts at the beginning are very simple and appropriate for complete beginners.  The quilts at the end are a little more complicated, and look lovely.  The later quilts use triangles, which I would not recommend to a complete beginner.  But even so, they will go together easily.  I should be able complete 2 quilts if I can find 2 free evenings in the next couple of weeks.",5.0
"yes, it's meant to be for baby/toddler quilts.  However, just change the fabric and colors and, tadaaaa you have a lap quilt for an adult.  Easy patterns, with terrific instructions.  I have made 10 quilts from this book, using various patterns.  And have 3 more ready to quilt. Never boring, shows the patterns in vivid colors and then again in pastels.  I rate this book higher than the other Ursula books, (sorry Ursula).  A great ""Primer"" for those just starting to quilt, or don't want to spend a lot of time fussy cutting, and would like to have a quilt in a few days. I have also enlarged the quilts and have found the patterns are very friendly in increasing the amount of squares or blocks.",5.0
"This is my favorite of Ursula's 3 books, much easier than the other two (which are also wonderful) and VERY easy to adapt to the growing child.  I currently have 6 of her designs in que for quilting for babies due, to friends and family AND am an avid scrapbooker, work part-time, raising twin toddlers...YOU CAN DO IT with this book!  If you can sew a straight line, you can make a quilt!  I give this book to anyone even thinking of learning to quilt.  The ""recipes"" are easy and very understandable!",5.0
"10 different quilts each photographed in bold colors and then in soft pastels.  This is an awesome detail because you would not believe how different each pattern looks just switching between bold and soft colors!!
The quilts are listed from easiest to ""most difficult"", but even the most difficult one could still be completed by a first time quilter!!  The patterns are beautiful yet so simple to create.
Instructions for each quilt are very clear and easy to follow.  The book even suggests which way to iron each and every seam!!
The instructions for each pattern will only make a ""baby"" size quilt, but because the instructions are so well laid out (especailly the material requirements) it is VERY easy to adapt the instructions to make a larger size quilt. (So it goes far beyond baby quilts!!!)
Oh, and did I mention how easy, Easy, EASY these quilts are to make??? The truly great thing about them though is they look far more sophisticated and complicated than they really are!
You will not be disappointed with this book!",5.0
"If you like to make baby quilts this is the book for you!  There are so many beautiful baby quilts in this book and they are easy to make!  I am a beginning quilter and have made 3 of the quilts in the book.  The instructions are clear and easy and they even have arrows pointing in the direction of which way to press your seams.  I really like the pictures of the different finished quilts shown in the book too, and the different variations of the same quilt.  I have very little creativity when it comes to putting fabric together for a quilt but this book gives you some inspiration!",5.0
"An excellent beginner book! I had never made a quilt before, and last night assembled a beautiful baby quilt for my future-niece! I just keep admiring it. I can't believe that I could make something so nice with so little effort. This book gives such easy to understand instructions through the entire quilting process. I am excited to use more patterns in the book. Wonderful book!",5.0
"I first encountered this sew-and-fold technique at a workshop. It was impressive. Even people who had at most a utilitarian acquaintance with needle and thread were able to create a beautiful folded pinwheel figure in the center of an organza square. I was therefore delighted when the book finally came out.

How it works:

1. Start with one of the authors' patterns of dots, transferred to a piece of fabric.

2. With needle and thread, in the order specified, pick up a few threads of the fabric in the center of each dot.

3. Pause every so often to draw the thread up tighter, smoothing and straightening the origami-like folds as they form.

4. Optionally, iron the folded figure when you're done.

That's all it takes; and if you work the project in a crisper fabric than the sample items Amazon shows as secondary images, the results are as precise as Moorish tiling patterns.",5.0
"If you like geometric patterns and you like fabric art, you will love this book. The projects are beautiful and the design options are endless. I am really inspired by what can be acheived with these fabric folding techniques. I love the dimension and texture that fabric folding adds to any project. I plan on incorporating these techniques into my art quilts. What fun!",5.0
"I met Chris Palmer once many many years ago at an origami convention in NYC. I was in awe at that time of his beautiful paper geometric origami designs...amazing to see in person...even more amazing to see them in fabric and so marvelously presented in this book.  The book itself is a work of art.  AND, the projects that the authors/artists include appear to be very achievable.  The technique as described looks like a most enjoyable game of ""connect the dots"" with a most beautiful end result. This book will appeal to origami enthusiasts and quilters or fabric artists alike.  Simply ""wonderfold""!",5.0
Excellent,5.0
So cool. Planning on making curtains using some things shown in this book.,5.0
"The title says it all.  The book thoroughly covers materials, technique and possible finished products.  I plan to use the technique to make lampshades soon.",5.0
"I bought this book as a gift for a talented friend.  I know that she will be so pleased with this creative approach to sewing and art.  I am so taken with the book, that I am going to buy a copy for my own use as well.  The book is beautiful, creative and well written.  I have been sewing for a long time, and I just love this fresh approach.",5.0
This is a lovely book with fantastic ways to create beauty with fabric folding.  Not for the beginning seamstress!,5.0
"I love this book.  It's like eye-candy for those of us who like to sew and create with fabric.  Time consuming techniques, yes, but the effort is well worth it.  I bought this book some time ago and put it away in my book stash until the mood struck me.  Now it has and I'm so glad I had this book in my library to arouse my creative genes!",5.0
This is a lovely book for those who like challenges and unique looks in fabric combined with the wonders of origami like folds. Fantastic and fancy to make.,5.0
The projects in this book look absolutely fabulous and very difficult.  However the very detailed instructions with many close up photos make success possible.,5.0
"So happy I bought this book! Easy to follow instructions and step bu step help. If you hide your stitching well and make the ties small, many of the designs can be reversed for a different and still beautiful design. (I love both sides of the fish-scale pattern that you see in the last project, the room divider.) A challenging, fun way to try new crafts or (as in my case) incorporate some of these origami inspired designs on clothing.

GREAT BOOK!!",5.0
I wanted unique designs for my crazy quilt and this book fulfilled my expectations. I plan to make more projects from this book in the future.,5.0
"You've heard and seen Origami, the Japanese paper-folding art. Chris Palmer, who studied under one of the Japanese masters, has extended it to folding fabric and creating geometric patterns that emerge when you backlight the cloth. (Confession:  I know Chris personally and even own one of his art pieces.) They look like tessellations, and the different thicknesses of material where multiple folds overlap give the patterns their density and bas relief look. In this book by Jeffrey Rutzky, Chris for the first time provides designs for you to make as well... the first time he has shared his special secrets with the world.",5.0
this book knocked my socks off! i have been a fashion and interior designer for over 30 yrs......this book will inspire you in many ways. great condition and on time.,5.0
"just looking at the pictures and thinking about the origami folds as a textile strategy makes your hair hurt and at the same time, it's like church should be: inspiring, uplifting, expanding and joyful.

If you work with paper or fabric, have a look.",5.0
"This book has helped me to transfer my paper origami and tessellation work into the meduium of fabric. The book is well set out, with good photos throughout. Instructions are clear. I recommend it.",5.0
"For those quilters who want to move into the art quilt arena, this is a good way to start thinking about something beyond standard piecing.",5.0
I have read this book -- interesting author with an interesting and unusual talent.  I think I just may have found a new addiction to rival my other fiber crafts.,5.0
"This book is about a sewing technique (it may have it's origins in origami but it's still a sewing tech) which may be inspiring to sewing enthusiasts who have pretty much tried & mastered (or not)other methods in the field of sewing. For me, personally, this is an exciting, newly discovered area of my much loved hobby. It seems to be based on what's called Canadian smocking.  The projects in the book are gorgeous, and I cannot wait to try my hand at shadowfolding :).  Great job, Palmer/Rutzky!
Samina, American Sewing Guild",5.0
"I love this book.  I'd like to emphasize that the instructions are very easy to understand and to follow. Any sewing novice can create these beautiful, intricate looking pieces. I haven't felt that any of the projects are too complicated or beyond my abilities.  No frustration -- no confusion. And, I've been using some of the patterns to incorporate into clothing.  After years of wanting to stick a fork in my eye after reading industry sewing patterns and diy books that read like Klingon, and/or are missing pertinent instructional steps, and/or have boring/crappy projects, this was a breath of fresh air. I sincerely hope that they publish more books :)",5.0
I love this book.  I've wanted to try different and interesting techniques to manipulate fabric aside from simply smocking. These designs are easy to understand and the projects give you a variety of applications for the technique.  I can't wait to start experimenting.,5.0
"Love this product. Being new to paper piecing and after trying this material I never want to use anything else. It's perfect. After trying 2 other types/brands, I finally found the perfect paper with Simple Foundations Translucent Vellum Paper. Only wish I could get it in 50ct or more. Fast delivery too.",5.0
Pattern printed on it beautifully.  Easy to see through so it was easy to use.  I will be buying more to complet my project.,5.0
"I used this vellum as an overlay to a Christmas card I made this year.  The stamped image under the vellum showed very nicely through the vellum, which is what I wanted.",5.0
Great quality. Exactly what I l needed for my project. Easy to use and made the project much easier to complete.,5.0
Just learning to paper piece,5.0
"I ordered this paper, along with a ream of ""Vellum Value Pack 8.5""X11"" 50/Pkg-Clear"" by Darice so that I could compare.  The Simple Foundations pack only had 30 sheets and the other package I ordered had 50 sheets (so cheaper!).  I want to say that they are both exactly the same.  Same weight, so translucent color.  Thought I would share because I'm sure someone out there was wondering if there might be another, less expensive, option.  I do plan on keeping both packages, since I opened them up.",5.0
So much clearer and easier to use than newspaper type foundation.,5.0
It is what it is and for a great price. The Quality is Good.,5.0
Might be too expensive for using all the time but as a first time paper-piecer I would recommend highly.  It rips off material easily when using a small stitch.  Very easy to trace through and use.  I may use it all the time just to feel rich!,5.0
Will need more of this soon and will reorder this brand. :),5.0
Worked very well,5.0
"Yes, this is a nice translucent paper for art projects, and also, for calligraphy. It is very smooth, and has a nice slick feel. It is heavy enough to not wrinkle. It also makes nice translucent envelopes.",5.0
"This was nice vellum, just what I wanted and it held up good to my heat gun while I was embossing.",5.0
"These are thick, but they do the job!",5.0
Very happy with this order. Thank you.,5.0

Perfect for paper piecing.,5.0
It's vellum paper and it works like vellum paper. :o),5.0
"it is the best paper it isn't slippery, I have tried other paper and this is the one I use",5.0
"Although I have quilted for 20 years, I have never learned the technique of foundation piecing. This product was highly recommended by my Yahoo quilting group online, so I ordered a package of it and I have to say, it performed wonderfully. It went through my laser printer with no problem, sewed beautifully and no problems removing it from the quilt blocks once they were finished. It holds up well to the iron when pressing the parts of the block, and doesn't seem to cause any trouble with the sewing machine. I will definitely keep using this product!",5.0
I have used this product many times.  Very intricate designs can be done.  All come out perfectly.  I always have straight seams.,5.0
"Thank you for fast service, item is as expected, and packaging was adequate.  I will gladly recommend your site to friends and family",5.0
"I teach paper piecing classes and this vellum is my first choice for the patterns.  The students prefer this paper to other types of foundation papers because they can see the placement of the fabric pieces before they sew.  When printing, remove each page as it comes out of the printer and allow it to dry.  There is slight ink smearing otherwise.  Keep the stitch length smaller than normal to avoid stitches tearing out when you remove the paper.",5.0
I purchased the 4-in-1 tool when it first came out.  My favorite part of the tool is the stiletto.  I really can't live without out.  Not only is it great for quilting but it also is a great extra hand if you are embroidering.,5.0
"I haven't had the 4-in-1 Essential Sewing Tool very long, but it is such a versatile little ""toy.""  In fact, as far as I'm concerned, it is the ultimate quilting toy--everything you need in one object!  You can sew, then you can press, then you can un-sew (as I usually do several times!), then you can start all over again on that block!  I love it.  Thanks, Alex, for thinking of this and then going through with the production of it.",5.0
"THIS TOOL WAS MADE FOR QUILTING, BUT IT COMES IN HANDY FOR ALL KINDS OF SEWING. VERY USEFUL FOR ANY SEAMSTRESS.",5.0
"GREAT quilting tool - recently made a new quilt and used all four parts! Thanks, Alex!!!",5.0
"I've used this tool several times since I got it--the stiletto is great for guiding tricky seams and Bernina makes the best, sharpest seam rippers. It's great to have by my side!",5.0
I received  one of these tools for Christmas and already I am sewing and unsewing with it at my side. My favorite parts are the seam ripper (its Bernina!) and the stiletto.,5.0
Great quality tool!,5.0
Can't imagine how I ever sewed without it!,5.0
"convenient sewing tool, useful as a seam ripper, press seam down and to get into a point",5.0
"Should have read information better, assuming will get you........!

Best tool ever,5.0
Nice all-in-1 tool.,5.0
"I love this product.  I use them all when I am quilting and this is a great product to have.  All three tools at you finger tips instead of having to
get three separate products out to us.  Very well made!!!",5.0
I use this tool daily!  Well worth the price,5.0

"Very handy, good size to manage while sewing.",5.0
Exactly what I wanted. Arrived promptly.,5.0
Great!,5.0
I love it! It's nice to have one tool that does so many things!,5.0
"I've had one of these for about four years and love it in spite of the loose caps others have reported. I just make sure both are pushed on tight so I don't lose one or the other or inadvertently stab myself! My two favorite tools are the stiletto which I use to help guide fabric through as I sew, especially when there's a seam that could end up going in the wrong direction and the turner which I use mostly when I'm sewing baby bibs and need to turn them inside-out and smooth out the curves. I've just ordered a second one to keep with another sewing machine. I've tried using other pressers/turners and stilettos but I'm not satisfied. The only tool I don't use is the seam ripper. I have one I like better.",5.0
"The tool had to be replaced initially due to rust and dull blade, but there was no argument from the vendor and a new one was sent very quickly. My wife is very happy with the 2nd tool - it is as sharp as she was expecting and no rust in sight!

Good transaction and we'd buy from the vendor again.",5.0
"Great tool!
Many uses......love the point for turning, nicer and thin for small areas.",5.0
BEST ONE MADE,5.0
I love this tool and it's big enough that I don't lose it either!  It has a Bernina seam ripper which is the best seam ripper ever.  The stylus end is great for keeping those seems straight.,5.0
"An essential tool for sewers, and the wood is a nice change over cheap plastic. Also the built-up handle decreases hand fatigue. Great.",5.0
this is the handiest tool ever.  you don't have to search for several tools because they are all at your finger tips.  the caps stays on tight.  I can't believe that I sewed without this tool for so long,5.0
Received in good condition.  This was what I was looking for.  Since starting to use it I was unlucky enough to break the seam ripper tool. :(. But I will still get great use out of it.,5.0
"I am disappointed because I purchased three of these sewing tools and because one of them was broken, i could not use them for the rest of the group...one of the three tools (the seam ripper end) was broken when i received them, and it was broken inside the top, which was closed.  However, the package was open, and the tool was unattached from the backing, so it appears obvious to me that it had been returned and then just re-mailed to the next customer.  I have never had bad service from Amazon, so I have to believe this happened at their supplier.",5.0

"This book is filled with all kinds of projects to knit in lace: shawls, sweaters, scarves, accessories for the house, purses, and even gloves.  The book provides helpful tips for knitting lace such as a crochet guide, blocking techniques, tips for washing.  There are projects varied in difficulty and some are charted and others are written out and charted both.  There are many beautiful patterns in this book, several of which I hope to knit.  My favorite is Sarah Hatton's Beechwood Sweater with two lace panels on the top of a pull-over.  Naturally, this pattern is written out as I don't do well with charts.  The Dulcie Tunic, designed by Amanda Jones,  is also beautiful, knit with a lace center and bottom on a pull-over sweater.  There are wonderful shawls in this book for those of us who love to knit these.  The designers are varied with many that are new to me.  However, their taste is sublime for the most part.

There are some projects that don't really speak to me but, for the most part, this is an excellent selection of patterns.  I would recommend this book for the more experienced lace knitter.  It is not really appropriate for beginners.",5.0
There are several projects that I can't wait to make.,5.0
"I am enjoying this book and the patterns. I discovered patterns I will make. I am such a slow knitter that there are a few I love, but doubt I would finish it. Maybe later in my life. I love the layout, the clear directions, and charts for those who prefer them.",5.0

It was difficult in deciding what project to start first in this wonderful book.  I loved most of the patterns and they were easy to follow.,5.0
"As always, M's Weiss' ""Afghans by the Pound"" delivers what we have come to expect from the Leisure Arts seiries of books. Clear, concise instructions are present as well as a variety of afghans for almost any occasion.

I bought this book of cross stitch alphabets a number of years ago.  I have used it a number of times to customize my projects - everything from names to sayings to words I want to memorialize in an art project.  I like that there are so many choices and that the alphabets are all so different from one another.  I have several alphabet booklets and this one is one of my favorites.,5.0

"This is high quality print of a map. If you are looking for wrapping paper, look elsewhere.

Also, this map is AMAZING! It is a high quality print of an original folding color map from the mid 20th century. The paper is high quality, the print is high resolution, and it has additional appeal because of the aged look. I have mounted mine on foamboard and I'm marking the places I've been.

Fully recommend.",5.0
Great quality print. Colors are amazing. Framed and hanging in our living room.,5.0
"Looks great and rustic. I put two dowel rods on the top and bottom to give it a pull down map look and hung it on the wall in my child's room. It looks great and was very reasonably priced. exactly what we were looking for. I put an image of what it looks like (not the greatest quality picture, but gives an idea)",5.0

"Bought these for a friend who loves the outdoors and photographs nature.  They're realistic, mounted on a lovely hardwood, and cover in an impressive tin.",5.0
"I bought this on a whim, really more for the mushroom stamp than anything else. I'm a huge fan of Cavallini products in general but I know they can be hit or miss, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very surprised to find that these are really exceedingly good quality - while the stamps looked rather rudimentary and I wasn't sure whether the ink pad would be any good, the impressions were crisp, clear and looked professional. The only downside is that the ink will most likely stain any of the wooden stamp blocks if you clean them under running water like I did - perhaps this can be avoided if using a stamp cleaning pad. However, this in no way detracts from the beauty of the stamped images themselves and even the slightly dinged tin didn't damper my enthusiasm about this set!",5.0
Purchased this set to embellish wedding and reception decor. It definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and the details. Love it!,5.0
"The stamps have sturdy wooden ""handles"" and very detailed lines on the rubber part of the stamp.  The stamps produce beautiful, clear images that you can color in with colored pencils if desired or leave as is.  I plan to use them at school to stamp student papers.",5.0
1Product is beautifully packaged and great quality. Arrived on time. Thanks for the great service and beautiful stamps.  Love them and have already used them to make cute labels.,5.0
"These are much smaller than the ""luggage labels"" by the same company, but these come in a collectible tin. The quality is really good. They have a ""cloth-like"" texture (they are paper) and have a sense of vintage. For best effect pair these up with a set of vintage postal ink stamps and stamp them (""Cancelled"") to make them look like the item you are stickering (package, for example) has actually traveled all over the world. Some of these may even have little fill in areas, as they are reminiscent of old tags (I have purchased several of these so it is a crap shoot). Definitely worth the price.",5.0
"I give these to Japanese students as a reward. They love that they feature vintage American cities and aspects of travel (road signs, air travel, etc.).

The stickers come in a thin little tin that is adorable.

The stickers themselves are of very nice quality. Great for scrap-booking, if that's your thing.",5.0

The stickers show just as the outside box photo is viewed--very nice birds that (in my experience) would seem to resonate better with an adult rather than for little ones.  There are words showing behind the birds--some words illegible.  I loved the look but my children were hoping for just nice outlines of birds.  The sticker's shape is actually oval--and a nice size too (guessing approximately 4 inches across).  They would look very elegant on the back of an envelope or to hold tissue paper together in a gift box.  I was impressed! :),5.0
These are super cool and the paper's texture is lovely.,5.0
Great little tin filled with great bird photos.,5.0
Love birds and especially these bird stickers.  The tin is great for storage as well as pleasant to look at.  It is very hard for these fingers to hope.,5.0
I used these stickers to seal the envelopes of wedding invitations and they are so beautiful! I hadn't realize that they come in various sizes (some were just far too large to be used for an envelope) but the rest were a decent size.,5.0
"I do really like these. They're nice to add to stationary or the back flap of an envelope that I want to keep sealed while moving through the mail. There are two pages of 12 designs, package says 100 + stickers. Not kiddy bright but rather subdued colors. Some of the stickers are rather simple such as bird's nest or the word ""bird"", I like the tin these stickers come in. Easy to store and just neat organization. The back of the tin shows exactly what's inside. I also use these in scrapbooking. The stickers are oval. Some are quite big. The hummingbird, for instance, is just so attractive. These are not ""American"" bird breeds but they closely resemble some of ours. The stickers are printed on Italian stock, some images have words behind them. Very pretty!",5.0
"The packaging is beautiful and useful and the the stickers are exactly as pictured.  Very very nice product!

One thing to remember though, the images are not high res.  I thought some of the very slight blurriness of the images on the stickers was due to the image quality on the amazon sale page but it was not.  They are not crisp images but don't let that hold you back.  They look a bit antique and are of great quality.",5.0
"I used the majority of these stickers to make magnets for my Mom's new refrigerator.  We ended up making so many that we gave them away to a bunch of co-workers.  Everyone was cooing practically.
The stickers are great quality and there is enough variation within the pack.  I used a fixative spray to prevent water from bleeding the colors and to keep the images fresh.  Absolutely beautiful!",5.0
"Great bird art--natural looking and realistic images are my preference when choosing materials for mixed media, journals, and other craft and art pieces.",5.0
"I love how vivid and bright these stickers are, as well as the excellent quality. They arrived quickly and as described, they're thick and stay put. I recommend it!",5.0

"These file folders are so beautiful, and colorful, that they simply make me happy just using them!!",5.0
"These are very sturdy, and I hope highly reusable file folders. Unlike some other designer file folders I've purchased in the past, these don't have a glossy finish, where you can peel off a label after it's been placed. To make them work for me in this manner all I did was add some clear tape. Now if I need to rename a file I only have to peel off my current label and I can rename easily. Love the cute design. Happy I ordered these.",5.0
Wife loves these. Sturdy,5.0
"Who knew getting lovely file folders was becoming difficult, especially beautiful botanical prints? I love these, and was glad to get them.",5.0
I am going to use these for my client files.  I like beauty around me and they make great presentation folders.,5.0

"Very heavy card stock! Love the colors, the artwork, and pleasure I get from using these folders for special purposes instead of plain vanilla... I mean, manilla!

Yes, they're a little pricey and I can't afford to use them for everything, but I'm a paperholic and love the colors, textures and pleasure I receive from using nice items from time to time. I can't afford a boat, so why not?  :-)",5.0
"Love these.  So pretty, a nice splurge for myself to get the ball rolling on my studies.  Treat yo self!",5.0

These are really heavy-duty file folders and so lovely to use.  These are almost pretty enough to frame and hang on the wall.,5.0

"These file folders add a perfect pop of color and fun to a boring home office!
I really love them and have already ordered more.
They are sturdy and well made.",5.0
Very durable and pretty at the same time.  Planning on buying more in different patterns. These are super fun to have.,5.0
"There are a whole bunch of sizes and designs, so you can use them everywhere.  And the tin is practically indestructible.  I use stickers as a way to mark which books are mine (I am a bibliophile living with another bibliophile, so this is important), and they are perfect for that use.  I put the larger ones (which there are a ton of) onto the endpapers the into the really big books, and the smaller ones (which there are a lot of) onto the endpapers of very small books, and put all the middle ones into mid-range books based on the space available.  Most of them are oval in shape, but there are also some small circular ones.

Additionally, the look of the stickers gives it a really classy feel.  This is perfect for books, as well as anywhere else where you'd want to use stickers without making it seem 'childlike'.  The drawings on the cover are pretty indicative of the style of drawings on the stickers themselves.

In short, these are beautiful and practical.  If you like or use stickers, I don't think you can go wrong with this set.",5.0
The detail is wonderful and realistic and just what I was hoping for.  I will use them for cards and scrapbooking.,5.0
Thought they would be like regular stickers but really not for kids in my opinion. Worked out because they did drawings andused stickers on the drawings.,5.0
"I love this brand of stickers and the container they come in is pretty cool too. The stickers are high quality with high detail.
I have yet to be disappointed and I can say this with confidence after having purchase dozens of Cavallini Papers & Co. products. The stickers and the company's tags are my favorites to use.
I have used the stickers as focal points in my paper crafts and they always add a bit of elegance to a paper craft item because of the quality artwork.",5.0

Hope you will have another box of stickers when these are gone!!",5.0
"If you are wanting to sew handbags for fun, for gifts, or so you will have one to match each outfit you own, this is the book for you!  The designs vary from easy to more complicated, from dressy to fun, from classic to . . . well, whatever!  There's something for everyone here.  There are also  good instructions for sewing leather - a process to me that always seems  scary - but after reading the suggestions, I tried it, and it's easy!  My  favorite design is the teardrop bag - one of those ""ergo-dynamic""  designs that really works! There's a lot of inspiration here as well, if  you want to take and idea, run with it, and make a design of your own. Have  a great time!",5.0
"This book was another good find if you're into making purses for yourself or family, or just like making purses.  More great designs and patterns to chose from.  Very well done and explained.",5.0
"I was so excited to receive this book in the mail this week - I gasped several times as I turned from page to page in this book. My 5 yo daughter kept coming over to me to look at what I was reacting to. Thank you Norah for these gorgeous, elegant and inspired designs - I think I want to make nearly all of them!",5.0
"I have been a fan of Norah Gaughan for some time and have ofter marveled at her patterns in the various knitting magazines.  So when I saw she had written a book, I did something I rarely do.  I ordered it sight unseen, hoping it would be interesting and I might be inspired to try something new.  Well I wasn't just inspired to knit but to actually go out, look around and marvel at nature.

When I opened it for the first time, the book literally took my breath away.  The designs are stunning and each design is so  beautiful photographed, I kept paging through it again and again. ""Knitting Nature"" delivers page after page of beautiful designs that will make your fingers tingle to cast on.  The look and feel of the book is first rate. Turns out Norah, in addition to being a talented knitter, is a math wiz and in ""Knitting Nature"" she takes you through her design journey using shapes and theories taken from Nature.  The commentary of her design process is fancinating to read.  I can't wait for the book tour because I would love to learn more about her approach to design.

The test of any knitting book is the quality of the instructions.  The designs in ""Knitting Nature"" seemed a little daunting at first but as I read through the pattern instructions, I began to feel a little more confident because the instruction are clear, concise and easy to read.  I can't wait to try my first project.  I should mention that some of the recommended yarns are on the pricey side.  For those of you who are looking for more than just another simple pattern book - who want to be inspired; this is the book to buy.",5.0
"Knitting Nature is a brilliantly conceived and exquisitely executed book.  Norah Gaughn's designs are beautiful; earth inspired, they are unique and compelling.  The photography is stunning.  This is a book that is at once a gift of pattern design, and a volume to grace one's coffee table as a visual gem and conversation piece.",5.0
Love having this in my knitting library.,5.0
"Not for the new knitter and not for the ""faint of heart"", but the designs in this book are breath-taking.  I saw this book at the home of a fellow knitter and ordered it as soon as I got home.  I'm not disappointed.  The photography in this book is wonderful.",5.0
"Good book, good patterns.  Look forward to knitting some of the designs, sometime in the near future.  Thank you much.",5.0
"OK, I am working through other projects so I haven't started a pattern in this book, but I enjoy looking through it and the creative patterns.  I anticipate making many of them.",5.0
"This interesting knitting book has chapters titled Hexagons, Pentagons, Spirals, Phyllotaxis, Fractals and Waves. All of the patterns are inspired by natural forms found in nature The author, Norah Gaughan, in the introduction, states that she has ""always been torn between simultaneous desires to study art and science"". This book is a good example of how she combines the two and creates beauty. As Norah's life progressed, she realized that what she truly loved was knitting and wanted to make a career as a knitting designer. ""The work in this book feels like the melding of my science - and art-loving selves..."". ""Some of the designs in this book are structurally similar to nature's example."" This can be seen by the chapter headings themselves. ""In some cases, the structure of the natural phenomenon dictated the structure of the garment (the garments made from hexagonal and pentagonal pieces, for instance). In others, the pattern from nature become a surface decoration imposed on the grid of knitting..."". ""In all cases, working within the framework of six categories of patterns found in nature freed my mind to look at things differently and allowed me to rethink the structure of garment-making.""

Many of the patterns are eye-catching and lovely. In Hexagons, the Asymmetrical Cardigan in a lovely light blue hue is definitely a pattern I want to try. It is knit in cashmere . The stitch in this cardigan is modeled after the woven pattern of caned chair seats. The Hex Afghan is stunning. Knit in a rich brownish-red, half alpaca and half wool, it contains rows of elongated hexagons.

The Swirled Pentagon Pullover is luscious. Knit in an angora and wool blend, it is an almost turquoise colorway. The top of the pullover has swirled pentagons and the bottom of the sweater is knit in a classic stockinette stitch. The Bubble Pullover is knit in a lovely violet color out of baby alpaca. It has large pentagons as its motif.

The Spiral Scarf is very 'now'. Its contemporary feel is obvious to the knitter. It is knit with Mongolian Cashmere in a golden and blue hue and is comprised of spirals attached together. The Cabled Spiral Pullover is knit in a light blue colorway from extra fine merino DK. There is a spiral motif on the top and the bottom two thirds of the sweater is knit in stockinette stitch.

The Roundabout Leaf Tank is knit in an ivory hue with silk yarn. ""The seater is made out of a spiraling strip, in the same way that leaves grow on a stem."" The Phyllotaxis Scarf is perfect for a man or woman. Knit in a brown colorway with a wool, mohair and silk combination yarn, it is reversible. The scarf is knit in a tube to make its reversibility possible. ""There are five spirals slanting to the right and eight spirals slanting to the left so the pair from the Fibonacci sequence is 5-8."" I love the Sunflower Tam. There are two examples in the photograph. One is green and the other yellow. They are knit with Icelandic wool. ""For this tam, I wanted to make a disk with two opposing spirals, like the phyllotaxis of a sunflower, daisy, or coneflower.""

The Fractal section has several nice patterns. I really like the Branching Aran Guernsey knit with wool. ""I purposefully incorporated some traditional elements of the British guernsey into this design - the drop-shoulder shaping and the simple ladder pattern between the columns of the cables - and like the way they play against the naturalistic, very modern, branching cables."" The Serpentin Coat, knit in browns and blues with merino wool, is perfect for an autumn day. ""The sinuous motif used on the yoke of this coat is a Dragon Curve, another mathematical fractal."" The Triangle Scarf is in a dark beige and knit with a combination of nylon and rayon yarn. It features triangles based on a mathematical fractal called the Serpinski Triangle.

The Wave section of the book has several lovely patterns. I really like the Vortex Street Pullover in a green/brown blend knit with cotton. ""A phenomenon of fluid dynamics, a vortex street is an organized pattern of spirals formed in the wake of fluid flowing past a solid object."" The center of this pullover has a wave section with stockinette surrounding it. The Reflection Aran Pullover is knit in a deep wine color out of wool. ""Inspired by the rule of wave reflection, the cables in this pullover 'reflect' off of the edges of the center panel."" The Droplet Hat is another Aran pattern knit in a green colorway with wool yarn. ""This design is based upon a photo showing a droplet of water speeding downward propelled by gravity, spewing off little droplets as well as a narrow trail of water. My interpretation is rendered in bobbles and embossed leaves.""

Overall, this book is a real winner with clear photographs of the projects and easy-to-read pattern instructions. Some of the photos are a bit sexist for my taste but I can overlook that. They just seem silly. The book itself is a very welcome addition to my knitting library.",5.0
This is a great book to have in your collection.  Norah Gaughan has some very interesting patterns and there is something for everyone.,5.0
"Norah Gaughan never fails to satisfy.  Innovative, pretty and challenging.  I've made two skirts from this book.  I get compliments whenever I wear one.  I do agree with one review that there are errors but I've learned that most books and magazines do have errors.  I always check on-line for corrections.  I've also found that I sometimes like to alter the pattern a smidge.  That does not take away from this brilliant, stunning book.",5.0
"I thumbed through this book while at the bookstore, and I have to say, it looks way better in person than the few photographs here on amazon seem to show. The book has a lot of really great patterns, and is much more colorful and varied on the inside. The book is divided into sections that take their inspiration from things from nature, and not just your ususal, earth, water, fire, routine. The book includes some great designs, and the photographs are really beautiful. I would definitely recommend getting this book, and will picking up one for myself soon!",5.0
"I seriously plan to knit almost every design in this book.  The patterns are innovative and stylish.  As an artist I love how Norah explains her inspiration and works in different themes throughout the book.  Yes, there are errata but these are listed with the publisher.  Most knitting books I've found have the same issues but without the overall high quality of the book.  What a pleasure it is to knit and wear Norah Gaughan designs!",5.0
"I will start with the 'buts'. The lack of metric measurements is a torture for a continental European. I also gather from the reviews that there are some mistakes in the patterns, which would be bad enough in another book, but in this one it's a real shame. Luckily enough, both problems can be easily solved with the use of a calculator and the Internet.

Having said that: I love this book and a few of the designs are so beautiful they made me speechless. Some of them far to eccentric for me to wear, but the Vortex pullover alone would be worth the money.

The book is beautifully designed and I find the patterns clear. Some may argue the photos are strange - some of them are indeed - but they are one of the things that makes the book different. Each project is preceded with a short explanation on how it refers to nature and the explanations make great reading.

One more thing: the book is for advanced knitters. The patterns are extremely challenging. Even so, less experienced knitters may want to consider buying this book to encourage them to learn more.",5.0
This is not just another pattern book.  These are lovely designs that are inspiring.  Knit on!,5.0
"I hesitated to buy this book, because of all the complaining about errors.  But the fact is, Norah Gaughan is one of the freshest and most intriguing knitwear designers out there.  I find myself attracted to her designs everywhere I see them - so it was worth it to me to put up with perhaps some less-than-perfect editing to get this kind of originality and inspiration.",5.0
PATTERNS IN NATURE draws from nature to enhance knitting patterns and is a feast for the eyes. The photos are great and the patterns intricate but very doable,5.0
"Finally a book for those who know how to knit and would like a little more challenge. These have pleanty of challenge and a lot of beautiful patterns. Most, if not all wearable. Only 1 with multiple color work the rest are stitch texture. Not an odd ball book, these take planning and a trip to your yarn store to get the right materials.",5.0
What a wonderful book. These patterns are fantastic. If you are sick of just knit and purl and are ready for a challenge. Or you love the look of the patterns you see in ready to wear. This is the book for you. The instructions are very well written and the pictures are beautiful. I am stuck on this book for awhile in my knitting. Too many projects I want to do.,5.0
"This book compels me to write my first review because it is so good. While I'm pleased with the fact that knitting has lately becoming a hobby with mass appeal, however, the more recent knitting books has been focusing on easy-to-do projects that requires little time, skills, or reflection from the knitters. It has been a while since I've seen a knitting book with originality and beauty.",5.0
I love this book!  It is  new and original and made me want to knit ones of the designs ASAP.  The presentation is A+ and the photography beautiful.  I have quite a knitting library and this book is one of my favorites.,5.0
"Truly, this is the most captivating knitting book I have ever read.  Each section, pattern, is introduced with easy to understand explanations of geometry found in nature, with lovely photos as well (eg. the shell of the snapping turtle; how soap bubbles take on hexagonal shapes as they cluster; the direction of whorls of leaves and petals in different types of plants and flowers (and how that relates to the Fibonacci series--who knew!) This book has filled in some formerly black holes in the leap from nature to knitting.  And the patterns are nice as well.",5.0
"I fell in love with this book one night while sipping coffee and thumbing through books at the Barnes and Nobel.  I was amazed by the original designs, the organization, and the shear beauty of the patterns.  Being on of the luckiest people on the planet, I was given this book for my birthday.  I have now found a handful of patterns that I must make.

The patterns in this book are more challenging to some of the others I've reviewed.  I'd put it on par with Vintage Knits.  I think that any advanced to intermediate knitter could handle these patterns without any problem.

Worth its weight in gold.  A must have for every knitter.",5.0
"Although there is some criticism that this is a book of 'nature knock-offs,' I was impressed by the inspiration the author found in shapes that nature prefers.  Her explanations of designs in nature are interesting and fun to read and the way she incorporates them into her designs turn out unique without being unwearable.

Not only will I be knitting a great number of the patterns, I found inspiration for adding some of the techniques to standard patterns I use to jazz them up a bit.

As a knitter in a scientific family, this book is too fun not to have, but it is also the most useful book of patterns I've seen.  Usually a book has 2 or 3 things I love it in, but this one is just full of them!",5.0
"I'm an avid fan of the author's work, so picking up this book was a no-brainer for me. The designs - shawls, coats, tunics and more - are clever, wearable, and have a wide range of sizes (something many books & magazines neglect!).",5.0
"This is a great book.  Lots of pictures, clear instructions, and it was a break from the traditional knitting pattern books.  If you are looking to challenge yourself, or take your knitting in a different direction this is it.  I often take this book out in the morning while I'm drinking my coffee just for the good read.",5.0
"I'll be short and sweet, this is one of the best knitting books I have purchased in a long time, and I own a lot of knitting books.  I plan to actually knit some of these designs, not just use them as inspiration, but to learn. All the designs are beautiful, and wearable.  Some I will have to fiddle with for tummy cover but a lace panel insertion should work.

If you are a fan of Loop de Loop ( I am ) by Teva Durham, this book is a must.

Beautiful photos, innovative designs, and clear instructions.",5.0
"I rarely buy pattern books as I prefer to knit my own designs most of the time, but this book is so unusual and intelligently thought out that there are 7 designs in there I want to make. Everything is not only unique and unexpected but also WEARABLE, which we all know are two things that don't offen mesh well in knitwear design. I was really inspired by the designs and pleasantly surprised by how approachable they are.

This is a wonderful book, I don't know any knitter who wouldn't find something to make from it!",5.0
"We knitters are fortunate to have such a wonderful book but it is very difficult and also challenging. Very few books have reached this level and the author has impressive credentials. After researching them online I discovered that most of the 35 different yarns are knitting worsted or dk which is good because I don't have them nor can buy them. Every design is explained first by math and nature although it didn't help me much. Pictures are ok but more would have been even better. No complaints on book layout, printing or schematics, although type could have been darker. Yarns are not labeled in the new number system  or the old which is a problem as two are already discontinued. Make no mistake, this is a difficult book but it is also a milestone on the knitting map. Yes, it is a pattern book but more than that, it is a new way to see knitting and for those few who can understand it should lead to a new world of knitting designs.",5.0
I bought this for my granddaughter and she enjoyed it so much that I bought two more for her to give to friends. It's a very special idea and kids have such fun with it.,5.0
"Tired of spending large sums of money on my daughter's friend's b'day presents and knowing how much my daughter enjoyed art, I picked up this book and told my 14 year old that if she would use it to make gifts, I would pay for it.  I figured it would be a win/win situation.  She went to town making earrings and bracelets, wearing a new one each day to school.  Her 18 year old sister came home from college and wanted everything she made but instead sat down and made her own.  They shrinky dinked so much that I am ordering a refill pack and another book for my daughter to take back to college.  Moral:  kids of ALL ages will love this (including me).  One of the most fun Klutz books we've gotten (and we've gotten a lot).  And with a friend's b'day party coming up next week....",5.0
"My 9 year old and I have had a lot of fun creating jewelry!  She needs help and I think that it is more suited for an older child to use without supervision.  However, do not hesitate to get it for younger children to be used with supervision.  You can actually create very unique, beautiful jewelry with this kit!  This isn't the usual Shrinky Dinks for kids. Children and adults of all ages would love this!  It would be a wonderful idea for an older child or teen to use to make gifts for friends and family.",5.0
Gift for nieces.  Truly enjoyed!  Very fun product I've known of for years!,5.0
what a hit!  Fun to use!,5.0
This was bought as a present for 3 different girls 11 and 12.  I have got rave reviews from them.  It is a great project for the older girls who still enjoy this kind of stuff.,5.0
Daughters got this for Christmas and they love to make projects from it. They're easy enough for a 6 year-old but can be more challenging for older kids. Easy instructions as per usual from Klutz. [written by SH],5.0
Good toy,5.0
Awesome kit!,5.0
Excellent book with so many ideas for jewelry making.,5.0
This was a great gift for an older (12yr & up) girl that enjoys crafts!  Anxious to see what she makes ;-),5.0
"Purchased this for an 8 year old with older siblings. When the packaged arrived my own kids went wild for the gift. The viewed the pages in awe asking for me to order them this book for their own birthday. My oldest gave this book a thumbs up for future gifts. Wished they had more so I could mix up the presents and not give out the same gift. My kids and I have become addicted to Shrinky Dinks as have their friends. The gift recipent loves being creative so we're sure this kit will be a hit.  I would even suggest this gift to adults. They would make great party favors, which kids can make themselves.",5.0
I happen to absolutely love Klutz books. The resources provided are high quality and the directions are written well. Shrink art is really fun and great for kids or adults. This book provides good ideas and materials to get you started. Amazon has great prices and this book was packaged and delivered on time.,5.0
"I bought this as a craft project for a group to make Mother's Day gifts for their mothers.  The group ranged in age from 10 to 16.  Everyone enjoyed the experience.  Even the adults who were in charge had a ball making the jewelry.  Because it requires an oven, this is not really something younger kids can do by themselves.  However, it is a very worthwhile product!",5.0
"Very good diagrams and instructions.  It is very beneficial for anyone making crafts at what ever age, even if you are over 60 years old.",5.0
I was looking for some basic information on this type of jewelry making and this book completely surprised me by it's depth.  Nicely detailed instructions and photos.  The projects were interesting and I quite enjoyed making a few of them.  Somehow I missed that there were supplies included and that was fabulous.  Great introduction to the idea of using Shrink Plastic as jewelry and honestly I can't imagine how it could be improved.,5.0
This product is pretty simple to use and is ideal for mother/daughter or father/daughter projects.  Everything is included although you may want to purchase additional shrinking material.,5.0
I love all of the books I have ever gotten from Klutz.  This one is no different.  It teaches a fun technique in a very informative easy to understand way.,5.0
"This kit is so much fun.  It has ""Shrinky Dink"" type paper, the jewelry findings, cord for necklaces and hundreds of beautiful designs to choose from.  All you do is choose a design, place the shrink paper (which is transparent) on top of it, trace and color in! You can use the designs in so many different ways, you will never run out of ideas for this.

My 12-year-old daughter received this kit last year as a gift, and the whole family loves it! I have a 6-year-old boy as well, so finding things that we all can do together and enjoy are rare. This kit fills the bill. My son likes to write his name and shrink it to make a necklace. He also just enjoys tracing and coloring in the designs that come with the kit. This year, we made tiny Christmas ornaments from the Chinese Lantern design template, colored them in Christmas colors, and hung them on a tiny tree.

My daughter and I make fun medallion pendants, earrings and bracelets. She and her friends have fun every time they get it out. And besides, who doesn't love smashing your face against the oven door and watching the miraculous shrinking process?? I loved Shrinky Dinks as a kid, and I apparently I still do! I recommend highly! Makes great birthday gifts also.",5.0
"Very creative way for me to put my art in jewelry form! I have taken my art paintings and turned them in to necklaces, pins and hair combs! Taking Shriny Dinks to a new level.",5.0
"I'm 11 and into making jewelry and crafts of all sorts, i have EVERY klutz jewelry type crafty kit and i wanted to add this one to my collection, and it was amazing! some projects are a little confusing, but you get the hang of them, also there is enough plastic to make tons of things! This is definitely in my top 3 of all my klutz kits i have! (and there are 11)",5.0
"My granddaughters (4) from out of town spent three continious days creating....without stopping.  They made the most amazing pieces of jewelry.  They came from Texas to Ohio for three days during the holidays.  They never got out of their pajamas and finally took a shower the third day.  It was nonstop creating. Had to force them to take time to eat.  Their ages 10,11, 12 and 13.  If only we would taken pictures. Earrings, charm bracelets, necklaces and all..... pieces 0f art. I ordered another set with refills and had them delivered to their Texas home. They called and asked if I could send them some more refills. This was awesome fun for me too!",5.0
"My daughters (ages 9, 11, 13, 15) and all their friends absolutely love this book and are using it constantly.  It is extremely popular around here.  When they get together with their friends they all do it together.  They just can't get enough of it.",5.0
"Bought this for my daughter's birthday.  We've been having so much fun making them.  I was so excited when I saw this, because I remember making shrinky dinks when I was her age.  So cool to do something useful with them and make beautiful jewelry.  The first time we tried it, we took them out of the oven too soon because they were curling up, but it was okay, because even curled up, they looked really cool on a necklace.  When you see them curl up in the oven, just leave them and they will flatten back out again as they shrink some more.  My daughter plans on making her friends one-of-a-kind jewelry for Christmas.  Very cool!",5.0
My girls are 8 and 10 and this kit is one of the best we have ever gotten.  Highly recommend it and I think it would be appropriate for girls ages 5-14 because the directions deal with many different skill levels and some can get quite complicated and ornate so this would still work for older girls.,5.0
"I gave this book to my 12 year old niece. I was worried since her family isn't very crafty. I am famous for buying kits and then not wanting to help my children make the projects. My niece and her friends loved it, made all the projects, and didn't require any adult help. It doesn't get better than that! I bought a copy for my classroom.",5.0
"I bought this as a gift for my 10 yr old daughter, based upon a recomendation from a  friend.  She likes fashion and doing little science projects.  This was perfect for her.  She loved designing and creating the jewlery then watching them shrink in the oven.  Only concern was the items curled a lot, so if you are not on top of keeping the items flat, they end up looking like shrink-a-sculptures.  I understand from my friend there are refills that can be purchased, but have not checked for it.",5.0
"This book is a really good source of ideas. It carefully explains how to achieve the results, and lets you know which projects are more difficult than others (e.g. the rings). This is particularly helpful when working with younger kids, as it helps the kids (and their parents) avoid frustration by avoiding embarking in the most difficult projects first.

If you are new to shrinky dinks, it gives you a very good base to start. The explanations are very useful and they will help you avoid ruining many-a-shrinky dink sheets.

7 year olds were entertained for a long time. The included patterns are very good, and yet easy enough for the kids to trace and color.

It includes a bunch of supplies to make earrings, bracelets and necklaces. If you need more, they are easy to find in a craft or bead stores.

The kids can make nice jewerly for themselves, or presents for friends, teachers, granparents, etc, and they actually look pretty good.

We got some very cool results combining coloring with permanent marker (for bolder lines)and colored pencils. Some of the color does come off while wearing the jewelry (probably a problem with all shrinky dinks, but I did end up with a blue line around my finger after wearing a ring for a day).

One thing to keep in mind is that it definitely requires adult supervision, especially when working with younger kids (the projects involve permanent markers, scissors, oven, and a bit of exposure to toxic fumes when the shrinky dinks are in the oven).",5.0
"We bought this for my daughter's 12th birthday, and it is a HUGE hit.  She's been making jewelery non-stop.  This is a five-star product.",5.0
My 10-year-old daughter loved this! Within a few minutes she had her first designs ready to go and she kept at it for a couple of weeks.,5.0
"I bought this for my 8 year old twin daughters for their birthday.  We LOVE it!  It is so much fun, and you can be so creative.  Some of the jewelry created is so cool!  They spent hours creating their own jewelry from pendants to earrings to rings, etc... when they first got it.  There are TONS of supplies and so many designs and pictures to trace, the possibilities are endless.  The book has lots of great examples in it as well.  You do need permanent markers, colored pencils or acrylic paint (we like the colored pencils).  A hole puncher is also needed.  I have loved EVERY Klutz book I have purchased.  You can't go wrong.  We are buying these as birthday gifts for all my girls' friends this year.  I think the recommended age is 12 and up, but my girls were able to trace and color their designs.  Cutting them out is a bit of a challenge because the Shrinky Dink plastic tends to tear easily, so I cut out their designs for them.  If you like crafting, you will LOVE this!!  It is fun for kids AND adults!  It would also make a great birthday party activity for teens or pre-teens.",5.0
My granddaughter (7 years old) absolutely loved this kit. She made special gifts for all her friends with the included materials.  Definitely fun for the creative child!,5.0
"I had fun with this, used it to make braclets for christmas gifts. I loved how e-z the instructions and patterns were to fallow, and the amount of suplys included is ""wow"" very very pleased with this product.",5.0
"I took this out when I had a house full of girls (ages 6-13) and one boy (age 10) visiting.  Everyone got excited about picking out their project, coloring it in and of course, watching it shrink.  We then turn the finished items into necklaces and keyrings.  Great alternative to playing video games.",5.0
"I got this for my 12 year old daughter and its been a big hit! The results are quite impressive. She's made earrings, a charm bracelet (of colorful Chinese lanterns) and several necklaces. The kit comes with several sheets of patterns to mix and match. They range from cute to sophisticated designs. If you are looking for a gift for preteens and up, this is a perfect choice.",5.0
"An absolute ""must have"" for crocheters, as is the companion Knitters Handy Guide for knitting enthusiasts. Indispensible, full of the information you need. Take it to the store with you, put it in your craft bag, lend it to no one! They won't want to give it back. I've given several as gifts to other crafters and they love it as well.",5.0
Great patterns. Easy to read and to make.,5.0
Perfect for my crafty side ,5.0
Lots of choices for different projects.  Easy to read and follow directions.,5.0

Great collection,5.0
"This book has plenty of easy to follow patterns for a variety of alphabets.  Most of the patterns include the upper and lower case letters, which i have trouble finding sometimes.  There are styles to match any ocassion, event, or interests.  I have already used one set of letters for a piece I am working on now.  I can't wait to use many more!",5.0
This is a great quick reference cheat sheet.  It's great for a novice to reference crochet stitches and see how they look when created.,5.0
This handy little guide is a gem.  The directions are clear but the illustrations are really the selling point.  I read patterns pretty well...whenever I encounter a new stitch I go back to this guide.  It always does a better job then any other reference for explaining the stitch.  Wouldn't be without it.,5.0
I Love the pocket guide.  Comes in handy when you need refresher on how to crochet with a certain stitch.,5.0
This is a great guide for both beginners and experienced crocheters.  It is handy to keep in your crochet bag as a quick reference.,5.0
love this guide.. perfect for quick reference..easy to use and very durable. i'm glad i.ll have this for a long time,5.0
"very informative and easy to follow instructions,  easy to read, easy to follow with the pictures that are attached.  I can't believe that a book would be able to teach me without attending a class.",5.0
"We all need a little refresher every now and then. This is a handy reference tool. I like that it folds up to a nice portable size, and that it is laminated for durability. I am a crochet instructor and recommend this to all my crochet students.",5.0
"These guides are great. I have one for each type of handiwork and keep them in the bag with my work. Since I have some trouble with my memory, I keep the appropriate guide out while I am working to be sure I don't mess up too badly. Also, I don't use some of the stitches very often and hate to have to drag a bulky book around with me.",5.0
"I  was with a friend that bought this at a craft store and she bought the last one! I searched and found this only on Amazon, so I know they are hard to find.  I wanted one to see how to make a V stitch and see pictures of all the basic stitches as I learn to crochet. This is hard to find in a store, so order it on Amazon if you see it available. It is a laminated ""map"" of sorts that you will want to keep in your yarn bag. Very highly recommended...",5.0
"I just got this book and can't wait to get started.  The discussion of yarns is priceless.  Photos are beautiful. Best of all  the book is thoughtfully laid out with straightforward directions for completing each, lovely shawl. There are even directions for enlarging each shawl. Patterns are categorized by type of shawl and level of difficulty is indicated.  I predict this will be a well worn book in the  hands of many knitters.",5.0
I received my copy last week and am itching to get started.  I am a big fan of shawls that begin simply and have their details on the edging so they can be worn as scarves.  The patterns are very clear and the pictures are quite nice.  This is a good way to practice the knitting lace techniques.,5.0
"This is trul a terrific book!  The cover page is what caught my eye, and when I followed up on Ravelry with the patterns that were included in this book, I knew I had to have it.

I received my copy a few days ago, and am not disappointed - from the photography (love the close up pictures of the lace details!!) to the Special techniques section, everything is detailed with pictures. I also love the fact that Jen Lucas had the forethought to add in to each pattern a section on how to make your shawl bigger.  As a knitter, I have knit many shawl patterns where they turned out smaller than I would have liked.
I am halfway through knitting Happenstance, and love that it's more challenging than the normal shawls I knit up.

Happy knitting!!",5.0

I gave this to a relative who is an avid knitter. She loved it and showed it to her knitting club who all said they loved it as well. The designs are varied and interesting.,5.0
"I just bought this in the Kindle version. The book seems wonderful, but the charts are not transcribed (not sure if that's the correct word) clearly.  In order to follow the chart one has to enlarge it. The kindle version charts lose all contrast and are difficult to follow. For those who prefer written instructions, those are included. I guess I'll have to buy the physical book in order to knit the projects.

I was hasty in my review. I didn't see the option to download the charts as a PDF.  Sorry.",5.0

"Great photos, nice projects, and clear directions.  The directions for reading a chart made it very easy for me to transition from only using written patterns to happily working charted patterns.

"I picked up this book on yarn crawl, kind of on a whim (and let's face it, I have a LOT of sock yarn so a book with uses for it is always good). I've so far made three of the patterns from the book and enjoyed all three projects.

It's rare for me to make more than one project from any given book but this one has been unique that way. Not to mention that knitter friends keep wanting to look at it and ooh & aah over the projects.",5.0

This is a beautiful book.  I purchased 3....two for gifts and one for me!!!  The paper in the book is top quality and the cover is gorgeous.  I think each and every shawl is amazing and plan to make them all.  Which to do first is the biggest  problem!  Highly recommend.,5.0
"Page 74 tab cast on is the basis to begin a triangular lace shawl. I love this style. You can continue with just the what it's call a yarn over basic shawl or get into the lace. I am knitting page  13 inflorescence shawl pattern. I have accumulated a lot of sock yarn, mostly cascade heritage, solid colors. I am using red for this shawl. I plan to use the 3 different blues in bands of color changes maybe 4 inches each light to dark like a colorwash. I am early in the category of intermediate knitter and feel this book a challenge yet possible. Starting in December knitting gifts for 2014 birthdays and Christmas. I am very pleased with the style this book is written in, easy to follow. Charts are written out, easier for Mr to do than the picture of a chart for me.
Worth the investment. Worthy to be in your knitting collection.",5.0

"This book is an excellent addition to anyone's knitting library. The patterns are beautiful and simple, a rare combination.  If you're a new knitter, this book would be an excellent foray into the world of lace. If you're an experienced knitter looking for a quick shawl to knit, this book has numerous examples.
  The other nice thing about it is that I really want to knit most of the patterns. Out of 15, there are only two or three I don't care for.  That's a much higher percentage than my other lace books.",5.0

"I'm surprised by those who say this book is for beginners only. Learning lace is a fun, creative experience where you can experiment with your own designs. On the scarves with a lot of plain knit stitches, I plan to design my own lace pattern to really make then unique and personal. This book is a great way to explore lace and really take your skills to the next level! Simple instructions and great patterns.

Another suggestion for the shawls with a lot of knit stitches-great way to use a lace knit book with various lace patterns that you've always wanted to try!",5.0
"This author does it right.  She includes both, charts and written instructions for stitch patterns.  Brava!  I know a lot of people like and use charts.  More power to them.  I am of the other variety of knitter.  I like written instructions and hate charts.  This book does both, which is as it should be.  I have been knitting all my life and  I am an accomplished knitter.  I have used a chart under duress, so it isn't that I don't know how to read a chart, it is that I don't want to read a chart.  This book has some lovely projects and the instructions are clear and well written.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for some lovely lacy projects.",5.0

I'm ready for more from this wonderful book.",5.0

"This beautiful book for knitters is filled with shawl patterns that can be knit with sock yarns.  If you're like me, you have tons of sock yarns in your stash and don't want to use all of it on socks.  This provides a wonderful alternative for all that beautiful sock yarn.  Most of the patterns require just one skein and that means you won't have to go out and spend a lot of money on new yarns.

The patterns are both written out and charted, which works well for me as I prefer the written out patterns.

This is a beautiful book and a wonderful addition to every knitter's library.",5.0

"This book was made for those of us with lots of extra balls of yarn stacked to the ceiling. It is an excellent book with choices of all kinds of knitting styles. Whether you like lace, texture or even some variable yarn colorways, there is probably quite a few designs you will want to knit.

This is truly one of the few books where I am having a very hard time picking out the first one to knit. I like all of them for one reason or another. They are generally easy to knit and I think you will love these fun designs.

The designs are meant for the most part to be able to finish with a 100g ball of yarn with 400 yd.",5.0

"Oh my, I bought another quilt book!! Again, this product came in top notch condition, but I don't expect anything else from amazon.com!! The quilts are gorgeous and I have added them to my list of quilts I want to make.",5.0
This is a great book. It is easy to read and easy to understand. It has lots of ideas. Great for beginners as well as very experienced quilters,5.0
"The 11 projects in Barbara Cline's new book Simply Triangles are striking and lovely; Ms. Cline imparts a surprising amount of diversity to the humble 60-degree triangle.  First, she dresses up the conventional 6-pointed star with 7 patterns that incorporate borders, stacked strippy units, and even applique (making for a very Dresden-like star).  Next, triangles morph into flowers with 2 unique designs.  Cline ends with two Pinwheel-based projects: one is embellished with buttons and the other has a vivid tessellating appearance.  Each project includes a short ""Life Lessons"" box illustrating the huge influence on the author of her Mennonite family.  Photographs are in abundance, and highlight the exceptionally nice quilting details.  Both traditional and contemporary quilters will find something very pleasing here.

As for skill level, my opinion is that this book might be a challenge for some new beginners, as there are templates (included) and Y-seams;  precision piecing skills will be a must.  But I still recommend this book for all skill levels, as I remember when I first started out I went straight to the tough stuff so I could learn everything all at once.  (In retrospect, perhaps that approach is not recommended!)  Additionally, an endless supply of fabrics - or friends with fabrics - would be helpful because each quilt allows wonderful opportunities to play with value and contrast.

This book is set apart from all the rest, and not just for its beautiful contents.  Budget-conscious quilters might like to know there could be an extra ruler, an additional tool, and new products in their future:

1. Ruler -  Creative Grids 60-degree Triangle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creative-Grids-60-Degree-Triangle-Finished-Size-Up-to-8-Quilting-Ruler/dp/B0017RGKCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creative Grids 60 Degree Triangle (Finished Size Up to 8"") Quilting Ruler</a>.  I was hoping I could use the Clear-View Triangle I already own, but no.  The CG triangle is longer (and thus wider at the base) than the CV one, and most importantly the CG also has a differently configured tip.
2. Tool - Ms. Cline recommends using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jinny-Beyer-Perfect-Piecer-Quilt-Template/dp/B0050W9FRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jinny Beyer Perfect Piecer Quilt Template</a>&nbsp;for help with Y-seams
3. Materials - 108-inch wide black nylon netting (used as an overlay to create an amazing receding effect in several projects), batiste (for triangle foundations), 20-inch wide double-sided fusible web (Ms. Cline uses Shades SoftFuse which will add significant cost to your projects:  each 8x9 inch segment is about 1.00 per piece)

Ms. Cline is also the author of another absolutely stunning book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Struck-Quilts-Dazzling-Diamonds-Tradiational-Blocks-13-Skill-Building-Projects/dp/157120959X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Struck Quilts: Dazzling Diamonds & Tradiational Blocks; 13 Skill-Building Projects</a>.  Now that I own both books I am convinced she is in a class of her own, and the quilting industry is fortunate to have such an inventive talent.",5.0

"This is a great book - the instructions are easy to follow and the diagrams and pictures are great help.  I like the little personal stories included as well!  If anyone is worried about using the netting, you could do what I did with Star Shuffle and just add an extra shade of color for the needed contrast!  If you buy the kindle version, you can print out full size templates from a web link as well, so no worries!",5.0

wonderful book.,5.0
"It took a long time once I got notification that the book had been shipped for it to arrive, but once it got here, it was amazing!  It is one of the best books on how to construct very intricate designs without appearing to be very difficult.  I haven't tried them yet, so I don't know if they are going to be difficult, but they are by far some of the most amazing designs I've seen for a long time, so I can't wait to start on them.",5.0

Excellent new patterns for the future!,5.0
ever thing was great.,5.0

"This book is wonderfully illistrated and the patterns are breathtaking. I purchased the kindle verison.  The title says ""11 deceptively easy quilts"" As a new but I feel an intermediate quilter, I feel this should say intermediate to advanced quilter. (just my opinion)  If you are up to a challenge  with a beautiful quilt pattern this book is for you. Also in the beginning the book gives you the impression that a certain ruler ($20) is needed to complete most of the patterns, this is not true, the book gives you instructions for manually cutting.as well.
This is a great purchase from the Kindle!",5.0
Love the book. Good clear instructions. Well written instructions.,5.0
love it  thank you so much,5.0
Nice....,5.0
Its fantastic the color and very easy to make,5.0
Such a beautiful technique to be learned. Just looking at the front cover I can't wait to get started on this. Be assured that I will enjoy doing one or more of the quilts in this book. Thanks,5.0
The author of this book lays out directions in a way that makes it easy to build her quilts.  I would definitely recommend this book (and all of her other books) to anyone wanting an easy pattern with a beautiful quilt as the outcome!,5.0
another lovely book will be putting some of the ideas into a quilt. Well worth having this book would recommend this to those into quilting,5.0
I am excited about this book.  I have to hold myself back & finish my PHDs  but I am collecting my SABLE together for it as I work on the PHDs. I really enjoy it.,5.0

"Although, sewing triangles can be more difficult this book has some amazing quilts to make.  I plan on making several",5.0
What an exciting book.  I have always admired triangles in quilts.  But because they seemed so difficult I avoided them.  Barbara's book is easy to read and easy to understand.  She takes away the fears of triangles and makes triangles fun and easy. Shirley C,5.0
"Barbara's books are always fun. She is an incredible quilter and she uses her imagination to make triangles fun and easy to do. I really like the tips section of the book because it gives added information on cutting. I'm a visual sewer so I really like the detailed pictures she has on cutting and construction. My favorite pattern is the Triangles to Daisies. The netting overlay is a great way to add a different dimension and texture plus it is a way to get an added hue to the quilt without adding more fabrics.
I am an avid reader and I have to say one of my favorite parts of the book is the Life's Lessons section. I love how she made the book so personal.",5.0
The book was exactly as stated & I received it sooner than expected. I am a beginner quilter & quickly realized that I will need to do a few quilts before I attempt these. In my opinion is is intermediate level. Can't wait. Easy to follow directions.,5.0
"The assortment of patterns and the clever designs are wonderful.  I'm in the process
of making the Start Shuffle right now.... great pattern, excellent directions.",5.0
Just give me a quilting book and I'm in heaven.  Love it and can't wait to use some of the patterns.,5.0

"This is a great book with insight on how to make a intricate design easy.  This technique can be applied to the tumbling blocks quilt design.  If we can strip it, we can make it!",5.0
"I just love Barbara Cline books.  She really gives good twists to her patterns.
If you like different this is the book to get.",5.0
I saw this quilt made up and it was beautiful.  The directions are very nicely demonstrated and I can't wait to try this pattern.,5.0
"A quick look at the cover of this book lets any quilter know there could be great quilts inside. And, there are.",5.0
I already emailed a review for this book.  Why do you not get it?  Please fix your program so I do not have this coming the second time.,5.0
I love to find patterns that inspire and teach and this offers all of these things.  You will have beautiful quilts and even more ideas for your next quilt.,5.0
This useful tool is well laid out to help understand how colors are related to each other and how they work together.  One of the better color guides I have ever seen.  The person who shipped the product did a great job of packaging and it arrived before the promised delivery period.,5.0
I'm a quilter and this reference tool is super and especially helpful for the color challenged individual like myself.  I like the format presentation too.,5.0
"I was so excited to get the new 3-in-1 Color Tool&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-3-in-1-Color-Tool-24-Color-Cards-with-Numbered-Swatches-5-Color-Plans-for-each-Color-2-Value-Finders-Red-Green/dp/1607052350/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate 3-in-1 Color Tool: -- 24 Color Cards with Numbered Swatches -- 5 Color Plans for each Color -- 2 Value Finders Red & Green</a>&nbsp;to see what changes Joen Wolfrom had made from the original.  I was extremely pleased to see that she'd put on the front of each color card the very things I had to keep turning the old one over to see - the color plans that make the tool so unique.  So now I can quickly turn to a color that I want in my quilt (or even what I'm planning to wear that day!) and see which colors are going to make my choice of color work together for a successful project.  And she's also expanded the tints, tones and shades for each color on the back.  Although I don't personally have a need for the color formulas on the back, I know that others who use color in their work will find them extremely valuable.  It's not easy to take something that is good like the original 3-in-1 Color Tool, and make it better, but Joen has certainly done that!!  And the frosting on the cake is the new Studio Color Wheel that goes with it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-Color-Wheel-28-x-28-Double-Sided-Poster/dp/1607053500/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio Color Wheel: 28 x 28 Double-Sided Poster</a>",5.0
"This is one of the best color resources around.  If you want to make a quilt that includes certain color families, you can take this handy tool to the quilt shop with you, put it next to the fabric, and know whether a specific fabric will ""go"" with the other fabric in your quilt.

And it's a great value, too.",5.0
"My color tool has helped me alot with purchasing fabric for my begining quilting project, I am now using it for knitting and deciding what colors of yarn will look more attractive.  Great Product, many ladies in our quilt group has asked to use my Color Tool.",5.0

I keep one in my art studio for obvious reasons and the other in my car for when I go to the floral nurseries! I love to use this for choosing complimentary plants to those  already chosen.

"The Ultimate 3-in-1 Color Tool is excellent for learning how colors work together making it very useful for quilters but it is also useful to scrapbookers, artists and anyone who works with color. It works very well with Joen Wolfrom's book, Color Play: Easy Steps to Imaginative Color in Quilts.

"I am so happy I found this tool!. While I've just started in quilting, this is an amazing tool for any art project.  I'm also in the process of building a new home and am so happy to have the knowledge that this product provides.  I would also highly recommend the author's book, Adventures in Design, which teaches all of the elements of design with many examples of each element.  If you are a visual learner, these tools are fantastic!",5.0
"I learned so much with this tool. I went through all my pencil brands to find each exact ""pure"" color marked on each color card. I made a color chart and use it for picking colors within the same family of color. Myself and friends were surprised to see a color we would have chosen as red is actually the ""pure"" orange. The color combination are endless.",5.0

This tool is indispensable.  It has helped me select exactly the right fabrics for my projects.,5.0
Comprehensive value information,5.0
"AWESOME PRODUCT. You can't go wrong with your color scheme. The instructions explain basic color theory and pallet very well. I would get her book and then take her Craftsy class. Now, the class is a struggle to get through as she goes deep into color theory. However, if you stick with it until the end, you will never, ever look at color the same way again! You will be a COLOR MASTER!",5.0
I love it! A handy Quick reference tool!,5.0

"Love this little companion to the Color Play book. It's rather formulaic, but that can be a good thing.  You have a choice to use the tool's recommendations, or play against them....

Bought this as a drawing prize for our quilt guild and the winner says she loves it.,5.0
"I already own this. Bought it years ago.  But I have put is some where and can not find it.

You'll be glad you did.",5.0
"This is perfect for everyone of every age who colors.

I have been using a color wheel to teach my Grandchildren about basic color theory but that is a little complicated for the younger children, now instead of being intimidated because they don't know which colors to use, they use this guide to choose just one color.

 The guide provides them immediately with the Complementary, Analogous, Split Complementary and Triadic Colors and shades of color that go with the main color. It also lists the color by name so it is easy to find the colored pencils to match these colors.",5.0
This is the coolest tool.  Thanks for shipping so promptly.,5.0
This is a good color tool.,5.0
"I see most reviewers are quilters.  I'm a spinner-dyer and I don't understand why there aren't some reviews by my breed.  This is an invaluable tool for dyeing yarn or fleece.  The formulas are given for each color for both CMYK and RBG.  I can achieve any hue, tint or shade that I want and replicate it.  Come on, dyers, get with this book.",5.0
I got this in the mail today and was so excited with how neat this is. It is going to be a perfect tool when I pick fabrics for my quilts.,5.0
This is a great little tool. I actually bought two of them. I keep one in my sewing room which I use for quilting. The other I use for helping to coordinate home decor. It lives in my car with a note of which cards coordinate with my home. It is very handy.,5.0

"As a longtime quilter I love any tool that helps with colour, I took Joens craftsy class which is where I learnt about this tool and I highly recommend both!",5.0
"I love colors and use it well.  The product dispels doubt in creating color combinations in anything,  be it craft or clothing. It is a big help to a crafty senior who veers away from ""just grey"" while sticking to the simple, classic style of Hepburn, from hats down to socks and Mary Janes.  Don't stop, world, I'm not ready to get off.",5.0
"I carry this around in my purse, now, to help choose colors for quilting material. The red and green filters have made it MUCH easier to choose a range of colors to give better contrast in fabric choices. I have started using them in collage creation, also, when I'n stuck on what to do next. They always help determine whether to go darker or lighter. And the color cards themselves, that help choose color combinations, are great. I'm not much of an artist or quilter, but this, I think, makes me a better one than I would be without it.",5.0
This is a great tool for matching colors within the same color group.  I keep it in my purse when I go to purchase fabric and use it to help me coordinate my pieces.,5.0
"Very nice color tool.  Helps to see what colors will look like with black/white added. Shades and values are easy to see, easier to mix when following the colors from this tool. Also good when checking color combinations for quilting.",5.0
Extremely helpful for a color challenged quilt maker.  Helps to channel my color selections towards colors that complement rather than distract.,5.0
"This is very helpful when picking out fabric. I even got one for my sister.  We are both quilters and some times when you see certain colors together, it's hard to know for sure if they actually go together, this tool helps and confirms your choices.",5.0
"This is a must have to selecting fabric in a store! I used it yesterday and it really worked! I love the green and red see through swatches, easy to see the contrast...Joen Wolfrom has the companion book, Color Play, which uses all the colors on the color tool, describing each color, etc. Both a good investment...I will use both when picking out colors for quilting!",5.0
I saw this at our quilting group and since i have problems with color decided to order one for my use.,5.0
This really helps me to put together color combinations to see what might work. It has really helped me to figure out good color palettes.,5.0
"I've recently started quilting after having sewn for many years.  I often have trouble determining what the undertones to a color are.  Red can have a blue, orange, yellow, etc., undertone and in some projects it really matters.  I have found this tool to be a great help in figuring that out.  Even if my exact color is not matched on a card, there are enough swatches that I can at least determine which page it belongs on.  Here's to happy quilting!",5.0
"This is a very useful tool if you want to learn color work, it has two vinyl value finder very useful for quilting and other thing that need a value finder.",5.0
"Learned about it from a teacher at Mannings Handweaving School, and I keep it close by when I'm planning a new warp.",5.0
"My small art quilt group purchased these for using in a year long study of color. Everyone knows the basic 6-color wheel , but this tool breaks it down into 24. It also gives shades and tones of all 24 segments. Very excellent!",5.0
"Good book simple to use and easy to take with you while planning projects.  Also, explains in detail using color.",5.0
"This is a great tool for quilters.  Not only does it have a lot of information about choosing colors for a project, but the color cards are excellent.  The red and green lens sheets are very useful in determining value of the fabrics chosen.  The way the pages are fastened together makes it easy to use, and the size is perfect for tucking into a purse when shopping for fabrics et.",5.0
This color chart is easier to carry around and easier to use than a color wheel.  It is also more durable.,5.0
This has got every color you can imagine and how to combine them.  Been around a long time - don't know why it took me so long to purchase.,5.0
"While my technical skills are top-knotch, my artistic skills are pathetic. I lack the gene that allows spectacular color combinations that make a project POP. Not any more, though. I have yet to find a color that isn't represented and the combinations are awesome. Hopefully, I'm learning as I go. Every time I use it in a store, someone asks me about it & wants to know where to get it. It's the best tool I've found since the rotary cutter!",5.0
"If you are going to work with improving color on your quilts, I consider this the #1 must- have tool.  Joen has color intensity and tone depicted on this little tool so you can match those on your quilt.  It will also help you with gradient color if you want to do a quilt that starts one color on one side and gradually changes into another on the other side.  Also great for color wheel - star - quilts.  This is going on my peg board and in my purse every time I go to the fabric store.",5.0
"I'm the kind of person who has no idea what colors go well together, but who wants to make beautiful quilts. This little tool makes shopping for gorgeous quilt fabric a pleasure! I identify the swatch card for my focus fabric, decided which of the suggested color combinations I want to use, pull those color swatch cards and go shopping! The result is always a surprisingly delightful quilt.",5.0
I got this for my wife who is a quilter.  She loves it and uses it when planning color schemes for quilts and other items that she sews.,5.0
A wonderful tool for those who are seeking to step up their ability to use color.  I recently used it with a fabric that I loved but had not found fabrics I particularly liked with it.  The tool sent me in a totally different direction from the one I thought I should and the result is stunning.  Highly recommend for quilters who want to think about and us color differently.,5.0
Very useful to have. I use the color view finder all the time. I like the color cards and it is  so easy to use.,5.0
"I found the Ultimate 3-in-1 Color Tool to be everything it said it would be.  Heavy quality card stock with excellent color imaging.
Easy to use and understand.  I would recommend this to any artist in any field of work.  I used this tool to coordinate the colors for a quilt.  Quilt came out fantastic and had great feed back from other quilters.",5.0
"I use this whenever I'm planning a new quilt.  It helps you balance just the right tone of color with other colors so that your quilt is harmonious and more pleasing to look at.

For art quilters this is, in my opinion, a critical tool; and you can take it shopping with you to help you choose just the right color fabric. Making quilts is too laborious to be disappointed in the end effect.",5.0
"I am not naturally educated or confident about what colors go with other colors. This fits in my purse and gives me a great tool for figuring out what fabrics I need for quilting a particular product. I still have my color wheel, too, but this is such a great help for me when at the fabric store, don't know what I would do without it.",5.0
"This was purchased for help in quilt making.  You can combine the colors in all sorts of different ways, decide on what you like best, then go shopping for material.  Sometimes you want drastic contrasts, sometimes just a blend of different shades. It's also been very helpful in looking at the pattern you want to quilt, and deciding to do the same pattern in different ways.  Recommend it highly.

Try it with clothing, too.  Skirts, tops, vests, you can come up with some striking matches and contrasts.",5.0

Love shawls and there are some really beautiful ones in this book. Directions are fairly easy to follow. Happy crocheting.,5.0
I have the yellow books and now if I loan one out I don't have to worry about losing my place.,5.0
You never have too many patterens and these are great. I use them for donations for the chem people. I make matching hats to go with them. They make people feel better.,5.0
Great petterns!  I like a challenge rather than the same thing all the time as well as variety.  These patterns will definitely help in that area.  Thanks.,5.0
This is a very nice book.  It is great in that is folds flat on your lap.  The instructions as clear and look like a novice like me can follow easily.  Quickly sent and received.  Very pleased with the transaction.,5.0
"Along with other books that I gave my Daughter-In-Law, this one is special.  I know she will love making these shawls for her friends and co-workers at her church.",5.0
"This is a wonderful book, not just for Prayer Shawls, but for shawls in general.  Book is hard covered, spiral bound and small enough to fit in bag with yarn without worry of it getting creased.  Directions are clear, and I have loaned this book out to members of the Prayer Shawl Ministry in my church.  They also love this book.  I gave book 5 stars because I highly recommend it to all who crochet.",5.0
"Great product, with wonderful directions, however the book is a little small.  I fall into the elderly class, and the directions were very hard on my eyes.  Had to copy and enlarge...but the variety of shawl patterns were amazing and very creative!",5.0
"I love this pattern book and it was half the price of the same book on eBay!  I always check amazon, when I find something on eBay.  It is always half the price.",5.0
I am on my second shall out of this book and they are wonderful and the patterns are so easy to understand.,5.0
"these craft books are great, I love to find all the information I can get. I always try to learn more stitches, and creative ways to make new things.  I hope you will enjoy this  as much as I do. It all depends on your hobbies, and the things you like to do.",5.0
This is the nicest crochet book.  Not only the patterns beautiful and easy to do  but also I'm able to use a book stand on my end table to set the book in an upright position.  Yudo's to the author.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.,5.0
"Crochet Prayer Shawls:  The book is very interesting.  I have started making one of the patterns.  Lovely, informative, good book.",5.0
"I just received this little book, and absolutely love it!  After looking at all of the patterns included (more than a few times), it is really difficult to choose one to start working on.  Photos are included for each shawl pattern, and I feel this is not only a great feature for the crocheter to know what the shawl will look like when completed, but also to aid in choosing which shawl to make for a particular person.  I love this book and its easy instructions, and I'm sure with each shawl I crochet I will love it even more.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys crocheting.",5.0
"I was very impressed with this book. Hard cover with spiral pages made it easy to fold open to look at while I crocheted. The pictures were great and the instructions were very easy to follow. It wasn't one of those cheap little pamphlets that fall apart easily. Its a good quality durable book.

I was impressed with just how many shawls were in there. Sometime when you get a crochet book, it only gives you a few patterns but this book had several. They were very easy to understand and the pictures are great.

I would buy this book again and several just like it.",5.0
This is a great addition to my crochet book collection! All of these shawls are lovely and uncomplicated patterns.  I've already bought the yarn for one and plan to make at least 3 others.  I also like the enclosed spiral binding.  The book lies flat for easy consultation while crocheting.,5.0

Looks great in a frame. Good price/quality print.,5.0
The format of this book highlights that these are all highly acclaimed artists.  It includes thoughts on what inspires these artists and there exhibitions and career backgrounds.  The patterns and photos of them are inspiring.  I poured over my copy for days just as a visual eye candy treat.  My knitting group also loved it.  I purchased it as two of the designers are regularly in my knitting que.,5.0
"The patterns in this book stunned me with their beauty.  There are few knitting books I can say that about, though I own a considerable library of them.  The downside is that the charts for an entire sweater front are printed on a single page, making the squares very, very tiny.  But it's worth every penny to go and have the pages blown up at Kinko's or Office Depot, or some such place.  I am in the middle of the Princess Line Sweater right now and it is incredible!",5.0
The sweaters featured in this book are unusual and would be works of art if completed. The photography does not always show the whole sweater. I believe this to be because the fit on the sweaters is bulky. The sizing might have to be redone before  the sweaters would have an American fit. My favorite is the cat sweater which is cute and artistic at the same time. I strongly recommend this book for fair isle knitters who want something out of the ordinary.,5.0
"Once again, Donna Downey doesn't fail to delight us! Even more great  projects with easy to follow instructions and lovely photographs. A ""must have"" book for every journaler and scrapbooker.",5.0
I bought all three of Donnas books and am so happy.  I make custom scrapbooks for a living and am always looking for different elements and designs for my clients albums...not to mention my own.  The book is very easy to follow with simple step by step instructions and she gives a list of where to buy all the products she uses.  I highly recommend this and the other two books for anyone who is ready to experiment and move away from the regular albums to incorporate the WOW factor on their bookshelf at home!,5.0
"""Uncharted Territory"" is true! Donna Downey can do things you never would have imagined with ordinary household objects and scrapbooking materials. I couldn't put this book down -- I stayed up all night reading it, marking projects to make. So much inspiration -- so much fun! So nice that she also offers step-by-step instructions, unlike many books and magazines that just give you product lists and expect you to figure out everything on your own. Very well-done.",5.0
This book is well put together and enjoyable to browse.  It is full of creative ideas that make you want to get to work (or play) and do something with that beautiful patterned paper you have.  There are 25 different ideas for creative journals or books and nice instructions for each.  I've already picked out five I want to do first.  I am thoroughly enjoying this book.,5.0
"This is one of the best craft books to come along in a long time.  A ton of creative ideas to display memorobilia and pictures.  Effective directions and if you have a question on how to complete a project, the author is more than happy to answer the questions.  I bought all 3 in this series and I would recommend it to everyone.",5.0

"High quality canvas textured surface, good for dry and wet media.  This is a tough rough surface that I like working on.",5.0
Fantastic value on this paper. I was working it pretty hard and it stayed intact. I will buy again if I ever run out. Nice tooth. Smoother than most water color papers.,5.0
"I just ordered my second set of pads.  I am very pleased with this paper. I use it to make the top layer of cards. I use WN watercolors, Zig pens, Arteza watercolor pens in my designs. This paper is not Arches and does not behave as such. If you are creating a masterpiece, this is not the paper for you.",5.0
"Great sturdy paper, perfect for working wet.",5.0
It was exactly what I wanted. I am very happy with the Sketch book,5.0
The best watercolor paper I've used so far. I really love the way my watercolors behave on this paper. Flat washes are much easier now.,5.0
Paper is a gift for my 88 year old artist mother...appears to be of good quality,5.0
"I really like this paper! It has nice weight at 140 lbs., and it has 32 sheets, which is an awesome deal at two packs for $18 and some change! It is cold press, so it has tooth to it, and I like the linen-look to it. It's a great value! I find that it holds up well to watercolor markers and watercolor pencils, as well as normal watercolor paints. It's also nice for mixed media work. My son uses it for ink drawings and zentangles, etc. I will definitely buy again!",5.0
"For a cellulose paper, its pretty awesome! I would highly recommend this paper to students and artists alike. The paper takes watercolor beautifully. I will be buying more to practice on.",5.0

Good quality and fast delivery,5.0
"I got these on a sale here (lightning sale, I think) and they're a very good quality. They're a tiny bit larger than regular 8x10 paper, so they're not for large painting projects, but the quality is good and they're great for smaller projects. Now I need to get those paints out!",5.0
Love the thick texture and professional look to work.,5.0
I really like the quality of the paper,5.0
This paper is fantastic!!!,5.0
Great pad with thick sheets! I bought this for my son and so far he's been happy with the quality of this paper.,5.0
"Thirty-two rough-textured, large, heavy sheets accept both pencil and watercolor brush equally well ( Arteza's Watercolor Pencils are a perfect and fun match).  A two-pack will satisfy many hours of sketching or fine finishing your artistic visions.  This fine paper is worth the price.",5.0
"This paper is amazing according to my daughter. She uses it with the Arteza water paint brushes. Which I highly recommend. She only got one of the packs. Another daughter will get the other. From what I can see, the paint went on smoothly. I will be buying more.",5.0
"Arrived as advertised, on time, at a great price!  Well done!",5.0

Nice and smooth,5.0
"I am retired and when I told my daughter I was going to purchase adult coloring books to keep busy, she said, to buy Faber-Castell colour pencils. I am so glad she told me about them. I love them. They are easy to use. The colors are rich, glide on smooth and if the point of the pencil breaks, just use a regular sharpener to sharpen. I bought two boxes and when I wear them down I plan to buy more of this brand.",5.0
Good selection of colors. Easily able to vary the intensity of the color.,5.0
Very nice and high quality set of pencils. I replaced my daughter's crayons with them and she enjoys drawing so much more now.,5.0
pretty nice staff,5.0
"Smooth, wonderful rich color, and no breakage problem like other brand colored pencils!",5.0
"Great color, when you sharpen them you don't have to sharpen half way through the pencil in order to get a good tip. These are exactly like the Fabre-Castell 24ct Triangular colored penciks. We though they were different t because of the soft lead title. This is not the case both sets are exactly the same.",5.0
I wish...out of all the pencils I have bought.....that I had purchased these first. Vivid colors...pays smoothly. Very nice pencils indeed.,5.0
"These are great for my coloring books!  I didn't realize these were triangular, I would of preferred round... but  that was my mistake.",5.0
"I really like these colored pencils. The main pencils that I use are the expensive Prismacolor, but these hold up well next to those, but are much less expensive, and buying them on Amazon saves me even more money on all of them. I have bought three different Faber-Castell sets and love them all. They offer colors that even my 132 color set of Prismacolor don't. I highly recommend having more than 1 or 2 sets of colored pencils if you are a serious colorist. They may all have light blue or pink, but every sets colors are different and make you collection even more versatile!!!",5.0
"Great pencils, not too soft and not too hard.  Colors are great.  I still like my Prismacolor pencils, but these are
a great addition.  Recommend these to add to your collection.",5.0
"I have found my new love!  These pencils have such a nice soft lead it is easy to get great one pass coverage as well as laying on color for depth.  The triangle shape makes them easier to hold and my fingers don't seem to get the ""sore spot"" from grasping the pencil too tight.  I can see now why people love FC so much!  If these are this good, I can't imagine with the Polychromo's would be like!",5.0
Love these pencils.  Great colors and so smooth to use. Granddaughter and I making beautiful art!,5.0

"Lovely pencils! Vibrant color, will be ordering more for sure!",5.0
Love these,5.0
"I always loved these when I used it when I was in school. I didn't like the crayola and crazart color shades (no offense, I still use their crayons for my todler).
Triangular gives a good grip to toodlers. It makes them.hold pencils in CORRECT manner.",5.0
Bought these for my sister along with a quilters coloring book for her recovery from open heart surgery. She says the pencils were very smooth.,5.0
"Very nice colored pencils. They seem to be a compromise between artist's pencil and ""regular"" colored pencils. I don't know what an artist would think, but they are very nice for coloring books.",5.0
Would order again.,5.0
Awesome deal,5.0
"Wonderful texture for coloring, there IS a difference in brands! I remember the Faber-Castell name from when I was a kid and my artistic mother did pastels and sketching. I joined the millions of adults who have found relaxation through -- that's right -- adult coloring books and I started out with sharpies (which are fun and vivid) but I wasn't able to get any shading or the softer shades and effects I wanted. I've tried all kinds of pencils and had held off on these but this set is wonderful. They ARE softer than you might be used to, and if you want a sharp tip be prepared to sharpen more than others (perhaps). But even when rounded, they cover more area and the shading is really nice. They are not wearing out unusually fast, and I use them a lot. Faber-Castell has a lot of options, my friend has the watercolor ones which have easy-grip dots on them which I like too. These have a nice triangular shape. I would absolutely get these again and will look into their other products.",5.0
Lovely.,5.0
"These are the best colored pencils.  The points never break like cheaper colored pencils, yet they are still reasonably priced.",5.0
Good value for hobby usage.,5.0
Solid pencils. Do not break with pressure. Rich color!,5.0
"Love these pencils along with my Prang, Prismacolor, Raffine",5.0
These are a softer color than most of them but are great for shading.,5.0
"First of all, I wasn't sure what they meant by the tri-colored pencils and then when I got them, I saw that the pencils are triangular in style. They are very interesting and super easy to hold. These are just what I was looking for and work well with the Faber metallic pencils I just purchased.  The lead (or whatever it is) is soft yet doesn't break easily. The colors are vibrant and I can't get some beautiful sparkly accents with using these and the Faber metallic colored pencils and I don't need  to use a metallic gel pen. Each of the pencils offers a rich, intense color and when I use them with their matching metallic colored pencils I get a beautiful combination. I am hoping that these colors will give me more inspiration to work in my adult coloring books. Very excited to continue using these!",5.0
I love the way these pencils put color on the page so much better and true to color than others I have tried!!!  I will definitely buy more of these pencils!!!,5.0
Love these pencils. They give a great color and will hold a sharp point. Really like them better that Prismacolor premiere.,5.0

"These are my very favorite colored pencils, the color is bright and vibrant and the lead material, what ever it is actually made of is soft. This means coloring is easy and the color is brilliant. If you are looking for quality colored pencils, specially for adult relaxing coloring then these are perfect for that and so many other things. Any artist would love these!",5.0
excelente,5.0
LOVE these pencils. First discovered  them in a citrus lane box and was impressed ever since. What a difference quality pencils can make. International packaging is always interesting but the pencils held up well - none broken.,5.0
"These are super soft, you don't have to press for color which is great, but they also break super duper easily.",5.0
"Wife is hooked on the Adult Coloring activity. Bought these for her to use knowing that the Faber-Castell brand is and has been a ""Best"" in the art supplies category for many, many years. She's very satisfied with the performance and quality.",5.0
My faves!,5.0
"I was using Prisma pencils for a long time. I was frustrated because when I sharpened them the leads would break which meant I went through pencils very quickly. So I decided to try the Faber-Castell pencils. I really love these pencils. The leads don't break when they're being sharpened, the color is beautiful and the lead is soft enough that it colors in smoothly without any pencil lines. My only complaint is the color name is not printed on the pencil. You wouldn't think this is a big deal. After all you can LOOK at the pencil to tell the color but I sometimes I work in my planner sitting in my chair in the evening and my lamps don't have true light bulbs so I can't determine the color of the pencil. That is irritating. But overall I love the pencils.",5.0
Just what I wanted.,5.0
"I just started working with colored pencils, and these are my favorite so far. They go on smooth, their colors are vibrant and they don't break/get eaten up by sharpeners as badly as comparable brands.",5.0

"details on this patch are very good, def a fav gift for the recipient. Would love if they offered a hook & loop option, but won't hold that against the quality of the product.",5.0
Bought these as a gifts for friends and really impressed with the quality and speed of delivery!  I recommend these patches for sure!  I picked up 10 of these and plan to share it out.  If you buy in the US watch shipping cost.  But worth it if you buy in bulk!,5.0
"The photo's really didn't do this patch justice.  It's made extremely well and looks GREAT!  I've seen other similar patches depicting this moment from PREDATOR, but this one was much, much, better than anything I saw on ETSY.  It arrived looking great!",5.0

"I purchased this Recipe Journal for a friend who was drooling over my Book Journal Moleskine.  The friend has been saving recipes and loves to cook, so just the thought of having such a beautiful book to place their loved recipes was awesome!  So, I bought it for her!  (Why not share Moleskine love, I say!)

When she got the book we opened it to find stickers for her recipes and lots of room to detail all the facts, ease of cooking, time to cook, etc.

She took it right home and started getting out her piles of magazines and began cataloging her favorites.

A GREAT gift for those chefs in your family/friends.

THERE'S NOTHIN' LIKE A MOLESKINE!",5.0

"My daughter is leaving for university in a few weeks and I wanted her to take some ""home"" with her.  Being from Acadiana, our cuisine is unique & I was fairly certain that Berkeley wouldn't serve her a proper gumbo.

I copied all of her favorites from beverages to desserts.  I included simple instructions on when to know your roux is about to burn and recipes for sauces she has loved forever.  I know she will appreciate it & it makes me feel I am with her...in a small way.",5.0
Great journal. The only thing (as marked in previous comments) the print has  to be very small. Not so good for long recipes.,5.0
"I bought this to have my daughter's grandmothers, aunts, or any other special people in her life write down family recipes in. The intention is that I'll give it to her someday as a gift for her wedding or other big life event. It seems like it'll work good for the purpose! I wish the page tabs weren't pre-stickered and that the pages were all structured the same for my purpose but still a nice journal!",5.0

"I am an unabashed fan of Moleskine journals and I love their new Folio line of products.  I have been waiting for their release of the graph paper (""squared"") journal and I am quite pleased with the larger page size & better quality paper.  After you fill one out, you can place it in your bookshelf where the handsome hardcover binding will stand the test of time.  As with most Moleskine products, these books tend to be pricey, but they are a great way to memorialize those little life events that you want to remember down the road. I also like giving these out as gifts to friends & family to record the special moments in their lives.",5.0
"Fantastic! Exactly what I wanted and more. Great page layout for writing down recipes, smart looking design. Bonuses- has a divided pocket in the back to throw loose recipes into, calorie chart with some food items already logged, and a little food calendar that shows you what's in season each month. Love it!",5.0
"I bought this as a gift for a dear friend that was moving away from home. It was the perfect addition to the gift basket, however the book is impressive enough on its own. The pages are a little thin and you must write small to fit the entire recipe, but otherwise exactly what I was looking for. This book comes with the right amount of organization that just makes everything easier. Definitely a must have!",5.0
Very nice book. Now I will quit losing my favorite recipes. Tried a computer program but like this way of doing it much better.,5.0

"Single Greatest cookbook ive seen. Perfect size to fit in a larger back pocket and so many categories to help forgetful cooks, like myself, remember every aspect of a dish. I just wish it had more pages or replaceable. I'll just have to get another one. I'm completely ok with that.",5.0

"Highly recommend this. It's about the standard size of a notebook here in the US. This is what you want if you're normal, in the math and science field. The graph paper is perfect, not too small or too big.

The paper feels amazing, the cover is hard yet flexible.

Honestly this is the perfect notebook! Please don't take my praise lightly. This IS the best note taking notebook for you. :)",5.0
"I was very happy when I saw that Moleskin now made larger books.
The squared pages are really great for my design work and ideation.",5.0
"I saw an artist using this moleskine an art journal. I have to admit it - I do not like ""squared"" paper and did not wish to even try it. The more I saw her posts and photos of her ""Grid Book"" - I jumped in with both feet and decided to order it. I have literally become addicted to it. Why - I really and honestly don't have a clue.  Love the weight of all the paper in all the Moleskins but this is now my all time art journaling side-kick.",5.0
"I'm in a UK based degree program, so I went A4.  Moleskine's are really well made, and the fact that it's slightly larger than my other papers makes it easy to pick out of a stack.",5.0
"the paper is highest quality, the book cover looks great and is durable. you cannot go wrong with selecting this item.",5.0
"My only complaint is that it's so nice I don't want to use it!  As always, Moleskin comes through with a quality product.",5.0
I really like this notebook.  It's perfect for my everyday use.  The quality is amazing and I was very satisfied with the price.,5.0
"I needed to upgrade my notebooks for this year, considering last year's (30c variety from Walmart) are literally disintegrating from how much I have looked back and referenced them. I am a pen snob/fountain pen user, so I needed paper thick enough to prevent bleed-through. These notebooks are expensive, but they have quite a few pages, and will hopefully last me through grad school as a reference.

PROS:
thicker paper than the regular Moleskines--no bleed at all, hardly a shadow
huge pages
look super professional -- no more spiral bound notebooks!

CONS:
really, really heavy",5.0
"I needed a high class looking grid patterned paper notebook for work, and this seems to be about the only product on the market that works. Yes A4 is not the US 8.5x11 inch paper, but who cares. If you need a full size quality bound professional looking notebook, this is the ticket.

Highly recommended.

If you need a cheaper version and don't care if it looks like your high school chemistry lab book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Graph-Paper-Composition-Notebook-Requested-By-College-Students-The-World-Over/dp/1481011537/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Graph Paper Composition Notebook: Requested By College Students The World Over</a>&nbsp;works well. It's way less expensive, and looks that way too, but the paper is good, and if you use them only in the lab it won't what it looks like.",5.0
"I specifically needed a notebook larger than the normally found sizes, and it needed to be ruled.  This one is perfect because i'm able to lay out my design charts on a single page, or two pages if need be, as opposed to having to break a chart into various parts and making it more difficult to read.

The notebook is very sturdily built, and it seems heavier than what I expected.  The paper also seems a bit thicker, but I'm pleased with the results of its use.

Go Moleskine! They make great stuff and I don't buy any other brand anymore for things I want to hold on to for a long time.",5.0
I love these notebooks for my daily journaling. The grid ruled book works just fine and is excellent for that use! I just couldn't find the regular ruled notebook when I made the purchase!,5.0
"Moleskine is like the apple of paper notepads. Well rounded, elegant, discrete and very stylish.
My only concern is that the brand does not appear to offer a line of ""bleedproof paper"" notebooks.
I find it difficult to use sketchbooks that aren't bleedproof, as I use copic and other brands of
markers.",5.0
"I have several smaller Moleshine Products.  The Moleskine Folio A4 Notebook Squared fits another one of my needs. It makes the perfect journal for documenting/logging the results of various meetings with clients.  It is light, portable, and with the squares, sketches are easily made by both my clients and myself.  It is a great complement to my laptop. I recommend it to anyone who has dealing with others where a need to document the results of meetings.",5.0
"Simply the best. If you want a book to do everything -- horizontal, vertical, etc this is the one. It works for conventional and out-of-the-box thinkers who want to keep track of their notes and have a repository for all of their great ideas. Use it once and your note taking will change forever. M.",5.0
"The photograph here was misleading... I thought it might be of a different cover material but the notebook is the same as the 'large' squared black hardcover notebook one might buy. Same nice hard black cover.

I also thought the actual squares might be bigger. Not so, which I'm happy about. Squares are the same size; the only thing that increased was the page size. And wow this notebook is big! It feels like a photo album in your hands... approximately the size of a personal laptop when closed, but probably a tad bigger. The downside is that it is heavy, but understandably so. I wouldn't take this traveling with me, I don't think but I appreciate the bigger pages and would definitely use it as a regular notebook for any purpose whatsoever. Would be great for business. Looks very professional.

Overall, this product is fantastic and I'm thrilled Moleskine has released it. Just be aware of those items I mentioned above:
It is heavy.
It is large.
Otherwise, it is the same squared hardcover black Moleskine you've come to love.

Thanks for reading!",5.0
"I've owned a Moleskine pocket (ruled) notebook for over five years now. I've only filled half of it, but I'm constantly amazed by the amount of punishment one of these notebooks can take. I always use a B or 2B mechanical pencil to jot down notes, and even my earliest entries are still legible.

I needed a proper journal for technical use, and was a little hesitant at choosing between the squared and the plain A4 notebook. I eventually purchased the squared, still slightly fearing the thickness and darkness of the gridlines. When I draw, I don't apply too much pressure, and I was afraid that the gridlines will dominate every entry.

Well, my fears were mostly unfounded. The lines are precisely the same thickness and color as the ruled pocket notebooks. And so is the paper. This does mean that I have to make more of an impression when I draw (as opposed to writing), but it's not a dealbreaker.

If you own a pocket Moleskine, this is the big brother in every respect (down to the little historical insert). It is quite hefty, despite its thin profile, which is likely due to the heavier paper used in Moleskines. You don't notice the weight with the pocket notebooks, but it definitely shows in the A4s. I tend to treat the journal a little more gingerly due to its weight (like never grabbing it by the cover alone, like I freely do with the pocket notebook).

Overall, a good buy if you apply a little bit of pressure with pencils when you write/draw, or if you use a pen. If you like feather-light pencil touches to register, you'll probably want the plain Moleskine A4.",5.0

"I've never cooked before, so I need my hand held a little bit when it comes to having everything set up properly. This little book really eliminates the need for any questions - you can separate your meals from appetizers to dinners, and each meal is its own tab. There are sections for how high you need to preheat your oven and how much of each ingredient you need. Very helpful for those who like lists and are perfectionists with organization as well!",5.0
I had one of these already but I loved it so much (and was in need of a new cookbook) that I wanted another one! I'm glad Amazon had it!,5.0

I love this journal i am able to write up my fav recipes and keep them in one location. I do wish the ingredients area was a little larger. But I like the style and you can put a lot of detail. I'm enjoying filling mine out.,5.0

"We're a Moleskine family as it is, and I was ecstatic to see there was a Moleskine recipe journal. Cooking is my passion and I have a good amount of never-fail recipes written down in random notebooks or on scraps of paper that I used to hoard in the corner of the kitchen. Now they're all in one neat place.
The journal is split up into different meals - there's a tab for cocktails, main dishes, sides, desserts, etc. I guess my only complaint is that it's not more specific. There's no section for breads or soups or cookies. Also, there's only a page per recipe. So, if you have a long recipe or a recipe that has many steps, you will probably have to take over another page. It's not really a big deal, but it irks my OCD.
Another cool factor - the journal is embossed with little kitchen-y designs; forks, rolling pins, spoons.",5.0
didn't get to use it for very long for circumstances not in my control but this recipe book had some really great features.,5.0
This is a great organizer for recipes especially if you are traveling or for a gift of your recipes. Very nicely organized.,5.0

"I write pretty extensively for a personal movie blog, but of course I don't have the time to write a full review for every movie I see. However, I do have time to scribble some notes in one of these journals. Then later, when I need ideas for particular types of movies to review, I can easily go back and find something interesting to write about.

The organization of the books is excellent. It's got the alphabetized tabs for easy reference, but also plenty of space to personalize. I mostly use mine for overflow (when I run out of pages for a given letter) or for making lists.

Some people have complained about the alphabetized tabs. After all, who watches enough movies that begin with Q or X? I actually found this to be a joy for me, as I discovered movies that are now some of my favorites simply because the journal pushed me to find movies that start with odd letters. And the fact of the matter is, if you're a film junkie you're gonna end up buying a lot of these. So don't worry about filling up your C's long before your J's. Just buy another copy and keep watching.",5.0
"Love this journal, was exactly what I was looking for.",5.0

"That's nearly one month of meal planning. Make sure your 29 days written in there are balanced and full of nutrients. Strive to follow that month after month and you're sure to meet your health goals. This has really helped me create a balanced, nutritious, affordable, and overall healthy meal plan that is super easy for me to follow and grocery shop for. If you're the kind of person who doesn't enjoy eating the same stuff (I'm a college student...I have my staples in order to stay healthy on to go), throw in some extra pages with your daily food intake recordings. The moleskines are very durable and the elastic closure keeps your stuff inside quite nicely.

anyway, all in all, I really love this journal. I hope it works out for those of you who decide to keep it!",5.0
Love it. It keeps everything so organized.,5.0
Awesome,5.0
This is a very organized way to write your recipes. I was blown away at how the pages were laid out. You get quite a bit of room at the back to make your own. It comes with some stickers to make it easier and there is a folder slot at the very back of the book. Overall it is great and exceeded what i thought I was getting.,5.0

"I've been using the Moleskin Wellness Journal for about a week now and I must say... I love it!

I've been looking for an integrated journal like this where I can log workouts, caloric intake, goals, etc. This is (almost) perfect!

Features I like:
1. The tabbed pages make it really easy to find things and record stuff. I'm a college student and I like that I can just throw it in my backpack and go! If you're a small purse carrier, it may be a little difficult due to size, but you could always record things when you get home.
2. The stickers are definitely fun!
3. The bungee that goes around the cover makes it practical for saving wrappers that have nutrition information-- and you don't have to worry about losing them! There's also a little accordion folder in the back (like all moleskines) to store goodies as well.
4. The goal section.
5. The game and sport section-- especially because I'll be running 5Ks soon!

Features I'm not fond of:
1. The General Health section. I'm not into vitamin supplements or anything of the sort, so this section is kind of superfluous, really. That's just a personal preference, though. I've decided to use it for my before and after pictures, as well as an area to record my weight progress.
2. Some other reviewers have complained the ""Diet"" section is too short. I'm afraid I have to agree-- HOWEVER. That is not a deal breaker (for me, anyways). There are 6 blank tabbed sections in the back. Once I run out of room in the original ""Diet"" section, I plan to use one of those.

Hope this review was helpful! :)",5.0
What can I say?  I love Moleskine products because they are top notch.  I also love Pac-Man.  The Pac-Man graphics are low key and they give you some great little stickers.,5.0
"Confession: I always keep a few of these in my closet for emergency gifts. I was given one as a thank-you gift by a woman I nannied for years ago, and it was one of the most thoughtful gifts I ever received. She had written some of her recipes in it that I had liked, which made it all the more meaningful. Now I do the same thing - as a birthday present, graduation present, etc. It seems like a generic gift, but it can be made very personal just by adding a few favorite recipes.

"I have a chronic condition that sometimes makes me feel awful and puts me in bed for days at a time. When I have times like that i watch a lot of TV. More recently I got a Roku player so I could enjoy more movies that I have wanted to see. Soon, however, I found that if I watched a movie when I was at my illest I would forget and tried to re-watch the same movies over and over. So now I write down all the movies I watch. I love this journal and the only thing I would do a bit different is put less customized options at the end and a few more lettered tab pages in the front. The only reason I say this is that I seem to have a penchant for movies starting with the letter S and it's already full! I will end up using the customized portion for overflow so it's not a big problem. Basically it just simply means your Moleskine Film Journal will be flexible and grow to be whatever you need it to be!",5.0

i just love everything moleskine. im not using this for a couple years- that way when i start my own family someday ill have recipes that are stored away.,5.0
"I bought this journal since I'm just starting to get into cooking, and I wanted somewhere to keep track of what recipes and ideas work and which ones don't.  I used the stickers that came with the journal to reorganize the pre-labeled tab sections, whose labels didn't necessarily work for me, but I'm sure they might for someone, and hey that's why they come with stickers anyway, right?  Speaking of the stickers, there's a wide variety of pre-printed labels for all your needs (there's ones for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; different categories of food; labels for keeping track of restaurants, websites and shops; etc.), and also a handful of blank ones, just in case what you want isn't already there.

The journal opens with pages on measurement conversions and calendars of what produce is in season when, which I know will come in handy.  Each recipe page has separate sections for all sorts of little tidbits of information, including things I usually forget to write down, like how many the recipe serves and good wine pairings.  After the pages devoted just to recipes, there's the sections where you add your own tabs, and each page is blank, divided into 5 sections by lines.  I can think of a lot of different ways to use these pages, so I feel like everyone can find the way to use it that would be most beneficial to them.  After that, there's several just plain blank pages which can obviously be used for just about anything.  In the back, there's an index, where you can write in yourself what recipe is on every page, for quick reference.  The back cover has a stretch pocket where all the stickers are stored, and I've already put several recipe clippings from magazines and such.  The capacity of the pocket isn't great, but I think it'll be fine for my needs.  And I think if it were any larger, it might be too big; as is, I can fit it in the largest pocket of my apron with a pen, and it's always where I can find it when I need it.

Overall, I really enjoy this journal so far, and I definitely feel like it lives up to the standard of quality that the Moleskine brand suggests.

The journal is awesome. I loved how it had many spare pages at the back and that it gave all these stickers that gives you ideas for the other pages such as memorable scenes. The whole journal can be inspirational and will give good memories for the movies that you see :),5.0

"I love to cook and most of my recipes are either made on the spot or have been time tested to perfection and though I have them all stored neatly inside my head, I wanted to be able to record them so that Ic an pass some down to future generations. This is the most comprehensive recipe record keeper and much more advance next to how my grandmother keeps her recipes (note cards in a recipe box).

The quality is exactly what you would expect for Moleskine and could not be any better.",5.0
"I bought this journal for my wifey who is exceptionally inspirational about cooking and making up recipes. She needed to write them down somewhere so I decided why not go with a journal specifically made for this very purpose. And may I tell you she is extremely happy with it!

Pros:

- Fantastic Moleskine quality
- Nice tabbed layout
- Blank space in the end for whatever you feel like writing in there, so you are not limited by the tabs
- Unit conversion cheat sheet
- Wine pairing guide
- Nice set of stickers to make your own sections or just leave notes about recipes. Nice touch!

Cons:

- The space on pages is rather limited so long recipes are somewhat tough to fit

Wifey is already finishing her second journal and ready to purchase third one. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants recipes in a stylish and well organized journal. 5 stars!",5.0
"If you have small, neat handwriting this is a well-crafted and completely USABLE recipe book/journal.  Comes with tons of stickers to customize the tabs.  Templates for additional page types are available for free online.  If I had to come up with something I dislike, the paper is thin enough that you should test a couple of pens to make sure they don't bleed through before deciding which one you are going to use.  My fountain pen bled through slightly, but a Sharpie pen (not marker, pen) works very well with this.  Extremely happy with this purchase.",5.0

"Gracias a los reviews que le ac (en ingls, obvio), no tuve ninguna sorpresa (negativa) al abrir mi caja desde amazon con mis moleskine, empecemos por el principio.

La libreta mide unos 13,5cm x 21cm x 2cm, vaca se ve bastante fome y hasta me pregunt Que voy a hacer con esto?, pero apenas empec a llenarla, fue maravilloso, porque habitualmente tengo problemas ya que al ver tantas pelculas, y al haber tantos actores en las mismas pelculas, se me confunden a veces.

Bueno, es evidente, despus de escribir 2 reseas juntas, que las paginas son un tanto delgadas, por eso, recomiendo no usar un lpiz de tinta y mejor usar un lpiz pasta (para que la hoja no la absorba).

Son 240 paginas, 6 planas por letra (imposible poner los 8 Harry Potters en la 'H'), es mas creo que mas adelante tendr que usar el otro titulo o rellenar en la X o Y (existe un indice al final, por lo tanto es poco probable que se te pierda una resea)

Los stickers parecen ser pocos para poder complementar las reseas, pero no sean tacaos y senlos.

El lomo de la libreta se puede personalizar con stickers, no los malgaste, ya que al ser el lomo muy liso (y creo que no poroso)el sticker se sale.

La moleskine viene con un un pequeo diccionario para traducir los conceptos que hay en la libreta y en los stickers, es bastante til para ciertos conceptos que se pueden confundir o para los que no somos nativos en ingls.

En fin, estoy feliz con mi libreta, los detalles en la tapa son destacables y realmente la hace mas querible.

No es como para traerla siempre en la mochila/cartera porque igual es grande y da la sensacin que se tiene que cuidar mas porque tienen que durar mas (me refiero en el tiempo, como recuerdo de las pelculas que viste).",5.0

"I recently bought 2 of this excelent notebooks. I'm a Moleskine freack and also cook so had to have this. I leave in Venezuela so I order the notebooks to be shipped to a friends addresss un US. A month later I receive my to Recipe Journals and runned to open them up. Both were identical, shrinkwrapped, same name on the front ""Recipe Journal"". Once I open them I figured out that even having the same identifocation one was a Recipe Journal and the other a Wine Journal. Not nice. probably a Moleskine packing problem but now I'm without my secong Recipe Journal far enough to be able to return the wrong one.

In any case, any Moleskine notebook is a work of artcraft.

Had to say it.",5.0
"First off, the journal is great. Perfectly organized, it has everything you need. Of course this is a Moleskine so its basically the perfect journal- but for cooking.

Got this for my girlfriend and she uses it almost every day. I've gotten more praise for this little $20 gift than almost anything else (might not be a good thing haha).

Definitely recommended.",5.0
I squealed in delight when I received this book!  I have searched high and low for YEARS to find the perfect book to annotate my recipes and this is it.  I collect cookbooks and I have many folders overflowing with recipes that have been cut out from magazines or printed from the internet.  My whole system is a crazy mess.  I feel this book will ultimately allow me to put the recipes that I use REGULARLY in one place that I can grab and prepare. To me the book has an heirloom quality to it that makes me feel that this is an extra special book.,5.0
"I purchased this journal to compliment my massive cookbook collection and recipes found online.  I find that I will love a recipe in a cookbook, then promptly forget how much I loved it, where I found it, etc.  I rewrite my favorite recipes in this journal as an easy collection of my favorites.  The ""notes"" section on each recipe page has been very useful for writing who I cooked the recipe for, and what I paired with the dish.  Like many people, I found that the pre-labeled tabs did not compliment my particular cooking tastes.  Fortunately, you can select from the many stickers that come with the journal and cover the original labels with categories that better suit your needs.  I've found the back pages (which are divided into 5 sections per page) to be useful for writing basic recipes for sauces, dressings, and preserves.

Like many other reviewers, I would have appreciated this journal being slightly larger, but it's not hard to write smaller.",5.0

"Got this for christmas. My mom saw it and went and got one too. She paid $20 at barnes&noble, so this is a much better deal. This is very customizable. I put my favorite recipes in here (only the ones I've made and know I like). This is nice because I don't have to search through all my cookbooks for a recipe. I also get a bunch from allrecipes.com and this is a good way to keep them organized. One nice feature is an index in the back where you can see what page a recipe is on. Also the nutritional info on ingredients and measurement conversions in the front is nice.",5.0

"I received this recipe journal as a gift this year for Christmas.  I've always been a huge fan of the Moleskine journals, and figured I would enjoy this journal as well.  It does not disappoint.

My mom always had her recipes in a tin container with each recipe written on an index card.  This journal basically replaces this system, allowing you to keep all of these handwritten recipes in one place. The journal is broken down into different sections, appetizers, first course, main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and cocktails.  Each of these sections gives you space for the recipe itself, but also rate the recipe, put a wine pairing with it, and make little notes in the margin.

As with all Molskines, there's plenty of space for personalization and customization.  The sections in the back allow for you to add notes and other recipes, but are not the same format as the main sections.  If you want to continue to use the journal but have run out of recipe pages, I've found a simple solution.  On the Moleskine website, you can print out templates:

[...]

You can either type right on the template itself, or print it out and write on it like the other pages.  A great way to use up the pages in the back of the journal if you don't plan on using them for other things.  The journal also comes with stickers to further personalize your recipe book.

All in all a great journal for a great price.  I hope to slowly add to it over time, and finally get all of my mom's great recipes out of her tin and into my journal!",5.0
"This is a fantastic little book and I'm glad that moleskine has added to their line of wonderful journals with these. This is a handy little recipe book and it's format makes it easier to use than a recipe box or just plain notebooks. It's embossed cover is elegant and goes nicely next to my copy of ""The joy of cooking"". Not to mention the price on amazon is far better than in brick and mortar bookstores! Highly Recommend!!",5.0
"I try to crank out two three film scripts a year and after doing this diligently for the last several years, I thought I had my process of creation down pat. I'm a writer who likes routine and repeating my steps along the way to get to the end even if one story is vastly different than the other. I was a bit hesitant when I saw this product and it got to my house. I'll be honest and tell you that I even laughed a bit. At first glance I thought it was silly.

About a month later though, I started another script and thought about my moleskin journal and started filling in the details on page one from day one. The point of something like this is twofold:

1. It directs your pen to a specific thought when you have an idea and the object is to be specific.
2. Portability. Yeah, other journals are, too, but i kept remembering i had this crazy little thing and kept putting notes into it.

Maybe it's novelty, maybe it's a fad. I don't know. But I'm getting ready to purchase my third one now as I'll be starting a new script in November. If you use it to contain and direct yourself, you'll appreciate the results.",5.0
"The Moleskine Passions Recipe Journal is a perfect gift for anyone who enjoys cooking at any level; from novice to professional. The crisp, bright pages are made of quality paper that will stand the test of time. It would be a great gift for someone wishing to keep a record of family recipes. In terms of the space for writing, I found it to be a sensible balance; if you do have a rather long, complicated recipe, you could simply extend it over two entries. Overall, I highly recommend this product.",5.0
"I ordered 3 of the Recipe Journals. Kept 2 and gave 1 as a gift. I love being able to put my recipes in one place and it's so lightweight and compact enough to carry with me to cook at other's homes.
The only objections I have are that the additional pages in the back are grided too small for entering full recipes  and that there should be the ability to attach more tabs for catagorizing recipes.
I also had to cut a piece of transparent plastic to cover the pages while I cook so as not to stain the page...good thing for Moleskines to add to the journal next time.
Otherwise, I'm thrilled to be able to reduce a major pile of recipes into a small book.",5.0
"These days at least three quarters of the new recipes I try come from online.  It's easy to keep everything organized, particularly with [...], and I don't mind hauling my laptop into the kitchen in order to try something new.  Once I've tried any given recipe and liked it, however, I'd rather leave the laptop where it belongs.

That's where the Moleskin recipes journal comes in; it's excellent for keep track of recipes I've tried and loved. I do wish it were a little larger; my handwriting gets harder to read the smaller it gets and the ingredients field is fairly small, but if I wanted something bigger, I'd have just bought a plain notebook.  Basically, I'm in love with this journal; it suits the purpose I bought it for perfectly.  I'm looking forward to years of use.",5.0
"Thank you for my Moleskine Passions Film Journal, it's perfect!  I love the deep black cover embossed with various movie-related symbols like a director's chair and box of popcorn.  It gives the cover an interesting look and feel. All 234 pages are perfect, with alphabetized tabs to list all my favorite movies, along with information such as the director, actors, quotes, genre, awards, and my rating and opinion.  I also like that there is an insert included that tells me where I can go to download and print off additional pages to add to my journal. I like the fact that Moleskine has thoughtfully left 71 pages either blank or lined so that I can also create my own pages if I want.  And the two accordion style pockets in the back are perfect for holding old ticket stubs and the 202 stickers that I can use to further personalize the pages of my notebook.  The three silky ribbons sewn into the top of my notebook will come in handy for holding my place.  The film festival listing in the front of the notebook is impressive as well, I only wish I could go.  Well, maybe someday.

It's obvious that you and your coworkers put a great deal of care and attention into the planning and creation of my journal and I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate it.  This kind of craftsmanship is rare in today's world and should be applauded when it makes its appearance.

Thank you very much for my Passions Film Journal.  I absolutely love it and will fill it to the brim with my favorite movies.

Your fan,

"The 5"" by 8"", 240-page Film Journal notebook is part of Moleskine's Passions series that also include issues for Recipes, Wellness, Books, Wines and Music. We live in a world where not too many of us can find the time to write down their thoughts, with a pen and on paper but, again, the Moleskines aren't for everyone. To the extent that there are people who not only love to write but love to write specifically about the movies they watch, the Passions series Film Journal is a notebook dream come true. But, let's examine what one gets.

First and foremost this is a Moleskine, and it's very much true to its tradition of look, feel and quality. It comes with the traditional and most useful elastic band, nice cardboard binding that allows it to lie flat when opened without cracking the spine, excellent quality paper, rounded corners, THREE ribbon bookmarks and the 2-pocket mini accordion file inside the back cover.

Now, this being a Film Journal, it includes a listing of a few dozen major film festivals, sorted by continent and location, an event planner, personal tabbed pages under half a dozen tabs with preprinted tab stickers to be found inside the accordion file. The main section is, of course, the movie journal. Alphabetically organized, it provides one page per movie with sections for recording the movie's title, country and year, awards won, directors, actors, quotes, notes, opinion and rating. For a movie lover who loves to write, can't get much better than this.

I love this notebook for its quality make, its design and for its familiar look and feel. But I am repeating myself. It's a 5-star item without hesitation.",5.0
"Organize your reviews of favorite (and not-so-favorite) films in this embossed 5 x 8 1/4 journal.  Alphabetical pages for recording reviews, film festivals, actors: where and when seen, year filmed and more.  The last half of the journal contains blank tabbed pages for additional notes. Personalize it with an envelope of tabs covering Events, YouTube, Facebook, Awards, Memorable Scenes, My Library, To rent, To Record and much more.  A list of attachable icons add to the personalization for favorites, not so memorable films and such.  A multi-language pullout gives the Moleskine history and info on quality control.

The notebook is well crafted with themed incised designs in the embossed black leather-like cover.  An elastic slips over the long end to keep the book closed and loose items from falling out, and the pages are acid free.

If you are a film buff and like to record your reviews and notes on what you've seen or what you'd like to see, this is the journal for you.

This is one of several Passions notebooks (Others include Recipes, Wine, Books, Music, and Wellness-six notebooks in all).",5.0

The second half of the journal contains blank tabs to store whatever information you like.

"i have been purchasing moleskines for the last decade and loved them all, however these little prince editions touch a special place with me.

the same quality craftmanship of the brand is present, but with new delightful, and sometimes subtle, touches.

(if these really are limited edition, i will certainly be stocking up)

some differences from standard moleskines:

printed (and slightly embossed-feeling) cover with the little prince standing on his planet graphic
both inside covers are printed with stars and planet graphics
a lovely three-dimensional pop-out of the prince sitting on his planet

i do wish the pages had had a bit of the star and planet print as well, and if there had been stickers it would have been nice, but otherwise, i am beyond a happy camper.

very highly recommended!",5.0

"Best remembered for the early '60s smash, ""Don't Let Me Cross Over,"" the husband and wife team of Carl and Pearl Butler snuck into Nashville at a time when their brand of straightforward hard country singing shouldn't have gotten the time of day, amid all the goopy pop crossovers of the time... Yet, there they were, hitting the charts regularly with their rough, wonderful vocals and dopey songwriting -- plain old hicks with strong country backbeat.  Like many of the best old hard country artists, there's very little of their material available in print today.  This disc only has ten songs on it, but they're all pretty good, including such winners as ""She Didn't come Home"" and the moralistic ""Temptation Keeps Twisting Her Arm..""  Worth checking out!",5.0

Thank you soooo much! This product worked great for me! I posted a pic of my finished product too! I used maybe a little over 1 cup and 2 teaspoons of water. The mix was pretty thick but I didn't want it to be mushy and figured I could always add more water. I bought some various wooden letters and stones at a craft store and put glitter on the letters. I just thought it made it a little cuter. But as far as the mix and the kit in general? It fit my need and worked just as I needed it to.,5.0
"This kit is perfect, you can use your own mold(s) if you want, you don't have to make a stepping stone, be creative! If your child wants to make one, then BUY TWO. This is a project for an adult who is attentive to detail and PATIENT. It was very humid when I made mine, so it took a long time to dry, water kept forming on the top, but I still got it done. Be careful not to add too much water, follow the instructions carefully. Regarding the bad review posted here, they have to suggest wearing a mask to cover themselves to not get sued by someone who decides their lung cancer was caused by breathing cement dust. I didn't smell anything. The best way to protect your pet's paws is to lay saran wrap down on the wet cement, push it down so it sticks lightly and flat, then push his/her paw down on top. Works like a charm.",5.0
This was a fun project. I now have a beautiful memorial of my beloved dog. Be patient and allow the cement to set up before doing paw prints-if too soft will not work. Plenty of time to do the art work.,5.0

"We used this on our lab who was 14 yrs old.  I mixed up the concrete since breathing it in can cause issues, but from there on out, I let my 4 yr old decorate it.  It was easy to mix and press his paw into.  He swiped through it the first time, so we just smoothed it over and got a good print the second time.  We waited about 15 minutes and then pressed in the stones.  We let it dry overnight. It looks much better dry!  It has been in the flower bed for a few weeks now and still looks really nice.  The dog has passed away and it's a really sweet reminder of him.",5.0

We got one of these with our first dog. After he passed away we got another kit for our new dog and then another for our next. All three dogs have passed away after long loving lives with us. We just inherited dad's dog and have a new puppy and just ordered two more paw kits for those two dogs. Paw Print Kits are a great way to memorialize your hounds. We love them. We gathered local stones instead of using just what was provided in the kit. We also placed the dog tags into the cement after getting the paw print. You will be thankful you got it. 5 Stars.,5.0

"I got these as gift for my parents. I did their puppies prints for them and it worked great. The bone stamp works well! I would recommend buying marbles or stones because the ones that come with it just look like rocks. Also, read the directions well...make sure that you absorb as much water as you can before doing the paw prints. Wait for it to set a little longer than the directions say. I had to reprint their paws multiple times because the water made them disappear.",5.0
"Super easy to use, instructions very clear.

I would advise not using all of the cement if you plan on using the final product somewhere besides outdoors. The cement block ended up so thick and heavy that I can not hang the final result indoor as planned. Plus, my dog would not allow us to press his paw into the cement very far, so the print is not even 1/4 the way through the material.

Very easy to clean the residue from the animal's paw, just keep a moist/wet towel near where you are doing the impression to wipe their paw right away.",5.0
We just finished making 2 of these - one for each of our dogs.  It was very easy and I think they will look nice.  The kit comes with some pebbles - we went to the craft store and got some glass beads to use instead.  I think they look nice.  Wait about 30 or 35 minutes after pouring the mix to press the paw.  We will do this with all our dogs from now on.  It's a very nice memento.,5.0
"My Rottweiler was diagnosed with Cancer, and I knew that we only had a brief amount of time before he passed away.  I was looking for a way to memorialize him, and found this kit on Amazon.  We didn't follow the instructions exactly, and our concrete mix was a bit too wet at first, but otherwise, a great memento.  Be sure to wash your pet's paw after putting it into concrete, as it can burn the skin.",5.0
"I have tried both the HP paper and the Office Depot paper, and the HP paper sure has better quality.
Both of them were done with the same steps, and it ends up that Office Depot one started to come off after 1st or 2nd wash, while the HP one is still on there without a scratch.
Also, HP paper fits more to the fabric, which it will be harder to see it was an ""iron-on"", but the Office Depot one was very obvious.
I will give two thumbs up for the HP paper!",5.0
"Well, I have used this product with more than 100 t-shirt and I have no complains. After my 3 first big trials... a really mess... It is easy to transfer (once you get used with the process), it is a fast process, and the image stay for a long time on the fabric. Of course, the transfer will not last forever, but after 100+ washing cycles, all of my t-shirt still are in PERFECT condition. I use soft soap, and a soft washing machine cycle. The most important words here, are: VERY high temp iron (mine is one with 1400 watts), very VERY high pressure when ironing (I sweat a lot in this process) and the fabric must be as flat and firm as possible (porous fabrics are not the best, as well as stretching ones like cotton-lycra are not a good option because when stretching, the image breaks).
 One last note: it is for white fabric. If you try it over other color, the image's colors will be different from intended. If the fabic is dark colored, you will not see anything after trasferring. This is because the WHITE color of the image after ironing comes from the fabric, so if within the image are white and shiny teeth, and the fabric is dark, the teeth will be black, as well as all the other light colors of the images.",5.0
"Follow the included instructions, especially the cold water one and they won't crack.  I've had some shirts for more than 100 washings, they crack less than my mass produced t shirts.",5.0

"At the time of purchase of this item, it was the best deal I could find for the price. A pack of 12 for $7.99 at my first purchase was a deal breaker. I purchased another pack of this a second time which was two days later and the price had gone up to about $10 but I still think it was ok as you can either make 12 or 6 shirts from these depending on your end design. The quality was ok and the transfers were done nicely. I was satisfied with the way my designs came out for a church conference. I'd purchase again.",5.0

"These transfers worked well - we followed the detailed instructions to the letter and all of the shirts came out looking good.

One BIG caveat - even though the packaging says ""For Light colored shirts"" these really work best for white shirts - for any other color, the shirt color is going to blend with the image colors. In fact, HP needs to label these better - inside the box, they actually say, ""For White Fabrics only,"" but not outside.

Easy to overlook: Make sure that you are printing a mirror image, otherwise you are going to get a laterally inverted image after the transfer! This is mentioned in the instructions.",5.0

"I used this to transfer a facial image (.jpg) to t-shirt material, in order to then attach/stretch the t-shirt material over a Styrofoam mannequin head. The idea was to create a facsimile of the face on the styrofoam head.

Following the instructions, the transfer process went without a hitch. The resulting image transfer on the t-shirt material wasn't as thin as the t-shirt itself, but it wasn't really too thick either - a little thicker than what you'd see on a t-shirt with transfer that you'd buy retail.",5.0
"I saw a decorator pillow made with a black and white iron-on transfer in a magazine and thought it would be a cool gift for my daughter and her partner for their home. I bought sturdy white cotton duck fabric for the pillow. I pulled up pictures on my computer of their Newfoundland dog, adjusted the printer to make them black and white, and followed the directions given in the transfer pack. I used the cutting board from my kitchen, put an old pillow case over it, and put it on the floor for good stability for ironing. I ironed carefully and slowly and went over the transfer and cotton fabric several times just to be sure. Then I let the fabric cool completely before I carefully pulled it away from the transfer. It turned out great. So much so, I decided to make two more small pillows for a set of three of their dog in different close-up poses. Each time I was careful to follow directions and take my time and had no problems with the transfer.",5.0
"I did everything the guide told me to do, which was only three very simple steps. awsome prodect i plan to make more t shirts soon. Keep in mind that if you do not cut the special paper directly along the outer edge of the logo, you could possibly have a empty white print you don't want.

I used this for a project at church and was delighted with the results.  I have since bought two more packages,5.0
"These transfers are superb. All you need is an inkjet printer, a bit of time, a T-shirt, a hot iron and a hard surface to iron on (not your ironing board) and you are set.

There are a few things to watch out for, but the results are fantastic. I used white T-shirts to print a photo transfer onto. It may seem obvious in hindsight, but the quality of the print is more down to what you print and the quality of the printer you use. The transfer will transfer anything you print onto it.

The documentation says to print whatever you want in reverse, which makes sense as ironing it onto the T-shirt will reverse whatever is printed. Having dutifully reversed the print and tested the print on blank paper I was ready for my first Transfer - be warned though - I used a Canon Pixma printer which has a very clever Paper Type option of ""Iron on Transfers"" and which reverses the print for you, so my image was changed back so I wasted a T-shirt! If your printer has a paper type of Iron on Transfer, you might want to do a test print on this setting using plain paper to see if it reverses it for you.

When you iron, you need the iron really hot and to press hard to fuse the transfer onto the T-shirt. If the iron isn't hot or you don't press hard enough, the transfer will not fuse properly and just peel off.

Unless your ironing board is solid, don't use it. Most boards use a mesh to allow steam to blow through and if you use an ironing board the transfer will only fuse where the pattern is solid. I used a block of wood with a cloth over it, then with some paper over the top of the Transfer so that the T-shirt wouldn't scorch as I ironed it. You'll need to iron it for a few minutes for the transfer to fuse properly. I started in the middle, pressing hard and working out to the edges. You can see when it has worked as you can see what looks like small bead of clear melted plastic oozing out from under the transfer paper.

The results are great. Enjoy.",5.0

"These iron on transfers were awesome! This was my first time attempting to do iron on's so I was a little hesitate about the whole thing.

I followed the instructions to the letter and my first white cotton T-shirt transfer was perfect.  The shirt's been through the wash once so far with no fading.,5.0
Over all I was very happy with the results. I did have a few that didn't work out- but I wouldn't say it was the product- it could have been that I didn't iron for long enought- or use used enough pressure. I would use this product again.,5.0
"These worked flawlessly (well, one out of 36 didn't come out perfect) on white t-shirts. We used black ink only, printing from a HP inkjet. Each sheet (after printing) was cut into two, as we put a logo on the front and a quote on the back. Mine has only been washed once so far, but it looks the same.",5.0
"This product is for white shirts only. There is other options for dark or colored shirts. We used this for a bright orange shirt and using black ink only (as dark as we could get it) it turned out okay. We also tried a color image on a white shirt and we were very impressed. It looked very good. The better your printer, the better your images will be. You will also want to cut away any extra paper from your actual image for best results.

One other thing to note - We put cardboard between the sides of our shirt. It worked well, but you need to make sure it is a completely flat piece with no crease or holes in it. It makes a huge difference. We ended up with a small bubble where we didn't get the image to stick to the shirt well and it didn't make it though the first washing. The rest of the image held up very well though through two washings so far.

In general, this is a great product if you have a great color INK JET printer. Don't even try a laser with this set of sheets. Great for do it yourself shirts, but you might want to practice with it a few times to get it just right!",5.0
"now if you're going to use all the iron-ons, then it takes about 2 hours to make a dozen or so t-shirts, but the quality is pretty nice, and looks very professional. All you need is a regular iron, and white t-shirts! perfect product and cheap too.",5.0

Good product! I bought this for my 16 months boy. He loves it and likes to push the chairs around. The height of the chair is high and he cannot get on easily at this time. But it's just a matter of time he will able to. I am sure he can use this set for few more years!,5.0

"My daughter received this table for Christmas at 16 mo's old. Just a week before, she had started making ""table and chairs"" out of everything. She loves it. It took a little work for her to figure out how to get onto the chairs since they're a little high for her (she's about 31"" tall now). Within a week, though, she's managed a method for getting onto the chairs just fine. She's already got crayon on it and it cleans up fine. I'm happy that I don't have to  worry about cleaning the paint right off like some of my friends wooden/painted tables.
The only negative I have is that I can't sit on the chairs. I'm an avg/petite size woman but the chairs only hold up to 70#....Luckily the table is low enough to be able to kneel at it pretty comfortably. Admittedly, the chairs would not make a comfortable fit for an adult anyway.",5.0
"We bought this table and chairs set for our 2 year old son's birthday.  We wanted a table his height where he could sit and enjoy a snack or play with playdoh, puzzles, or crayons.  It is the perfect size and very sturdy.  It fits neatly in a little corner of our small kitchen.  Occasionally our son climbs on top of it, and it seems very stable.  The chairs do slide on a tile floor, but we just keep the whole set up on a kitchen rug as much as possible.  It's a great buy for the money, and clean up is so easy.

"We bought one of these when we started collecting grandkids in the early-1990s. It survived five grandkids but when the youngest outgrew it, we donated it to Goodwill. Now we're collecting great-grandkids and wish we hadn't given it away. Hooray to Little Tikes for not discontinuing this very sturdy table and chairs. Yes, it's light in weight but to us that was a plus because the grandkids could move it around.",5.0
"This is exactly the same as what my brother and I had as kids. This table is perfect with the primary colors and gives my child a sense of being a ""Big Boy"" because he can sit at it and pull the chairs out by himself. Easy to assemble and store.",5.0
Just the right size for 20 month old. She is so proud when she gets on and off the chairs by herself.  We still need to be there when she climbs the chairs for safety. 4 and 6 year olds still use this,5.0
"We got this for our granddaughter for Christmas. It was delivered before it was due and in good shape. This is a very rugged table and chairs! A snap to assemble. All you have to do is snap the legs on and install the trim on the edge of the table.
The kids wile love it",5.0
Bought this for our grandaughter who is turning 3. She loves it and it is just perfect for her! And Little Tikes products are so durable I'm sure her new little baby brother will get to use it when he gets bigger too.,5.0

"Had this table and chairs for my granddaughter 12 years ago.  Passed it on to two different groups of siblings and still sturdy and in great shape.  New grandchildren with a 20 year span from the first and it was still available.  No hesitation as to which table and chairs were appropriate for a new cluster of grand kids now 18 months, 2-1/2 years, and another on the way:)",5.0
Delivered immediately; exactly as pictured; simple assembly; good quality and price; can be used indoors and out-this will get a lot of use,5.0
"A little before our son turned 2 years old, we started shopping around for a table and chairs for him to use. We didn't want a wood table and there are a lot of flimsy designs out there. Then we found this and bought it in good faith. Certainly one of the better purchases we have made as far as our son goes. It's over 4 years later and he still uses this.

Besides the durability that comes with this table (and chairs), we wanted something that would also clean easily as any parent will tell you, children at a young age can be messy. This table has a slight drop in it, so if liquid is spilled it won't go over the sides. Very easy clean up. Our son uses this for homework, eating, snack time, playing - and has used this for his occupational therapy. All these years later and it is still going strong.

Comes with stickers you can use around the outer edge of the table, but we never used it. Easy assembly.

Really, well worth the money because it lasts.",5.0
"I had one of these tables as a child I am now almost 21 (my table is just like this one but with a white table top) my table is 20 years old and still practically brand new my 18 month old enjoys it just as much as I did. When I got too old for it, it went to a local kindergarten classroom for about 10 years. It is still in great condition my kid stands on it and uses it just like any other kids table. Five stars for being so durable I didn't need to buy her one even after 20 years of Co tenuous use.",5.0

This table and chairs were a gift to my 2 year old  grandson . The set is sturdy and always being used for one activity or another.,5.0
"My daughter uses this for putting her toys on, playing, eating, coloring, its been very useful for her ""stuff"". The two chairs and table itself is strong enough for even an adult, very sturdy, thick hardened plastic legs, crayon marks come right off, but indelible markers are there to stay. Perfect for adult jig saw puzzles, strong enough to stand on on to change a lightbulb.",5.0

Great set.  Has been around along time.  I plan to bring it out on the patio in the summer.  Little Tikes is sturdy and reliable.  I have the kitchen my grand daughter's mommy played with.  She loves it as her mom did.  Quality products that last a life time!,5.0

"I bought this 18 years ago for my son and this little tikes table and chairs is still in working order.  My son is special needs and it is still in his room with his television on the table, along with an adult sized table and chair. The chairs are so sturdy. I have a neighbor who smokes and he comes outside and sits on the chair and smokes at night. The chairs are strong enough to hold an adult and they do not tip over at all. I can't say enough about this product except Well Done!",5.0
Durable my children had it until they were in their teen now I got it for my grand neice and nephew and they love it. It last forever!,5.0
My great grandson is a year and a half.  He wanted to sit right down and eat his lunch.  He needed help getting in the chair but I am sure in a few months he will be able to manage by himself as he gets taller. It was a nice switch from his highchair and he felt like a big boy.,5.0
"The table and chairs have the  same high quality of the product I bought 30 years ago for my child. The table was easy to put together and can be used indoors and outdoors. Would have liked it if it came with four chairs instead of two, though.",5.0
The perfect table for our 2 and 6 year olds.  Very durable.  My little 2 year old will climb on the table and it can support me sitting in the yellow chairs (200 lbs)!!,5.0

"My son and I are very pleased with Little Tike's durable table and chairs set
-Easy to clean
-Easy to move from room to room; lightweight (or even transport if you have a decent sized vehicle)
-Very durable chairs
-Great for making forts with too!
-The uni-sex colors make it perfect for all genders
It's a great set to help create a space for your child to color, read, paint, play with play-doh/clay, etc. All at the same time making it easy for the parent/s to clean up after!",5.0
"This product works great for our toddler. It is kind of lightweight, as mentioned in other reviews, but this doesn't bother us because our son isn't too rowdy with it. He uses it sometimes when eating his snacks, and for writing and coloring activities. Overall, we are satisfied with this product.",5.0
"This table is the perfect size for my 19 month old. She picks it up and carries it around the house which is not ideal, but aside from that, it is just what I was looking for.",5.0
My son loves this. I thought he was too young for it but oh not. He enjoys it and does everything on it.,5.0
"I was looking for a table & chairs where my little one could sit & eat, color, play, etc. This is a perfect fit for her! She's colored on the chairs & table, but no problem. Everything comes off with a Mr. Clean ""erase-all"" sponge. The table & chairs themselves are very durable and don't tip easily. While researching what to buy, I came across some expensive ones! This was a nice alternative since she is my last one, and will be getting rid of it once she outgrows it.",5.0
I purchased this for my granddaughter who is 2 and she loves to have her snacks sitting in her size chair. It has been great for art and craft activities for her age level. I love how sturdy it is and knowing it will last well beyond our use.,5.0
This went together well and very durable.  comes apart easily for easy storage.  My workplace has one in the waiting room and it gets alot of wear n tear and looks perfect even after 20 years of young patients beating it up every day,5.0
I purchased this table for my two small children. My two older children had one when they were little so I remembered how handy they were. They can use them for eating and crafting. They use the chairs all the time to watch tv. Definately worth every penny.,5.0
"Little Tikes Table and Chairs is one of the best items I have purchased.  It is a perfect size for my grandchildren.  They love it.  Very strong, can even handle this adult.",5.0
"This is a perfect table for a toddler. Our 2 year old enjoys all of his snacks on the table right in the kitchen.  Chairs and table are a little light so he is able to move them around fairly easily, but they stay pretty much where you put them.  Easy to clean and so far pretty durable.",5.0
"Purchased for grandma's house. Quick and easy set up. Sticker border was mangled in the box but the design was iffy anyway and the table is perfectly functional without it. Table easily supports my son's 30 lb self and chairs stack nicely on top of table for easy storage. Still the same ""original"" hard plastic construction as the old days ;-) Wipes off easily and holds up well. Good value, sturdy table set and the size is perfect for toddler snacks, meals, crafts and playing.",5.0
"I bought this set for my 14 month old daughter to start using.  I bought it after reading the fairly positive reviews that it had gotten.  I found the table and chairs to be well constructed and a good value.  She's been using it for about 4 months now and still loves it.  Yes, the chairs can tip over if a child leans too far back on them, but what chair wouldn't?  That's just something you have to monitor as a parent.",5.0
"We bought this table and chairs set for my 2 year old son.  It is very durable, easy to clean, and is light.

Positives:

-The edge of the table has a lip on it, so crayons and other items won't roll off (but not enough of one that your child could get hurt on it)
-There are no sharp corners!
-When on carpet, the tables and chairs do move, but the table is very sturdy
-Very easy to put together- it took me all of 3 minutes!

Negatives:
-The stickable border is ugly- but the tables looks better without it (it doesn't come already on thank goodness)
- The chairs will topple if your child isn't used to sitting on them... that being said, your child probably won't get hurt from falling on the table and chairs because they are light plastic.

We love this set and are very happy with it!",5.0
My granddaughter absolutely loves it. Started playing with it as soon as it was out of the box and assembled.,5.0
I bought this table for my 18 month old grandson and he loves it. Uses it every day and it seems to be durable enough to last a very long time.,5.0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson and he loves it. It's the perfect size for a child. He sits at it to play with his toys,to color and even to eat afternoon snacks. Plus it comes with a second chair for a sibling or friend to sit in. It is also very easy to clean. I highly recommend this table & chair set.",5.0
"My one-year old little boy is too small for the chairs at the moment and also not yet able to hold a crayon properly to draw. So, I would have thought that the table wouldn't be much use to him at this stage. I would have been wrong. The table has become a bit of a ""base station"". He holds on to it and gravitates to it a lot. I use it to feed him snacks and he stands at the table and eats them, then takes his water sippy cup off the table to drink it. This was particularly useful when, due to medical reasons, I had a few days of not being able to lift him. That meant his high chair was out. I can see this table being more and more useful as time goes on. Although not recommended, I can sit on the chairs (136lbs) with no thought that I am in danger of a huge loss in dignity. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.

I also like that the table is square (with rounded edges).

Like another reviewer, I didn't put the stickers around the edge. I prefer it like that.

It should be noted that the instructions say not to disassemble the table once the legs are joined to the table top. I am glad I noticed this caveat as we move a lot and I might have done that had I not noticed.",5.0
"This is a heavy-duty table for use by toddlers. We like the colors and the construction of it.

The only drawback is the lack of rubber feet on the bottom of the table caused it to slide all over our wood floors. We ended up purchasing some of the tilt-slider rubber feet that you can use to make it easy to drag/move couches or chairs. This made the table much less frustrating for our twins who were pushing it into each other before.",5.0
"I have not bought this yet, but I am going to order two for my grandchildren for Christmas, who will both be two years old.  I bought this exact same table and chairs except the table is a different color.  Even the yellow chairs are the same.  I have two sons that are 22 and 23 years old and I got this for them over 20 years ago.  I have done some babysitting over the years for friends and so I held onto the table and chairs.  I finally got rid of the chairs about 3 months ago so we could paint and lay new carpet in the house.  So after 20 plus years the chairs had to go.  I don't know if they make them like they use to, but it's Little Tikes and they are a great company.  If you are thinking about getting this item for your child, I say take a chance.  Even if it doesn't last 20 years...it's still a great deal.  Happy shopping.",5.0
"My son is 17 months old, and we use this table as a place for him to play with toys and to eat his snacks. He really likes it, it's easy to clean, and it's the right size for him. It does move around pretty easily -- for instance, he often pushes the table away from himself as he is climbing into the chairs. But I think this is more of a result of my son being new at sitting at a table and climbing into chairs more than anything about the table itself. I think as he gets older, that will be less and less of an issue. The nice advantage of this, though, is that the set is light enough that he can pick up the chairs and move them around himself.

I would definitely recommend this set to others. I think we're going to get years of use out of it.",5.0
"We did a lot of research before getting this table and chairs set for our two-year-old daughter and this one definitely came out the winner.  It is all made of very sturdy, durable plastic and is extremely easy to put together.  The surfaces wipe clean in a snap.  Our daughter loves coloring and doing puzzles at this table.  It fits two children easily with plenty of surface space on the table for multiple projects.  We ultimately went with this classic set because it seemed so much better built than everything else we had seen.  The chairs even hold the weight of adults easily.  My parents had this same set when we were kids and it is still in great condition (set up at their house for the grandkids).  We wanted something that would last for all of our children and feel confident that this set will do just that.",5.0
"Table is durable and chairs are sturdy.  The colors are great, especially the red table top to hide the marker and crayon.  The tape on the side of the table is optional - we chose not to use it.  Chair legs click into place versus screwing (good so that the little ones can't un-screw).  Overall, we are very happy with the purchase!",5.0
I have purchased two of these tables for my nieces and they both love them. The table is great for all kind of activities. I recommend this tale and chairs for all children.,5.0
"Other than the table being a different color, it is exactly the same table I purchased for my children. Now I have purchased it for my granddaughter and she enjoys sitting at it as much as her mother did. She puts her large teddy bear on the other chair while she colors or does a puzzle. The chairs are still as sturdy as before as they hold mommy, daddy, grandma, and grandpa. When we decided that we wanted to purchase a table for her, our first thought was to get the Little Tikes if it was still in circulation. When we discovered that it was, we looked no further and sent for it. The set came promptly and grandpa set it up in a flash. As we watch her play, we can still remember her mother, aunt, and uncle using their set. My daughter recalled the legs being green and the top was white with the same yellow chairs. Many manufacturers today cut corners on their products to save money but it does not appear that this item has changed in quality. Thanks for the memories Little Tikes both past and present!!",5.0
"We just got back from a vacation in Santa Cruz...the land of tie dye.  I didn't want to be tempted to buy a fabulous rainbow shirt for $20 or more for my two boys so went with this instead.  It was incredible!!!  Vibrant, and has stayed so through the handful of washes I've done so far.  I headed to youtube to watch some videos about techniques rather than going with the more expensive dye set from the same company that included a DVD.  Couldn't be happier with our ""rainbow shirts""",5.0
This worked great!  I've used it 4-5 times now.  I've never used another brand but this one is very nice.  I've had shirts go through 3 boys now and they DO NOT fade much at all (if any)!  They have never bled.  We try to set it with vinegar after but don't always remember to do it.  The colors are wonderful.  We have so much fun with this...most people think the shirts were purchased tie-dyed.,5.0
"I am a fairly experienced tie dyer (I have my own small tie dye business and have sold several items made with this kit) and I must say that I LOVE this kit. It's made in the USA, easy to use, and the colors are bright and vibrant even after several washings. I especially love how the instructions are fully illustrated. I highly recommend this kit.",5.0
"THIS KIT WAS AWESOME!! I have used many tie dye kits but this kit was by far the best! The colors are gorgeous and stay vibrant even after many washings. Its messy but any tie dye kit is... thats half the fun!
I recommend getting  a few pairs of gloves because its impossible to wash the gloves off and put them back on. You will need more pairs. I will definitely buy this kit again.

I HIGHLY recommend this product.",5.0

Fun,5.0
"This tie dye kit is amazing!  The color is bright and vibrant, and has not faded with multiple washings and being out in the sun.  I tie dyed a plain white swimsuit cover-up and two t-shirts and still had dye left over.  The instructions are easy and all the necessary items are included in the kit (gloves, rubber bands).  If I ever need to tie dye again, I would definitely purchase this kit.",5.0

Never buy any other tie dye! This is the best!!,5.0
What can I say! I LOVE THIS TYE DYE KIT!!! The colors are just so vibrant and they do not fade when you machine wash them. I have even washed a white tee with them too see how mich they bleed and to my surprise the tee came out white. I have purchased about 4 kits and so far so good. My only complaint is that the bottle top sometimes drip and they can make a bit of a mess but what can you expect? You are tye-dying! Five stars and would 100% recommend!,5.0

The little kid comes out of me with this starter set.,5.0
"I bought these to add to the large kit.  in case I just needed a little bit of extra color.  When we tie dye, we make a day of it.. and do lots of items.  This would be fine for a little mini project or like I buy them, to just have a little extra color on hand rather than mixing a large bottle from the big kits we use.  jacquard knows what they are doing when it comes to dying!  LOVE them",5.0
These dyes work better and last longer than any other you can get.  Makes a really vivid shirt.,5.0
Great Colors!!,5.0
"i have always been intimidated by tie dying, figured i would just end up making it all brown. nope! everything turned out so awesome! i get so many compliments on my shirts! they have not faded one bit, and i also ended up tie dying my husbands boxers with the leftovers ...and those haven't faded either.",5.0
This was my first time tiedying. The instructions where simple to follow. I tiedyed a queen size sheet doing the swirl. It didn't quite turn out the way I thought. The middle didn't get as much color as I was hoping for. But I still love it. Perfectly imperfect. I will be buying again.,5.0
"Great kit! Easy to use. My niece and I had a blast tye dying everything we could think of possible. These colors where bold and vibrant which was nice compared to some that tend to be a bit more pastel like.

Now after many washes the shirt that I did using these is still very bold and bright. I love it!",5.0

"These worked much better than other tie dye kits.  VERY intense dye made for bold colors.  A fun bday party activity.  Though they REALLY do stain clothes, so wear old clothes.  It even stained our plastic table and some bins we used.  We did a party and made pillowcases (hard to find white all cotton pillowcases) and that seemed more useful to people than t-shirts.

Loved it! ThAnks,5.0
"This dye is great, very bright colors and after several washings is still holding it's color. I tie died a white polo shirt with a spiral pattern and it turned out great. Jacquard also has some great videos on you tube showing the tie dye process.
Was only enough to do one adult shirt but I overlapped all the colors so my shirt had 6 total colors instead of 3. Overlap blue and yellow to get green for example.",5.0
Best Tie Dye Kit ever!!,5.0
These are the best dyes ever! Follow the directions and you will not be disappointed! Very vibrant colors that last. Thank you for such an awesome product!,5.0
My daughter really enjoyed making her shirts. She ended up being able to get 4 M size shirts tie dyed with one kit. She wants another one!!,5.0
the colors are great. and stayed even after i washed them. My kids are young but this was still something they could do.,5.0
"Purchased this for my Sisters Grandaughter for Christmas. She loved it was easy and fun for her, packaged contained enough product to do 5 applications. Just enough for her to know if she liked doing it.",5.0
"Awesome kit?mwould totally buy this product again. It came quickly, worked well, and my hippie sister was very satisfied with it.",5.0
"Worked perfectly! Plus- if you save the string you can reuse them, all you to do is dye the strings, let dry and reuse as new again. Recycling lesson too! :-)",5.0
"Used it to tie dye some shorts, came out great. Make sure to use soda ash it keeps the colour vivid.",5.0
"After buying it a year ago I finally got around to using it with my friends. The instructions were very simple to understand. The colors provided were great primary colors and applied vibrantly to our clothing. I applied the dye on a pair of shorts that were actually a cotton and spandex blend, so I wasn't sure how well the colors would turn out but they were still very bright and gorgeous. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to tye-dye. Even though it only comes with three colors, my friends and I just used extra bottles to mix colors.",5.0
"Best tie dye kit!
I didn't use enough dye on the shirts and onsies i tie dyed, but that was my fault not the product. :)",5.0
"Great, nothing more to say. This can create more than 5 shirts if necessary and the colors are gorgeous, I somehow even managed to create a light pink color with this dye. I don't know how but I loved it.",5.0

Super freaking awesome. I bought this during the summer and made shirts and shorts. They were awesome to wear to the beach. This was great!!,5.0
"My main objective was to dye a 50% cotton, 50% polyester sweatshirt and I know they say natural fibers are best so I was a little nervous.  This was my first time tie-dying so also nervous about that.  There were enough supplies to do a practice batch of two pairs of underwear, one pair of socks and one t-shirt before I went for the main course of the sweatshirt.

Everything turned out great and the kit was easy to use.  Recommended to anyone!",5.0
"So easy to use. Detailed directions for each step.

Comes with enough dye to do at least 6 shirts or more if your dying smaller clothes.",5.0
"I've been looking for a tie dye kit for a long time, seeing as I wanted to try it out and didn't want to waste a lot of money on the supplies before I actually tried it out.
So I bought this kit and a very good price. Shipping was fast. Delivery was definatey not.

This kit came with very clear and fun instructions.
Was easy to do, and results are fantastic.
Highly reccommended!",5.0
"I needed a simple kit that had everything I needed (minus the shirt).  Just what I needed.  I made two shirts with my autistic son and he loved it.  He really enjoyed squirting the dye over the shirt and watching the colors meld to make more colors.  We did the spiral pattern.  So easy!!!  The biggest time consumption is rinsing the shirt thoroughly after the dye sets.

I let the dye set 30 hours and it came out great!

This kit says it will make 5 shirts.  Based on using generous amounts of all 3 colors I'd say we could easily do 4 shirts total so if you were at all careful you could probably get 6 shirts out of it.

If you want more colors an idea would be to get more plastic squirt bottles (like small diner sized ketchup bottles) and mix the primaries into those to form the color you are after. However, keep in mind as you pour (squirt) on your colors that when they overlap they will form that color anyway.  So when you pour yellow first, then blue, just overlap it as much as you need to get a perfect green!

Definitely use plastic to cover everything around you.  Mainly your work surface. The bottles squirt nicely so you really don't make a big mess if you are even a little careful.  The only thing that got stained were the gloves we had on to protect our hands.  Nothing got on our clothes or on the floor.

I rinsed them outside in a bucket using the garden hose to get large volumes of water quickly.

This was well worth the money.  Have fun!!!

EDITED.....6 months later.....shirts washed multiple times.....I can't see ANY fading.....",5.0
"If you want to tie-dye, this kit from Jacquard is a great way to get started. It is a far higher class of dye than what you might find at the grocery store. The dye is pre-measured into squeeze bottles, so it's even relatively mess-free. The kit comes with everything you need, other than 100% cotton clothing to dye and a dust mask (important to wear when the dye is still in powder form).

I've done some tie-dyeing, but I actually like this kit most because it is the easiest way I could find Procion MX dyes to use to dye fabric for quilting. Procion MX dyes are top-quality, long-lasting, work in cold water, and don't fade or run (after initial washing) like many other dyes, so they are exactly what you want if dyeing fabric for a quilt or art project. However, Procion dye is a little hard to find, especially in small quantities for beginners curious to try dyeing for the first time. That's why I love this kit. You get enough dye (in 3 colors) to dye at least 12 fat quarters of cotton quilting-weight fabric. I used directions found online for dyeing a 12-way rainbow gradient using 3 colors of dye -- and this kit provided all the dye & dye fixer I needed.",5.0
"I've done a lot of tie dying (also, I am an adult), and Jacquard is the best brand that I have found. I have clothing that I dyed 5+ years ago and wore consistently ever since, and the color hasn't faded in the slightest. People ask me what brand I use all the time. Jacquard also makes a larger kit, for ~20 shirts.",5.0
"I purchased this as a gift for my 11 year old niece.  She had specifically asked for a tie dying kit for her birthday and while she enjoyed the process and loved the results, mom said it was pretty messy.  However, I'm not going to reduce the rating based on that because frankly I don't know how you can tie dye and not make a mess!",5.0
"I bought this kit for my first attempt at tie dyeing.  I was more than satisfied with the results.  My 7 year old daughter and I made five shirts and still have enough dye for another.

The kit came with 3 squeeze bottles that each had the powdered dye pre-measued in them,  just add warm water to the line and shake.  It also comes with a small bag of soda ash that you dissolve in water and allow the shirts (or what ever) to soak in prior to applying dye.  Some how this helps to fix or make permanent the dye to the fabric.

The dyes were incredibly vibrant and easy to use.  Being as this was our first time,  we watched a few youtube videos to get some ideas on what to do.  It truly was unnecessary,  as the instructions are quite clear,  still it gave me more confidence that we were doing it right.

We made 3 shirts using the spiral method,  1 folded horizontal 'accordion' style,  and finally one just balled up.  By far the classic spiral shirts came out the best.  The folded one looks pretty good,  but I doubt we'll bother with the balled up method again.  That shirt looks more like it just came off the paintball field (still not bad though:-).

Next time (and there will be a next time) my daughter wants to try her hand at doing a peace sign.  I think we'll catch a few more videos on that topic first.

Anyway,  I highly recommend this kit,  and I promise to 'report back' if I find the shirts fading.  So far we've only had 2 washes since making them.",5.0
"Another grandson Wish List (for birthday)coup!  This one was terrific ... he really wanted it, and the next time he arrived at grandparents' house, he was sporting a newly tie-dyed shirt (great job!) he was justly proud of.

"I have bought foam brushes from the local home improvement stores and from a local woodworking store for using with water based polyurethane products and these are as good, or better, than the ones from the local woodworking store. The foam brushes from the home improvement store always seem to tear apart when you hit a edge and leave little black specs all in the finish, or back in the can. The brushes from the local woodworking store use denser foam, hold up well, and after a wash I can re-use them. These appear to use slightly denser foam than them, better cost per a brush and the box is handy to store them away from dust versus the big plastic bag.",5.0

"Jen Manufacturing Inc. 2 Poly Foam Brush (Pack Of 48) were just what my woodworker spouse and I needed for finishing projects or painting.  The angled head of the 2 brush makes it easy to use in small areas.  The wood handle is about 4 long and  in circumference.  I use these brushes for craft projects or when painting a room in the house to cut-in as necessary.  They work well for getting a smooth finish  no brush marks  when painting a toy or stepstool that we have made for the grandchildren.  Best of all, they are easy to wash and reuse several times.

At one-third the price of 2 foam brushes found in the big-box hardware stores  approximately 25 cents vs 79 cents - Jen Manufacturing Inc. 2 Poly Foam Brush (Pack Of 48) are a true bargain.  More surprising, these brushes are made in the USA.  You won't go wrong buying these 2 foam brushes on Amazon.",5.0

"I have used Jen Poly Foam brushes for many years for varnishing and painting.  I think they are great - far superior to most foam brushes.  I get a good finish on my varnish.  The brushes in this shipment appear genuine and function as such.  Although it may seem wasteful to dispose of your brush rather than clean it, the solvent use and hazardous waste generated in cleaning multi-use brushes make disposable brushes seem more eco friendly.  At 33 cents each, it's probably cheaper as well.",5.0
They good quality foam brush.,5.0
Used them painting a bedroom and to make a collage.,5.0
"Many years ago, I discovered Jen's foam brushes. The foam lasts a long time, seldom breaking down (other brands failed very quickly), which means they work great for applying finishes on my woodworking projects. I recently completed one using a oil-based poly as the finish coat; the foam brushes permit an even application, and makes for a neater process. Between coats, I'll put one in a plastic sandwich bag - that keeps it from drying out, allowing the brushes to last longer. I'll also use them for applying gel-stain to the wood before spreading with a staining pad - just a ""neater"" process to dip the brush into the can.",5.0

I do a lot of painting so was happy to be able to have plenty of brushes on hand and was tired of running to the store for them so ordering this way works out well for me .

"These Jen brushes are my favorite for applying Cetol and Varnish. They're more firm at the tip than most other brands, likely due to the quality and density of foam used for manufacture. The result I like is that I can control the flow of material more accurately than when using the floppy foam type of brush that is sold regularly in the box stores. Jen brushes make for a better all-around project experience, i.e., less mess and cleanup, less frustration during the  application stage and more satisfaction with the finished job. The price per brush is excellent at this quantity and the vendor was excellent as well in shipping promptly. The product arrived in perfect condition. I will buy this product from this vendor again.",5.0
they work great,5.0
Same as other sizes. Works great and does not get floppy,5.0

Alas, I've been stuck using the non-Jen type which are horrible! With Jen brushes, I don't have to worry about bits of foam breaking off into my medium and marring my surface. I don't have to worry about the foam head separating from the handle. I can use them over and over with water based paint. I JUST LOVE THEM!
I use all three sizes and it's worth buying them in bulk so I don't have deal with the other brands.",5.0

"Fantastic deal, and these can be used several times provided they're rinsed thoroughly in whatever is appropriate for the paint/finish you're using (paint thinner/etc. for polyurethane, water for polycrylic, chalk paint etc.) I've also used them to apply an initial coat of glaze. They do best with polyurethane thinned a bit with mineral spirits. I've had some issues with bubbling when I used them with polycrylic, but I think that's more due to the limitations of water-based finish than the brushes. These are more durable than the ones sold individually at Wal-Mart or Lowes, and the foam is more dense.",5.0

As another reviewer has mentioned, these are far better than the ones you find in big box stores and less expensive. The main reason I would say far better is that you can use one of these all day long and it won't break or come apart if your staining or painting. Conversely, the box store type will usually become saturated and the foam separates from the wire that holds it in place after about 1.5 to 2 hours of continual use. This is a great buy on amazon that you won't regret!",5.0
"Ok so it's a foam brush. It isn't a real brush. I get that.  But I make beer pong tables and I use the foam brushes for painting. I throw them away after every use, for the convenience. I bought the foam brushes that you can find at Home Depot and Lowes. Those foam brushes snap in half easily. This is because there is a plastic piece that is inside the foam brush (sits in between the two foam sides), goes up only halfway (from the wooden handle to the tip of the foam brush) so there is no rigidity/backbone to the brush. After like 25 strokes on each side the plastic piece in the middle snaps. This doesn't happen with the one's that Jen Manufacturing Inc sells here. This is because the plastic piece inthe middle of the foam brush goes from the wooden handle all the way up to the tip of the brush. It's also thicker so it provides much more rigidity and last much longer. To this day, I haven't had one of the brushes snap on me. Very impressed with these foam brushes. Won't use anybody else's especially with the cheap prices.",5.0

They're made in the USA, too... So that's a bonus.",5.0

"I own a custom cabinetry shop and we stain a lot of different woods with oil based stains and lacquers and these have been the best brushes I have been able to find over the last 4 years and I will never buy anything else. They hold together well even after hours of use soaked in stain, mashed and rubbed against hundreds of doors and cabinet frames. With other brushes I would have issues with chunks of foam falling apart and if I dipped the brush too far into the stain the glue holding the foam part on the stick would become unglued and I would end up loosing the foam tip off the stick. I've never had either issue with this brand. I use to use 10-18 brushes per job with other brands and with this brand and how well it is made and holds up I've been able to get away with just one brush per job saving me hundreds. The foam tip keeps it's form, won't disintegrate and stays attached to the stick. Overall an extremely high quality product well worth the money and honestly the price per brush is a really awesome value you won't be disappointed with this brush.",5.0

"Far better quality than the typical offshore manufactured foam brush.  I use these primarily for varnishing, especially for the first few coats when I want to lay on a heavy coat, or for when something less than a museum-quality piano finish is required.  For those demanding finish requirements, a high quality bristle brush is used instead of foam.
Great price when purchased in bulk.
The foam is more durable than the cheapies, and the interior support for the foam works better.  I also appreciate that the wooden handles are slightly larger.  The quality is consistent.

one of the best I have used so far.  Only thing I find as a negative is the bar-code label being placed on the foam.  Remove it right away if you will be storing the brushes for any length of time.,5.0
"I bought these foam brushes because of all the good reviews I saw here.  I haven't regretted it and have ordered a second box of them.

Until I used these, I thought that the phrase ""quality foam brush"" was an oxymoron.  These have disproved that idea.  Yes these are cheap brushes, but they are not CHEAP brushes.

You won't get flakes of foam in your paint.  They will stay firm until the jobs done.  They will even allow you to brush out a paint film, although not as nicely as a bristle brush will.

For quick jobs, or the first coat, or jobs where you cant justify cleaning a good bristle brush, these will not just do the job, they will even do it well.

Highly recommended.",5.0
great price and quality.,5.0
These are fabulous.  I had bought some at big orange for a project I am working on.  They were flimsy and if I tried to clean them they would just fall apart.  So I said what the check..the price was less than 10 of theirs and I am getting 48.  A no brainer.  I am on my fifth or sixth coat of poly and still using the same one.  The foam is very dense and holds lots of product.  Love them.,5.0
These foam brushes are the best available anywhere.  They  work equally well with solvent-based material and water-based.  They are tough and can be used many times if you rinse them out.  I use them with water-base poly and just throw the brush in some water and leave it sit.  Two months later is is as good as ever--squeeze it out and start brushing.  They are the ONLY foam brushes I have ever found which are any good at all.,5.0

These brushes are awesome for the price.  I cannot say anything bad about them.  I would recommend against using them with latex paint since the strokes do not look like a bristle brush or foam roller.  It looks more like a foam roller that got stuck and was dragging across the surface.,5.0
These are great quality brushes.  Some foam brushes flake apart and really ruin the surface you are painting.  These do not do that at all,5.0

"These things are way better than the typical foam brush.  I am using them to apply polyurethane.  My typical foam brush experience has been that they disintegrate halfway through the job.  These things feel very substantial, it was completely intact when I finished the polyurethane job so I turned around and used it to apply primer to the next round of items that I am making.  The brush was still useable at the completion of that and I was being rough on it.  I tore the brush apart when I finished painting...there is a little paddle attached to the end of the wood stick and then the foam is sort of wrapped around that.  I am very happy with these and will look for them again when I get through the 48 pack.",5.0

"These are higher quality brushes than I expected, so the price on them is fantastic in my opinion.  My hobby is woodworking, and I make a lot of furniture.  I tend to use Tru-Oil and also some poly, and the finish I've been able to get with both is like glass.  These are firm enough to brush out excess topcoat so the layers are thin and even.  I haven't tried them with paint. but I think they are firm enough for this as well.",5.0

"I am almost finished with re-purposing my oak kitchen cabinets to a dark java color.  I decided to use Jen foam brush instead of a regular bristle one and even the tube sock many people recommend.  The foam brush glides effortlessly and leaves almost zero streaks when wet and after the surface dries, it is so smooth.  I ordered the 48 pack so I could toss out a used brush every time I took a break to allow for drying, etc.  These being made in the U.S.A. was important to me too.  Great product!",5.0
"These American made foam brushes have always been my only choice in brushes. The imports use coarser foam (and are sometimes redolent of some unknown & unpleasant chemical.)

These are perfect for applying stain or polyurethane. They hold a lot of product and apply it to the wood in a smooth even coat. Much better than bristle brushes. I haven't used them much for regular paint applications and really don't like them for that purpose. They are inexpensive enough that I don't bother cleaning them, just use and throw away. They hold up well. No coming lose from the handle and no falling apart like other foam brushes. I will reorder more when the time comes.",5.0

"These hands down beat any of the other foam brushes that I've bought at other stores.  They hold their shape really well and the handle doesn't come lose, which is my biggest gripe about foam brushes.

"I have been using foam brushes to apply tung oil finish to my wood working projects for several years now.  i find foam brushes do an excellent job at applying finish and are inexpensive enough you can dispose of them after a single use (cheaper than using mineral spirits to repeatedly clean a non-disposable brush).  Up until now, I had been buying my foam brushes at lowe's....the foam brushes sold there are generally around $1.15/piece.  they are poorly made and often break/snap in half when you are using them.  I never really gave it much thought because I have always viewed foam brushes as throw away/single use items.  A few months ago, it occured to me I might be able to find foam brushes even cheaper on amazon (not sure why I never thought of this before).  I found these foam brushes and ordered 2 boxes.  not only are they cheaper than the brushes sold at the big box stores...they are CRAZY high quality.  The handle is super stout and the foam is probably 2.5x as thick as the ones you buy in the big box stores.  these foam brushes are incredible and they make applying finish much easier than using the cheap, chinsey brushes sold at local big box stores.  i will never use another brand of foam brush again.  Would HIGHLY recommend and will DEFINITELY buy again.",5.0
I only used one thus far for limited application of Target EM6000 water-based lacquer.  Brush maintained integrity with no shedding of little bits of black foam and the foam stayed well adhered to the handle.  Hopefully the foam does not degrade quickly because 24 of these will probably last me many years with cleaning and reuse.,5.0

"Jen foam brushes are the best foam brushes... better than any other brush out there. The foam is dense and sturdy. These brushes hold their shape and don't start crumbling apart hallway through a finishing job. I use them for solvent-based and water-based finishes.

I am a professional carpenter and cabinet maker and Jen brushes are the only foam brushes I'll use. I highly recommend them.",5.0
The foam is very fine and limits the nubmer of bubbles I usually see with store bought brushes. I use it for polyurethane finishes,5.0

"I used to manage a paint store and have seen and used many many brushes. These are the highest quality poly brushes that I have encountered and they are US made to boot.  The cheaper dollar store /walmart  quality ones will start to fall apart and ruin your finish and often have the internal support snap making them useless. Jen brushes will last you through your project and if you wrap it in plastic while one coat dries , they can be used for multiple coats.
If you are looking for poly brushes look no further.

The advantages of a poly brush include:
-low cost / cheap enough for single use
-minimal/no brush stroke marks

The disadvantages are:
-single use
- they don't hold much paint and require frequent dipping when compared to a bristle style brush",5.0
"There were reviewers who commented that they only received a single brush at first, and while Amazon did send the rest after the mistake had been reported, the reviewers were understandably annoyed by the mistake.  I did get all 48 of my brushes, but what's more, the box I received was sealed with a big yellow sticker that said, ""This is a set.  Do not break apart.""  I'm guessing this is Amazon's way of ensuring that the workers who place the items in the boxes don't make that mistake anymore.

As for the brushes themselves, they're great!  I didn't expect them to make much difference, but they hold several times the amount of polyurethane that the natural bristle brush I'd been using held.  It's amazing how much of a difference that made.  The job was much quicker and my back hurt much less when i wasn't constantly having to stop to get more poly on the brush.  I've only used them once so far, and it was for the 3rd coat of poly, so I could be wrong, but it looked like the brush strokes left the same pattern as the regular brush was leaving.

I don't like using things that are disposable, so I didn't love the idea of buying brushes with the intention of throwing them out after a single use, but the process of cleaning a regular brush after you use polyurethane is crazy.  I'm sure I will still use a natural brush for anything that's water soluble, but for polyurethane or anything else that requires the use of harsh chemicals, using a disposable brush is so much easier and, given the fact that those cleaners are so dangerous that they can't be dumped down the drain, the disposable brushes might be better for the environment.  I even thought to put gloves on for the first time.  I couldn't believe my cleanup was so simple.  Take off the gloves, throw away the brush, done!",5.0
"I do a lot of staining and cleaning with these small brushes and they are handy when my grandkids come over, too.",5.0
Great price and quality. There is no better price on the web. Jen foam brushes are the best made foam brushes there are.,5.0
Best price I can find on foam brushes.  Better quality than found in the store.  No problems here.  Dense foam.,5.0
These are great firm durable foam brushes. The bulk per item price can't be beat. I highly recommend Jen poly foam brushes. I have used them for paints and stains.,5.0
"I bought these because I needed a lot for a new painting style I've been working on. I'm super pleased with them. They are strong, wash out really easily and the price is great. I love using these because they don't leave any brush strokes on the canvas for times when you don't want them to show. They are great for little lines and mark making too. I'm so happy I went and ordered the 1"" size as well. My next masterpiece is already almost finished!",5.0
"The foam brush lasted for the entire application on 8 small drawers 2"" x 16"" x 16"" inside and out.  In the past I would have us multiple brushes for this size of a job.",5.0
"There are low quality foam brushes available--these aren't those-good quality. I don't use bristle brushes because cleaning them
is a pain. Buy one or two at the store- .65+ each. Buy these in bulk for half the price. You'll always have use for them
if you own a house.",5.0
These brushes are the best! They're not the soft airy foam that makes bubbles. The foam is very dense. These are without a doubt the best brushes and they're made in the USA!,5.0
"THis was a great price for these foam brushes.  I do lots of woodwork, and use these to apply stain and poly to my projects.  They work great, and buying them in bulk makes them much cheaper, and so more disposable than buying them from the big box stores.  Overall, highly recommend.",5.0
"I heard Wooster discontinued their foam brushes and was reluctant to try other foam brushes based on the terrible quality of alternatives I've purchased at various home improvement outlets. I saw the review on these brushes and figured I'd give it a try. For the price, the brushes have been fabulous. Couldn't ask for more. I had a massive painting project which included 8 colors. I just used a brush for each color and kept them in a ziploc bag until the project was over. This was perfect for quick touch ups with no clean-up process. The bag kept them fresh and wet and the brush was high enough quality that I could use them for an extended period of time. Of course they are not going to be as durable as a high quality bristle brush,but for projects where you don't want brush lines and want to convenience of dedicated brushes on a shoestring budget,you really can't go wrong.",5.0
The Brushes are quality foam brushes and just what I ordered.  The order was on time.  I use foam brushes all the time for stains and urethanes and these perfect for that.,5.0
Very good quality foam brushes at a good bulk purchase price.  I now have enough for a few years .......... Yippee,5.0
"For a disposable brush, these are very sturdy and high quality.  I varnished around 300 rubber stamp handles and the foam was still going strong.  Jen Manufacturing is my new supply source for foam brushes!",5.0
"These are good brushes at a good price. These are not the cheap kind, but the good ones. Try them!",5.0
"I do a lot of painting, staining, and touch up and don't like to spend a lot of time cleaning brushes. I also hate to see brush strokes anywhere so really love the finish a foam brush gives, so for me foam brushes are something I go through pretty regularly. I have bought bulk brushes on Amazon before and had been burned - handles that snapped, heads that came off the plastic mounts, and tons of fuzzy bits coming off the brushes.
These were absolutely fantastic. I could use one of these all day then store it in a plastic sandwich bag for a few days, take it out again, and it would be good to go. If you need foam brushes, buy these.
I needed a wood dowel for some detail sanding and tried to snap off the handle of one of these after I used it for a day or so. Other brushes I had would just break with a minimal amount of pressure. I couldn't get this one to snap at all. Thats a quality product!",5.0
"These are the best built foam brushes I've used or seen.  I've used a variety of brands.  The foam is securely attached to the handle, the foam density excellent, and cut is straight and sharp.  They hold up compared to the others I've used.  Great value.  I also purchased the 3 inch.",5.0
"Arrived quickly, as advertised and a good buy.  These cost, at a local big box, about twice what I got them for here.",5.0
"These brushes were exactly what they were supposed to be. They are working extremely well for my dad and grandpa's woodworking projects. If you need them, these are where you should get them. Good value - good price for the quantity.",5.0
"I'm just finishing a bookcase project.  I started using foam brushes from HD, only to have the heads of three of them snap off while applying the first coat of stain...and I wasn't brushing the surface very hard.  I switched to these brushes and haven't had a single problem since.  These are inexpensive enough to use once and discard, although I generally wash them out and get a couple of uses out of them.

Highly recommended.",5.0
I used these brushes over and over.  Worked great for my craft using paint and mod podge.  Towards the end some of them got a little flaky but I think it's because I used them so much,5.0
The copy cats still don't make a brush as good as this. Bought some cheeper ones but the just keep falling apart made this the cheeoer brush on the long run,5.0
I used this item and they worked great. The brushes are well made and i will advise to get them. I am a home do it your selfer and i approve this message.,5.0
I favor Jen Poly brushes and have been using them for decades.  I have used many other brands and these hold up well and do a much better job.,5.0
"I am an amatuer woodworker, with a fair amount of experience. I have used bristle brushes, foam rollers, and at least 3 different brands/sources for foam brushes. These are the best, and they come at a great price too. I can't argue with a product that saves me time, as I can just throw it away when I am done - Guilt free. I use them to apply stains evenly, as well as sanding sealer, wood conditioner, and oil based polyurethene. Victory on all counts.",5.0
"Getting ready to order more. Two projects one a bunkbed stain job- one brush! Another a floor cabinet-one brush! Very fine grade foam, not like big box store brush that they only sell as one, no longer a pack of ten. So ur spending .79 per brush,that when used most of the time fall off the handle (I hate when that happens!)Order showed up ontime and better than expected product.",5.0
"They're foam brushes, what more is there to say?  Unlike several other reviewers I did get all 48 of mine.  What a great price!",5.0
"I was worried about only getting one brush, as the other reviews have mentioned. I received all 48, and they're really well made and packaged nicely. What else can I say? They're foam brushes, they're made of foam...and they brush stuff. Amazing.",5.0
"Wiss Shears have been in my family for over 60 years. I even got the same model because they are great, solid and dependable. Best tool in my sewing room.",5.0
"When I was young, I probably wouldn't have bought these, thinking they were too expensive.  That would have been a mistake.",5.0
"I was a bit apprehensive when I when I read in a earlier review that this pair of Wiss 20N shears had changed...  Happily I've discovered that my worries were for naught...  Comparing them to my 30 plus+ year old pair, the blade edge is identical in length (4 3/4 inches) - The fulcrum pin is 5 9/16 inches from the blade tip (vs 5 7/16 inches in the old shears) - Overall the shears are 11 1/16 inches long (vs 10 1/2 inches in the older pair)...  The extra room is in the handle/grips and for the first time in 30 plus+ years my fingers are not cramped while cutting 90 feet of heavy 24 ounce woven roving.

Needless to say, I am not disappointed with this new pair.",5.0
"These shears are exactly what their name says. They are sharp and extremely well made heavy duty shears. In the shop I reach for them daily for opening heavy plastic packaging, cutting rolls of heavy brown carpenter's paper, cardboard, and countless other items.",5.0
"I love Wooster brand brushes, the hold paint very well, do not leave streaks and are just the best on the market.",5.0
"Used this brush over a period of a week with two different paint colors.  I cleaned it each night (warm water and brass bristle cleaning brush) that I changed color and the brush was still fine for use the next day.  Tip: If you are using the same paint color for a few days, place the uncleaned brush in a plastic zip lock bag and put it in the fridge.  Allow it to come back to room temperature the next day and the brush will be good to go!",5.0
Another brush i use more often than any other size is this Wooster 2 1/2 in. From cut work to trim work and doors its up to the task.,5.0
"My money maker. Good deal on a great brush. Wooster is my favorite brush, I highly recommend for all pro painters its durable and lasts when properly cleaned after use.",5.0
"This brush is awesome. I just used it to paint 225 feet of crown molding, and it was a joy to work with. The brush loads well, has excellent control, and the wooden handle is comfortable.  I will be using it again and again.",5.0
The best trim brush ever!,5.0
The best brush made at a great price its better then any purdy brush also i plan on ordering more,5.0
"I'm not a professional painter, just a DIY guy.  I've had numerous paint projects around the house but I finally decided to purchase a professional paint brush because I was told by a very seasoned painter that a good brush makes all the difference.  I researched the big three brand names trying to decide which to purchase; Wooster, Purdy, and Corona.  I read numerous reviews for various brushes in all 3 brands, read some blogs regarding painter's favorite brushes, and visited all 3 websites to find out more info.  Everyone seemed to have their own opinion, so I decided on this brush because between the 3 brands, Wooster Ultra Pro Firm was the best deal.  Not to mention I'm an Ohioan and am pleased to support a solid, reputable, Ohio business like Wooster Brush company.  The feel and usage of this brush is very good from a novice's point of view.  I tried my hand at ""cutting in"" a straight line between the wall and the ceiling (without using painter's tape) and it was effortless.  It also cleaned up extremely easily and was like brand new the 2nd time I used it.  We'll see how it wears over an extended period of time.  Overall I would highly recommend this brush - great deal through Amazon, delivered very quickly and in excellent condition.",5.0
"Got 6 of these brushes 15 years ago - great for cutting in edges and corners.

I have used them frequently, for both 0il & Latex paint - clean up easily.",5.0
"A very versatile brush. It has many uses, for wall painting, brush cleaner or for canvas. It produces great strokes and made of good fibers for a simple brush.",5.0
"Excellent brushes, the best. We only paint with Wooster.",5.0
"The brush loads well, has excellent control, and the wooden handle is comfortable. I will be using it again and again. This is an excellent all-around brush for most paint jobs. Works great at cutting in and equally well for trim work.",5.0

If you want a good paint job used only the best.,5.0
One of the best paint brushes I have used.,5.0
"This is an excellent all-around brush for most paint jobs. Works great at cutting in and equally well for trim work. I've repainted all my house's interior trim with this brush, and the lines it makes are very small and unnoticeable. This brush glides very well. The bristles are excellent. This is a professional brush that should last quite a long time with regular cleaning and care.

Fairly easy to clean and it seems to retain it's shape very well through many many cleanings.

Wooster makes good stuff, so I can't say I'm surprised.",5.0
Best brushes. Works perfect and bristles keep intact,5.0

"I used this to remove a glob of paint on a good winter stadium coat.  I did not use the whole amount, only diluted some in warm water and soaked the spot on the coat for the day.  Rubbed a little bit with my fingers and watched the water turn white with the paint as it came off.  Very happy with the result and hope to only use it on brushes from this point forward.",5.0

"This awl is perfect for several things. works great, is sturdy, and is small enough to pack around. I love it.",5.0
"This is a great hand tool, made just like they were years ago.  It's a simple tool that you can't do without and this design fits the hand and does the job perfectly.  Stanley makes a quality product at a reasonable price.",5.0
I have used one of these since Jr. High shop class 30 years ago.  It is a great tool to use for setting the center of a drill or screw hole on wood.  Just place the point on your mark and whack it with the heel of your hand.  That little dimple will keep your drill on mark or break enough fiber to  give your screw a grip.  It is a basic hand tool that should be in every  woodworkers war chest.,5.0

"I'm not sure what constitutes ""heavy duty"" these days but this is one of the weakest products I've ever used.  2 hours after holding it in place I still can't get a solid deal, waste of time and money.",1.0
The velcro part holds really good. Unfortunately the peal and stick adhesive does not.,1.0
The adheisive does not stick very well. Not sure why. Had to use super glue when using it on the underside of my floormats,1.0
It is not as strong as advertised. I attempted to use it to hold up a light weight shelf and it always unsticks little by little till it falls. Not industrial strength. Look elsewhere,1.0
Not industrial strength. Like other posts the adhesive is trash and the Velcro is not that strong.,1.0
No good,1.0
Missing the other side of the Velcro? Weird.,1.0
"Though this Velcro claims to be industrial strength, I used two long strips on each of my cabinets to keep my cat out of them. One time of coming apart meant they would never stick together again. Pretty disappointed.",1.0
Did not work as advertised...Industrial Strength???..not even close.,1.0
Velcro is super strong but the adhesive on the backside doesn't hold-came off the first day.,1.0
"Had this between my jeep door and top to keep top secure. The sticky stuff melted and became useless. The Velcro may be industrial, but the glue sure is not. That's the weak link. I had to add my own glue.",1.0
OK so the Velcro itself might hold up weel but I wouldnt be able to tell because the glue doesn't hold at all. I have sticked the velcro on each side and pressed it down for a while. I also left it alone a few days so it had enough time to stick without pulling weight on it. However once I but both Velcro end together it last a day before I found it on the ground again.  Not impressed at all.,1.0
"This velcro is not worth the one star I gave it! You go through all the trouble cutting,and putting on. Then you pull it apart,and the sticky part pulls off. I used this three times with same bad results. I do have to admit the velcro it self works. I wouldn't recommend  this stuff to my enemy.",1.0
Don't but it I bought over 2 weeks ago and it's still hast arrived! It's scam! Please don't waste your money people!!,1.0

"It seems like this should be awesome stuff, but the adhesive is either old or just insufficient for the term ""Industrial Strength."" I bought this for very lightweight use and it just won't cut the mustard, despite such a light task. I'd look for another product for this...there's got to be something better out there.",1.0
"The tape will peel off if you use it were it is warm or in the sun light.  Furthermore, the adhesive left a sticky mess when it fell off.",1.0
"I purchased this because i have concrete walls and cant use nails to hang lighter things. Excited, i put up all the things i needed on the walls....never anything heavy or with any weight at all. Now everything has come crashing to the floor and is broken. Buy at your own risk.",1.0
"I bought this because I did not want to make holes in my apartment wall for my pictures, but it took the paint off the walls. Plus I used to hang a clock and the velcro did not hold and fell down and my clock broke. I should have just used a nail. Regret buying this.",1.0

"Arrived bent in multiple spots, crinkling the entire roll. ",1.0
The roll is crinkle on one end and didn't straighten  out.  The color is more a pea green than lime.  Will not be ordering from this company again.,1.0
I am so disappointed in this product. The roll arrived in a tall skinny beat up looking box and when i opened it the paper was already torn along the edges. It also had no type of seal to keep the paper from unraveling so when i took it out of the box it all came undone >:[ I was definitely not happy having to spend the next 10+ minutes trying to roll it back up (as best as I could).,1.0
This paper is thin and only one sided so I can't use it. It is white on the back side.  This should be clearly stated in the description.  I bought green which is more like neon green.  No way is this 50 lb paper as the seller stated in the Q&A.  It is almost half as thick as regular 20lb printer paper.  Disappointing.,1.0
"Unfortunately, I chose to ignore other people's reviews that it arrived damaged. I figured that the odds were small that mine would also arrive damaged. It did arrive damaged. The box was bent in the middle, and the paper was certainly impacted. If I would have used it on my bulletin boards, there would have been a sizeable line and wrinkles throughout. The color was beautiful, however. I wish it would have arrived undamaged.",1.0
Good quality paper. I needed this for back to school night . It came in 2 boxes. However who ever placed the role in the first box bended it in two parts . When extended it creates a wrinkle. I had no choice but to put it up and covered the wrinkles. Not satisfied at all . Tough to be a teacher trying to do all you can to create a nice environment.,1.0
It's not teal rather a brighter blue . Not what I was looking for but last min ordering leaves me with no choice but to use it. Bummer,1.0
"The item came and was in a great color, and I would have loved it. However, I was sent a damaged item.  The box the package was sent in was fine, but the box the roll came in was obviously bent, ruining my roll of paper.  Very disappointed.",1.0
This arrived today and looks used!  The roll was not covered in plastic and the beginning of the roll has tears in it. The box it was shipped in is undamaged so this did not happen during shipping. Very disapponred.,1.0
"I ordered a white roll of paper to be used for a really special project with MY daughter for her birthday. When I opened the box and took out the paper on her bday it was some kind of ""under the sea"" themed wrapping paper. Useless.

"I'm not sure who's fault it was, but this package arrived looking like someone had kicked it as hard as they could. The box was bent in half with a giant hole in the middle. The roll of paper was bent as well, leaving permanent creases down the center of the whole roll of paper, leaving this product useless for what I had bought it for.",1.0

"Don't trust the other reviews, this is straight-up copy paper on a massive roll. I was hoping for more thickness, but in all honestly, this is a little thinner than copy paper. If that's what you need, great.",1.0
It says for crafting and projects. Didn't work for what I wanted to do. Only one side of the paper is purple. If I wanted white paper I would have bought white paper!,1.0
"I got the wrong color. I was using the green paper for our banquet decorations. Didn't open the box until I was ready to start decorating... not green, but RED, our rival's team color. I am so upset.",1.0
If you want/need true black this is NOT your paper. Its more like grayish black. I needed it for a Black Light bday party tomorrow...now I have to figure out something else...not happy...going back!,1.0
BE AWARE:  Paper is green on one side and white on the other. No where in the product description does it specify that. The project we were working on needed both sides green.,1.0
Waste of money. Paper thin totally not what was needed or described. It's not even being used.,1.0
I ordered black and got blue. Very disappointing,1.0
"Very fragile, thin paper. They really should state the Weight in the product details. I guess they don't want you to know.  Color does not saturate (ie is white on one side).",1.0

"Came bent in half, with several large holes in the paper. I used the part without the holes on a narrow board and it worked fine, but a lot of the paper went to waste.",1.0
This item was listed as prime and took 6 days to arrive. When it arrived the outside of the box labeled indicated that it was BK but when I opened it the paper was white on both sides. Do to the late arrival I had to make do and could not wait for a replacement. Very disappointing.,1.0

The teal is not as pictured. it's much more green than in the picture.,1.0
This package arrived and is not even close to the color that is advertised. The actual color of the paper is more like a green grass color which isn't what we needed.,1.0
"I ordered royal blue. The sealed box that arrived said royal blue. The paper inside was black. I arranged replacement.

The replacement had the same issue. I'm really disappointed.",1.0
I purchased this paper for my classroom.  Now I am being forced to take it all down because it is not listed as flame retardant.  How is this paper for classrooms if the fire marshal will not allow it in my classroom?  I can't imagine rules are very different district to district.  If something is listed for classrooms in the descriptions I think it should abide by these rules so that teachers aren't forced to take down all of their hard work.,1.0
"I purchased this paper for a project that my children were working on.  I read other reviews and did not expect this paper to be ultra high quality.  I just needed a large roll of paper.  When I opened the box, I found that the entire roll had a bend it in-right in the center of the roll.  I was able to use the paper but the project on which my children were working had terrible wrinkles down the middle.  I did not have super-high expectations of this paper but I also expected that it would not come wrinkled.  As a side note, I contacted the manufacturer about the condition of the paper roll and they did not even respond.  Avoid this paper.",1.0

"This kraft paper started out a lovely shade of blue, but it faded rapidly after it was used to cover a large bulletin board (indoors, not in direct sun, in a hallway with flourescent light fixtures). Items that were posted on the newly-covered board left dark (unfaded) spots when removed 2 weeks later. It looks sloppy now. I would not buy this paper again.",1.0
This is not lime green. It is more neon with a yellow undertone. Abrasive. I took it down.,1.0
"I should have read the reviews on all of the colors, not just one. The color is an emerald green, not the green in the photo. The paper is not quite as thin as tissue paper, but not thick enough for most projects. VERY disappointed.
Took a photo of the color I expected vs the actual color. Delivery was so difficult I'm just eating this one.",1.0
I purchased this paper to use as a back drop for my crafts...but the paper is quite thin...and it wrinkles easy...I was disappointed...so I would not recommend.,1.0
"My son needed this to cover a wall for a school project. Luckily I ordered it well ahead of time, but we pulled it out today and it was not even close to 200 feet long. I measured it at 139 inches. Even though the roll itself also said it was 200 feet long, I think I might have been sent the wrong type because I ordered the same brand in red and black and those came in huge boxes and are very thick. I just figured the blue was made of a cheaper paper, but it was just not even close to the correct size. Now I can only hope and pray I can find the correct size and have it sent quickly.",1.0
I bought it so that I could paint on it but it was just as thin as the paper that I already had.  I will use it eventually.,1.0
This is very thin fragile paper.  It tears and creases easily.  The description said it heavy weight paper?  I purchased it for background for mounting photos.  It just doesn't stay flat.  I would not recommend this paper.,1.0
"Boo! I bought this for my niece for Christmas because she wanted a roll of painting paper. I saw that there were some reviews saying it was thin and not duo sided and some that said it was, hoping for the best I ordered it anyway. Unfortunately the negative reviews were correct; it is not at ALL as described.  This is DRAWING paper and will bleed terribly with painting. There are no duo sides like mentioned and it's definitely not a heavy weight type. I really needed PAINTING paper but if you need it for crayons or pencils or something then it will work for you but certainly not a single type of paint like it lists. Poorly described and my first negative amazon experience, very disappointing.",1.0
The main description of this item is a picture of 10 different colored rolls and a weight of 50 lbs. The only color that arrived was a black roll that weighs like 4 lbs. When calling Amazon she informed me that I was wrong and would be issued a refund. Please be aware that you are paying $20+ for just a roll of black paper.,1.0

"These guys must have laughed hysterically when they decided to call this paper Heavyweight... or even White for that matter, and just for fun, made up the word Duo-Finish.

First off, the paper itself was wavy and completely uneven, almost like it had been exposed to moisture or humidity. It was not smooth at all, is an icky, off white color, and both sides were equally crappy. It's as thin as cut-rate copy machine paper. Unlike the photo, it does not come on any kind of core, and the center is wound so tight you can't slide it onto any kind of rod to use as 'roll' paper unless you spend a half hour to hand loosen it. Even if you bother, it will end up sagging on whatever hanger rod you put it on instead of sit in a clean roll, making it very awkward to use.

You can completely forget trying to use it as cheapo photography background paper, and is so crappy looking, will show in anything but the most blurred backgrounds. I can't imagine it's much good for anything EXCEPT letting a child scribble with crayons on it. It's basically going to end up as wadding for shipping/package filler.

Seriously, pass this junk right on by and purchase a decent brand...

It's pathetic.

When color building, the lightest single stroke and your layered stroke five times over itself with the same color are literally identical.

I've trusted Prismacolor as a company with my finest art supplies for over ten years now. And now that I need to re-order colored pencils as well, it devastates me to know that I'm going to have to seek an alternative. In the meantime, I have a set of markers that I can't do anything with, and a lot of disappointment.

The markers were not that great honestly. About the only one reliable to use is the yellow. Like in the picture on the box it works great when used to add color to a pen drawing. The problem is that the rest of the colors are not like advertised. They are much darker than the images of the colors provided. The color is deep darker almost merging and making the pen lines unnoticable. It is more like using regular crayola markers. Only a few colors if at all can work like they are show as a example on the front of the box. If you are wanting something that works with pen drawings than these are not it.,1.0

So I branched out and got these double-ended ones. I did NOT like them at all.

For clarification, I am NOT an artist - this review is solely based on my use of them for Adult Coloring Books. Specifically, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Garden-An-Inky-Treasure-Hunt-and-Coloring-Book/dp/1780671067/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book</a>.

BUT, I do NOT like the Double Tipped Markers. I DID like that these markers come in TONS of colors. I even went and bought some that were the single markers just to get some extra colors - like the light blue in the photo. Unfortunately, they don't write/draw/color at all like the 'brush tips;' which are awesome. These are firm and clumsy for fine detail coloring. Additionally, I didn't like the thickness of these in my hand - they're really wide.

Most importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad. I hope this review is helpful to others considering these markers for the same purpose. Now, if you're an artist or designer, you may have a completely different experience. I found these inferior to the single-ended brush tip markers by Prismacolor... (Those are shown in the last two photos)",1.0

"My wife is really big into art so I bought these for her as a present well in advance. When they arrived I hid them away until I gave them to her. When I eventually gave them to her and she started to use them. She was very disappointed, because about 7 of the markers were all dried up and would not work. Let alone almost every marker seemed dryer then normal and would not draw correctly.

Unfortunately because I am well past the 30 day return period, that is not longer an option. So now I am stuck with a crappy gift that nearly a 30% of the markers DON'T work at all, and the other 70% were of very poor quality!!!! So now I have a $70 piece of junk. . .

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND not buying these, purchase them from an art store so you are guaranteed that they are more fresh! But if you do buy them from Amazon, then make sure that when you get the package, that every marker works! Otherwise you will be suckered out of money like me!",1.0

$71.00 for 24 wrong markers? I was anticipating much better and a description match. But like usual, it isn't worth the trouble or expense to return. I'm not a happy customer. I would appreciate seller making this right. At their trouble and expense.",1.0

"I purchased these markers for my two teenage sons who are into drawing and cartooning. I thought the double tip would be especially useful. We tried using them right away this weekend and found that some worked and some didn't -- like they were already running out of ink. I tried to use them myself and couldn't get them all to work either, maybe 50/50, regardless whether I used the thick or thin end. So I take one and shake it, thinking maybe I just needed to get ink down to the tip. Oh, that got ink down to the tip all right -- and splattered all over my white kitchen table, all over my kitchen cabinets, and all over my natural linoleum flooring. And now for the fun part -- even bleach wouldn't get it out!! I've been scrubbing all day today using various combinations of cleaners in an attempt to get the bright pink ink off all the surfaces without damaging them. Online trying to return these now. I don't understand how the tip could still be in place and how ink could have splattered everywhere. I have never used markers this awful.",1.0
"The Prismacolor markers I have purchased before always have a fine tip on one end and a brush-tip on the other end.  The markers I purchased through Amazon have a fine tip, but the other end is a stiff, calligraphy-type marker.  I can hardly even use these things.  Not happy.

"I bought this product, the Prismacolor Premier Double Ended Art Markers 24 Count, based on my experience using the Prismacolor Brush Tip Marker set. The Brush Tip set is a good product, but I needed a set with a wider color range. I took a chance despite some negative reviews about the 24 marker set being dry or not lasting very long. I usually use Sharpies so I took a chance ordering these hoping mine would be OK. When the set arrived my grand daughter happened to be here. She asked for a set, but I wanted to try them out first before buying her a set. I was very disappointed that the set I received had the same problems stated in the reviews. Obviously I am not going to buy that set for her now. I also looked for a larger set of Prismacolor Brush Markers, but I couldn't find one on Amazon.",1.0

"I bought my kids (4,2) two sets of these for Easter to replace the old ones that were getting dry. The black barrel is ridiculous. You cannot match the lid with the pen. With the old markers, my kids were so proud of themselves when they matched the lid to the marker. We used it as a tool to learn colors and learn the concept of matching. Now, I cannot tell what lid goes with what marker unless I draw with it first. When we are in a hurry, we now grab any old lid and put it on the marker. Then the kids get frustrated the next time they want blue and end up drawing with purple instead. As soon as I can find a replacement, these are going in the trash.",1.0
"First of all don't let the picture of the box with the white barrel fool you, I've ordered/returned twice and it's been the black barrel both times.

There are chunks missing from the corners where bits of eraser have torn off. Its texture is gummy and feels weird in my hand. While the old one erases smoothly and cleanly, the new one snags on the paper and doesn't get the graphite up nearly as well.

What happened, PaperMate? Why did you change the Pink Pearl? If the old version wasn't viable anymore, I still think Papermate's R&D could have spent a little more time and effort to design something that was just as good.",1.0

They are however very sharp. Wish the design was better, I have the smaller ones that are angled normally and they are fine scissors!",1.0
I bought 2 pair one for use upstairs and the other for downstairs. The upstairs pair is used more frequently. I loved these when they arrived but after using a short time the Spring in the pair I use more often doesnt spring open. Too late to return. Im hoping the other pair lasts longer.,1.0
"I hate these scissors. The idea of course is great. However, mine are impossible to cut with! I've had them for a year now, and they've been terrible since day one.  (I didn't know at the time what the problem was; I thought it was misshaped/bent blades.)
 I get to a certain point in the cut, and the scissors get stuck. The screw keeps coming loose, no matter how tight I make it.  If I make it super tight, then the scissors barely spring back open.  After 5 or so squeezes, it's coming loose again, and soon it's loose enough that the scissors again cannot cut.  Also a design flaw--in my opinion--is the lock feature. Maybe mine again is a dud in this situation, but the button often slips into the lock position while I'm cutting, and the scissors of course then cannot cut.

I'm also not fond of the large size.  If I cut out a few patters, my hand gets sore using these, because they open so wide.  I have big hands, I'm 30, and I don't have any kind of arthritis or anything. I have since purchased a pair of comfort grip scissors from the dollar store; they're much better than these.

I was going to buy my mother a pair of these after I tried them for a while. She's 70 and had carpal tunnel in both wrists, so there's no way I'd ever recommend these scissors to her!",1.0

"I am terribly disappointed in this pair of scissors. I've used similar pairs and have been very satisfied, hence why I wanted a pair of my own. As an elementary teacher, I cut a LOT of miscelaneous papers and lamination, so I was hoping this would help prevent hand pain associated with that. After less than five minutes of very light use (only on construction paper) the spring stopped working and the scissors will not spring open any more. Even when the lock is completely disengaged, I have to manually open them every single time to make a cut. It completely defeats the purpose of this product and makes them completely useless since I have to manually open them each time without a finger hole to do it one-handed. I will be seeking out a refund for this and would suggest for others to look at other fiskar types (just not this particular style)",1.0

"These were bought for me as I make a lot greeting cards and paper crafts. My family thought they would be easier for me since I have a badly arthritic thumb and wrist on my dominate hand.
After the first hour of having to lean against the table and use my other hand to push the scissor closed the pain the plastic handle fell off of the handle! It just broke. More cheap crap from China. My hand was hurting more than before.

I called Fiskars about the broken plastic and was told they shouldn't have done that. No kidding?

I gave the replacement piece and the scissors to my son who is the only one strong enough to shut those scissors!

"I would have given it no stars but that wasn't an option. I wish I had known these paint pens contained xylene before I purchased them. Xylene is a toxic, hazardous chemical. Besides that, the paint runs and these cannot be used for the art I purchased them for. Disappointed, will be looking to return them.",1.0
"These pens are so bad.  I do a lot of projects with paint pens, and I thought I would give them a try, based on the good reviews.  The Sharpie pens I bought are so far superior to these that it's not even funny.  The Sharpies cost a little bit more (if I recall correctly), but they could be 10xs the price and still be worth it.  Don't buy these.  They are a waste of your money!  They are exhausted almost immediately.",1.0
These pens are terrible.  Either there is not enough paint in the tip or you push the tip for more paint and you get a pool of paint on your surface.  We use them for writing signs in our store.  I'll go back to the other brand I have used.,1.0

"On the strength of other positive reviews and attractive price, I bought a set of these markers.  Big mistake.  For the record, I've been using paint markers for 30+ years, so I'm no newbie to using them.  My experience with these is as follows:  The first marker that I used worked fine--the first time.  The second time I went to use it and tried to take the cap off, the entire top of the marker came off, not just the cap, and spewed paint all over.  Fortunately, I was working  in old clothes.  So much for that one.  The next two markers that I used both spewed paint all over the first time that I took the cap off, one leaking probably half its contents onto the tool box that I was marking in a couple of seconds.  Another mess, and two more markers chucked into the trash.  Finally, the fourth marker actually worked, but, even after vigorous shaking, the paint tends to be very thin and runs easily.  So, I'm unimpressed.  The $6 apiece paint markers that I've used for years now look like a bargain compared to these.  One of those cases where you get what you pay for.",1.0

I am so disappointed  in this product as a left handed person. My older left handed Fiskars put this new scissor to shame.  It does not cut.  Its like the blades are installed backwards.  I actually have to use it upside down to cut things.,1.0
"i absolutely hate these scissors!  I have had several pairs of Fiskars left-handed scissors, all of which were terrific.  These have the blades the opposite of earlier ones.(the top blade goes to the right rather than to the left). The only way to cut a straight line is to turn them over as if they were right-handed. I had to replace an older pair because one of the handles partially broke, but these work better than the current ones.  A real waste of money.",1.0
"They broke after several uses. If that is what left handed scissors do, than I'm going back to using right handed ones.",1.0
"These are absolutely NOT left handed scissors, regardless of what the packaging says. The curve on the thumb is for right hand use.",1.0
These are NOT left handed scissors. They are standard right. False advertising,1.0
"I have a pair of these and NO- these are NOT true left-handed scissors. I'm vary particular about scissors and used Fiskars over 30+ years in my work and these are right-handed with molded left-handed handles. I have used Fiskars for my whole career until they made this change to use right-handed scissors with left-molded handles. The way to check is which direction the scrap goes. On true left-handed scissors the scrap goes under your left hand on the hand side of this image but these blades the scrap goes up and runs into your thumb. You cannot use these for sliding through materials when you are stripping. True lefty scissors like Fiskars used to make, the blades are reversed to the image and the top blade is on the other side to this Fiskars image. If you apply pressure the normal way with your hand the the blades separate and so they are wholly useless if you are left-handed and need heavy duty stripping or snipping. It's a shame these used to be the absolute best to became the worst scissors for left-handed users. I keep my only pair of these in my kitchen and barely use them for snipping packaging and not cutting or stripping and they mangle and fold over most of what you cut. If there was a easy way to do it on Amazon I would give them away. If you use scissors extensively then get true lefties which are available elsewhere on Amazon.",1.0
BEWARE! They are JUNK! Used them maybe 20 times to cut normal paper.  I believe they are inferior quality or rejects. The usual made in China junk. Very disappointed.,1.0
"Wish there was less than one star to rate this, another time I should have heeded the bad reviews on this product.  Just threw this useless thing in the trash. So inferior in quality to Fiskars scissors I still use purchased years ago.",1.0
"The scissors I received have 2 inch blades and they are about 5 inches long in total with the handles.  The package they came in describes them as 8 inch scissors but they are definitely not that long.  Also, the plastic looks cheap and the scissors are flimsy. I hope they sent the wrong item by mistake. I wouldn't pay $1 for the scissors I received.  I'm returning them.",1.0
Worst pair of scissors. Buy right handed over these. cutting with precision is part of my job and these barely cut a straight line let alone a curved one!,1.0
It is too big to my liking and the grip was very sharp and painful but it is cutting good.,1.0
"Left-handed, really?  I can't cut anything with these.",1.0
"I have owned these scissors for a weeks and used them the other day for an extended period of time (only 15 minutes, mind you) and am sadly disappointed.  I found them uncomfortable, even painful to use.  They have such a drastic slope that you must hold them in a certain way to make them feel comfortable in your hand, which hurt my wrist.  They do have very sharp blades, but I have used right-handed scissors that were much more comfortable than these.",1.0
"Not sure why my experience differs so much from the glowing reviews on here, but these are poor quality for a couple of reasons. First, they do not fit comfortably in the left hand (or the right hand, oddly). Second, the blades are right-handed blades, and therefore don't cut where expected. Not good for anything remotely precise.",1.0
"Fiskars used to have a great thing going. they made the BEST left handed scissors around. now they're putting lefty handles on righty blades and you can't see what you're cutting! my old pair was amazing but i needed to retire them to 'paper only' and get a new pair for cloth. once i got these horrible things it took mere moments to figure out what was going on. for shame, Fiskars! don't ruin a great pair of shears!

any lefties out there who need something else, try these, they're for either hand and sharp as all get out!: http://www.amazon.com/Fiskars-Inch-Titanium-Action-Scissors/dp/B000XAPLKQ",1.0
"Yes, I agree with you. I have old Left hand Fiskars and the blade is the opposite. Also Amazon picture is lie because 1-picture tell Fiskars Finland but when I get this item there is no Finland. There is made in China, my old one is made in Finland, the amazon item picture is not right!
2-Picture show metal pin between too blade but item I got is prastic pin.  I though same one with mine because the picture is same one I have but that not truth.",1.0
These are not left-handed scissors.  They are right bladed scissors with handles that fit the left hand.  Fiskars should apologize to all purchasers and offer to buy them back.,1.0
"These scissors are very inexpensive because they are very cheap. They rusted sitting in my office drawer! Don't reward Fiskars for making junk - find a decent pair of stainless steel scissors. These are truly awful quality, and could give you or your child tetanus.",1.0
"I have used Fiskars lefties for years and thought it was time to buy a new pair for a wedding dress project! I am so disappointed. They are not even as sharp as my old Fiskars! They look like a cheap copy made in China. It doesn't say Finland on the blade like in the picture. And they have the blades reversed as compared to the old lefties. So after 30 years of cutting with my eyes to the left of the blades, I would now have to watch the other side. I went back to my old ones quickly!!!",1.0
Wow I cant even open and close the scissors with out struggle. Its more of a pain to use then its worth.,1.0
"I have an old pair of Fiskar's lefties that lasted for years and thought these would be the same.  They aren't. They don't cut correctly and the sharp curve on the handles cuts into my hands. Maybe the higher end Fiskars are what I had before, but these are worthless. My right handed ones work better.",1.0
Look at the photo closely. The blades overlap like a standard right-handed pair (top blade on right when looking at the handle). Then look at the actual left-handed ones on Amazon or anywhere else. The top blade is on the Left. These are just ordinary right handed scissors with a modified handle. When I went to return them the invoice even SAYS right handed!,1.0
"Do not buy these scissors unless you just want them for cutting things open that do not have to be precise, like hard to get into packaging.  The only thing left handed about these scissors is the handle.  The blades are the same as right handed scissors.  So if you try and cut on a line, you can't see the line, the blade is in the way.  You end up cutting about 1/8 of an inch away from the line.  I am an artist and they are useless for me as I need to be exact.  I have 2 old Fiskar left handed scissors and they are true lefty scissors. I compared them to these new ones and saw the problem about the position of the blades.  Unfortunately, they are dull so my only option is try and get them sharpened or try one of the other brands.  I called Fiskars and they told me they are aware of the problem with these scissors but these are the only ones they make now.  In fact, the guy at customer service, told me he gets complaints all day long about them.  I can't figure out these good reviews on Amazon unless they are by people who just want to cut things open and aren't trying to cut on a line.",1.0
"Straight out of the package, these scissors can't even cut through an inch-wide strip of cotton fabric. It will cut the first few millimeters, then just ""bite"" the rest so your fabric twists but nothing is cut. Forget trying to cut out two layers at once. They're comfortable enough to use, but there's no point--they're absolutely useless for sewing.",1.0
"Everyone has seen a million pairs of these laying around, broken, dull, or dull and broken.  Never have I used an orange handled scissors and had it actually cut something decently.  Why on earth would someone want to buy such junk lol?  Matter of fact all of Fiskars products are complete garbage.  From the pruning shears to the scissors, cheap plastic junk.",1.0
"Who are these scissors made for--a grade schooler?  I don't have big hands, but they are so small that it's painful to use them.  I am really, really sorry I bought these Fiskars (I had always heard that this was the brand to buy!)  My Amazon days are over.  I really need to see things before I buy them.  My hand still hurts from cutting some cotton fabric.  I also bought some ""erasable"" pens which weren't erasable at all.  The puzzle book I ordered has print so small I have to use a magnifying glass.  SO disappointed in my whole order!",1.0
Not like the Fiskars of old. If you buy them you will be disappointed. My Fiskars that are 20 years old are way better than these. They just don't make things like they used to. Sometimes that's good and sometimes that's bad. This time it's bad,1.0
"After a month or so of owning a pair of these, one of the blades broke at the pivot while cutting open some plastic packaging. The dog-chewed-up-the-handle pair that my parents have had for what seems like decades would have had no problem.

These are not the scissors I was looking for. Perhaps I got a knock-off pair? I don't know, but I am disappointed.",1.0

"I bought this unit almost a year ago to do some home deorating.  Throw pillows - vallences, etc.  I had not gotten around to it till now.
The one think I noticed is that the power plug had to be rotated to actually power the unit.  So there may be something wrong with that design.  But my biggest problem is when I bought it I took out the instructions to read.  I lost those instructions.  And now have having a very hard time with it.
I cant get the unit to sew with out having the thread bunch up in the underside of the fabric, and then clog.
I was hoping to find a user manual on line - but there does not seam to be one.  That would be a great help for most of us out there who for one reason or another, don't have it any longer.

"Never before has this saying been so true to me than when I purchased this sewing machine. It's aweful...it bounces all over the place and makes it nearly impossible to sew a straight line. I'm a beginner and let me tell you...it's NOT for beginners! I was able to sew one thing, a pillow and after that I have not been able to get the darn thig to make stiches since!

Then, I call the customer service number on the manual (they don't have a web site. can you believe it!). They told me no one else carry their parts because they are the manufacturer, and they don't have the spool pin becuase this machine is so small. I tried to give feedback and they hang up on me.

"Alright, I must admit I'm cheap. I had a gift certificate and could have a bought a REAL sewing machine. But istead I was lurred in by this cheap alternative. It arrived and I thought hmm... this can't be it the box is so small. But hey, don't judge by size correct? How about weight, I always remembered my grandmother's huge sewing machine and how heavy it was, and this arrived and weighed less than an average paperback book. Color, yes very cute looking, lots of colorful strings and such but the fact of the matter is it's a TOY!!

I made some little bags out of very thin cotton to try it out. They seemed to turn out alright, but even after adjusting the tension the stitches wouldn't hold. But I wasn't really upset until I went to fix a 1 cm strap on a dress I've been wanting to repair. It was made out of a thin rayon and it jammed. Then it jammed again. Six tries later it was all I could do not to throw it out the window. 1 cm!

So folks, take my advice: don't be cheap, spend the extra $50 and buy a real machine. I really wish I had gone with the Singer that was refurbished for only $80.

Good luck!",1.0

"I have had one of these for a year and a half - or so. I am getting ready to return it for repair for the second time. The first time it just stopped all motion and electrical activity. It was still under warranty; they sent me a completely new one. This time it is badly bunching thread on the back of the fabric - was working fine then suddenly started doing this. I have to pay this time to have it repaired.
 You have to be very careful with the way you use this machine. There are many things you cannot do with this machine (no reverse, cannot manually reverse a stitch, cannot adjust the stitch length or pull on the fabric to do so.) The instructions for correct use must be followed to avoid damaging the machine and to have it operate properly. I know how to sew well with machines, but only do so for repairs or alterations, so I'm not abusing this thing. I could put up with all of the care required to use this machine to have an inexpensive one for straight-stitch repairs while in my temporary situation (my regular machine is packed up). But I am getting sick of calling their tech support, trouble-shooting all the things I am doing correctly anyway, and being told to ship the machine back for repairs (I have to pay this time for repairs plus shipping) and having to stop sewing for another 2 months while it is fixed.
 If you want to enjoy sewing, especially if you are just getting into it, look elsewhere for a machine and save yourself a headache.",1.0
"I have two scouts in the family and I don't sew.  I thought that buying this inexpensive ""sewing center"" would save me a few dollars or finger pricks by letting me easily sew on my children's patches.
I was dead wrong.  I think the model I got is missing a piece because the thread bunches up from the bobbin underneath and the machine freezes up after less than an inch of sewing.  I have followed directions in threading the machine, but when I look at the photo of the bobbin case there seems to be a bit of metal that my machine does not have.

UPDATE:  I looked this yarn up on the yarnspirations web site and found the example photo to not contain any blue.  from now on, before I order yarn, I'm double checking the color example's provided on amazon.  I know it hardly seems fair to rate the actual product by a photo description mistake, but the rating is a reflection of my disappointment in what I received compared to what I thought I was ordering.  if I had been able to see the correct product color photo, I wouldn't have ordered it.  for anyone ordering the ""rainbow"" yarn from amazon, just know there is no blue in it ... the photo is wrong.  it's just lilac, pink, yellow, and bright green (absolutely no blue!).

I double checked the color photo of the ""pretty pastels"" with the yarnspirations site and it is the same, so I went ahead and ordered the pretty pastels.  in a ""rainbow"" i expect a little green. lol  but I'm pretty sure i'll also get the blue, this time, too.",1.0

"I purchased these pencils after an extensive search for a former ""Spectracolor Design"" colored pencil now no longer produced by Faber Castell.  Finding an artist-grade pencil in a well-blended crimson color was a requirement for an alternative colored pencil for my search.  I purchased a box of twelve.

Upon the shipment's arrival, I promptly began preparing the pencils using a high-quality artist's pencil sharpener.  Time after time and to my frustration, I found the pencil lead would only disintegrate in the sharpener, making it impossible to produce a proper 'point' to the pencil lead.  I tried a number of other sharpeners, only to have the same effect.

Clearly, the leads of this brand (or batch) of pencil are defective in either manufacture or design.  A pencil without a point isn't worth much - whatever the intended use.

STRONGLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS PRODUCT.",1.0

"Seller packaged this item well for shipping, but the spring roll wrappers are terrible!

This is not the first time I have used rice paper spring roll wrappers, but it is my first (and last) time using this brand!

A few wrappers were damaged.  I expected that, and discarded them.  Many had holes in them.  I wasn't pleased about that.  I searched through the package, and found perfect ones, placed them in a pan of water, and watched two inch long cracks appear in them.  ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!  I threw away the first 7-8 that formed these giant cracks in the water - and eventually just gave up and put two wrappers in the water at a time (rotating one by 90 degrees - so the cracks were in different directions).

Please understand - they are not splitting because I was rough with them; or because I used something sharp to pick them up; or because I overstuffed them... they are splitting in the warm water.  The wrapper appears fine when it goes in, and as it softens, multiple large cracks (1/2"" to over 2"" long) split the wrapper.  Maybe the machine that pressed the pattern into them wasn't calibrated properly?  Don't know...

Sure - you can use them... but you have to use two at a time.  It is like making a sandwich and having to use 4 pieces of bread to hold it together.  Ridiculous!",1.0

THESE ARE THE WORST foam brushes I have EVER USED.  The dollar store foam brushes at least work for one use.  the only support is the plastic tip.  you can't use the foam bursh in any functional capacity.  VERY DISAPPOINTED !,1.0

"I always try give positive reviews for products, being an entrepreneur and business owner myself I know how important they can be, but man....did these guys miss the mark on QUALITY with this product!!!  The company itself, as far as delivery of product, packaging, and processing, was good, but again, the product is absolutely TERRIBLE which is why I'm giving such a low rating. :/  I would suggest saving your money and purchasing a better quality product that will actually be worth your money instead of falling apart as soon as you begin to use it and feeling like you just threw your money away in the trash.

Let me share a quick example & some specific details of the product ""in use"" so you as a consumer, customer and user can get the full concept of what I've experienced working with these particular foam brushes so you can determine for yourself if it's worth it for you to purchase them. I am an artist entrepreneur and as one of my main businesses I make wood wall art. (which is why I purchased these foam brushes) I had been buying my foam brushes from Home Depot in the small variety sized packages which worked GREAT, but in order to save on cost, time and increase overall margins & revenue, I decide to purchase these foam brushes.  (Every dollar counts when it comes to the bottom line in your business!) Here they have a LOT more pieces in one package (50) for much less expense than the HD versions. (HD sells a 9 piece set, variety sizes same as here, for $5.97 a pack vs. this 50 piece variety pack for only $13.00, needless to say this is a no brainer on cost savings overall.) Or so I thought!

HOWEVER.....if you're not able to use these because they literally start falling apart WHILE you're using them, then it's not ""really"" a cost savings.  You're basically throwing YOUR money away because as soon as you start to use it you have to throw it out. :(  The quality breakdown: I am primarily using these foam brushes to stain my wood pieces. After only 2-3 dips into the stain, lightly mind you, I wasn't soaking the brush through, using this particular brand, all 3 sizes had the same effect, the foam literally starts to FALL APART!  I mean, even for one of my small pieces, which is only 15""w x 14""ht, 1.5"" thick, this foam starts to fall apart. Compared to the HD foam brushes, to which one larger size 3"" foam brush and I could stain 10 or more pieces at one time, and even some of my larger pieces (41""w x 31.5""ht), with the same brush.  I had to go through 4-5 times as many of these particular foam brushes to do 1/3 of the job that the better quality HD brushes were capable of doing.

Now, I must also share that I'm not sure how these do with regular paint. Perhaps they're much better for that kind of application, but there is no question what so ever that the quality of these foam brushes, in my opinion, really needs to be reworked by this company.  They really need a ""thicker"" more dense foam instead of the cheap-o kind of foam they're using here so these brushes can really stand up to the work they're being used for, however minor it may be.

Needless to say, I will be researching to find a better quality product in bulk from somewhere else.  Remember, initial cost savings if it's poor quality, is like no savings at all in the end.  Better to spend a little more and really have your money working for you instead of throwing it in the garbage.

I hope this helps!",1.0

"I regularly use foam brushes for applying pre-stain conditioner, sometimes for stains, and for poly for trim. These are the worst foam brushes I have ever used. The foam separates from the wood after just about one minute of use. The foam would not even stay attached long enough to complete pre-stain of a single window jamb or single window sash. Waste of money, ended up using 4x as many brushes.

I have since purchased the Loew Cornell brushes (also available online and on Amazon) and they are a far superior product which I recommend in place of this product.

Even if you are only going to use these for a quick 2 minute touch up job, these are still not worth it, they literally won't last that long.",1.0

I use xacto knives almost every day. I thought I'd buy this more expensive model to treat myself and I was disappointed. the blade is more cumbersome to change and the safety cap doesn't stay on. Other than hold the blade these are the only two things the knife does. BTW it holds the blade just fine. I'm giving this one away and sticking with the inexpensive one.,1.0
"Does not cut, dull as crap!",1.0
"like most customers said this knife has the look but stops there. This knife worked great the first few times and then the sharp tip broke off and flew into my EYE.

So frustrating when i have to use this product EVERYDAY. never again",1.0
"After only a few uses, the knife no longer securely holds the blade.  Now, the blade slips out when attempting to use.  I'm using the blade size #11 that came with it and that is recommended by the company.  And, I'm only cutting photographs printed from the printer.  A waste of money.",1.0
"I had a similar blue rubberized X-Acto handle years ago. It was really comfortable and lasted years.

The rubber on this is hard and uncomfortable, with a mold flashing seam running down the length of it.

The cap is pure garbage. It cracked while I was pulling the handle out of the packaging, and falls off with just the slightest amount of force.",1.0
Won't hold blade tight. May be ok for paper but the blade won't stay in when cutting thick items.,1.0

"Elmer products shipped the product to me in a amazing next day.  To bad the product is not worth it.  I could never get the blade to tighten all the way, the clamping mechanism doesn't clamp all the way, dangerous to have the sharp blade loose when using.

Never ad a problem with Xacto products, very disappointing.",1.0
The rubber came off the first time I used it and the blade wouldn't stay in:(,1.0
I was actually checking the knife out and made the mistake of unscrewing it like you would to replace the blade. Now it won't go back together. The screw stripped so now it won't even hold the blade. Bad thing is I bought four of these. Looks like you use it til the blade goes dull then toss it...pretty expensive knife for one use only. Just goes to show a brand you once could trust to produce quality products now has gone to pot.,1.0
Very dissatisfied. Recieved on time and first time i went to change blades the mechanism stripped. This was one of my worst purchases I have ever made. The quality is very poor. If you want a knife you only want to use once and throw away this is the product for you. I was looking forward to the soft grip but i intended to use it more than once. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone whom uses it frequently. I mean more than once as you cant change the blade.,1.0
"I bought 5 of these knifes  for our workshop, I use X acto knifes all my life, but looking at the many products I have from them, more and more are turning out to be only competitors to the cheap Chinese products. I think they lost their professionalism somewhere along the way, this knife definitely proves that. Looks great, but that's it. The plastic cap is cheap, too hard and cracks all the time, not to mention that it doesn't hold in place on the knife. And the worst part about this knife is that once you use it a few times the silicone part of it gets loose and you have to use pliers to hold the new blade while turning the rear section when replacing the blade because the front silicone part just spins around.",1.0
"I agree with another reviewer here that said the cap falls off. It is poorly designed. It does not ""click"" into place, but relies on friction to stay on. The surface area that the cap grips on the shaft is only about 1/8"" deep. Even a slight lateral force will tip the cap off of the shaft, exposing the razor sharp blade. This is definitely a safety hazard. In one motion, you could knock the cap off and cut your hand. Don't ever carry this in your pocket. I was keeping the cap taped on, but eventually I told myself it wasn't worth the risk of having this thing around. I threw it away -- and I feel good that I probably saved me or someone else from a nasty cut. Exacto should pull this thing from the market until they redesign the cap -- and they should recall all the units already sold. Don't waste your money on this expensive version -- get the basic version that has a secure cap.",1.0
"They looked sturdy and we do alot of project with these type of foam brushes - these don't work at all. Apply any pressure on the foam brush ends they snap off the handle.
The others we have used, the foam is wrapped around a thin plastic sheet that it is adhered to. These are on a small ridgid pin type inserted in the wooden handle - when you go to apply paint or anything - the pressure alone will make it snap.

Sturdy handle looked like a good product - too bad its got a bad application issue.",1.0
"DO NOT BUY unless you want flecks of black foam on your finished surface.  These brushes broke down immediately when applying sanding sealer.  Luckily I had a smaller Woodcraft foam brush on hand.  Yes, ""a"" brush.  The Woodstock brushes began breaking down on the first face I worked on, the much thinner Woodcraft brush lasted through 10 sq feet and would have kept going.",1.0
This product is poorly made. The holes in the bottom make it impossible to transport from one drawer to another without completely emptying first. I find it useless and the image preview deceiving.,1.0
"Cheap plastic that didn't lay flat, as if someone tried to wring it out. Opposite corners were either both off the surface or on the surface. Probably makes no sense to anyone but me.",1.0
I bought the product to hold socks.  I can only put one sock in each compartment.  each compartment shoud be big enough to hold a pair of socks.  It is not like my socks are huge since I wear a size 31/2 shoe. I am not going to bother sending it back.,1.0
"I do not like the magnet feature of my machine at all.  It gets crumpled and twisted and ends up ruining your item, or wasting way too much magnet and laminate material.  Perhaps I'm just not experienced enough with it yet, but so far I just don't like it at all.",1.0
I purchased this with the hopes of making custom save the date magnets for my wedding. The magnets were much weaker than I anticipated despite only using a relatively thin piece of paper. I ended up scrapping the idea because they could only hold their own weight and wouldn't have been able to be used to hold other items.,1.0
"I meant to purchase the larger size and now if I want to return it, I am only getting 38 cents back.  If you are not sure if this is what you want, buyer beware.",1.0
"Don't bother buying this magnet, doesn't do the job. It won't stick on our fridge at all. VERY POOR QUALITY.",1.0
Magnet isn't strong at all.  They wouldn't stay on a metal door.  The quality used to be better on these magnet cartridges.  Sadly all my magnets didn't work.  Waist of my money.,1.0
Was not what I ordered. No magnets and laminate didn't stick.,1.0

"I do a lot of quilting, which involves a lot of cutting. I was hoping to have something that kept the rulers and templates from sliding, but this was a total waste of money. All this is is A piece of plastic film that you put on the back of the ruler. It does not grip the fabric. It does not keep the ruler from sliding. I think I will go back to using a small piece of sandpaper in each corner. At least I know that will keep the ruler from sliding around.",1.0
Waste of money!  Wish I had read reviews before I bought 2 rolls.  Does not change the way the ruler slides on fabric at all.,1.0
"I've tried this on 2 different cutting mats, didn't work.",1.0
"This did not work for me at all. There was nothing I could do to make it stick to any of my rulers. Grip strips from Guidelines for Quilting work perfectly but I was trying to save a little money by buying this. As it turned out it cost me more because after I tried this product with no success, I turned around and bought the Grip Strips too. Much better.",1.0
"This is a wast of money. I end up using 2 rubber bands. The ones that are flat and that works much better and are cheaper than this useless plastic. You are better off buying a bag of long rubber bands and place them on the ruler. Do this first and if you don't like it, then spend the money but I don't think this is worthy, in my humble opinion.",1.0
"I was expecting, as it said.. to have some grip to the plastic to hold the template from moving when on the fabric while I am rotary cutting it..... but..it does nothing to keep the template from moving when on the fabric. Template slides like it did without it. I am not happy with this product..it doesn't do what it says. Now, it does keep the templates from sliding around when they are stacked together...template to template. That is a tad of help since when I use several size templates, and they are sliding all over..this product makes them kind of stick together so they don't get pushed around and have to hunt for them. But it is advertised to hold the template to the fabric..and it doesn't",1.0
Wasted money on this one. I put it on and the ruler slides the same with as without it. It might be better on top of the ruler so I can write on it to mark my measurement in order to verify I am always cutting at the correct measurement.,1.0
"I'd return it but not even worth the trouble,  I put it in my donation box.
When applied to my OMNIGRID ruler, it slid right across the fabric, no gripping at all.

Stick with the sandpaper dots - they are the best ever.  They are cheap and last a long time.",1.0
This product works if you are cutting on a fabric with no seams and everything is laying flat.  It does not hold if you are laying ruler over the top of a seam.  It wobbles and moves.  My Omnigrip rulers hold same without this product.,1.0
I APPLIED THE INVISIGRIP AS INSTRUCTIONS.  IT WILL NOT STAY ON THE RULER.  WHEN I PICK THE RULER UP THE INVISIGRIP FALLS OFF.  AM I DOING SOMETHING WRONG?,1.0
This did absolutely nothing to my silver chain and earrings.  I previously purchased Connoisseurs Silver Jewelry Cleaner (Silver) which worked great.  I managed to have a tiny bit left so I tried my jewelery in it and it worked perfectly.  I will never recommend this Hagerty cleaner.  It was a total waste of money.  I've opened the Hagarty stuff and used it once.  Is it too late to return it and replace it with the Connoisseurs Silver Jewelry Cleaner (Silver)?,1.0

"I ordered this for an intricate sterling pin that a cloth wouldn't work for. The item I tried it on was pretty tarnished. It had an amber centerpiece. I left the piece in for 5 hours. The sterling was barely changed, sill very tarnished. The amber, formerly shiny, was now dull and no amount of polishing would restore it. Jewelry now is a throwaway!",1.0
"It sure doesn't seem like this stuff cleans very well. I left a necklace to soak, then brushed it and rinsed. When I got done I thought it didn't look clean so I used one of those jewelry cleaning rags - LOTS of tarnish came of the necklace - like I hadn't cleaned it at all.

The brush needs to be wider - its skinny and difficult to use on items like necklaces. It worked fine for rings - and after much brushing, the rings were definitely cleaner than before soaking.

My largest complaint is the packaging. I had to cut the plastic protector off the top (standard), but I can't get it off the actual outside of the jar - so it doesn't close properly and leaks everywhere. I have tried multiple times to remove the plastic, spilling the liquid all over the place. Very frustrating :(",1.0
"I bought this to stamp info on various keys I have.

This thing won't stamp soft brass. Maybe it'll stamp wood or plastic, but I don't know.

"This set was impossible to use: the numbers and letters were not centered or aligned with the flat sides of the stamp tool, so it was impossible to orient the character accurately on the work to be stamped. Properly designed stamps have the character centered, and aligned with a flat side (usually square) of the stamp tool. This set went into the rubbish rather than return it, so that it would not wind up in some unsuspecting purchaser's hands. One of the worst examples of poorly executed, cheap knock-offs. Caveat emptor.",1.0
"Hands down, this is the worst quality item I have ever ordered from Amazon. That's saying a lot considering I've been shopping on Amazon since it opened, have a Prime membership and try to purchase what I can here first.

I ordered this for stamping Moleskines, leather and anything else that can be stamped.

First thing to mention is packaging. You'll need scissors as it's one of those clamshell things. Not a biggie.

As soon as I cut the package open, however, the mess began. See the blue plastic case in the photo? Well, the blue is everywhere. For whatever reason, it comes off on everything. My hands were immediately covered with blue dye. The items I was working on were blue. The plastic is fading in spots, and the coloring in it ends up everywhere. It's bad enough as to make the case something you definitely won't want to keep, which means unless you think of some brilliant solution, you'll have a mess of jumbled letters and numbers in a baggie.

When you pull out one of the letters or numbers to put in the tool, you'll then find that that the company generously oiled them at the base, I assume, so they'll easily slide into the tool. The problem is that the oil is now drippy blue oil that will end up making your already blue fingers blue and slippery.

And having blue and slippery fingers will be a problem when you find that not all of the numbers and letters FIT in the tool. Yes, no matter how you try, some will simply not fit. At this point, you'll be trying to manually hold them on the object you've already started lettering and tap them with something so you're not left with a half-lettered item.

Then, if you're like me, if you get a letter that almost fits, you'll manage to tap the tool hard enough that the letter that initially wouldn't fit in the tool, now not only fits, but also won't come out short of using some kind of vise and pliers, and at this point, with your oily blue fingers, good luck with that.

Finally, the entire concept of this item is poor. There's no guide whatsoever, no way to line up the letters/numbers so you know where they'll end up. You'll find yourself with face on table, trying to see if the letter is perpendicular, being as careful as you can, only to find that it's crooked -- or worse -- backwards.

Yes, this is going back to the company. I wouldn't recommend this or ANY item produced by the manufacturer. There appears to be absolutely zero quality control at the factory if this item is at all representative of what you can expect from any of their products.",1.0
It was missing a crucial component and had to be returned.,1.0
The automatic punch only worked 25% of the time. Very poorly made. Returned for a refund.,1.0
So upset..spent good money and the stamps are horrible. Will not even stamp cleanly on the easiest material. I would like a refund,1.0

I made sure to work on a heat resistant surface as mentioned and use a damp buffer cloth in between the fabric and the iron, and still was greeted with this horrible mess.  Not only does this product seemingly only work when it wants to, but the fact that it made a horrible cleanup afterward was the nail in the coffin.

I would give zero stars if I could. I bought the 1/4 circle punch. It broke after ONE punch. No returns so now it have to end up in a dumpster. I don't care much about the $6.

"This punch is garbage. Seriously. This is my second try, too. (There wasn't a return policy? But Amazon sent me another.)

First, the punch is hard to press. For being a good brand in scissors, I thought Fiskars would offer a sharp punch. Wrong. Not only is it hard to punch, but there seems to be a burr or two on the edge, leaving the paper with rough edgesnot a clean cut.

The worst is probably that after about 20 punches, it stopped opening altogether. It kept sticking, but so much so that I had to pry it with two hands to get it to open up.",1.0
"When I first got this thimble thought it was the most comfortable thing ever. However when sewing, the needle digs into the leather and tears it up. The leather is too soft where the needle goes. Within a week I could see the bare metal. Within a week and a half most of the metal was visible. The metal tip inside does not have any divots on it- it is a smooth piece. So the end of your needle slips around on it making it hard to sew.  And if you're not careful the needle slips right off the metal and pokes you right in the finger!  This product is going back and I will try a different leather thimble",1.0

Second- the shape is flared out like a bell and fits a thumb better than a finger.  Lastly- they have changed the thick leather for a thin leather + waffled composite liner that is much less rigid or sturdy.  All these things mean that the thimble won't stay on my finger, making it unusable.  Going to check ebay and see if I can find an old version.",1.0

piece  of junk....did not punch.........Amazon authorized refund. Thank you Amazon not Fiskars!",1.0
It was nice to discover that at Fiskars has finally resorted to using Chinese prison labor in the manufacture of their products. Based on the quality of what I recently received I'm guessing it was a maximum strength facility. The metal stampings looked like throw aways from a failed sheet metal merit badge attempt at a Cub Scout meeting. The fit involving the actual punch mechanism was so poor I could get better results by stabbing at paper with the rubber coated handles. The two best parts are the rubber coated handles which should provide plenty of cushion as I repurpose this tool for its new life as a hammer. The second was the comically low price of only $4.19 While I would have found better value in a Happy Meal for the same price it's a toss up whether I would have had more fun playing with the toy or contemplating how much of the purchase price was used to improve the conditions on death row.,1.0

i was excited about this hole punch for my daughter.  It is difficult to push down and when you do push down hard it doesn't punch the heart out completely.

"Just finished trying to paint a small wood medicine cabinet with Krylon Colormaster with very disappointing results.  I first primed the cabinet with 2 cans of Krylon white primer, then sprayed it with Krylon semi gloss white.  Applying several thin coats (2 cans) the paint barely covered the primer so I waited about 30 minutes and tried again. The next coats wrinkled the earlier coats in several places even though I waited 30 minutes before applying.  When the cans get low they sputter and spit droplets which also added to my stress.  I restore and paint cars so I know how to paint.  In the past Krylon use to be the only paint I would use but something has changed with their formula.  My guess is they had to make changes to meet environmental regs.  After waiting one week I just spent 2 hours sanding the cabinet down, now I'm afraid to take a chance using this product again.  Will try another brand and hope it goes on without these issues.  I'm taking the time to leave this review in hopes that Krylon chemists will take note.",1.0
"This was listed as appropriate for Exterior use. When I opened the box, I saw the can was labeled just for Indoor use.

The coverage on this is awful even after multiple coats.  I bought for a school project for my kids.  For example didn't cover cardboard that was white with a lite color pattern below.  Three coats and nada.  I also spray painted a picture frame that was a light silver and it just dripped off.,1.0

I expected better from a Fiskars product because they have such a long and stolid reputation for their cutting tools.

"I ordered these as recommended by JDS Labs for use on an Altoids tin. Though the punch tip looks nice, the rubber handles are somewhat comfortable, and it can punch standard paper just fine, the first hole I tried to punch in an Altoids tin resulted in a bent handle, just under the CHINA label under the pivot pin/rivet. Now they won't even work on paper. It was a nice idea, but it just didn't work.",1.0
"Like the other reviews stated, this will not punch an altoids tin.  I had assumed the other reviews were just aberrations.  Not so!  I removed the retaining clip as suggested, and applied enough force to bend the handles.  No dice.  The punch is now worthless.

I can only assume one of two things: 1) JDS Labs used an altoids tin with thinner metal or 2) Fiskers has had decreased product quality since that time.

The construction actually seems pretty good, so I'm thinking it's the former.  If you're looking for a paper punch, disregard this review. If you came here from the JDS website though, this product will not work.",1.0
"OK, I didn't buy them to punch paper - I bought them to punch holes in Altoids tins based on the recommendation of the JDS Labs site.  They must have off-shored the manufacture of these, because JDS has a video showing them punching holes in an Altoids tin.  I tried one hole, and without feeling like I was really even trying they bent like they were made out of cardboard.  I threw them away without ever having punched a single hole in anything.  Even if I were just punching paper, they bent so easily they would have self destructed with a few too many sheets.",1.0

"OK. I'm totally pissed with Krylon. This is my third attempt at painting an antique metal too box with their incompetently formulated paint. I've used Krylon on many projects over the years, very familiar with their paints - at least up to now. I had put down a couple coats of paint as describe on their instructions. The next day I wet sanded the coat to get out some minor imperfections. and let it dry thoroughly. As soon as I re-sprayed what was to be the final finish coat - several places fried and bubbled up. Temps are 70-80 degrees in the shade. The first time I thought it might be the base paint. So, I switched to a primer that I had used before with Krylon with success and bought another new can of Krylon in case there was a batch problem. Same thing happened again. Each time this crap has to be stripped, re-sanded and re-primed. I think what is happens is that the Krylon paint I'm using never really cures. When a second application is made the next day the solvents in the paints penetrate the uncured first coat, expand and loosens the initial coat - frying it. This does not happen with a competently formulated paint that cures/drys properly.

I have had it now with Krylon forever - and will tell everyone I know about this totally unacceptable experience. I used to think Krylon was a great spray can paint. Now - I would give them a zero if it was an option. Totally pissed.",1.0
"I used this today to paint a wire basket. When I finished I put the can on my kitchen table. I left for errands right after. When I returned home I immediately smelled paint when opening the door.

"This hole punch is entirely non-functional in every way, which is something of an achievement for a tool with one moving part. The (small, vertically-oriented) punch tab is irregularly shaped and slightly off-center, which makes it difficult to align with the slot. This produces a ""chewing"" action more often than a solid punch, even on a single sheet of paper. The handle action is stiff, and the grip is only a thin rubber sleeve, which makes the force required to gnaw a hole through something like card stock very uncomfortable.

I would be willing to assume that the individual item I received was defective, except that the one I borrowed briefly as a replacement -- exactly the same model -- worked precisely the same way. Uncomfortable, shoddy, misaligned. Will not replace, wouldn't recommend. I may end up keeping it in my desk at work to loan to people I dislike.",1.0

"Disclaimer: I did not buy this through Amazon. I bought it at a national hardware chain whose name I probably should not disclose.

I have had years of good luck with Krylon products but ColorMaster / CoverMAX fails completely.

When sprayed on a white item, the first coat is a light ""smoke"". The second coat is a darker ""smoke"". To get ""flat black"" requires 3 or 4 coats. When sprayed on a ""flat black"" item, the first coat is more of a dark gray.

Claim ""Dries in 10 minutes or less"". Not likely. 60 minutes later it was still tacky. (BTW, it didn't ""Dries in 10 minutes or less"" on my fingers either.

Claim ""No runs"". Bull!

I've used this product on flat black plastic, white plastic, metal and a cardboard composite material with the same results. I must assume that the other colors are no better.

- The can splatters paint, it doesn't spray paint. Actually added time to my project because I had to do extra sanding and repaint (with different brand paint of course). I've seen monkey's lob feces more evenly than this paint sprays.

- This paint is thin and requires more than average coats. Rustoleum & Valspar are better choices and within the same pricing. This paint is not even in the same ballpark as Testors.

- The can stopped spraying, splattered and then started spraying, then stopped all within the same attempt at applying a single coat. I clean all my nozzles between coats but somehow this brand of paint still manages to clog itself.

Conclusion: if you like extra work, super splattery paint finish and high-maintenance sloppy nozzles that repeatedly clog, then buy this cheap paint. If you want a finish that even somewhat resembles nice and even, buy a different brand.",1.0
The quality is terrible- the gauge is inconsistent- it varies from sport to dk to worsted. The yarn has slubs and bits of white or fuzz in the plys. It splits and frays; the project pilled and shed even before the project was finished- just from handling. I would not use it again.,1.0
Not as listed.  States a quantity of three but only one shipped.,1.0
"I purchased the three pack and I was charged for them, but only I received one. Very unhappy.",1.0
This order was two skanes of yarn short.,1.0

"I have bought this paint locally, but decided to order it online this time.  I'm  not sure why it was different, but the can I bought online was too thin and the paint just ran instead of sticking.",1.0
This was horrible. Couldn't even use it cz the nozzle was clogged. Can't even return it so I'm screwed,1.0
I ordered because it stated it was light grey. It's more silver and does not match a light grey I was already working with.,1.0
"Advertised as a 6 pack, but you only receive one can. Disappointed.",1.0
"This stuff is most definitely not made for metal. It has the worst coverage I have ever seen on a metal surface that was prepped properly. It's almost watery in consistency. It leaves spots, doesn't dry flat, and leaves an odd texture. Not to mention it dried to a dark grey finish and not black. I will never buy another Krylon product again.",1.0
"Much larger than average seam ripper and very dull, would have returned if worth the hassle.",1.0
"My message to Krylon:
For the second time in a row, Krylon has (bleeped) me.  A couple weeks back, I purchased a glossy white stray paint for the finishing coat on a glass project I was working on.  I gave that baby the shaking of a lifetime and sprayed my starter spray to the side and then gave my 6 glass pieces a swipe to find that the can was filled with partially dry paint, spraying paint boogers and coating my glasses. While my eyes began to reflect the bubbling surface of the sun, my husband walks by and comments ""Why did you finish those with drywall texture?'.

Then we get to today, my last day to myself for the next few months, so I thought I would treat myself with some in the sun crafting time.  I sanded and primed and again sanded an entire dresser.  I got it papered and taped and ready for action.  I thought in my head of how this will be the best piece ever, how I would frame some fabric and how this blue was going to look stunning, people will be asking ""How does she do it?"".  Five seconds later my response would have to be, ""Not with bleeping Krylon!""  As I pressed that flimsy button, a few flecks of paint splattered the surface before the paint began just dribbling down the front of the can, down my hand and onto my shoes.

So I thought I might help Krylon's creativity development the way Krylon has helped me!  I came up with some alternative logos which I hope you will seriously consider.

""Krylon:  We've never done manual labor""
""Krylon:  Hope you like sanding""
""Krylon:  Your official fingertip paint""

In case the response is something like ""sorry to hear that, you can contact customer service"" or ""we would like to ruin any future projects you might have with free crappy paint"", I will pass.  Krylon can however reimburse the following:

$4.72 for white spray sand
$4.72 for a blue can of what I assume is secret paint that has to be kept inside for the sake of the human population
$2.00 for gas, probably more than that but since I won't be reimbursed for this,  I want to minimize my own disappointment
$4.00 for sandpaper, you know why
$2.00 for Band-Aids needed after sanding my fingertips off
$7.82 to replace my ""drywall"" jars
$45.00 for the time I spent waiting in front of the ridiculous glass case of paint, the creepy political conversation I had to endure with the paint guy, the 30 minutes spent shaking Krylon cans like I am working on the ""old fashioned"" Olympics (really hope you are a South Park fan and got the reference), the 20 seconds applying both Krylon products before I realized I just received the hucklebuck from a paint company, and another 900 hours for sanding given at a discount rate since Krylon clearly doesn't value my time.

Best of luck,

"I have bought this yarn previously (Aran) and was satisfied.  I recently bought two skein and found them totally flawed.  Consistanly varied as to the width, the twist and one skein was knotted twice.  I will never again purchase Red Heart 4 ply again.  Where was the quality control?
On to another brand.

"I would strongly discourage buying this paint. We purchased this paint (not from Amazon) but local store to paint bezels around interior recessed lights. This paint had terrible coverage and went onto surface in small blotches, (orange peel). The smoothness of the finish was awful. I am returning the paint to get my money back and buying Rust-Oleum. I have always had very good luck using Rust-Oleum paint. Perhaps the application may make some difference, but if you are after a very smooth and even finish, I would highly discourage this product. Perhaps if you are painting wood or some surface that is not really smooth, this paint might work OK. It is less cost than Rust-Oleum, but at least in my case you apparently get what you pay for.",1.0
Way over priced for one small skein of yarn. I thought it was the jumbo with a charge of over 7 dollars a skein,1.0
Bought this for sons army man costume. Even on basic plastic I needed 3 or more coats. Awful coverage. Cost a fortune as I had to keep buying more paint. I thought the krypton brand would equate to good quality... This is so bad I'd think it came from dollar store. STAY AWAY.,1.0
This is no good. It just made a big mess :(,1.0
"I bought the flat black, the flat white, and the white primer at Michael's, and I really should have checked Amazon reviews first.  I assumed it would be typical Krylon, but they've changed the paint formula (I guess to comply with new regulations) and the nozzle.  The formula isn't great, but other brands of compliant paint are fine, so I think all my problems are with the nozzle.  I mean seriously, it's that bad. What paint does spray out sprays in a huge vertical line rather than a cone, so only a tiny bit gets on the item. The rest of it doesn't spray but runs down your hand, down the can, and drips on the ground.  I had the same experience with all three cans of Krylon I bought with this lame ""comfort nozzle."" Did they not test this?

Conclusion: I won't be buying Krylon again.",1.0
I didn't get what I ordered. I got Krylon's new Color Max flat black primer/paint. It dries a weird black-gray color and looks like s***. I've shaken the can until my arm is sore and it still comes out awful. Thanks Krylon. You make garbage now.,1.0
"The spray nozzle on this can is extremely faulty. I think at least 1/2 of the can dripped out rather than sprayed. It took one entire can to paint one dining room chair and it still needs more. No matter how I held this can, it dripped excessively. Color is great. Can is terrible.",1.0
I would give this a 0 if possible....made a huge mess of drips and runs,1.0
"The old paint was awesome! The new cans of pumpkin orange doesn't paint for anything. When I say new I'm talking about the paint+primer. They changed the way the paint applies to what you're spraying and they changed the nozze on the can too. If you're too far away it barely will apply to anything, and if you get closer it's next to impossible to avoid the paint running. What was once an awesome can of paint is now garbage. I am now in the process of trying their Decorator gloss enamel in pumpkin orange so I will get to see how that will work for me. If you are going to paint something that you want to look nice I urge you to buy one can and paint some srap steel or something first in a vertical position and you will be glad you didn't waste that much money on this stuff",1.0
Horrible. Doesn't spray evenly and comes out like water.,1.0
You need about 5 cans if spraying wood. The wood kept turning back brown as if I didn't spray it. I wouldn't recommend it.,1.0
"I've been buying Krylon spray paint for years and never once had a problem, so I thought nothing of buying several cans in various colors the other day. Well the product has changed and NOT for the better. The paint is very watery so the coverage isn't good. But the worst part is the sprayer. It doesn't spray straight (I ended up spraying everything within 4 feet in every direction of what I was trying to paint). And it sputtered and splattered all over what I was trying to paint.

Horrible experience!",1.0
"When it arrived, the entire nozzle was caked in this yellowish hardened ooze. My wife was finally able to peel it off and use it properly, but the paint itself was also terrible. I've used a lot of spray paints and this was the absolute worst. The only redeeming quality is the color does match the cap.",1.0
"This paint sputters and drips when used, rather than applying a fine mist.  Shaking the can to mix, and turning nozzle a bit was no help. I  ended up buying a different paint at local paint store to use instead.",1.0
"I didn't care for this paint very much.  It is difficult to get just the right color when you buy paint online, and I didn't like this color of green much.  It was sort of a sick farmer green (I don't think that is actually a color, just my description).  I also didn't like the quality of the paint.  I used this to paint some metal shelves.  I purchased a different color of the same brand but it was satin touch.  That paint went on much smoother than this paint.  Maybe it was just the wrong type for this application.  I was painting over a powder-coated metal shelf that was primed.  As I said the other satin touch of the same brand went on smooth and looks great.
Another issue was that the paint dripped and splattered.  It did not seem to come out as well as the previously mentioned satin touch.  I had to wipe the paint off the applicator to keep it from being an even poorer finish that it was.",1.0
"The cap was hard enough to get off the damn thing.  Then I saw their new sprayer...dear god.  It sprayed like it was spitting.  Uneven sputtering type spray.  Seriously, don't get this.",1.0
I'm very disappointed in this paint.  It was very drippy and splotchy.  I'm an avid crafter & DIY'er and have spray painted many items and this is the worst paint I've used.,1.0
"The paint did not atomize, but instead splattered in large drops out the can despite shaking vigorously before using this product.",1.0
It dripped too much and was inneffective as a spray paint. I will not buy it again. Please do not buy this.,1.0
"I usually don't write reviews, but this product was so bad that I wanted to write it so others don't waste their money.
I was doing a simple project of spraying a wall (not holding the can in an odd way) and not only had the paint running on the wall, but on my hand, down my arm and ruining my shirt. It also dripped on some nearby items, ruining them.
Even though I shook the can before starting, it flowed-out like tinted water when using it.
Purchase a different item and save some stress and clean-up.",1.0
Received a yellow. Only one yellow. Was adertized as a six pack.  Double checked on several screens to check the color on the discription and they all seem golden orange.

Get what you need from the hardware store for cheaper and properly advertised.,1.0
"Horrible yarn. Inconsistent from skein to skein; some will be relatively soft and okay to work with, and the next will be much thicker and rougher, which will cause gauge to be inconsistent. The rougher texture will also be uncomfortable to work with. There is good reason this yarn is cheaper than others. Go for a better yarn and you will enjoy working your project much more, and the end result will be far superior.",1.0

I normally don't review products but I am struck by how bad this product is. Its watery and streaky and the paint leaked through the top while I was spraying and got all over the sides of the can and my hands. I used a Rustoleum primer before this paint and that was so beautiful. I am so sad that I have ruined something by using bad quality paint and I need to figure out how I can salvage my stuff from this.,1.0

"All the one star reviews hit it right on the dot.

Krylon spray paint is always my go to, especially the oil rubbed bronze. But recently they redesigned the can I guess with the 360 spray....HUGE MISTAKE!!! I attempted to use the oil rubbed bronze on a small baby gate, I was extremely surprised at the horrible mess it made and I only got one side finished with the whole can!!!! It took sanding over and over to get it right, and I had to go out and buy more!!! Then I attempted a second baby gate with the ballet slipper pink....this was even worse!!! As one reviewer explained, it sits in a cloud and barely touches the surface, so you come up closer and you destroy your painting surface with dripping and cracking paint!!! It's horrific, I wish I could get my money back on the gates as well as the paint!! Now Iv'e used two cans of the pink on only one side of the damn gate, and some of the paint came out darker then lighter even after vigorously shaking it, so now it looks like a goddamn tie die hippie gate with drips and cracks all over it.....horrible just horrible.  I don't even want to finish what I started, It's just throwing away money..... extremely pissed!",1.0

We want to keep them, they just need to be a different color.  I applied the first coat using a sweeping motion and the paint ran and dripped all over the place. Then I noticed that the color is very sheer so you get almost no coverage.  I let the first coat dry and came back to apply a second coat and the experience was even worse. Again, it ran and dripped everywhere. Very difficult to get a good solid color. I will probably have to buy another type of spray paint and re do it. I have no idea how we can use them in their current condition.",1.0

DON'T FALL FOR THIS RUSE!!!!",1.0
"The can was a disaster! The new ""comfort spray"" did not work well at all, and seemed to drip paint everywhere rather than actually spray.

"The last can of Krylon I bought sprayed horribly inconsistently. There were lots of globs that came shooting out, coating both the wood I was painting as well as covering my hand. I shook the can before using and while painting. I've never seen spray paint this bad before. I used a can of Valspar spray paint and it worked beautifully. Nice even spray. Not sure what's going on as I have used Krylon years ago and it worked fine. I guess the old adage is true, ""they just don't make them like they used to"".",1.0
"I bought 5 cans of this for a project... Horrible!! It's not the paint, it's the sprayer. I sprayed it on the ground to figure out what the heck it was doing and it made two lines... With one spray? Three of the five cans did this. The two that didn't do this had the normal spray top on them. The chalkboard paint by Krylon was perfect and so easy to use. Good product if you get the regular spray button top thing - check before you buy.",1.0
"IF I could give this paint a lower rating I would. It's not the paint itself so much as it is the sprayer and the wastefullness of it because of the sprayer. The ""new 360 dial"" directional sprayer on this paint is HORRIBLE. It causes most of the paint to spray into the air and not on what you are trying to paint. I bought three cans of rustolum primer and three cans of this Krylon indoor/outdoor metal + wood + wicker + more satin spray paint. The rustolum covered 4x the area that this did. I will need to buy at least 4-5 more cans of this crap to complete my project. A LOT of the paint is wasted as it sprays into the air. At first I was holding the paint at a normal distance from my project but 95% of the paint was going into the air. Then I held it closer, about 4"" from my project to try to get the paint onto it, but then the paint started to get runs in it. So it caused a COMPLETE MESS. I am no novice at using spray paints. I've been using them for 40 years. This is the most wastefull spray paint I've ever used. Blotchy uneven finish will cause you to have to go over and over it even when you think your done. If you stand back and look you will see ""holidays"" in the paint. Be prepared to spend a LOT of money on a LOT of cans of this paint. If I had it to do over again, I'd choose a different color so I could buy a different brand. Never again, Krylon!",1.0
"So bad I returned it. It was like clear paint with some pigment mixed in. (Yes, I shook it for 2 minutes before using). Would have taken 3 or 4 coats to do what Rustoleum spray paint does in 1 or 2 coats. Horrible.

"This yarn is pieced together. When you try to ball it it unravels, knots and the color is inconsistent. Especially the orange colored ones. Red dye is dropped throughout. It actually looks like someone bled on it. Comparing it to other yarns it isn't soft either. I prefer Vannas choice or Bernat. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on quality.",1.0
Didn't work for me at all.,1.0

"Very disappointed when I received this today.  Over the weekend I purchased some Red Heart Fur yarn at a local store to tide me over until this arrived.  The difference between the two products is pretty drastic!  I was expecting it to be more like the Red Heart ... or perhaps somewhere in between.  Attaching a photo of the two yarns side by side.
As you can see, you'd pretty much have to knit or crochet along with a regular yarn in order to do anything with this thin Lion Brand yarn. I normally like Lion Brand yarn, but this was a disappointment.  If you're looking for more of a fur feel, look at the Red Heart instead. I found it crocheted really fast. My only only complaint with the red heart is that the ""fur"" is so dense, I had a hard time seeing the chains in my crochet, but on the other hand, the fur is so dense, no one will catch your mistakes.",1.0
"It's very small, the pal of my hand is bigger than this. Disappointed because I thought it would be like the size of regular yarn. Not sure you can make anything with just one.",1.0
brittle. cracks easily. not durable.  scratches easily.,1.0
"It's skimpy eyelash yarn, NOT fur consistency like it is labeled. Very thin and fragile, difficult to work with.",1.0

"I mainly quilt and piece. For me, the pokey part you use to get under stitches is way too big. It makes it difficult to even get it between stitches. Also it is dull as heck. Almost unusable.",1.0
The product appeared to have been used.  The Red Heart label was completely torn from the yarn.  The yarn appeared to have been unwrapped from the center (not the pull out end) and to have been cut -- as the end of the yarn was frayed.,1.0

"I know it's not too pricey but this broke on me on the first use.  I was just ripping normal thread, nothing special.  Disappointing.",1.0
"normally this is good yarn, but certainly not worth the 6 week wait for items that were in stock and supposed to ship in 1-2 days. There was a 4 for 3 promotion, so I bought 16. I must have missed the fine print that said the free portion would be shipped a month and a half after the regular priced order. I would have been better off at Walmart!",1.0
I love to work with Starbella. But this price is outrageous!! Look around before you buy it here.  Just sad. I really like a good deal and this is a joke.,1.0

"This is a terrible quality instrument. Cheap materials, arrived scratched up. Clearly not a good buy for me. I suppose you can argue that it's a low cost, therefore low quality. Nonetheless, I am displeased with my purchase.",1.0
"Got half way through my crochet project when I encountered the Gordian Knot lurking within the center of the skein.  This yarn was so knotted and tangled, I couldn't get the center portion of the skein to come out of either end, so now I'm stuck winding roughly 850 yards of yarn into balls from the outside end of the yarn instead of working on my project.

Other than that, the yarn is fairly soft, easy to work with, a pretty shade of gray and inexpensive.  Worth it, if you don't mind spending HOURS winding hundreds of yards of yarn balls and untangling knots instead of working on your project.  I mind greatly.",1.0

It is very scratchy and nothng like I expected except for color.  I used it for baby gifts but washed it in Woolight and softener 3 times to get it a decent softness.  Never again and I still have a lot left.,1.0
I usually very happy to buy my yarn here but this specific item came to me yesterday and the colors were faded and off...,1.0
"Very poor quality, the inner yarn is full of knots and the yarn has areas where there are thicker areas like fur balls.  I had to cut the yarn four times with one skein at a loss of about 1/4 of the skein. The second was worst I was so frustrated that I refused to go through the time consuming process of trying to salvage the skein and threw it away!  Would not recommend this yarn.  I have used other Lion yarns and have been satisfied but this particular product is inferior!",1.0

description said that the pattern was printed on the canvas and when ai received it it was not. Extremely dissappointing.,1.0
This rug does NOT have the design stamped on it.disappointing because it said it did.  Not good for a child.,1.0
This would have been great if it had included the actual hook!,1.0
"The old latch hook projects used to come with the pattern printed on the mesh.  This one does not.  Just a chart and a blank mesh.  And at that, the chart wasn't very good.  We were quite frustrated, my 7-year old and I, so we put it back in the box...where I imagine it will remain.  I loved doing latch hook at her age...but they were much better back in the day...",1.0
Very disappointed. I bought this specifically for my mother because I thought the design was printed on the canvas and was an easy design to complete. Received it and the canvas is blank. They give you directions on paper to count the squares and figure out which colors of yarn go in which square. Not easy for beginners to do. Do not want it and will return. You can't find the pre-printed canvas designs anymore. Very frustrating.,1.0
If something tells me it's a kit then I expect it to have all the stuff I need in it. It does not come with the latch hook. So on Christmas Day when my daughter was all excited and wanted to learn how do do it she couldn't and was very disappointed. I would have been better off going to Michaels and getting one.,1.0
"Bought this product for my daughter. Upon opening up the kit realized no hook was included, this was't a problem went to the local Hobby store and bought one. Upon a very close inspection w/ my daughters help we realized there was no light yellow yarn anywhere in the kit. We counted every yarn fiber one by one to ensure we hadn't missed anything and sure enough there was zero light yellow yarn in any of the yarn packs as there was supposed to be 48 light yellow yarns per pack for a total of 192. How these were left out is beyond me?",1.0
"This yarn is something I would never order again! It splits so easily it's frustrating to do anything with. When making a mistake, the 'hairy' fibers lock it in so you can't pull it apart, wasting more yarn. Very disappointed.",1.0

Not on plastic canvas as described!!! I should've read reviews first instead of taking them at their word. :(,1.0

"I like Sugar'n Cream yarn, and I'm sure I would have liked this if I'd had a chance to use it.  I ordered six packages (they're too small to call them skeins) to make a rush item for a customer, but when the delivery came, I found I had three packages of one dye lot and three of another.  I had to then scramble to find some place where I could get what I needed.  My advice?  Don't trust Amazon to pay attention to dye lots.  If you need more than one package, get what you want on a cone.  Took me three hours to do it, but I found what I wanted elsewhere.",1.0
Very disappointed . Maybe good for knitters but I crochet and have no idea what and how to use this thread .  It is not yarn .,1.0
This yarn is advertised as having 364 yards per skein.  It only has 236 yards.  I can buy it cheaper at somewhere else.,1.0
"Weight not as advertised ,too light. Some Yarn has been used and therefore missing.",1.0
The kit description has changed since I ordered. No where did it say stamped cross stitch! I am seriously disappointed with the quality of the material. The needle that came with it is disgraceful. It is a weak needles that has bent in me while trying to stitch and it has a nick on the tip of it which means it's catching on the fabric and thread. A complete waste of money for me,1.0
I can't find a needle that this works for so it is useless to me.,1.0
"So far every time I've tried to use this, it ends up fraying or completely tearing my floss. I'm using it on a larger eye needle for cross stitching. It was a waste of money.",1.0

"I needed some more floss of a few colors so I submitted a request online about a month ago.  I am still waiting to here back.  If it wasn't for the poor customer service, I would give this product 3 stars.  I wish the aida square in the kit was a little bigger since I like to use a hoop when stitching. The finished size is 7''x 5'', so I used a 10'' hoop, but the aida provided was only 10''x 8'' so I had to go out and buy my own.",1.0

"Since when did Amazon become the yarn police? I was only allowed to buy four skeins when it says there are 19 available. Now as a long-term Prime member not only do I have to spend 25 $ , I am limited to how many I can buy. It's like saying you can only buy two cups of flour when you need four.

This is another to good to believe. they give you  a great price on the product but pad the shipping cost pretty badly. and trying to get a proper refund is a laugh so buyers beware. I haven't been able to place a claim because the system is not working on this one.,1.0
When I purchased these two skeins of yarn I was under the impression that the price stated was for the 14 oz size per skein not the 7 oz for the same price.

"I followed all the review instructions on how to use this product to remove scratches from plastic lenses. Right from the first application that I applied with a cotton ball on just the inside of my scratched lens, the product left an edging film.  I tried a few more applications done on both sides at five and 10 minute intervals and the edged film would not come off. In fact its scratch the lens more.  If my optometrist had not I assured me that my lenses are in fact polyplastic, I would think that I was actually etching glass.

My older but beloved eyeglasses went from scratched-but-still-usable to 100% un-usable after following the steps detailed on multiple websites for scratch removal using Armour Etch, Jeweler's Rouge buffing compound and a Chamois cloth.

"Beware, if your glasses are scratched this will etch them further. It says will not etch plastic but it ruined my plastic glasses. Granted they were on their last leg. But now they are done. It may have removed the anti-reflective coating also, can't really tell. I tried 4 coats.",1.0
"I actually used this glass etching ""cream"" for etching glasses, so was using it as per the manufacturer's instructions. Because the cream is more of a liquid substance than a paste, it runs under your stencil at every given opportunity. This was even true while using the blotching technique recommended in various You Tube videos. I allowed the cream to sit on the glass for one minute. That hardly even made a mark on the glass, so I tried five minutes. I just couldn't get it to render an etched look, but just a vague shadow of the stencil.

I was extremely underwhelmed with this product on all fronts. It didn't do what it says it does, the product is not as described and it is pricey. Next time I'll try the Martha Stewart brand.",1.0
"I read all the positive reviews about this product removing the protective coating from plastic and polycarobonate lenses and thought I would give it a try.  I tried it on two different pairs of glasses (both plastic lenses), and it didn't work on either.  It made the glasses worst by creating scratches since the material is highly abrasive.  I tried 3 or 4 times on each pair of glasses and left the Armour-Etch on for anywhere between 5-20 minutes, and it didn't dissolve the coating at all! I have a feeling people providing positive reviews work for Armour-Etch!! I can't think of any other explanation as it didn't work on two different glasses bought at different places and in different years (one pair was 3 years old and the other pair about a year old).",1.0

Disaster!!! For the first time I wish Amazon had a zero rating. I have done needlepoint projects forever and wanted something small to take on a trip out of town. The colored stamping on this canvas is so bad that there is no way to do the design. You would be better off trying to follow the picture on the front of the kit which is show here. Unfortunately not all of the picture comes to you. I am not surprised that another reviewer found an inadequate amount of thread and she also complained  about the stamped canvas. I actually tried a small amount of basket weave in the right upper corner and knew I could not continue as the stamping was impossible. I had added other things by the same manufacturer to my wish list and deleted all of them as one of the problems we are fighting with imports is the company never opening what they have gotten and looking at it. So it goes in this modern world.,1.0
"I bought this for zooming between my office and classroom at the university, and it was perfect.  It was so nice to bring office supplies, files, heavy dictionaries, etc... without worrying about shoulder stress from a heavy bag.

I had purchased the limited edition black leather one, so it was an expensive purchase.  Crop In Style just said that it was reasonable for the item to become unusable after two years.

"I first bought this kit many many years ago because at the time I thought it was cross stitch, was pretty, and would be fun to do.  This is not cross stitch, it's a variant on it where you do half cross stitches instead of full and use 6-ply instead of the fairly standard 2-ply to fill in the same space.  The kit contains your necessary colored thread, a needle, a 'pattern', and the stiff wide-hole mesh (not evenweave or aida cloth like cross stitch) with color pattern printed directly on it.

The 'pattern' contained in this kit is a strange organic camo-looking combination of various patterns to indicate which color goes where.  It is not printed in a grid format or in any way that you could even translate from paper to canvas.  The instructions tell you to follow the printed colors on the mesh and refer to the 'pattern' on the instruction sheet if needed.  Neither worked to instruct you in any way.

As a rule I generally don't trust patterns printed onto the material you will be crafting on because they never tend to be accurately printed; they're almost always crooked, or off by a millimeter or so.  This was no exception.  On the left and right ends of the printed pattern it was perfectly straight however on the top and bottom ends it was crooked.  So somehow a square pattern got printed in a trapezoidal fashion, very frustrating!

It also was printed too small and did not fully match the image of the completed project on the front of the packaging.  In fact, it was 3 rows too short from top to bottom.  But since the 'pattern' on the instruction sheet was no where near legible in order to USE it as a pattern, I was basically left with 5 hours in and no hope of finishing it.

I got the red and dark red border from the bottom right corner all the way up to the top right corner and was working my way across to the top left when I realized my red border at the top was far too close to the Chinese character in the middle.  The completed project image shows 5 rows between the Chinese character and the red border, but by following the printed pattern on the canvas, I wound up with only 2 rows between them, which if you notice the picture means the 'border' of the gold part would then become flush with the Chinese character.  I also counted to make sure I had the right amount of space below the western lettering and above the red border at the bottom.  The finished product image shows 4 rows and I had 4 rows of space, so the pattern was in fact printed too small on the canvas.

The Chinese character and the western lettering below it wound up being the best and easiest part of this entire kit.  The instructions indicate to find the middle of the printed pattern by measuring from the corners then following an actual grid-based pattern in the instructions to do the black part.  That part was perfect, went easy, and gave me no issue what-so-ever.  It was the only enjoyable part of what I did.

If the rest of the project had a proper grid-based pattern the way the Chinese character had, I would have had 0 problem with this kit.  In fact, I was enjoying the idea of basically doing cross stitch twice as fast because I was only doing half cross stitches (also called continental or basketweave) for the entire project.  However when I noticed the trapezoidal printing and later (after about 6 hours of work already put into it) the too-small printed color pattern, I just stopped and threw it in the trash because I knew it would be too much hassle and wouldn't look anywhere near as good as the picture indicates.

Simply put:

This kit is a nightmare.  It's got a terrible paper pattern, it's got a worse printed-on-canvas pattern.  The only way to do this kit is to ignore the color on the canvas, ignore the paper pattern, and just try to do it using the finished project picture as a guide; but I'm not sure that's even worth it.",1.0

"*** Update ***

I just bought a new candle after using up the old one.  A 3x6 ""100% pure raw beeswax candle.""  It's pale as a ghost, smells like parafin. That is... doesn't smell at all, or sorta chemical.  Hard to describe how disappointed I am.  Will not buy from Bluecorn Naturals again.  They're selling bad product now, but it used to be good.

Original review:

I burn this candle a few hours at a time as instructed, makes my apartment smell great.  They give you very descriptive instructions on how to make your candle last longer... things I've never heard before actually.  (More than just trimming a wick, something about pushing in the outer edges so it burns evenly.)  A company that cares.",1.0
"Candle was fine but it had a dent on the top, it wouldn't matter if it were for me but it is a gift and I don't want the person to think I got it at a discount since 25 bucks ain't cheap for a candle!  I am probably going to return it if I have the time.  Won't order from them again though.",1.0
"I order a 3""x6"" pillar and got a bunch of tea lights instead. False advertising and not worth the money",1.0
It puts itself out. First time using it and it just put itself out in a minute and I am unable to re-light it. The wick was too short. Unfortunately I'm two days past the return policy it just happened to be the first time I had a change to light it. I was very hopeful! What a waste of money. I couldn't find a way to contact the sellar and request an exchange. Will probably go elsewhere now so I don't risk wasting that much money again.,1.0
"Firmness okay, but edges were not trimmed and smooth.  Leaves an blemished surface to the clay.",1.0
"I also tried really hard to like this machine.  I have trouble reading and I thought it would be easier to read on the computer screen rather than a smaller screen.  I also am a home typist, so I thought I could maybe do my work and at the same time have a little enjoyment with my sewing.  The concept is good if the machine would only work.  I constantly get error messages saying that there is a 'hardware error' or that there is 'thread breakage.'  I have ruined more than half of the items I've tried to monogram.  I tried embroidering a small project today and broke three needles and tried 3 different types of thread.  Can't figure out what the problem is.  Other times when it works the work is beautiful.  I've only had it for a month and right now am real close to returning it.  The instructions are vague as well.",1.0
"I really wanted to like it. I tried hard to like this machine.

This thing sews beautifully, but if you want a sewing machine with a lot of great stitches, there are a lot of better choices at a lower price. For embroidery, it leaves so much to be desired that it's a shame to call this an embroidery machine.

The software is a little difficult and the manual doesn't do much to help you through it. There is a 90+ page manual on the installation CD but they don't bother to tell you that. It's a well kept secret. Once you've ingested that 90 or so pages, it's a snap to use the software.

The CE100 is pretty basic and the CE200 comes with digitizing software but you can buy it as a separate item for around $200 if you're set on buying the CE100.

As far as support for the machine, I'm sure you'll get it if you buy it from a dealer. I bought mine online and several months later, I am still having problems getting the machine to stitch out embroidery designs. Maybe I got a lemon? Maybe.

Whether I got a bad one or not is irrelevant. What really matters is the support I have gotten (or rather, haven't gotten) from Singer Support. Calls leave me on hold for over an hour until I have to hang up because my ear is numb. Daily emails go ignored and unanswered. Rare answers are sketchy and unrelated to the problems I'm having. I've resorted to hardcopy letters mailed with samples of the embroidery with notes written on it to show the poor stitch quality, the broken threads, the large loops (even with adjustments). So far? I have five months left on the warranty and Singer just doesn't feel the need to resolve anything.

So, basically, if you have a few hundred bucks and feel like dumping more money in after you've spent that, and you like being ignored, treated badly, and really would like a large blue and white electric paperweight, then this Singer Futura CE100 is for you.",1.0
"I DID own the Singer CE100 (until I returned it!) and speak from personal experience. I purchased this as an embroidery machine rather than a sewing machine and was sadly disappointed. There seems to be a communication problem between the software and the machine. My husband, who makes his living working with software and hardware, spent 15 hours trying to get it to communicate properly and consistently; finally he gave up in frustration.

Error messages don't always display and, when the machine would simply refuse to run, we were left having to guess at what the problem could be. On the other hand, sometimes the machine would just stop and an accurate error message--""thread broken""- would be displayed in spite of the fact that the machine was threaded properly and the thread was intact. This machine, at least in its embroidery capacity, is most certainly NOT user friendly and getting online help is a joke! To make matters worse, the manual instructions are unclear and inadequate. After three wasted days of hassle, we finally returned the machine for a refund.

A MUCH better choice, in my opinion, is the Brother 6500. It's a litle more expensive, but well worth it. The software is easy to use and the machine is a delight. It took us less than an hour to uncrate it, set it up, and get it working correctly. This is a much better value.",1.0
"I NEED THE SOFTWARE INSTALLATION CD Without that I can not use, you should bring the box but NO came in, not if I can help with this please, thanks!",1.0

I can't even use it! I sure hope I can get it... for free!! I feel like I've been robbed!",1.0
"The machine worked great at first, but the electronics went and their is no local repair shop.  The only trained shop authorized by Singer is in KY.  And from what several repair service people have told me this will happen every two years at a cost from $200 - $800.  This was a very costly mistake.",1.0
"I have had my Futura CE 100 for less than 3 years and have spent of the cost of the machine in repairs.  Very disappointed in this Singer product.  I am from Louisiana and the nearest facility that works on them is in Kentucky.  Getting help was really hard.  Then I finally got it fixed and bought a new computer and it won't upload the program.  Now I have to spend more $$$$$$ to get an upgraded program for it so that I can see if it will work for a little while again.  Never, never, never will I buy another one again.  Will switch to Brother",1.0
"This machine is a nightmare.  I have been sewing for 25 years or more.  I have had experience on more than my fair share of machines.  I hate this one.  HATE it.  I have used Brother, Janone, White, Kenmore and Singer.  I have never ever had the trouble I have had with this machine.  I have owned it for 5 years.  It has never worked right.  The embroidery is awful, I finally gave up.  In 5 years I have had it to the shop 12 times.  TWELVE.  The bobbin case breaks constantly.  It makes a horrible noise, the tension is never right, the stitches are beautiful, when they work.  I JUST got it back from the shop having it fixed (a different shop in a different state so I know it's the machine not the mechanic) and what do you know?  I have had it 10 hours, sewed two seams, it is back to making the same horrible noise and the bobbin case broke.  I have HAD it.  I have read similar reviews on other Singers and that's that.  I am ordering a different brand as soon as I finish this review.  I am SO disappointed.  This was a BIG investment for me and I was so excited and it has caused nothing but anxiety for me.  Do yourself a favor and skip this machine.  Skip this BRAND.

Seriously, my 11 year old daughter's ""Sewing Pretty with Hello Kitty"" Janone sewing machine is MUCH more durable and reliable than this Singer.",1.0
"OMG!  If I had known then what I know now!  This machine is way too sensitive and spends most of its time beeping warning messages because it doesn't like the thread, fabric or whatever else you try to do.  I'm an accomplished sewer and I can tell you, this machine isn't worth the money to spend most of your time fighting with it.  I wish I had bought something else.  So disappointed with this machine.  If you want to sew your way and not have the machine try to tell you what you can or can't do, buy something else.",1.0
"I bought this product used and with many pieces missing. The person who sold it to me was nice as could be and continues to send me the missing pieces, but I took it to a place that fixes sewing machines and he said he may not be able to fix it and that if he can it may be worth it to just buy a new machine... So, we shall see. I wish I could talk about ""how"" it works, but I haven't been able to get it there. If I do, I will tell you more.",1.0

"This machine sucks..big time. I should've read some of these reveiws before I bought it. I've owned it for almost 18 months and have had problems with it but for maybe 6 months. The bobbin case is very defective...there is a replacement part that I was never notified about when I bought it brand new. I spent money in 3 bobbin holders before I was told to buy the replacement part that was impossible to replace on my own since the screw was too tight. I was told by Singer reps to buy expensive Silky thread and bobbins. This machine was shipped back to the warranty center and they jipped me...it came back just as broken as I sent it. Now they're issuing me an second extended warranty letter to send it to another warranty center. I oretty much am going to get another machine. I make embroidered tops for the Summer and this has cost me alot of sales cause I can't make anything embroidered.

Invest in a more expensive machine. This is an over-priced sewing machine.",1.0
"My wife bought one of the CE-100s and after she couldn't get it running she turned it over to me, her resident tech-head with a PhD in computer science, to get the thing running. In the end it never ran at all.

My conclusion is that a pack of wolves could write better software and manuals. First you will find that the manual and install card give exactly opposite instructions on the order in which to plug in the USB and install the software (a critical detail for testy installs). After multiple installs using multiple clean machines I determined the correct order and was able to get the USB recognized. I visited a half-dozen forums and used every trick out there.

Ultimately it was all for nothing. The machine never did anything but light up and blink red all over - indicating error. The manual has a helpful list of error codes and tells you what to do based on the error code displayed.

Big problem: there is no error display! You will never know what error the machine thinks it has!

I tried methodically restarting, refreshing, and then undergoing the corrective actions for every possible error on the list - all to absolutely no effect. Ultimately I believe the problem is probably an internal mechanical one. I think the mix of ""1"" ratings with normal ratings is the luck of the draw whether you get a working machine or not, and the odds look to be below 50%.",1.0
"I had the CE100 for all of 3 days and it was just awful, I ended up exchanging it for the CE200 (so glad I did) The CE100, has some problems, first off, it doesn't sew, and considering this IS a sewing machine I find this to be a big problem!!  The bobbin thread will not lock your stitches, and on top of that the top thread breaks like every 4 stitches. And for those of you wondering I have sewn for over 15 years and believe me I called customer service, and they told me that the CE100 series has a problem with the bobbin casing cracking. Well call me crazy but why are they still selling the dumb thing then?? Seriously, I spent 3 very long days doing nothing but being upset, angry, and aggervated, not to mention saying ugly words and making up new ones when those didn't work:-) Save yourself from what I went through, just spend the extra money and get the CE200, once you get it and figure it out , it can be addictive! Good luck and happy sewing!!",1.0
"I purchased this machine from an on-line vendor in November 2005 and immediately the bobbin casing cracked.  After 4 months of run around I finally found a singer store that was able to drop ship a new bobbin casing to me.  It is now March 2006, and now that I have the new bobbin casing I find that the whole machine design is defective. Now it won't allow the needle thread to pick up the thread from the bobbin so that I can sew!  I have had this GOD AWFUL machine for 5 months and the only thing I have been able to do with it is stare at the damn thing while it collects dust!  I am furious!!",1.0
"Within hours of sewing on my new Singer CE-100 Futura Sewing and Embroidery Machine my entire project was ruined.  I was sewing with satin and a basic straight stitch when suddenly the bobbin housing popped out of the machine with such violent force that it broke the needle and jammed the satin so tightly into the machine that it had to be cut out of the machine.  At first I thought it was because perhaps the bobbin was not loaded or because the tension was off and chalked it up to my excitement to rush into a new project on my hour old machine, however, after closer examination, two more needles, a yard of $95.00 satin and a half of a spool of thread, I learned that the housing which is made of flimsy plastic was split at the screw.  The thread was getting caught in the split thus causing me to scrap my entire project, not to mention the time spent and emotional attatchment to my project... and now I am the disappointed owner of a useless machine.  What a complete waste of time and expensive lesson this has been!",1.0
"When they say ""You get what you pay for"", they mean it. I have bought and used 2 different Singer machines in the past 35 years. My last one was 25 years old. I decided I'd like to try one with embroidery.  As I had been very pleased with my previous Singers I bought this one, tried it for a couple weeks and I RETURNED IT!!!  Singer used to make a very good machine.  Not anymore.  The bobbin didn't wind evenly, the stitches are uneven, the tension was way off and wouldn't hold thru a project.  Also, the auto needle threader has a tendency to split the thread and it gets in your way.  The light is on the wrong side and doesn't illuminate the sewing area.  The needle area is very confined and small making it hard to manuvere your hands and fingers when changing needles, threading, etc.  Now that's just the basic sewing experience. The embroidery was a chore to understand and set up and the stitching is not as nice as other machines.  Save your money and buy a more expensive machine.  I payed more and bought a Husqvarna and it's worth the price and beyond.",1.0
"My daughter asked for one thing from Santa this year: a kid's sewing machine.  I purchased this machine because:

2. it carried the respectable name SINGER, so I (wrongly) assumed that it would at least work.

This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it.  It cuts NOTHING.  This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something.  It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle.  The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch.  There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together.  We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking!  The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING.  My daughter just walked away.

"My son (age 6) received this as a Christmas gift and he was so excited to use it. Right out of the box, I spent hours unjamming it, rethreading it, fiddling with the tension to get stitches to be balanced (never achieved that), unjamming it again, rethreading it again, tinkering with the bobbin, retinkering with the bobbin, on and on and on. He would sew on it for 5 minutes and it would jam. I would adjust it, and then the tension would go. He'd sew for 5 minutes and the needle would unthread itself. It finally seemed to be sewing alright, and he was able to sew for maybe 30 minutes and then we noticed the needle was no longer picking up the bobbin thread. I spent 45 minutes or so trying to figure out why it would no longer pick up the bobbin thread. The bobbin was wound exactly as instructed, the bobbin was placed in the case exactly as instructed. Finally, we gave up. My son was really sad, as he had a bunch of half-sewn projects. I was sad too, as I had to tell the person who gave it to us that it broke already.

"This 'sewing machine' has been nothing but disappointment for my daughter and frustration for me.

First, the protective casing keeps you from being able to access the needle to thread it. It took about 10 minutes on the threading, even using the needle threader--which broke about 5 minutes into the effort so I had to get another one.

Second, once we finally got it threaded, the stitches didn't hold.

Third, when the needle breaks, there's no way to replace it.

Don't buy this thing unless you want to make a child very sad. And a parent very frustrated.",1.0
I purchased two of them and never could get either one of them to sew. The needle came out of the first one and while trying to change it something broke.

"This was a big disappointment.  I got it for my daughter for Christmas after a woman in a local fabric store recommended it.  My daughter is 8 and loves to sew little projects by hand.  It was a waste of money - had I spent $25-30 more, she could have a real machine that would grow with her (or work at all!).

The test piece of fabric stuck in the machine and took us some time to get it out.  Once we finally did, my son tried to sew a little.  That also got stuck and when we finally got it out, the stitch unraveled before our eyes.  It says you need to do a finishing stitch with a needle and thread (translation: parents need to do it), but the stitch doesn't even stay in long enough to let you do that.  I would not recommend this product at all.  Spend a little more and get something that works.",1.0
"I bought this machine for my 7yr old daughter thinking it would be a good little starter machine,this thing is just a toy it didn't even sew a stitch and the noise it makes is horrible. Just get a regular sewing machine which is what I did,don't waste any time or money on this thing.",1.0
"I would have liked to know that this sewing machine didn't really work and was simply a toy (a pretty expensive toy at that).  We've tried every way possible to do a simple chainlink stitch doll pillow, but the fabric gets bunched up in the machine and the stitches just fall out.  I do have my own sewing machine and purchased this because my daughter always wants to sew when I sew so I thought this would be perfect to show her how it works (and let her sew on her own in a limited way).  I've followed every trouble shooting tip and nothing has made it work.  It's a cute toy, but please do not be misled to think that you will be able to show your child how to sew on it because it does not work and is pretty expensive for just a toy.  I would not recommend this.",1.0
"I purchased this for my 8-yr-old daughter for her birthday...not very user-friendly at all, and definitely not practical.  A child can learn the basics of making a basic stitch, but it's not reliable, doesn't work consistently when you push the pedal.  The pedal is just a little plastic thing that doesn't stay put on the floor, so you constantly have to reach down to turn it around/flip it over and hold it in place while you put your foot on it.  The machine makes a wretched loud sound while stitching.  I would recommend purchasing a regular basic sewing machine over this one any day.",1.0
"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I would have saved me and my kid the disappointment.

I love to sew. My 6 year old daughter loves to watch. So for Christmas, I bought this and a fantastic sewing book in hopes of embarking on a new journey together. Since she is so young, I wasn't entirely comfortable with her sewing on my machine. I wanted something like this as a good intro.

This toy does not work well. It comes pre-threaded. Once that thread runs out, you're done. It is VERY difficult to thread this machine. The needle guard requires that you use a threader, but its nearly impossible to get it through. Once you get it going, count to 10 because, chances are, you will be rethreading it again. This machine only holds a tiny spool of thread. I ended up using my ""Sidewinder"" to make tiny spools for this machine. Although, that too was a waste of time, because this thing has been collecting dust because neither me or my kid want to deal with it.

It is nice that it runs on batteries - fewer cords for her to potentially tug.

Overall, I wouldn't bother. If you want to introduce your kid to sewing, get an inexpensive, no-frills, but solid sewing machine. All it needs to do is sew a straight line.  It won't be cute and pink like this one, but it will be less frustrating in the long run.",1.0
"This is the worst waste of $25 - you'd do better giving it to your child to use to purchase penny candy with. Or flush it, because then you'd at least save yourself the frustration. I didn't buy this toy through Amazon - I wouldn't have, because otherwise I would have read the reviews - but picked it up on spur of the moment at the store. The machine is impossible to thread and that factor alone is more frustrating than you would believe. Add to that the disappointment of a 5 year old being unable to sew and it was one of the worst purchases I've made.",1.0
"Yes, it is a piece of junk.  Yes, the people who brought it to market should be put in jail and made to eat with defective plastic silverware.  But if you want the stitch to lock, ignore the instructions and cut the thread short, approx. 1/2"" long, before hand turning the needle ""anti-clockwise"".  This will leave the thread on the bottom side of your fabric in a partially locked position.  Good luck!",1.0
This sewing machine is garbage.  Of course the stiches unravel--you only have the one thread.  There is no bobbin or bottom thread.  The real issue is the machine itself.  This is more than impossible to re-thread the needle.  Big disappointment for the Singer name.  Don't buy this toy!,1.0
Wish I could give this piece of trash zero stars!!!  I also wish I would have read reviews before purchasing!!!!!  The only good review on here is a total fake!!!!,1.0
"I too bought the machine since it was simple and ""Singer"" brand. But it's horrible. In theory, to ""lock"" the stitches the instructions say to sew the item, remove the item from the machine leaving extra thread, and then use a needle to sew a few stitches back. Even if I do all of that, the middle stitches come loose. My 7 year old just wanted to make simple crafts but this was a headache. I'll just let her use my real Singer machine - it was FAR easier.",1.0
"We were so excited when my daughter opened her sewing machine at Christmas.  We read the directions, and expected not much more than a simple straight stitch.  What a disappointment.  It won't stitch right, even for me.  She is extremely patient and very mature for her age, and yet simply trying to thread the needle make ME want to chuck this toy out the window.  Singer, I am so sad to say that you made a piece of junk, and I will NO LONGER BUY SINGER products!!",1.0
"as everyone else said, this machine does not work. i wish i'd read reviews before i bought it. i just saw it in the store and thought it would be so fun for my daughter to get so sew along side me. PLEASE don't waste your money on this toy.",1.0
"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. Wish I could rate it 0 stars. Like many of you, I mistakenly thought the brand Singer meant I couldn't go wrong. Found it at a craft store and then for an even better price at a discount store. My mother in law, who is an excellent seamstress, could not figure out why this machine did not have a bobbin. The pedal not reaching the floor is another problem. Is it meant to be played with on the floor, and therefore a toy, not an actual machine as claimed?! Battery operated without electric backup makes no sense at all. The worst part is explaining to my daughter who received it from Santa and was so eager to start her first real sewing project. I will return it and not award Singer with another purchase for my 6 year old. Instead I am considering the Easy Stitcher.",1.0
"I recently purchased this product for my 7 year old daughter.  She wanted to learn how to sew and I thought this sewing machine would actually work since it was a Singer product. Well, I wish I would have read the reviews instead of buying on impulse.  We tried making a purse and it was a horrible experience. The machine does not work.  The only think that works is the pedal.  The stitches unravel as soon as she stops sewing.  I became frustrated as we tried to stitch the same piece over and over again.  The machine is awful! It was a waste of money and it's going back to the store.  I am giving the product a one rating because she did understand how to make a simple purse.  I will be researching other machines. I will make sure there is a bobbin this time!  Save yourself the headache and don't waste your money on this one!  I'm avoiding plastic this time.",1.0
"This machine will not hook the thread underneath. There is a fix which I successfully performed on my neice's machine. There is nothing worse than an enthusiastic little girl who gives up on sewing because of dashed expectations over which they have no control. In order to fix the problem, you will need a small phillips head screwdriver and a razor blade or an exacto knife. Carefully unscrew the seven screws holding the machine together, there is one under the handle, and lay the machine in half. The handle and the foot plate will most likely fall off, so watch carefully how things are going together. Once the machine is open, take the foot plate out of the machine and turn it over. You will see the hook mechanism which is held on by two screws. You will notice that one of the screws is in a slot instead of a hole. This is where the adjustment takes place. The screw is more to one end of the slot than the other. You can see the ring left by the head of the screw on the slot once you unscrew it and take the screw out. You need to extend the slot slightly more in that direction, to be able to adjust the hook closer to the needle when it descends. Use the razor blade to carefully slice a bit of plastic off the end of the slot, about 1/16 inch. Reassemble, adjusting all the way to the end. Carefully put the machine back together. Make sure the handle is in its stowed position, the crossed wires are under their tape and the power wire is laying in its exit hole. You may need to turn the machine upside down slightly as you are settling it back together in order to keep the foot plate in place. Tighten all the screws down and rethread the needle. This is another misunderstanding. The needle can only be threaded one way. Lower the presser foot and raise the needle to its highest position. You will easily see the hole through the slot in the side of the safety cover. Thread from left to right. Once the thread is through, you will notice that the thread is through the right hand slot of the safety cover and cannot easily be brought between the toes of the foot and underneath to the back. So,raise the foot and lower the needle until the eye of the needle is visible beneath the foot. Use your needle threader to grab the loop on the right side of the eye and pull the thread down out of the safety cover, between the toes and underneath the foot, drawing it to the back. Now try your stitching again. Any questions, feel free to e-mail me at bridgetherr@gmail.com. Good luck.",1.0
"This was a deeply disappointing experience for my daughter (and for me).  Whoever at Singer approved putting that respectable name on this piece of junk ought to be fired.  As others have said, even the pre-sewn stitches on the piece of fabric pulled out instantly, and it was not possible to produce any stitches that held.  Do not waste your time or money on this pitiful piece of garbage.",1.0
"Do not buy this!  Needle is terrible difficult to thread, can't get it to stitch after working with it for an hour.  Such a disappointment for my daughter.  Follow the old adage, you get what you pay for.  Singer should be embarrassed to have their name on this.",1.0
"My daughter begged and begged for this toy.  We'd read the reviews, and hoped that somehow, we'd have better luck.  How does one explain to a 4-year-old that she's not getting her favorite thing because it had bad reviews?  So we had to see for ourselves.

She was so excited to set it up and start making pajamas for her baby doll.  The stitches don't stay in long enough for me to tie them securely as instructed.  We've tried rethreading the machine to no avail.  We will be returning this, but I am not sure what to get for a replacement.  I love the idea of a plastic protective cover over the needle to prevent injuries, but if she never uses the machine, that's not a very helpful feature.

Explaining the rating:

How fun is it?  She loves pressing the foot pedal and watching the needle go.  Too bad it does nothing but feed the fabric through.

How educational is it?  Not at all.  My idea of an educational toy is one that shows cause and effect.  This does not work as promised, and teaches her nothing.

How durable is it?  Nothing is visibly broken, but it doesn't do anything.  More poor design than poor workmanship so far.  But I haven't thrown it against the wall yet to see if it'll break under expected usage.

How do I rate it?  Would be zero stars, but that's not allowed.",1.0
"No fun to have your child discouraged. The only lesson this provided me was to NEVER add something to my childs wish list that I have NOT researched.  Geesh!  Who would have thought a childs sewing machine would be so difficult. What is the point REALLY?  Singer has the perfect opportunity to prepare for future customers, but NOT like this.

This was a gift for my daughter and she was so patient, preparing and reading all the details only for it to come un threaded after the fourth stitch.  Have rethreaded and followed ALL trouble-shooting.

No fun. Durable, only in the fact that is doesn't do anything so, it will last forever doing NOTHING!  Overall, the toy is a gimmick and only provides a educational value of what NOT to spend your money on.  What a waste of time.",1.0
"This product, as stated in the title, is terrible. I had never used a sewing machine before so I figured a child's one would work even for a beginner. Terrible idea. The stitching has always ended up too loose and comes apart altogether. I would not recommend this to anyone; it is a waste of money.",1.0
"Please please please do not waste your money on this thing.  We purchased it on clearance, thinking it would be great for our 5 year old daughter to sew with while Mommy sews.  Yeah, no.  It is INCREDIBLY noisy, and doesn't work at all.  I am very familiar with sewing machines and machinery in general and this piece of junk is worthless.  If you can get it to make a stitch at all it doesn't hold after you take it off of the machine - it instantly falls out.  Save your money and see if you can find a 2 stitch sewing machine at a yard sale or something for probably the same amount of money.  I ended up just breaking out my old 2-stitch Singer for my daughter to sew on since my she was so disappointed that this piece of ^&%* didn't work.",1.0
"My grandniece wants to sew--bought this with her birthday money.  The stiches do not hold--just unsecured loops through the fabric--unravelled instantly.  Set-up, especially threading, is extrememly difficult.  she even tried exchanging it for another thinking maybe she got a lemon--the 2nd was the same.  She was sorely disappointed. And it was a big waste of everyone's time as we all struggled to try to make it work.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!",1.0
"As everyone else has said, this thing is horrible.  My daughter was sooo excited about sewing, but it won't be happening on this thing.  If I can't find a kid's machine that works, I'll just teach her on mine.  I just get nervous about little fingers and fast moving needles.

I had a kid's machine when I was little, but I don't remember the kind. It was red and yellow, I believe and had some 70's flowers. It was purchased in the late 80's at a thrift store, so no clue when it was made, does anyone know what this machine could be? It worked well.",1.0
"I, (the Mom) have been sewing for 20+ years and know the ins and outs of sewing machines very well. We've followed the instructions perfectly and this thing simply DOES NOT WORK! It has consumed a huge amount of time and producted an even larger amount of frustration! My 8-year-old would be far better off learning to sew on a basic, possibly used, introductory, REAL sewing machine-- which is preceisely what I intend to purchase after I throw this piece of junk away.",1.0

"Bought this machine for my daughter.  Yep, it was cheap, but I thought at least she can start somewhere and it had a needle guard so she wouldn't accidentally get her fingers under the needle.  This thing NEVER EVEN SEWED!  It would stitch, but the stitches always came out.  Not sure how it can sew if there is no bobbin.  I went over and over the directions trying to figure out if there was something I was missing, but nope I wasn't !  So it went back and they almost didn't take it back b/c I threw the box out!  Definitely save yourself time money and aggravation and DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT!

"I bought this sewing machine for my granddaughter for Christmas, It is awful.  Almost impossible to thread the needle, It took me 15 minutes, my granddaughter couldn't even thread it with her small hands.  I have been sewing for 35 years and have had many singer sewing machines.  Could not believe singer put their name on this piece of junk.  The tension is useless, does not hold stitches and jams every minute.  It is very hard to believe that the piece of sample sewing that comes with the machine was actually done on this machine.  Such false advertisement.  My granddaughter wants nothing to do with this and has discouraged her from want to learn to sew.  SINGER PLEASE TAKE THIS MACHINE OFF THE MARKET.....",1.0
"This machine is a constant struggle.  We bought it for our six year old daughter.  We knew she would need some help, but unfortunately it is impossible for her to use this - it is a struggle for adults to use the machine.  The stitches are either so loose they pull right out, or so tight that the machine jams.  Threading is a five minute ordeal.

How disappointing. My daughter was so excited to try sewing - now she thinks of it as just some noisy machine that is too difficult for her to use - too difficult for Daddy and Mommy to use!  This one will be returned - I will gladly pay just another $50-$60 for a real sewing machine that my daughter can actually use.  When we buy another machine, the two of us can work on re-sewing the dress that has already fallen apart after being sewn together with this disappointing Singer product.",1.0
Completely useless. Stitches come out immediately. Very loud. Cord is not long enough to reach anything. Comes with the smallest piece of fabric possible.,1.0
"Like other people I was hooked in by the price and the fact that it's SINGER, and my young daughter only wanted to do some basic sewing, nothing fancy.

We got this for Christmas for our daughter and thought she'd be able to make something small - no such luck.

Luckily we had purchased a few other things on her Christmas list.  But we're taking this thing back and will gladly double or triple our budget for something that works.",1.0
"I've owned Singer machines before, so finding this 1/2 off seemed like a nice idea for my 8 year old daughter.
NO!!
The needle is exceedingly difficult to thread, even with a threader.  The design does not allow for the out thread to be placed easily.
The ""Thread Tension"" is worthless as it appears to do nothing.
And the foot advance is so wonky it won't even lay a straight line.

Seriously do not waste your money on this machine.

"Singer Chain Stitch Sewing Machine Set
This sewing machine sewed maybe 5 stitches before stopping, I put in new batteries and it sewed two stitches then never again.

"Thank goodness I purchased this product on clearance!  It's a terrible first sewing machine for anxious little ones who just want to sew like a grown up!

All of the past posts have said it all!  I can't tell you how horrible the disappointment was for my little girl.  The worst part was that she thought that the fault was hers when it was this horrendous pretense of a Singer sewing machine!

After an hour of frustration, I told my little one that we would be shopping for something else to teach her sewing on.  As for this one, I told her we could yank the thread and she could ""pretend"" to sew on it.  The action, noise, and semblance of the real deal will appeal to her imaginary play!

Please don't bother with this sewing machine!

p.s.  Shame on you, Singer....  for allowing this awful toy have your name on it!  You are souring the sewing experience for the seamstresses of tomorrow!",1.0
"This ""sewing machine"" is a total waste of money.  We received one as a gift for my 6 year old daughter.  It never worked, not a single stitch.  It is poorly made and hard to use.

"I am an avid sewer and have a small business selling my handmade items all sewn with an adult Singer machine. So when my daughter received the child's Singer Chain Stitch machine as a gift for her 5th birthday she truly felt like she could follow in Mommy's footsteps. It brings tears to my eyes when I see how absolutely frustrated and defeated she has become trying to sew on this poorly constructed, poorly functioning plastic machine. It is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to thread and often takes in excess of 20 minutes to finally get the thread through the needle that is almost completely blocked by the safety presser foot. Once it is finally threaded, the thread easily slips out. The chain stitch is so loose it barely holds the fabric together and forget trying to turn anything inside out! The project will literally fall apart. All of this has turned what should be a creative bonding experience into a disappointment. I never thought the Singer name would be the name that turned my daughter off on sewing. Singer needs to be alerted to the fact that this product is a blight on the Singer name.",1.0

It totally sucked to throw away this kit with so much paint left but I couldn't handle the aftermath any longer. Buy a different brand ;)",1.0

"The paints would not soften and were like colored hockey pucks.

"I ordered this face paint set to use for Halloween. Im not sure if I just happened to get old stock, but the paint was very, very stiff, and I had to add some olive oil to it just to get some on my brush. The set came with two brushes, one slightly stiffer than the other, and I was able to use that to scrape some of the face paint out. The other brush was unusable and shed hair everywhere. The face sponges that were included were unable to scrape up any of the paint, so I ended up rubbing the paints vigorously with my fingers to incorporate some oil and then using the stiff brush for the application. Its too bad because this product has really good reviews and thats why I purchased it. I really wanted to like it! On the plus side, once I mixed in some olive oil to loosen the paint, I was able to apply it with difficulty, avoiding a total Halloween fail,  but I would not purchase this brand again.",1.0
Dry and nothing worked. Had to throw it away,1.0
The paint was as hard as a rock and I was not able to use it at all for ny child's birthday party. Disappointed because the reviews for this were great.,1.0
I am not impressed with this at all. No way was the example pictures done with the same stuff. Tried it out on my kids before Halloween next week. It doesnt go on smooth at all. Ended up using my fingers just to get it on their faces. Will not buy again.,1.0
"I bought this face paint for my son after he got super excited about his face painting at a fall fair we went to. We received it and right away, he wanted to get to painting his face. He painted his face and then washed it off shortly after and he seemed fine (other than the fact that the green paint had stained his face yellow and he now looks like he has jaundice). Anyway, later that night, he complained of a headache. He never gets headaches and so my husband asked me about the face paint and if it was safe or had heavy metals in it, etc. We spent a while online trying to find out what ingredients were in it and came across a website saying snazaroo face paint does, indeed have lead and other heavy metals in it. Snazaroo has 0.5 ppm of lead, specifically.  My husband was still up at night looking this up while I was trying to fall asleep, and he told me that he was reading that the UK considers anything above 20ppm of lead in face paint toxic, if I'm recalling correctly. But the EPA does not allow anything higher than 0.015ppm in drinking water. It should be noted, however that there is no safe blood level of lead in children. If it is detected, it is not safe. It can effect every organ and can get in through the mouth as well as skin. My son's headache was most likely coincidental. But at this point, I am tired of trying to figure this out and I am not interested in flirting with something that has known heavy metals in it at all. It's just an unnecessary risk and unnecessary exposure, so I'm throwing the set out and am going to say no to face paint from now on.",1.0
"I ordered this to do face painting at my son's 3rd birthday. The paint quality was terrible. It said to just add water, but the color consistency was worse than crayola water colors. I had to put so much water on them just to get a little color on the brush that the paint ran once it was on his face. I ended up just wiping it off with a warm, soapy towel but the green left his face stained yellow. I had to scrub it to get off so he didn't look weird in his pictures. He was not a fan. Unfortunately I ordered it in advance of his party and I can't return it now.",1.0
The sponges and brushes are made of cheap materials and the paints dried out within minutes of opening them. We weren't able to finish the face paint for my daughter's birthday party. Kids were very disappointed.,1.0
This product was recommended to me by my sister who said she uses it all of the time. I ordered it and my granddaughters and I used Snazaroo Face Paint Ultimate Party Pack. We painted each other's faces. The paint went on well and we used every color. The problem was washing it off. It was difficult for all 3 of us to get it off of our face. 4 washings later and I still haven't gotten all off. Not happy.,1.0

Not worth the money. Paints are too thin. Don't show up at all.,1.0
Just received this in the mail and kids were excited to give it a try. As I was applying the green dinosaur design to my child's face i washed my hands and realized it wasn't washing off.

I got this set due to the great reviews. I decided to test the paints in advance to my daughter's birthday- thank goodness! Colors are very translucent even using a rather thick layer -which does not dry fast enough to enable using other colors without creating a horrible smudge.

"I received this as a gift for my daughter's 4th birthday. A friend started painting faces at the party (which was outside with a bounce house). Their faces looked awesome just painted, but the paint quickly smeared all over their hands, arms, the bounce house...everywhere, anything they touched. It does not dry to where it can be touched, it stays kind of wet so it smears easily. Also with the jumping and sweating it helped to make it run, too. My friends text me pictures of their kids the next day, one with swollen eyes & face and the other with a rash on her cheeks. My daughter didn't have a problem but I wiped hers off at the end of the party because she was sweating it off too much so it was a mess. My daughter didn't have a reaction but the paint smeared so bad I can't see ever wanting to use it again. I hate to waste but I'm throwing the kit in the trash. I would not recommend this kit.",1.0

If you are doing a church or b-day gig with non professional face painters this is probably okay for a first endeavor into this field.

I also used some of their glitter and their paint brushes, all of which worked great.

HOWEVER.

There is a non-profit online , safe cosmetics, that has produced a report about the safety of these paints. Please investigate on your own!

Snazaroo has responded on their website, but I remain a bit skeptical. They state 'hazardous materials are beyond classification limit'. In the second statement Snazaroo just says it adheres to the 'current legislative limits' for lead, nickel and cobalt.

 We opened it and half of the paints were dried up, the ones that had film over top of them were okay (four colors) and one of the glitters was okay. The other glitter was useless. We ended up going to Wal-mart and picking up a kit there. Luckily it was Halloween or we would have been SOL. This product had a lot of good reviews which is why we chose it.

The box doesn't close properly (warped?), the locking mechanism is a simple snap, and the screws used to secure the snap and hinges have screws that are not properly screwed in.

If you attempt to screw them in properly, it will probably snap the wood since the wood is extremely brittle. The pictures are misleading. The snap is silver, not gold. There is no blue velvet inlay. There is hardened glue that oozed out and there is extra spacing between the pieces of wood. If you want a cigar box, spend real money on better built box or a legit humidor. This looks and feels like a 99 cent store quality box.

I measured my X-Acto blades at 0.65mm thick and these flimsy things measure 0.36, just a little more than half as thick. THAT'S why they're so flimsy.

C'mon folks, we're not talking about a huge price difference here!!! Spend just a few more dollars and get real X-Acto knives. I'd already opened this set so can't return it and had to spend the money again to buy an actual X-Acto set. Learn from my mistake.",1.0

Every one of the blades in this set were dull. Could barely cut paper with them. I do not recommend purchasing this product.,1.0
"I would not recommend this product even if it was free. The handles claim to be aluminum but are so weak it might as well be plastic and therefore cannot fully grip the blades. Because of this it is a safety hazard and this product should be removed from Amazon.

Cons:
It came with 5 rusty blades 8 dull ones
Low quality
Safety hazard

Pros:
It fills the empty space in my trash can.",1.0
"I knew I was buying a cheap ""hobby"" knife set but I didn't expect this low of quality. I mean seriously this is the worst set ever...and it's not worth fighting. All the blades have rust all over them, not because of water, because of oils from someone's hand. DO NOT BUY!!!",1.0
"For this price I wasn't expecting much. However, I wasn't expecting the blue color of the box to get all over my hands.  I ordered these for a one time simple project, but the fact I ended up with blue color everywhere made a mess of it.  When I opened the package the lid came off the box, so worthless as a container.  I don't know why they didn't just put them in a simple, clear plastic box.  The blades looked like old, used blades.",1.0
Cheaply made.,1.0
Not worth it. The blades fell out no matter how much it was tightened. Used once then they broke.,1.0
"Case was broken, won't stay shut. Thought I would need for my cameo but I never use it",1.0
"This is extremely awful. You get exactly what you pay for. For one thing, the latch on the poor quality box it all comes in broke within 2 days. When I attempted to cut foam board with the tool that has the grip, it actually broke the plastic part that holds the blade, as they are not made of metal, as advertised, and it took an extremely large amount of pressure to cut anything. Overall, very bad purchase, i wouldn't even recommend buying this on a budget, just get a single X-Acto for a couple dollars more.",1.0
"You know the cheap $1 tools in the bins at the local hardware store? This kit hopes to move up to that level some day. Mostly plastic, discolored, cheap blades, flimsy holders. Plastic box that never manages to close right. I bought this to compare to the more expensive X-acto set I bought. I definitely feel better about the X-actor set. The best thing about the set is the magnetic strip that holds the blades in place.",1.0
"Abysmally bad.  ]I'm editing this review because Amazon came through and refunded.  Do be aware that they are no-return though.  Actually:  Don't be aware of anything except that there is no reason on Earth to buy these.]

These are complete junk.  Not worth $1 (psst, they're imported by ""Dollar Empire"", so that's what they actually value this garbage at.)

So dull they won't cut paper but rather tear it.  The handles are so wimpy they flex when I cut [tear] with them.  They're simply not safe, they won't even firmly grip the blade.

[Amazon did NOT ask me to alter this review; they refunded based solely on an email I sent them.  I'm editing only for intellectual honesty]",1.0
cover is too much sharp so my finger was injured. cheap one is just cheap thing,1.0
"I wasn't very happy with this product. First the case won't shut. Second the tools felt sticky and the magnet that kept the blades to the top of the case had fallen off. Third(AND probably the most important) I am a little concerned by the warning on the back of the container "" warning for California users ( thinking ok I don't live in California but I will read it anyways) pursuant to California Health and safety code 25249.6,  the distribution of this product warns you that this product may contain substances know to the state of California to cause cancer and/or reproductive toxicity"" WTF!!!!!!

DULL! Right of the box! Complete waste of money!!,1.0
cheap.. cheap.. cheap..,1.0
"Pack was already opened when I got it, but stapled back together. The blades were all scratched up and dirty. The plastic blue case doesn't even close. Magnetic strip falling halfway off. Health hazard,  not safe.",1.0
these are an utter waste of money. this type of knife is used for precision work and the slightly better than garbage build quality make that impoossible with this product. to add insult to injury the case doesnt even snap shut. if your building a model you'd be better off getting a good excto knife with less variety. youll probably only use the #11 blade and maybe a chisel tip.,1.0
"I used mine for one of my classes and within one week all of the handles broke and were completely ruined, but I guess I got what I paid for.",1.0
"I never really write reviews, but this one is a little frustrating. I bought this a while ago for a particular project i was working on, since the case is plastic it came broken in half. I wasent that worried about it and i was going to store in my craft area anyway. My problem lies that i went to use this the other day and its just cheap! the blades do not stay and it will not cut straight, which is the opposite of what this product is suppose to do :( I found a better one at michaels for a cheaper price and better quality.",1.0
The product is not expensive but is not of high quality. I would not buy it again. I will buy a better one and throw this one away. I would not use it.,1.0
just awful. the blades wable. The case doesnt look like it was made to even close (and it doesnt). Feels extremely cheep.,1.0
Cheap flimsy waste of money!,1.0
"Piece of Cheap Junk!! Don't Buy! Handles look like metal but they are all made of plastic, no metal except blades.",1.0
"This is truly the biggest piece of junk I have ever gotten. DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!! Spend a little more and buy a metal set. They say the box is plastic.....so are the handles for the blades. Christmas morning when I opened this it fell apart. ALL of the handles are broken, they fell apart into pieces, and there is no way to tighten the blades into the handles. The blades all look like they were used as well. This is the first time I have written a neg review on any product. I cannot stress enough how horrible this set is. This set is very dangerous and someone can truly get hurt using it. STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!",1.0
"Pile of junk. Very cheap and break almost instantly. Don't waste your money.

*Update* After posting my issues in a haste, Sona Enterprises refunded my money no questions asked. It's riveting to see a company take pride in their name and make things right with their customers. Highly recommend this company as a whole and with minor improvements, this blade set would be very good.",1.0
All plastic. The blade is the only metal but even that is cheap. The blades are not sturdy. I got mine and one handle came broken the other cracked and the magnet strip that holds the extra blades isn't even attached to the box. I could of found something at the dollar store that was better quality,1.0
It was not worth the price,1.0
Crap.  Don't waste your time.  Spend the extra money for X-acto brand.  I couldn't even use these with X-acto brand blades.,1.0
The plastic box is practically garbage and the blades were rusty.  It was in the worst quality i could have possibly recieved it in.,1.0
Junky piece of crap...DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,1.0
"This realy upset me, the box cover broke rite when I took it out of the put back used package.

"Flimsy blades. Won't stay in holders. Won't even stay on magnetic holder strip.,",1.0
this was a crappy product. the blades are very flimsy. the box broke upon opening. I should have paid attention to the reviews for this product. will never buy again.,1.0
Parts and box broke son after use,1.0
"This product is cheaply made.  The blades a dull compared to Xacto and are not held firmly by the light weight, hollow handles.  Don't waste your money on this product.  Put the $5 towards and name brand set.",1.0
Junk... was broken when it arrived so I can only imagine after I actually used it. Sent it back immediately.,1.0
I have owned this for about 5 years now and I don't know why I haven't thrown it away. I regret not investing in something more expensive and sturdier. I have only been able to use it a few times and then gave up on it.,1.0
"I wish I would have other reviews. Knives and blades actually seem ok. They cut thin injects fine, which is what I wanted. But the case, it is so cheap. I sent it on my bed while opening it, then pillow. The dye isn't fixed in the plastic. Transferred immediately to the cotton. I didn't notice it on my hand, but know it is on my wall and door frame. Cotton washed out. Nothing yet can take out the dye on the wall and white frame of door. They should have mentioned bio-hazard in the description. (Run away)",1.0

SORRY FOR THE BAD REVIEW BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.",1.0
"The plastic box leach color. After handling it once, it stained my hands blue. God only knows what is the color product that stains... The box also crumbled by the time that I notice the staining on my hands. The hinge broke completely. A bad plastic mix and color added must be the culprit. Sent for refund. Amazon should stop allowing these things to be sold. It diminish the brand.",1.0
Does not hold any of the blades design is poor,1.0
"Chemical blue of case comes off & stains everything.  Will not wash off case.  Thin & cheap.  Concerned about what chemical residues are left from very apparent uncontrolled and unregulated manufacturing process.  Toss & reorder is only proper recourse.  Subjectively---does not seem safe.

As I remember from core classes the tempering & annealing process is very exacting.  Timing & temperatures are precise. This exacting nature is required to get an edge that holds sharpness while not shattering.  If improper, the shards can go everywhere. Like your eyes.  Way to thin & brittle to have been done properly.  Risky to use.",1.0
"These blades get so dull, so fast, it's hardly worth it. Went through every single blade on one project, cutting FABRIC.",1.0
Garbage. Case was broken upon arrival. Tools don't hold blades. Save your money. I should have read the reviews first.,1.0
LOW QUALITY,1.0
Blades are ok quality but soaked in oil presumably to keep them from corroding. Box is super cheap and doesn't latch. Blue comes off on your hand as though you just had blue chalk in them. Unfortunately I didn't notice this until I'd handled a bunch of things in my home. Now there are semi permanent blue stains all over including on my new $40 otterbox iPhone case.,1.0
You get what you pay for when you buy these. when i received mine one of the handle's was already broken and wouldn't take a blade. The red one rubs the color off in my hand turning my hand red as well. They are made of cheap plastic and after only a few uses none of the blade handles are usable any more. I would definitely recommend spending a little more and getting a better quality set.,1.0
"I received my set of blades and just opened them. Firstly, the packaging is stapled together so that was the first clue that the product is not ""new"". Once opened, the blades are covered in a some sort of oily substance. Actually, not only the blades but the handles as well. The red handle is discolored and has stains on it. Horrible! I have not even used the """"used"" blades as yet but I am very disappointed in this seller.",1.0
"You get what you pay for, true.  But they shouldn't have even bothered to make this set.  There is nothing positive to say about it so I won't go into any details suffice to say the blue carrier box snapped in two the very first time I opened it.",1.0
"The picture is so misleading. When receiving the set, I was so disappointed to find out that the components (aside from the blades) were ALL plastic. Also, when trying to cut PAPER, the blades would not stay in, to save it's little, cruddy, life. Secondly, the red handle you see? Whatever paint was used on it completely rubs off on your hands, and stains anything and EVERYTHING (it was only held for a few minutes). Finally, when twisting on a new blade, the handle flat-out BROKE! Just stop yourself, before you wreck yourself, and DON'T BUY this set! What a joke!",1.0
"When I received it box was broken, very flimsy items, found out later you can get it for three dollars at Harbor freight",1.0
"I can't conceive of a bigger piece of crap that these knives.  Don't buy unless you want to cut your fingers.  Cheap plastic holders for blades will not stay in handles and blades just slip out.  Sure they are cheap, but it is money thrown away since these are unusable.  Seller is POS too because they want me to pay postage to return.  Wish I had spend the $5 on another set name brand Xacto knives.",1.0
"Rust on blades clearly seen through packaging. Blades bend with very little pressure. Handles have very sharp, unfinished edges where held that could cut fingers, and the box doesn't close properly. Completely useless at any price and in the trash.",1.0
Very poor.  The plastic carrying case arrived with a hinge broken.  The knife blades after the first use become dull.,1.0
I made the mistake in thinking this was an Xacto knife set which was new. It is not. This set is an old imitation Hobby Knife setup with thin weak dull blades. Maybe worth 2.00.,1.0
"Am looking forward to using it when I get it. I can,t rate something until I have a chance to use it",1.0
"There are three expensive things in life. Cars, woman, and cheap tools. This is no exception, invest into a hobby knife that will actually get the job done.",1.0
The blades are incredibly flimsy. I broke two of the blades off the handle simply by trying to keep a piece of foam board. I would definitely spend the money next time to get a better quality knife.,1.0
"I purchased this because albeit there were some low stars, there were more 5-star reviews.  The handles and blade holders are plastic.  They don't hold the blades well at all.  Trying a simple cut in balsa wood and the entire blade and holder pull out of the handle.

Blades themselves seem OK.  I went to the local hobby store and bought metal Exacto handles.  They don't fit in the box, but they don't take your fingers off as the blade comes out, either.",1.0
This set is to dull to cut paper. I see why exact o charges 5 bucks a knife. Don't waste your money.,1.0
You see in this picture it looks exactly the same as the xacto knife set. Do Not Be FOOLED these are entirely plastic and cannot be tightened in any way shape or form to hold the blade tight. this item is definately going to be returned due to its extremely poor quality,1.0
"This item is of horrible quality and a serious waste of $5.

Pros:
1. Low Price

Cons
1. The blue box, not the shown color (not a big deal), turns your hands blue. If you just touch it, you become blue so I had to wash mine and it still makes me a little blue.
2. The case doesn't close, maybe its just mine, but it doesn't lock shut it just springs open.
3. The blades are held in place by a tiny magnet. The magnet is very weak and the pieces fall out very easily.
4. Knives are not sharp at all. This can be fixed, but it not convenient at all.
5. Blades are thin and of poor quality, can cut paper and that is about all.

I would not recommend this item",1.0
"The handles are cheap plastic.
The part that holds the blade is also plastic.

The blades are thin and not that sharp.

The case is also cheap.
It doesn't close well.

Not recommended.",1.0
Im glad I didn't let my 9 year old on his own with this it wasn't helpful at all both thumbs down!,1.0
"Where to begin...  The handles that I received barely resemble the ones in the listed picture.  Actual items are MUCH Cheaper quality look and feel.  All of the blades are of the cheapest stamped metal that China has to offer.  The real kicker is the case they all come in.  First I have yet found a way to get it to stay closed. But the BIG SURPRISE was when I put it down and looked at my hands it looked like I had joined the Smurfs!  Blue die from a plastic box?  Makes me wonder what toxic materials are in the case.

Bottom line: I just blew $5  I should have not been so cheap and gone with the named brand stuff for a few bucks more.",1.0
"I purchased this item based off the reviews, but I should have gone with my instincts and purchased an xacto brand kit instead.

This item, while favorably priced, fails to deliver on the quality required for an actual hobby knife kit. The handles are incredibly thin and flimsy. The blade securing screw top is very weak and comes loose often. I used the blades on a single project and intend to throw them out. Just a complete waste for a serious hobbyist.",1.0
i knew I was not getting some great set but what I got was fair below the norm every piece of this set was bad and when I first opened the box the knifes where al over and  the red handle was broken over all this set was not nearly what i expected,1.0
"The case is very bad quality. It does not even snap shut. Definitely do not buy this one. If your looking for a hobby knife from this company, at least purchase the Wooden Box. Also, The magnetic strip is weak.. The blades fall all over the place and the magnetic strip itself falls off the back of the lid. All in All, bad quality. Visit you local Hobby Shop!!",1.0
These are incredibly cheaply made.  The box broke the first time that I opened it.  The blades bend and/or break very easily.  I wish that I would have spent more money and gotten a better set.,1.0
"the photo shows metal tip that hold the blades Not what you get they are plastic and don't hold the blades. The case didn't come in in the plastic they show in the picture just the blade holding box that was broken and you could tell that this set had been used. most of the blades were damaged either before shipping or durning and they were covered in glue. I threw this set right in the garbage. if cheap, useless is what your looking for then this is a great set however if like me your looking for a decent set with metal handles and tips look elsewhere",1.0
"I was upset at the condition of this item, it looked like it had been already used and some of the blades were rusty.",1.0
"I was not very happy with this set. The blades would not stay screwed into the one of the handles and kept falling out; the screw part of the blade wouldn't tighten all the way, so it was unreliable.",1.0
"the blade is very weak, easy to break, sometimes you can find the same product from your local 99 cents store.",1.0

I bought this glue thinking it would be a great adhesive for scrapbooking. I used a small amount of glue in the corners of my photos and let it dry. I come back an hour later and much to my horror my hard work on my page had been ruined by crinkling and cracking of the dried glue. I tried to use it once more with a minuscule amount to see if I used too much glue the first time and yet again it ruined the item. Don't trust this glue I think there is black magic at work here.,1.0

It is incredibly easy to tell where the repaired section is, because it is so smooth.

Not a fan.",1.0
Does not adhere well to some surfaces when there is incidental friction,1.0
Way too complicated. Not an easy application as claimed.,1.0
I am disappointed with this product. It does not do a good job of repairing leather. I would not recommend this product.,1.0
this product was less than satisfactory. Product was completely dried out and unusable. I would not recommend this product to anyone,1.0
All the colors other than black and brown were dry and hard rendering the kit useless.,1.0

Useless. The prep flluid ruined the leather and most of the colored fillers were dried up. Absolute crap...Don't buy it!!!!!,1.0
Don't WASTE your money!,1.0
"The adhesive was extremely difficult to color match (which is probably a ploy to sell to color specific set). After an hour of mixing and testing, I ended up with a color that dried as a splotchy dark tan. But frankly, I didn't care about the color as long as it repaired the damage. It didn't. I put on about 5 layers and let it dry for 36 hours. Within an hour after sitting in the driver's seat, the adhesive cracked and came apart. This was a complete waste of money for me.",1.0
Crap!,1.0
"This kit does work. It takes some time to mix the colors just right, but once you get the right tone it looks great. It just doesn't last. The patch just peels off after while. Not a good product.

Looks horrible on any leather.  Not easy to use.  Does not do the trick.  Don't waste your money.  Not recommended,1.0
Did not work on our car seat. The ripped leather about 2-3 inches would tear out again after a few days.,1.0
"The kit includes base colors that are to be mixed to get a color matching the leather. Good luck with that. This is nearly impossible. Add a little of this, then add a little of that.... it is never right.",1.0

I said I'd have to pay to ship it and since they couldn't get it right the first time,
I'd rather just get my money back. I was told I have to pay to ship it back anyway.
So I said then I'll ship it back for a re-tint, I suppose they'll want another material sample?
She said just send it back and we'll refund because it doesn't sound like we'll be able to please you.
I said, oh, I send a sample, you guys don't match it and I'm the problem?????
So I disputed the charge with my credit card company.
My suggestion it to find someone else.",1.0
The description was a bit misleading to me. I tried using it but had no way of making it happen.  I ended up disposing of it.,1.0
"I followed the instructions but couldn't get the color or the texture right.  The instructions said to make the color lighter, as it would darken as it dried.  It actually gets lighter as it dries.  The texture turned out like plastic sheeting.  It would have been better and less permanent to slap a piece of duct tape on the leather.",1.0
The instructions for this product were hard to understand. And trying to mix the right color a pain in the__. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.,1.0
This product cracked where my leather had cracked and now is peeling...so I am left with cracked leather and now a peeling product that looks even worse than what I started with!  Do not buy!,1.0
"I used this kit and did not like it at all. Had to mix different things to try and match color. Dried OK, but the smell was like burnt plastic and lasted for days. This kit is OK for a cheap repair, but the area I repaired actually looks worse.",1.0
I bought this kit from magic mender website. 1st problem it does not match the color then when you left your car under the sun wow it is so sticky. It will look nice as long you don't use and seat on it. One more thing it doesn't last. In other words it is a useless thing.,1.0
"Out of the package, you'll get a manual on repairing a leather seat and the color mixing guide. They are very brief and didn't have any clue how to properly put in the last step; which is the gloss. Then there's the different colors that was on a tub that looked like no more than 1 and one half of table spoon each.

  Well, I mixed the color as instructed at the color guide and fine tuned the color on to my practice leather; I did the first 2 steps of on the instructions and when I spread the compound on the leather, it's too glossy and shiny, also if the colors are not 100% matched (which most likely you couldn't)it will look like a shiny middle with streaks on the outline as you fill in the fine wrinkles of the leather and shave the protruding parts. There's no way you to copy the texture of the leather around the repaired area unless the you plan to cover the whole pannel, which is again not possible since you only have a little more than a table spoon of paint!

Negatives:
 -expensive
 -hard to use
 -limited instructions on the kit
 -repair will obviously look amateur-ish
 -Not so leather magic

Positives:
 -It's one thing you could put on your ""NEVER buy list.""

Do yourself a favor and never bother with this product; saves you the headache.",1.0

I would imagine it would work better if you had some outright holes in a leather couch, bigger than what I have. The patching pieces (sub-material and the leather) were just too big to fit into the holes I have.

So now I'm just using the glue to see if I can glue the rips shut.

Unfortunately, I really thought this would be a better product, based on the price compared to other similar products.",1.0
"This was a total ripoff. I needed to cover up some cat claw prick marks on my leather barstools. They are black, so I didn't have to worry about color mixing. The first thing to go wrong was the finish on the product after it dried. It was very shiny, like patent leather. So my barstools looked like they had tone-on-tone polka dots! The second thing to go wrong was when I cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework. Using a normal, soft dishcloth, wet and well wrong out, no cleaning product on it at all, just plain water, I lightly wiped off my barstools, and there went my new shiny polkadots. All the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic. The best thing I can say is that the claw marks are still there and I am right back where I started. The worst thing I can say is I wasted my money on this product. I definitely wouldn't recomend it for a fine piece of leather furniture!",1.0
I followed the directions to the T. In a few days the split started showing on top of the dried so called paint. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!,1.0
"This product was an absolute disaster.
I had a huge hole in my leather couch, which this product describes how to put a subpatch and glue the pieces together- except that the glue was old and putty-like; it would not hold anything together!
Secondly, although it claims to tell you how to combine the basic colors to get any color in the world, its a very basic description - like, tan is a combination of yellow, orange, white and brown. this resulted in a salmon colored liquid when i tried to make tan.
Anyhow, in desperation to get my couch not to continue to rip, I took out a needle and thread and sewed it together. Also now have salmon colored streaks on that cushion, which is not pretty.
I returned the product for a full refund.",1.0
Do not bother with this kit. You get one tiny piece of backing and one small piece of leather. I opened the glue and couldn't figure out why it wouldn't squeeze out. Finally pried off the top to find that the entire bottle had already dried up - and I had just opened it for the first time. Definitely not worth it.,1.0
Its junk. didn't work at all. had to throw it away. complete waste of money.,1.0
"Ok  I was allready to go with this stuff....  then I tried to use the adhesive,  it got jammed as I was squeezing it out,  so I popped off the little nozzle and applied through the larger hole in the jug,  then the whole jug of adhesive got hard.  There goes the adhesive... so I used some of my own adhesive...  right now I am letting the leather patch dry but i am not hopeful,  waste of $30.00  use that money for somebody to fix it for real",1.0
They were rated for left hand.  Package said used for either hand.  Picture shows 4 pair and received only 1 pair.,1.0
"Terrible, ordered a 4 pack of LEFT HANDED...got one right handed.",1.0
"I received regular scissors, not for left handed. Left handed scissors need to have the blades inverted, the ones I received do not. Also in the pictures you can see the package says for kids lefty. The ones I received do not say this, it only says for kids. I bought these scissors specifically because I needed left handed scissors, regular scissors are not of any use for me. I bought 2 and both are the same. The way I see it this is false advertising, because these are not left handed scissors, as simple as that, and I am attaching pictures as evidence. For me this is the same as buying pants and receiving shorts, a complete different thing and not what I think Im buying. I bought 2, and both are regular scissors. Returning and looking somewhere else. I cant trust buying these again and risk receiving something that I am not buying.",1.0
"This is a very deceiving product picture........you do NOT get 4 pair of scissors, just 1 !!  No matter how hard I searched, I could not find a description of exactly what was being purchased so I assumed what was pictured, as with other products I purchase on AMAZON, had to be what I would get. Wrong!  I cannot attest to any other aspect of the product yet.  I am quite an unhappy customer.",1.0
I was under the impression that I was buying 4 scissors not 1. Too expensive and cheaply made. Doesnt give you the option to pick a color.,1.0
"I thought it came in package of 4 but only 1 Scissor, way too expensive",1.0
"Very misleading picture led me to believe I was getting 4 scissors. Instead only one :(
Also, it was scissors specifically for left handed kids. Not what I expected.",1.0
I thought it was a 4 pack based on the picture and price difference from the exact same pair with the picture of a single pair (2.99 same seller and brand),1.0
I only got a few uses out of these before they broke.,1.0
Broke within 5 minutes of opening package,1.0
They were great until they snapped after only a few weeks of use.,1.0
poor quality. after the days of use they got loose and do not cut,1.0
"We were really excited to get left-handed scissors for our 4 year old daughter.  Unfortunately, these broke the first time she dropped them.",1.0
"Got pink pair. Now I see colors vary but this should be made more obvious. I know it should not matter but my boy will not use them, so it is now a waste of money.",1.0
My daughter cuts left handed and I thought this pair of scissors could help with her cutting. The scissors are not very smooth in cutting and sort of stick when the handles come together.,1.0
I'm left handed and for the life of me I can't use this. Will try another.,1.0
"These scissors are for lefties and we purchased these for my son, however, when we received them they were not the blue color pictured or any other gender neutral color...they were pink.  Certainly not going to send him to school with pink scissors...waste of money in my case.  Caveat emptor!",1.0
Used the scissors 3 times and they broke. Very disappointing.,1.0
"These scissors are not well-made.  After a few days of light use, they were broken in two and cannot be put together again.  Although they have a ""limited warranty,"" it would not be worth the cost of shipping them back to the manufacturer, and Amazon has not let me return them for a refund.  And yes, they came in pink.",1.0
Very disappointed....they broke after first use and they were expensive for one pair of scissors that only lasted for one cutting. Now for our left handed kids at school we have nothing because I bought them as a trial pair to see how well they worked.,1.0
"My kid only used this scissors three times and they broke, she's not harsh on them at all and only took one fall (from a height of 2 feet) to break them in 2. I'm very disappointed, it's supposed to be a product for kids and I was expecting something a lot more durable than 3 uses.",1.0
Plastic at hinge broke during first use.,1.0
"So, I realize that the description on this says ""Colors Vary"", but I think it should be obvious that approximately 50% of the kid population that these are made for will HATE it when their pink scissors arrive in the mail.  #scissorfail  I will be returning these and unfortunately paying a premium for a pair that is guaranteed to be ANY OTHER COLOR.",1.0
"Broke on the first use. I was helping my daughter and she didn't use any unusual force. Used it to cut a few shapes and 10 minutes in, they snapped apart and could not be fixed.",1.0
"Scissors were o.k. but picture shows them in blue and they came in pink, so he didn't want to use them.  Put them away until someone else can use them.",1.0
"I bought these thinking they were specifically for lefties. But they are just the same as the regular kids' scissors I bought from Wescott. Looks like they just added the title ""Left Handed"" and charged three times the price. On the packaging it even says on the back that their scissors are designed to be used with either hand. Then why have a special pricier model for ""left-handed"" kids?",1.0
"Broke in less than 2 months, after only occasional use by my little lefty grandchild! Very disappointing, will not buy again.",1.0
"These scissors did the job for my 3.5 yr old leftie but they broke after only using them a few times.  He was not rough with them, always used them with supervision and only cut paper with them.  I was using them to cut a piece of felt and they fell apart in my hands.  The plastic piece that attaches the two pieces together snapped off.  Maybe I just got a bad pair but because Santa bought these before Christmas and stored them away for a few weeks, we are now outside of our return window.  Bummer.  Will try another brand.",1.0
Bought 2 types of lefty scissors for kids.  The Fiskar brand was very smooth and fluid to open and close.  This one is very stiff and impossible to smoothly open and close when cutting.  Fatigues hand because it takes so much work to open.  Would not recommend.,1.0
"Bought two pair. One to keep at my home the other for granddaughter to take home. The first pair broke the first time they were used (was with granddaughter). She dropped them on the floor and they broke in two since only plastic holds them together. I don't know about the second pair, I sent them home with her.  Very disappointed with them.",1.0
"My kid's a leftie, so I was trying to help him out.  First day of school (i.e., first day of use), they fell on the floor and broke into two pieces.  Come on.  His teacher bought him a replacement pair a few days later which was so sweet, but let's see if they can make it longer than day 1.",1.0
"This stand could not even support a 12"" vinyl record. It is loose and very cheaply made.",1.0
"Arrived with screws fallen out and hinges coming off. I used a screwdriver for eyeglasses to repair, but had to apply glue to some of the tiny screws, as the ports were stripped. I did not want to bother with returning such a low cost item.",1.0
Was BROKEN IN HALF when I received.,1.0
Description said this was U.S. Made but when it arrived it was made in China - very misleading,1.0
I bought this to display a picture frame and the frame is very unstable sitting on it. If you even touch the frame the whole set up will fall over. Very disappointed.,1.0
Cheap! Does not hold up pictures. So it doesn't serve it purpose. Overpriced. I threw it away!!!,1.0
"These were not 7"" tall. The measurement includes the bottom. They are too short to use as I needed. Now I have 30 unusable stands :-(.",1.0
"I wanted a more stylish stand to display a plaque and I thought this one would be perfect.  When I got it, I set it up right away and found that it doesn't stay open when you put something on it.  The plaque wasn't too big for it or anything, it just slid closed and fell over.  I will buy a standard wire stand now.",1.0
"These are horrible. Very generic, hard to use for to poor manufacturing. Once you can manipulate them to cut the paper looks like a tear Vs a pretty cut",1.0
"Not up to standards of Fiskars in my humble opinion! The 2 blades have difficulty to perform smoothly cutting even the thinnest paper edge!
Waste of $$",1.0
Doesn't work =(,1.0
"It doesn't work at all.
waste money. even can't retrun.",1.0
Dissatisfied with these product couple of them gets stuck while cutting the paper I do not recommend you,1.0
"I needed to cut a dozen five inch square photos and need to be prepared to do dozens more for gifts.
  These are apparently made for lightweight writing paper.
  I am purchasing a Susis 10 Inch Deckle Cutter Print and Photograph Trimmer 10"" Model 193.",1.0
Cheap flimsy plastic that shifts sideways & not as pictued on Amazon site.,1.0
Junk... don't cut... falling apart after one use...,1.0
I'd give zero stars if it would let me. These were a waste of money. They don't cut through a single piece of paper completely. Only one curved section actually separates cleanly. Don't purchase these.,1.0
"I have used many Fiskars edging scissors over the years.  Never had any problems.  This is the most recent addition and it turned out to be totally useless--cannot even cut a photo corner clean.  A piece of junk!  Not worthwhile to return.  Either I got a defective product, or Fiskars quality is greatly reduced...",1.0
"Maybe defective, maybe designed to be useless, but it didn't cut tissue paper, copy paper, card stock, light nylon fabric, or craft fur... mysteriously ineligible for return so I just got a refund.",1.0
I returned this item.  The paper shapes after cutting does not appear exactly as shown in the picture,1.0
"Used for simple craft project and instantly they chewed the paper up, and became stuck open.
I wouldn't reccomend them.",1.0
I have a generic brand of these type that came in a cheap pack of four from my craft store. I used that cheap pair to cut a mock up of my wedding invitations and loved the look so I wanted a good pair that would make its way through 100 invitations. This pair ain't it. I was mixed on the reviews so I spent the $3 to find out for myself. These are obviously made for kids (thus the cost and size). The handles are tiny and the cut is rugged. I need them sharp and long lasting. I'm disappointed as I thought I couldn't go wrong with Fiskars. :(,1.0
"These scissors barely cut. If you're using delicate paper or crepe paper, forget it. The blades will only chew paper that's not crisp.

As if that weren't bad enough, these scissors actually jam themselves. You have to be very careful how widely you open them, because they won't close if you open them too wide. The blades will interlock and jam. You can pry them apart, but it happens over and over if you try to use anything like the whole blade.",1.0
"scissors so poorly made, that they don't cut paper properly.  do NOT recommend!",1.0
"I am very disappointed in these scissors. I expected a quality product from Fiskars, but these scissors didn't even work when they arrived. They came wrapped in a sticker that left a horrible residue, and when I tried to test them out for the first time, the innermost scallops, closest to the pivot, caught on one another and jammed. When I unstuck them, the scissors repeatedly jammed every time I tried to use them. I was able to get them working by painstakingly filing down the two scallops that were too close to each other, but even when I did get them working, they were difficult to use and created a rather sloppy pattern. I will not buy this brand again.",1.0
"I actually bought these to use with my foam sheets. But it doesn't work. However, they work fine on regular paper.",1.0
"Hoped to cut Scotch and Duct tape for a craft project, but it jammed. It also jams greeting card paper.",1.0
"Does not leave crisp cut edges particularly closer in the cut. Pain in the neck to always have to trim tiny paper fibers. Would not recommend at all, especially for the price. Very disappointed.",1.0
"These scissors were impossible to cut with.  Each cut only made 3 scallops (which is fine), but, I couldn't line up the paper well enough to make the next cut.  The paper couldn't fit by the scissor design...i couldn't make a straight line to save my life. I would recommend an edge stamper instead",1.0
"Retracted stars. After some use, I find the pinking cutting blades do not leave crisp cut edges particularly closer into the cut. Pain in the neck to always have to trim tiny paper fibers. Would not recommend at all, especially for the price. Very disappointed.",1.0
When I first learned how to crochet yarn was cheap since that time the price has risen for a number of reason. I never expected the price to escalate to what it is now. Paying such an exhorbant price I never thought that I would have to constantly cut knots aloose and reattach them.,1.0
The Deep Olive looks absolutely NOTHING like the photos included in the product discription. Deeply disappointed in the color. Its more of a muddy brown with cool undertones. Not the vibrant warm green of the pictures in the product discription. Its getting one star for that.,1.0
Can only give one star because it never came-instead of one pink and one purple skein I got two pink skeins.,1.0
Not good for felting - returned.,1.0
These bundles of wool are sold in boxes of 10.  I received only one of the bundles usually sold in a box of 10 for a similar price.  Check out joann.com.  This must be a mistake  one 8 yard bundle?,1.0
"I was hoping it was just a bad picture and that the yarn would be ""yellow"". It's not...it's kinda 70's harvest gold bordering on orange. It worked fine since I was just making dryer balls, but I wouldn't buy it again in this color.",1.0
"I ordered this looking for a black yarn by Patons. The image shows a swatch of black so that's what I was going by since the color is called ""moonrock"". It is not black at all. It's not even close. It's a reddish brown! I'm very disappointed and set back in my work. The only good comment for it is it came 6 days ahead of schedule, but that doesn't matter because I can't use it for the customers product.",1.0
all of the sponge brushes used came off the handle while washing with soap and water.  Won't be ordering these again.,1.0
"I don't even know where to begin with my disappointment in this product, so you can stop reading here because I can't describe it all.  Brushes: bristles fall out or push in, glue doesn't hold them together. Sponges are not even as nice as the ones you get in the cosmetics department. The only 'nice' thing is the circular sponge on a handle if you want to a do small area, but the sponges are so shoddy you end up hitting the stick in most cases, so it had to be just touch up work. I wouldn't waste my time on these for kids projects (I tried), he got more frustrated than ever. I was able to throw them out after he used it rather than waste my soap & water.",1.0
Did not receive what was described. I got 6-piece watercolor gouache instead. I didn't even have the option to just replace.,1.0
These brushes were extremely stiff and I couldn't use them.  I've used cheap brushes before and usually when they get wet they soften up and are better to use and that was  not the case here.  Even the sponges wouldn't soak up the cream I was trying to spread.  Would not recommend.,1.0
The bristles are stiff and began to fall out after a single use. Do not waste your money on these.,1.0
"If you are looking for soft brushes stay away from these. These are extremely stiff, they don't bend! Maybe they are to be used on wood or something cause i cant see it being used on paper or skin or anything soft.",1.0
"I am going to cut-and-paste the email that I sent the customer service department of this company about 20 minutes ago, after putting this table together:

""I'm very disappointed to say the least (actually, infuriated is a more apt description).

We were given this train table as a gift by my mother-in-law, and the way it was packaged allowed one end to split open, the styrofoam inside to break, and for the pieces of the table to shift around while I was trying to move it. Fortunately, none of the wood was scratched.
However, when I finally did open it, styrofoam ""snow"" flew all over the room (which continued the feelings of annoyance).

And then I discovered that one of the brackets on the end piece was bent. I tried to tighten it with a philips screwdriver but didn't go very far because I was afraid of stripping the grooves in the hole. So I left it, and the table is pretty wobbly.

And on top of that, the board is warped! It won't lie flat. Now, maybe that is a common problem that rights itself after a while of lying flat, but if so, there should be a note on the instructions or somewhere to that effect. If not, then, needless to repeat, this is an infuriating product.""

I hope this helps people decide on this type of product",1.0
"We are not very happy at all with our purchase from BabyAge.  The product that arrived was the wrong color wood, and the play board is poorly made, arrived with many scratches and dings and is not very good quality at all.  On the plus side the table is very spacious so I am sure that many children can play on it at once.",1.0
"The wood is press-board wood. The wood split in a matter of days. My son prefers the coffee table to this train table. More information about this product should be provided. Our particular model is compatable with Duplos, not Lagos like we hoped. It is also very small; no dimentions were provided in the discription.",1.0
"I wouldn't know how many stars to give this item because it was ordered almost 3 weeks ago and I still have not seen it. I was given a tracking number the day after it was ordered, that's a start...but then FenFen went on vacation for a few weeks. You would think Christmas would be the time to send orders out!! I would advise you to get your budda board from any supplier other than this one.",1.0
"Booooooooo- Amazon.

As much as I hate to give bad stars over a mis-shipped product, I can say that Amazon will not send you this one if you order it.  They will send you the non-Laptop version.  Now I have to pry it out of a 2 yr old's hands to send it back for the more 2yr old version of this product (this one, with a more sturdy base).  Thanks for complicating Christmas Amazon.  It's not just a mis-pick, cause then you'd have sent me something wildly different.  This was a 'well, this one's good enough...' kind of mis-pick.  Shame.",1.0
I put it on the can once and tried to take it off and it broke. never even got to use the handle,1.0
Did not work for us at all. Good idea but a real waste of money.,1.0
This wouldn't worry in krylon or rustoleum cans... Which are standard brands. I don't understand what this works on... It's too small an opening to hook into basic spray cans. I even tried on a smaller can but the area it should clasp is still standard size so this wouldn't work.,1.0
broke in 2 days as the opening to attached can is too rigid.,1.0
Dropped it once and broke,1.0
I am not able to put this on the spray can so it is useless to me.,1.0
"I ordered (2) 100 bag packages of these zip-lock style bags.  One arrived fine, but the other one had a 'cut' thru the ziplock bag they were shipped in (think 'sliced' by a box cutter).  Neither Amazon, or 'Amamax' (the seller) were concerned about this enough, to do anything.

The bags 'are thinner' than I've boughten before (from other venders).  And they are usable, at least once, - reusing them (reopening & closing) them several times, may be another matter. And using contaminated bags doesn't thrill my wife.

I couldn't recommend the bags, - or the seller.  I'll not buy these same bags again, or deal with 'Amamax' the seller again.
So, if you buy these bags, - you'll be buying from a seller who won't back up the products they sell, - when there is a problem.  Good Luck!",1.0
"Very disappointed!  Ink pad was dried out.  Contacted seller and received an email telling me they have never had a defective ink pad & gave tips on using it which still didn't work.  Maybe they should read the 33 critical reviews a of today.  Seller offered to send it back to mfg. for evaluation if I return it in original envelope.  Envelope was thrown out but it wouldnt be worth the hassle anyway.  The label on the case is not as pictured, it is in Spanish.  Seller said it is the new label.  Hard for me to believe.  Ill just stick to buying at local craft stores even with it being more expensive.",1.0
Didn't even have this for awhile and by awhile I mean like 6 months or so. I have had this maybe for three months and the ink pad itself is just dry. No matter how hard or soft I press I get nothing. I store it just the same as my other ink pads  and this is the only ink pad that I have had a problem with.,1.0
"The description says 3x3.75 inch stamp pad but this isn't true. The container is that length, but the stamp pad is only 2 square inches.

I'm very disappointed it is not what was advertised.",1.0
"Awful. The only thing this ink dyed was my hands. It rolled right off the poster I tried to distress. I tried heat setting it, I tried letting air dry. It just sat there and I finally had to wipe it off. I used a tea bag instead. Threw this ink pad away.",1.0
"The good,  lightening fast shipping.
The bad, opened package, damaged, and very dried out.  Totally bummed because I was excited to use with my art",1.0
"I bought two of these distress inks, this one and another in Tea Dye. Tea Dye is wonderful, but this one came pretty much completely dried out. After doing the edges of a mere 15 or so pages, the ink pad is no longer putting out much, if any, color. If I need to buy a new package for every 15 pages (just the edges, mind you!) this project is going to cost me a fortune, as I'm trying to distress a 600 page book!!

I'd return it or demand a replacement, but it's just too much hassle to ship this little piece of garbage all the way back and wait for another. I'll just have to do the distressing with Tea Dye alone, not that one and this in combination. Really disappointed.",1.0
When this item arrived with the rest of the things I had ordered it was not wrapped with the typical plastic that a new item should have had on it.  So during shipment the lid came off and ink was everywhere in the box when I opened it.  All the other items were covered in ink and the inside of the box was all inked up.  I had to have this item replaced.  It was as if they sent me a used ink pad.  I use this ink pads all the time so have no complaint with the Ranger company just who sent me this item.,1.0
"Literally worked for less than 10 seconds. I opened the box put in new batteries, and turned it on. It ran for a few seconds and broke. I tried removing the batteries, and turning it off and on, and it didn't fix it. DO NOT BUY, this is a really poorly made product.",1.0
I bought this in hopes of inscribing my son's name on his plastic spoons for day care (because EVERYTHING has to have their name on it). Was very disappointed in the result.,1.0
"I too did not have much luck with this item. I was able to engrave a scrible, a .5 cm heart, two L's, ""Love"", and half of a heart before it died. I tried replacing the batteries but nada. and before someone else comments that I should send it back because there are always a few lemons in every batch, that takes too much time. Especially since I am not the only one this has happened to buying a different engraving tool is just more convenient.

Update: I forgot to mention I was engraving on metal",1.0
"I purchased the sewing kit to go with my new sewing machine that I received for Christmas.  The velcro for the closure was unattached as well as the closure being held on by one strand of thread.  The workmanship on this item is ""shoddy"" at best.  The removable tray was bent out of shape and I don't foresee it being worth much.

I do not recommend that anyone waste their money on this item; no matter how good the picture looks.",1.0
"I received the sewing kit to give to my future daughter-in-law.  I was appalled at the quality of the product.  The plastic tray is extremely ""flimsy"" and would not last at all.  The ""notions"" that are included are of particulary poor quality.  The tracing wheel would not last long enough to trace one pattern.  The scissors are not sewing scissors, but are cheap craft scissors.  The thread is not mercerized and would shrink when washed.  As one person who saw it said ""No corner was left uncut.""  I would not recommend that anyone buy this, especially if you were using it as a prize or a promotional device.

"I got this today, and while the design is nice, and it's a fairly decent sized sewing basket, their craftsmanship is awful.

The Velcro closure was barely even hot-glued onto the body of the basket, without so much as one stitch to hold it on (and if you look closely along the bottom and left sides of the product picture, there SHOULD be stitching to hold the Velcro in place), as a result, I had barely gotten it out of the plastic and tried to open it the first time and the entire closure ripped right off of the body of the basket. Literally within 2 minutes of it being out of the box.",1.0
Smaller than what I expected,1.0
"Wish I had kept my sewing basket from years ago. This one is garbage. Too small, hope my scissors fit! No room for anything in this and its made terrible. The junk inside is not great either. Reeeeeeally disappointed! Thirty dollars!!!",1.0
My daughter purchased this for me as a gift.  You can't imagine our disappointment as to the quality of this basket.  I have never seen such a poor excuse for a basket and the notions are useless.  The deceptive description leads you to believe that you will be getting a much higher quality item.,1.0
"First of all for what I paid for this sewing basket-I expected the shelf on the inside to be made of plastic- but not as cheap as it was.
I buy stuff from the dollar store  plastic wrapped in stronger material than the shelf was made from. I was emabarrassed to give it as a gift the items on the inside were extremely cheap also.
So not worth what I paid for it.
Very disappointed, I wrote immediately and was told I had to pay a restocking fee, I wouldn't get refunded for the shipping etc.!~
I would not recommend this to anyone.",1.0
"As soon as  bought this product and opened the case to put the included items in the velcro closure broke.  The tray is made of flimsy plastic and would not stand up to regular use.

Very disappointed with the quality of this sewing box.  The lid did not close properly and the piece of valcro that was supposed to keep it closed fell off almost right away.  It is not worth the money I paid for it.,1.0
Poorly constructed. Handle was already unravelling on arrival.  The rope trim on the handle had already begun to unravel.  The tab closure was half sewn in and half off.  The inner tray was made of a very thin and low quality plastic.,1.0

"I bought this for my 10 year old, and she's happy with it. However, it has a strange odor to it, like mold or mildew. Yuck!!

"Don't be fooled into thinking that these scissors are truly for left-handed kids. The handles may be molded to fit either hand but, in order to be truly left handed scissors, the blades must be reversed. It is physically impossible to make ambidexterous scissors. Hold the scissors open in front of you, with the blade pointing away from you and one handle in each hand. If the blade on top is coming from your left hand, then they are truly left-handed scissors. If it's on the right, then they simply won't cut well when used left handed. The natural cutting action of the hand will push the blades apart rather than together and the paper will slip between the blades, which is quite frustrating for a preschooler who is learning to use scissors.

I bought this paint as a comparison between Winsor & Newton and Liquitex professional and student paints. In order to compare I did a simple gradient test to find the truest and birghtest color when mixed with white. I find it important to note that the professional Winsor and Newton uses the same pigments as the Liqutex student paint. I found that Winsor and Liquitex professional pains have  the same degree of pigment saturation. However Liquitex professional had the brightest color when mixed with white. Liquitex student paint was only slightly duller than the professional and a closer comparison to Winsor professional. The Winsor student paint was not phthalo blue as I expected and had a very strong green shade. By all standards Liquitex professional was the best pain by being true to the expected color, having a high degree of pigment saturation, and remaining bright after being mixed with white. Winsor professional and Liquitex student tie for second though price would put Liquitex ahead. Winsor professional had a higher saturation but was not as bright when mixed with white and compared to Liquitex student. Winsor student pain comes in dead last by an long shot. The paint is the completely wrong color though its pigmentation states that it should be the same as Liquitex professional. The degree of saturation is far less that any of the other paints and it is greatly dulled by the white paint.
Final rankings: 1. Liquitex professional 2. Liquitex student 3. Winsor & Newton professional 4. great dissapointment 5. Winsor & Newton Student

"Just not what I wanted. They are cheaply made, so they don't hold up well. They are too broad to use on coloring book pages, and bleed through the back and following pages. I should have returned them, but waited too long.",1.0
I bought these same markers 25 years ago. The majority of them still work but some were just starting to run out so I figured it was time to buy a new pack. These ones are horrible!!! 2 of the tips snapped off if 2 markers. Most barely color. A lot of them are frayed and spread color all over. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and figured it was just a bad batch. So I ordered another set. Same thing happened. Very disappointed!!!!,1.0
Ink is dry! I was going to return but the shopping is more than I even purchased the markers for. Not happy!!!,1.0
pens were nearly dry. I thought the price was low. I have a set over five years old that work better than these new ones.,1.0
"Please choose a different marker set. The first set that I received had the majority of the markers dried out upon arrival. I requested a replacement, but they had the same issue. Once again, the majority were unusable, straight out of the packaging. Another problem is that the colors of the markers do not match the cases. For example, the peach case contains a dark brown marker.",1.0
Not good quality at all...WAAAAAY over priced. I returned them.,1.0
"Horrible markers for adult coloring. The colors are misleading and the markers are not smooth. The markers leave streak marks on your picture. I wouldn't recommend these makers. Instead, I would rather buy stabilo markers.",1.0
"I just opened them to use and am so unhappy.  I have not had any time to relax and try this coloring thing for the last few weeks.  Well, it is not relaxing when your new pens have arrived dried out.  Yes some of them work but when there are approximately one third are no good it is a problem.  Also several of the pens that should be different shades of color are exactly the same, exactly.  I had Pentel pens 20 years ago that still were good after 5 years  or more, so this new set is a shock.  They should not be selling these.  I have not notified Amazon yet.  It is the second time this has happened.  I am just read to give up.  Amazon please read the reviews and stop stocking products that are not worth buying.",1.0
"I purchased this set several months ago and finally got around to making a color chart.  I had a photocopy of an uncolored page that was done on 60# cardstock.  I found that when I colored an area and went back over it one time to fill in the blanks, the paper started to bunch up on the colored side and even with the 60# paper, it leaked onto the back.  It was also quick to permeate past the lines in the picture and would not work for very small areas.  I didn't know much about markers and if I had researched better, I would not have gotten them for coloring.  They work fine for making notations on a paper or for letter-writing.",1.0
Horrible set. Stiff thin markers. Ugly colors with minimal ink..have had in my possession for 24 hours..not impressed.,1.0
honestly they act almost dried out and I love to color if I am happy I will re buy happily this product i won't be rebuying and wasting my money...... colors are misleading and just not a good product,1.0

These markers were dried out very disappointing  I didn't go after a return because I refuse to pay return shipping while it's possible it's a fluke one or two being dried out is a fluke all dried out disappointing,1.0
"I received this set as a Christmas gift. Although the colors pigment in each marker is great, the quality of the tip is poor. Using any of the markets even for the first time left more pieces of the marker on the page than color.",1.0
"The tips are nice and fine,  however, they are so hard that they rip fibers off the paper (good quality coloring book paper) and leave dark areas if you have to go over any spot more than once.  One tip was so jagged that it drew 2 lines instead of one.  I actually switched back to Crayola mid project and the tips were softer and color laid down more evenly.  I had such high hopes for these markers based on previous Pentel products and reviews.  I regret this purchase.",1.0
"Bright and beautiful colors, however they do not match the caps. My biggest complaint however is that they bleed and destroy the paper very quickly. Very unhappy with these makers. If you are considering buying them to use with adult coloring books, I suggest you go with a different set.",1.0
"I just received my Pentel Color Pen Set with the most beautiful colors.  I've been using colored pencils to color with but thought these felt pens would cover large areas more quickly.  I took out a light dove grey pen and began a new painting.  Thank goodness my book recommends using a protection sheet underneath as the felt pens often bleed through--and this one ""sure"" does--almost through the protective sheet.  Dove Grey turns out to be an inky ugly non-descript color.  I am so disappointed.  I tried being more gentle using it and regardless, the color remains the same--not a light grey.  The ink blobs easily.  If someone else uses pens and can advise me; otherwise, I will stay with my pencils that give an accurate color and lovely finish.  nlm  And is I do not hear from someone, including the vendor, I will return the set.",1.0
So many of the colors do NOT match their packaging! I took out a salmon colored marker and it drew magenta. The peach came out orange. I had to test everything on a separate piece of paper to find the colors I needed.,1.0
"Reviews from ""very experienced artists"" claimed these don't bleed through....well that was a lie.  I got these as a Christmas present for my mom along with adult coloring books hoping they wouldn't bleed through to the other pages, but they totally do (as in saturated).  I should have known with the brand as I didn't think Pentel was that high quality of a product.  For the extra money, but ACTUAL artist markers (they bleed somewhat, but not nearly as bad as these Pentel pens).",1.0

"Totally disappointed!!! I bought these to color small areas in adult coloring books.  They rough up the paper and leave a mess.  Would not recommend these for any type of ""fill-in"" coloring project.",1.0
I found many of the colors are practically identical so there's really not as much variety as I thought. Also many of the colors died after very little use. I couldn't even finish one small project. I would not buy these again.,1.0
"Very disappointed, especially since I was excited about the great reviews. Colors are muddy colored and do not match the caps at all. What is bright yellow is a blah beige, and a pretty blue is practically black. I ruined my first adult coloring project because of the lackluster colors. They also streak and dry out fast. I received these as a gift and will be returning them.",1.0
"They are dry,  and start skipping the first time you use them.  Would have sent them back immediately but i don't have a printer to print the return auth and would have to pay postage.  Not worth the hassle, but definitely a defective product.  3 of the first 10 markers I chose skipped or had no coverage.  These are not for art projects which was expected considering the color range.  Spend the money and get the Uchida's.  They are the best.",1.0
"Big Waste of Money.  Sent these back.  So disappointed.  The tips feather and leave fuzziness behind and you have to ""clean"" the tips before reusing to wipe off the fuzz.  Colors were okay but 30 out of 36 had fuzz issues so these were no good for me.  The Bic Mark-It markers (both ultra fine and fine) were 3,000 times better than these and the colors were better too.",1.0
"Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but I really don't understand the good reviews of these! These markers had crumbling tips the first time I used them and left significant streaks. I do adult coloring (mandalas, etc) and found these essentially unusable. I used them on a few different types of paper to make sure it was the pens and I had the same result every time: clumps of the tips mixed in with the ink + streaks. Some of the colors were lovely, but all were streaky and every single one had a ""raised"" texture after from all the felt sticking into the ink.",1.0
"Colors do not match the caps and some were dry out of the box.  The beige pen turned out to be more of an ugly gold, and the pale pink came out neon orange!

Was very surprised after reading so many good reviews.  Waited too long to try the markers, so now I can't return them.",1.0
So incredibly disappointed. Feel like I got a totally different product than some reviewers. Numerous markers are dried up straight out of the package! Completely unusable!,1.0
"These are a huge disappointment. I read a lot of reviews (on these and other similar markers) before buying these and don't understand the positive ones for this product. Here are the problems with it: 1- The actual colors do not match the cap colors, they are much more intense. So, for a good art project they are essentially unusable. 2- They dry out! After coloring one small area, maybe 4""x2"", they dry out. Replacing the cap means that the next day they will color a bit more but that is hardly practical. The only good thing about them is that the tips are very nice but with not enough ink, and unreliable color matching, they are really not worth buying, at any price.",1.0
Dried out. Need I say more?,1.0
"These pens worked great for one 20 minute coloring session, but the next time they were used, every single color was dried up and/or clumps of the tip were coming off! There is no reason this should have happened because all the caps were put back on tightly after use and the markers were kept in a room temperature environment. So disappointed!!!",1.0
"I do not know what happened this Pentel set over the years. For years, when I worked in graphic arts (pre-computers) these were the premier pens for professional work.

"Maybe I just received a batch of duds, but I was so disappointed in these markers I had to get online and review them the first night I've had them.  I've worked with these markers less than two hours and already four of them have run bone dry.  First the dark orange went dry, so I reconsidered my project and switched to a lighter orange.  Then that one went dry.  I had to switch to yellow... and you guessed it.  The yellow ran dry as well.  So I thought, okay, at least I seem to have plenty of green.  And then the green went dry.  My project is small, just a normal letter-paper sized, and I have to go buy a new set of markers tomorrow to finish it--and I paid $20 for these things?  I hardly expected artist quality pens, but I did at least expect to get one project out of them.",1.0

"This has to be one of the worst art products there is out there. I bought this after using some mid-tier oil painting supplies at some art classes I have been taking. I did not expect much from this kit given its price but I had to give it a shot if I wanted to try painting at home on a budget. On first impression, the wooden box is of very poor quality. Upon opening, the materials started to come out and the compartments holding the paint tubes had completely detached from the box itself (poor glue job). I picked up the paint brushes to feel them and they were rock hard. It seemed as though the brush fibers were glued together. The material of the brush itself was also subpar. They're not soft like the beginner brushes at Michaels; they literally look and feel as though they are very thin cardboard cutout fibers. So I decided to give them a try anyways, I am a naive beginner after all so I couldn't judge the materials without actually trying them. When I squeezed the white tube onto the palette, a significant amount of liquid came out before the actual paint itself as though it had been separated. The other colors squeezed out fine, albeit on the watery side. Afterwards, I mixed a few colors and began to use one of the brushes. First off, the paint is not smooth like the Ultrecht oil paints I used in class. At this point I know I'm comparing these to a much superior brand but, c'mon, these can't even pass off as oil paint. Second, the brushes absorb most of the paint and don't actually paint. Not only is it difficult to paint with these brushes but the filaments themselves would actually shed off as I painted. At this point I at least tried to paint something on a small 5 x 7 canvas and was very unhappy with the runny, unattractive, and unpleasing paint and unevenness of the stiff brush's strokes. So I picked everything up to clean the brushes and prep the box for a return. As I was cleaning the brushes, one of the brush heads actually came off the handle. My disappointment at this point was just so overwhelming that I couldn't help but laugh uncontrollably at how poor this product was. Opened, used, and returned in 30 minutes. It's going to be hard to top that record!",1.0

"I just finished testing the hardness of several brands of pencils.  I tested Caran d'Ache Grafwoods, Reeves, Faber-Castell Castell 9000 & Goldfaber 1221s, Derwent Graphics, and Royal Graphite Pencils.  Every brand but the Royals tested nearly the same in both hardness and color.  However, it appears that Royal just produces grade school pencils and sticks whatever hardness label on it they need.  I tested from 9H to 2B by drawing 7 large and two dozen small circles on Strathmore Sketch 400 and crosshatched them.  While there was some variation among the others, the Royals I tested (from 4H to 2B) looked like the old 2Bs we all used in first through third grade.  I saw no difference between their pencils in hardness within the admittedly subjective testing I did (allowing for minor variation for all brands).

I bought this Royal drawing set because I thought the pencils would have some variation from the better brands but that there would be a range of hardness.  And there is.  Admittedly their B range is darker than their H range but that is the only variation in all 12 pencils.  Their H range looks like 2B grade school pencils and their B range looks like B6s in the better brands.  I also hoped something else in the set might work even if most of the items were poorer than other brands and some things did.  The white eraser worked fine but the kneadable eraser wouldn't lift a layer of graphite off the end of a woodless graphite pencil.  I don't know about the charcoal and the other pastel pencils as I didn't use them.  The sandpaper worked as did the human model and the 6"" ruler although this last item should not be used for close measurements, the inch marks not being particularly accurate. The sharpener wasn't too bad and you know how important a sharpener is.  Of course, this brings us back to the pencils.  One simply wouldn't sharpen -- no matter what sharpener I used the graphite would break.  I threw that pencil away.

And finally there was the box itself.  It worked and had cheap but serviceable hardware but the wood itself was made up from knots.  One side of the lid was broken and not because of handling or shipping but because it was made over a knot in the wood and split the whole side.  I even threw the box away.  Now that's poor.  The only reason they got one star is because some of the items worked and I couldn't give a zero (and I didn't expect much anyway).  Still, I should have saved my money and so should you.

And that's lousy because we are both from Indiana (theyre company is from Munster, but their pencils are made in China, and Im from Indianapolis originally).  I'd give them a break if the box hadn't arrived busted like that.  That's just too much.  Anybody who gives them a high score doesn't know what they should expect in pencils or works for them.  Any of the other brands I mentioned is fine.  Of the group I mentioned, I generally use Derwents in the H range and Caran d'Ache in the B range.  For carbon pencils I generally use Wolff's, for charcoal pencils Ritmo, and Faber-Castell woodless graphite pencils.  Actually, I don't use anything often except wooded graphite pencils so I want pencils that are consistent in hardness and manufacturing quality.

Royals ain't it.  They are truly the bottom of the barrel.  If you can't afford anything but these then save your money and buy some regular 2B writing pencils.  You'll get better pencils, better drawings, and they'll sharpen better.  What more can you ask from something a second grader writes with.

Oh yeah, I don't work for any pencil company.  I'm just a guy who's trying to learn to draw but knows how to test his tools.  Royals failed the test.",1.0
The box just fell apart when I opened it. The brush. Holder was poorly designed. Very poor product. On the upside Amazon' return service was excellent. Also this company does make a quality product that is similar just not this one.,1.0
"The item arrived looking good enough but as soon as I opened it, the back of the box fell off. The more I touched it the more pieces came off.",1.0
I hate it because i was so happy  at first to get it But it never go to my house,1.0
"I received this set and opens the box and it was falling apart.  I expected a better quality given the reviews and description.  The paints looked lame and the ""tools"" inside were cheapo plastic.

Next.....",1.0
It is a great product because it had the best materials thar you can use to draw nice drawings. Thank you!,1.0
the case was broken when it arrived. I was less than thrilled with it. I guess I just got a bad one...,1.0
"This product is like many have said, it is either a hit or a miss with how lucky you are to the state of the contents inside the box. I wanted to like this product, I did, but after having used the pencils. I just could not. And I knew it even when I had purchased this product that these would not be state of the art pencils, but it would have been nice if they did not completely skimp on them. Of the entire set of graphite pencils, maybe three worked well, they all sharpen horribly, which reduced me to using an ancient method of using a razor blade. Which I must say although it works great, I am not particularly a fan of sharp metal... I was one of the lucky few to find nothing broken, at least until I was attempting to get things out of the god forsaken case. It was a cheap plastic crate that held in the contents, which it does a good job of, don't get me wrong, but boy oh boy does it make it a pain in the behind to get the contents out. I snapped the handle part on the mini sandboard paper, and even though I am a bigger guy, it should not be so ridiculously sad of build quality that it snaps prying it from the depths of cheap haven. To the box itself, it is like others have said, it is very cheap, it does what I want, which is hold things in there. I can not say how nice it is to not carry 10 zip lock bags around looking like a crazy cat lady or drug dealer for art supplies. But thats where the good stops, it smelt fresh of paint, which is appalling in the least. You could actually tell they painted this thing before they sent it to me, which although it may have provide a sense of ""your own little case"" it does not because of the build quality. Granted my case has not been as bad as others, and maybe after not having purchased an art case of pencils for so long I was expecting too much, but if I had known that the build quality, the materials quality (especially that god awful crap kneaded eraser), and overall dismay was that bad, I would have saved 26.50 and put together a more expensive, and granted smaller package of art supplies. The only thing this case has going for it is that it hold things well. I do not do this often because I try to be nice, but boy oh boy, avoid this thing like the plague, it will only hinder your art ability, your wallet, and your sense of faith in art products online.",1.0
Ordered this product for a Christmas gift.  After several inquiries (where I was told that the product was on backorder and being processed) I was finally informed that my order was being cancelled because it was unable to be shipped.  The runaround took so long that buying  something similar was a too late to purchase deal. What a disappointment! I will not try ordering anything from this company again.,1.0
"I received the product, it looked nice. My daughter used it maybe 3 times and the hinges started coming apart. The lead was always breaking before you could even sharpen it. Total junk.",1.0
"I did not purchase this set but have purchased two new royal brushes over a month ago. They fell apart in just two uses, 10 mins each about. I contacted the company 3 times and have still never heard back. I will never buy a royal product ever again...",1.0
I bought these a few months ago.  it worked good but when i started to use them more often it started to pull on the fabric causing it to fray.  So i took it to the local knife shop to get it sharpened and said that it doesn't look dull but went ahead and sharpened it.  I cut a piece of fabric right then with the guy and it still wanted to pull on the single piece of fabric.  Save your money and get the $20+ ones that actually does it job. He says it's most likely the scissors itself.  NEVER AGAIN!,1.0
"These are light weight but only the first 2 inches of the scissors work.  Tears the fabric do I can't use them.  Takes to long to cut, I guess you get what you pay for.  Should have spent a little more money which is why I am going to buy another pair.  Need them for all the sewing I do.",1.0
"I don't know if I got a odd one, but something isn't right with these.  Only just over 1 inch cuts well, not toward the tip, not toward the handle.  :(  Pretty much useless. I'm looking for another brand to buy.

UPDATE: 04/11/2016 - I had put these away because they were annoying and useless. I forgot about that and just tried to use them again

USELESS.  To the trash they go, I wouldn't even donate these for some other person to waste their money on.  :(",1.0
"Sorry, Allary, but these were blunt and I returned them for a more pricey and different brand.  I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement.  No questions asked, so I was very pleased with the return policy, thank you.",1.0
These will barely cut paper much less cloth.,1.0
The handle broke off the first time I used them.,1.0
"These won't even cut through one layer of fabric cleanly.  It seemed like a good deal, but next time I think I'll spend the few extra dollars on a better pair.",1.0
"I put them to work as soon as I got them on some light weight jean material. Unfortunately after just a few cuts, the handle snapped off.",1.0
I've used these twice in the time that I've had them and the handle just broke.  Now they are useless to me.  The package says premium quality but that is clearly not true.  Don't waste your time or money buying this product.,1.0
"I am so glad these arrived broken so that I got a full refund because these are the WORST. THE WORST. I absolutely HATE these scissors & it is just maddening to try to cut with a POS pinking shear blade. Again, my order arrived & the pivot joint had been crushed in transit & the handle was broken, so I was able to get a full refund; however I think that the damage was not enough to cause these to be as crappy as they are. Buy something else.",1.0
handle broke the second time I used it.  Went right in the garbage,1.0
"I bought these just last week, used them on typical quilting fabric and they broke within 30 minutes. In between the blades there is a piece that broke and left the scissors worthless.",1.0
"So disappointed.  These broke after 2 uses.  Plastic cheap and just cracked, metal shears crossed and stuck and could not be opened.  Very cheap manufacturing!",1.0
"This product is not sharp enough to cut fabric at all. I have tried with multiple fabrics and the edges are a frayed mess. It works with paper, though, and should only be marked as such.",1.0
It didn't stay sharp and would pull and snap material. Not what I had in mind when I purchased it.,1.0
"I bought two of these for use in my Family and Consumer Sciences class.  They were not sharp at all.  I can't imagine how they are labeled as extra sharp.  I have used Fiskar's pinking shears in the past and while more expensive, at least they perform well.",1.0
"Too bad there's no option for 0 stars. These *might* cut a stiff, paper-thin fabric, but they are useless trying to cut a slightly thicker supple satin. The resulting ""cut"" looks more like a rough tear.",1.0
"After the great reviews, I'm really disappointed with these shears. Even on the most lightweight fabrics, the blades get stuck, requiring two hands to 'force' them open or closed. The cut on the fabric is acceptable once you manage to finish, but I would not purchase this brand.",1.0
"Really disappointed in these! They're dull in certain spots and don't ""pink"" right and have ruined one of my projects.",1.0
too expensive,1.0
"Disappointing. I expected an aluminum hook  to be almost slippery with the yarn gliding easily (cotton yarn). Instead the hook was very grabby the yarn did not glide at all. I even waxed it and thought the grabbiness lessened it is still way more than I can work with. Another thing about this hiook, it does not have the Susan Bates style hook I've been used to for so many decades. I guess this is the ""new"" style Bates hook I've seen so many other complaints about. While not quite as squared off and bulky as the hook of  the Knitter's Pride Waves hook I bought that is nearly unuseable (by me anyway) it is still NOT the Bates hook I used to love. The quality is just not there anymore.",1.0
Cheap knockoff!  Metal part of awl is not the shape shown.,1.0
Junk!,1.0
Received a knock-off version of the awl pictured. The handle is some cheap softwood with a sloppy varnish job and the needle itself was set into the handle crookedly.  It's basically useless.,1.0
"I just got off the phone from Lineco's customer service and what I got is NOT what they manufacture.  Lineco is a great company and I have always gotten quality when I've purchased their goods. The packaging and the product number are correct but the actual object is NOT. This is more like a safe version with the long point converted into a short point. My decades-old sewing awl is sharper than this! I didn't even think to read reviews since the photo and information is exactly what I've wanted for years, but what I got was like others have posted - not the right thing at all!. The handle on this isn't even that nice. It 'looks' right but the finish is not something you would want to use. You would end up with huge holes!

I bought this one through Lineco Ball Handle Awl Sold by: Amazon.com LLC

It broke upon the first use...piercing paper! A useless piece of wood and metal.,1.0
I was quite disappointed when I received this awl. What I received was different from what was advertised. It says in the product description the awl will be six inches in length overall  and the ball would be three inches in width. What I received was four inches in length and a measly one and a half inch ball. The awl was also poorly made with smudges and globs of the wood stain all over it. The needle was crooked and slightly curved which doesn't really help in making books. I used it to make holes and it still worked and it will hold off until I get a new one but what I am upset about is the quality. This product is not worth $11. I would only pay probably $4-$5. Don't buy this if you're a serious bookmaker and invest your money in something that is actually worth it's cost.,1.0
"I'm glad that the other recipients are pleased with this product and I appreciate the time they spent writing their reviews, but what I received is as dull as a cheap (and used) construction nail. The awl is long but there is no bulbus handle and more importantly, there is no fine, sharp point as pictured in the accompanying illustration. I'm  attempting to work through 5 sheets of 20lb paper --not 5 pages doubled which would be 10 pages. I not only have to push pretty hard but I have to push and twist, and push and twist and TWIST to even start making a dent.

A thumb tack would do a better job. This ""awl"" is labeled as having been made in Pakistan and it arrived woven into a piece of heavy-duty, hardboardboard designed to protect the sharp tip of the awl --but there is no sharp tip. Perhaps I received a defective one but I need the tool now -- not in another week. I hate returning things but I'll sending this back for a refund. It's unusabel. I'm certain that I can find something faster and probably cheaper at a local hardware store. After this foray, I'll want to lay eyes on it first. Happy shopping.",1.0

"News Flash!!! Venerable company Faber Castell is taking the PLUNGE with this the 'new and improved' 'TK-9400'. The newer/sleeker/thinner 'TK'  9400 22mm clutch pencil is certainly the thinnest 22mm clutch-type pencil I've ever seen. Along with giving you sweaty hand cramps, for some (anecdotal?) reason It crunches brand new, (expensive) leads like nobody's business! The leads go in and then come out as Kibbles And Bits on your drawing board. That's right, a dog's DINNER....Yummers! Oh and I guess FC weren't willing to splurge on pocket clips for these sleek newer and yes crappy 'TK' 9400's either. On the plus side this pencil won't stay in your pocket for long so you won't be stuck using it! In the meantime get a real Faber Castell clutch pencil (I did). The earlier full-sized '9400' a more substantial slightly earlier (lighter green) ''AW Faber 9400'' proper with the gold knurled metal end and thicker body. They're a couple of bucks more but worth it over these bank giveaway-level so-called ''drafting tools''....",1.0
"I purchased these after much research to use them for fine detail work on my coloring projects.  They are the perfect size for that and the colors seem to be really nice.  I say seem to be because over half of the ones I tried are so dried out they won't even be useful to finish one page in my coloring book.  Very, very disappointing as I used a gift card that I received for my birthday to purchase them.  I would be very cautious in recommending them to anyone especially with the hassle of returning them.  If I had purchased them in a brick and mortar store I would have returned them.",1.0

is everything made like crap these days or is it just me seems how this is a water-based water repellent kinda an oxymoron you can not really apply it to material that's already been waterproofed because the seems sealer simply beads up and runs off so if you're buying this to redo a seam on an already waterproof product you might want to think to try something else this is very frustrating i don't think that many people would try to waterproof a seem on a piece of fabric that's not waterproof to begin with ya,1.0
