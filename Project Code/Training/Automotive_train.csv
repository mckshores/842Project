Good manual. Just what I needed. I would order it again. And this silly site requires me to write a certain number of words for a review. Who came up with that?,5.0
"covers the bikes listed in the description, also gives some coverage to older models. a good resource for the DIY, or if you want to start learning about your bike and how to take care and work on it. between this manual and youtube, this is nothing I have wanted to do that I have not been able to very very easily.",5.0

We bought this for a friend. He was very pleased to receive this Triumph : Bonneville book! It came in handy when he needed help for his motorcycle!!,5.0

"Very nice map!  I used to when I went to Nor Cal (obviously).  I love the GPS tags that show you where the good roads are.  These came in handy so much that I wish they had more scattered throughout the map, especially the beginning and ending of the dirt roads.  Not big deal as there are ways around this with a Garmin and/or Cell phone.  The print can be small at times but it never inhibited the map in any way.  I found it was easier to do research with this map than use it on the open road, but I did both.  Yellow, red, and orange routes were as described!",5.0

Convenient on my Keychain and is secured by a good strong magnet (which can also be used for identifying ferrous materials when the pen is removed}.,5.0
"This a phenomenal little emergency pen. The build quality is rock solid--it's a little tube of stainless steel. The magnetic cap is plenty strong. I keep it on my key chain, and the pen has never once come loose or fallen off. The magnet is strong enough to give you a very satisfying snap when you insert or remove the pen. Inadvertently detaching the pen is quite unlikely. At under 3 inches long, it fits nicely in my key chain with my car keys. You can use any standard multi-pen refill. I use Fisher Space Pen U1F or U4F universal refills.

----------------------
EDIT: March 15, 2016

So this is still the best tiny keychain pen. The magnetization on the cap is strong and solid, and the pen is shorter than my car key. However, there are a few changes to the design since I last ordered this pen in late 2014. These details are noted below and in the pictures that I have uploaded.

First, the picopen has increased in length from a bit over 3"" to now a bit over 3.25"". In addition, the thickness of the pen has increased from what used to be approximately the thickness of a standard USB cable to what is now just shy of the thickness of a 6.35 mm audio jack... or a little bit bigger than the grounding prong of a three-prong electrical plug (sorry, I don't have a caliper handy for better measurements).

Second, the design of the top of the pen has changed slightly. As can be seen in my pictures, the older Picopen had a tiny lip at the top of the pen, where it connected with the cap. The newer design is a smooth cylinder.

Third, the cap design has changed quite substantially. In the older design, a magnet was attached just inside the cap rather shallowly. When you put the cap onto the pen, the magnet inside the cap gripped onto the lip of the pen (see pictures). With the newer design, the cap is nearly twice as long, and the magnet is recessed much deeper within the cap. Because of the recessed design, the newer cap slides down the shaft of the pen nearly a quarter inch more. Also, as far as I can tell, the magnet on the newer pen is a fair bit stronger than on the old pen. These design choices make it much less likely for the pen to accidentally become detached and fall off your keychain (though that never was a problem for me with the old pen).

Fourth, the mechanism for gripping the ink refill has changed on the new pen. On the old pen, the refill just slides in. It's a lightly firm fit, but it feels as though you're just sliding the ink refill into a cylindrical metal tube. You slide the refill in all the way until it hits the back of the pen and stops. The new pen is quite a bit different. Though I am unable to see inside the shaft of the new pen, it feels as though there is a spring that grips the ink refill as you slide it in. The spring resists the ink refill from going into the pen shaft at the very top, but once you have the refill in a little bit, it slides in very firmly. When the ink refill is inserted all the way, pushing on the top of the refill reveals a little bit of springiness. I'm sure everyone has used a retractable pen at some point in their life that, when they press down on a piece of paper, the ink refill has a very small amount of give/springiness. The new Picopen is like that, whereas the refill in the old Picopen is rock solid and has no give. I assume there is probably a small spring underneath of the ink refill that you compress as you push it in which causes this.

Fifth, as mentioned above, I use Fisher Space Pen U1F/U4F pressurized refills for my Picopen. Even though the U1F/U4F are standard multipen sizes and are almost exactly the same size as the ink refill that comes with the Picopen, the refill gripping mechanism in the new Picopen strongly resists accepting the Fisher refills. You have to wiggle and push the Fisher refills pretty hard to get them past the initial resistance of the new Picopen before they will slide in, and as you do so, it feels as though you might break whatever spring is inside of the new Picopen. Perhaps this problem will fade with time as you put some wear and tear on the new Picopen. I suspect that reason for the difficulty in getting the Fisher pen refills into the new Picopen is because the tip of the Fisher refills are capped--since they're pressurized--whereas the ink refill that comes with the Picopen has a hollow end (see pictures).",5.0
I really like this pen! I wasn't sure it would be useful at first but I've already been through two refills (cross 8518-4). Twice in the past two years the pen has gotten separated from the top while removing it from my pockets but so far I'm 100% lucky in noticing immediately and finding it.,5.0
"Great product. Its my everyday carry pen. Instead of putting it on my keys, I hang it on a zipper pocket. I just pull down instead pen. Now I can jot something down whenever. Not sure, how to change the ink. Like the product.",5.0
"People I've given these to love them. Too expensive to buy for myself. The pen really stays in the cap, and it comes out easily when you want it.",5.0
"Absolutely perfect pocket pen, in a pinch.  You wouldn't want to write with this little beauty for long periods of time, unless you've got very small hands (I've tried).  But in a pinch, it does a fantastic job.  It's an indispensable addition to any keychain.  ""Waiter, do you happen to have a pen?  We've got our check but we just need something to sign it with."" (Only to wait for what feels like forever)  - Me before my new PicoPen.",5.0
"I loved this pen (yes, past tense) because although the magnet worked pretty good, unfortunately not good enough!
I went to use it one time and it was gone, I guess the magnet let go. Kind of expensive to keep replacing so it lasted about 1 month before it disappeared, big bummer.",5.0
I am the most forgetful when it comes to pens so this is perfect and barely noticeable on my minimal key chain,5.0
"great, in my wallet but tsa still doesnt know what it is. always and issue. Top should fasten to body when using it, almost lost it.",5.0
Cool pen,5.0
Great!!!,5.0
"So far, after several month on my key chain, all is good. I've used the pen a few times, but mostly I use it to spin my keys around for fun. I did install a Fisher pressurized ink cartridge so I could write upside down under whipped cream.

UPDATE 3/15/2017- Thought I lost the pen, but found it in my car's trunk. The Fisher refill is DEFINITELY the way to go. The original ink cartridge failed a few times too many. The Fisher always works 100%",5.0
"Too many times I found myself needing a pen and there was none in sight.  Picopen solved that problem.  It's light, tiny, and attaches to one's keychain.  The pen itself is attached to its cap magnetically and securely.  This is a well made product that serves my need.  I highly recommend it.",5.0
This is a must have if you are working on a car. If you own a car this should be your first investment whether you are going to work on it or not.,5.0
The item arrived quickly and I was able to use the manual to help fix the 1995 Toyota Tercel.  The manual doesn't exactly cover that year but the info is pertinent.  The manual helps when trying to troubleshoot a problem.  The book was clean and arrived in good condition.,5.0
Has an index of ideal equipment to keep. Depicts engine and individual parts. Shows where to locate the parts and their names. Never to be blindsided any more. It portraits scenarios and possible solutions. Just perfect.,5.0
"PROS

1) This manual helps with small repairs that can cost over $100 if you were to take it to a mechanic.
2) It gives you several tips on how to have your car running at its best.
3) It contains many details that will help the average person.
4) It is a good compliment to the genuine Nissan Sentra service manual (look it up, especially on eBay).

CONS

1) The pictures are only in black and white, except for the pictures on the front and back cover of the book.
2) The manual is from 1999. So, it has not been updated for possible errors or improvements.",5.0

UPDATE- I found someone with this same book but their version does not contain the updates mine does on newer ac systems. I imagine that now only the updated versions are sold but who knows. This may be why some people have complained about the book being outdated.",5.0

"I get one of these for every vehicle I purchase and let me tell you, they make any person with little to no knowledge on how to work on vehicles an expert in what needs to be done to fix your vehicles problem.  Some things need special tools and require a certified mechanic but changing oil, spark plugs, brakes, bleeding your brake lines, etc., that you would typically bring your vehicle to a mechanic for and pay out the wazoo, you get a picture by picture tutorial on how to do it yourself (if you have the time) and save big money (and boost your self esteem).",5.0

"I have owned my '99 Silhouette Van for almost 8 years.  I am to the point now that I am not willing to pay $60 plus per hour to have someone else fix minor issues with it.  Since purchasing the manual, I have replaced the driver side mirror and vent speed controller.  Mirror was $35 and the controller $18.  Both took some time and effort (particularly the vent controller) to replace.  I am guessing the manual has saved me $300 or more in labor costs plus tax.

Who is this manual good for?  On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being Novice and 10 being Expert, I would say a solid 5.  The manual spells out several procedures that most people might not be able to undertake such as changing the spark plugs (have to rotate the engine - not going to happen in my garage).  But, overall, if you pre-read the procedures and take your time, you can accomplish most tasks found in the manual.",5.0

"You can learn a lot watching bike mechanics ""operate"".  You can learn what tools to use, and how to apply them, and what pieces fall out when you take something apart.  But who has time to hang around a bike shop?  Wouldn't it be nice to have a book that shows you what to expect, and how to deal with it?  This is it, in Technicolor glory.
Every page of this book has clear color photos showing exactly what to do.  The book is broken down by chapters for the various mechanical systems of the bicycle.  Each chapter goes through the various technologies in use.  (Example: five kinds of brakes.)  Each one is ripped apart and put back together with you.  Each chapter has a section on what tools you will need (and recommendations on saving money).
Haynes is famous for automobile and motorcycle repair books, and this is even better than those: All photos are in color, the steps are broken down and illustrated clearly, with the use of tools shown explicitly.  (This is not always the case with the automotive books, which assume a certain proficiency with mechanic's tools.)  Very nicely done.  I hope they update it periodically as bicycle technology evolves.",5.0

"Clearly, HAYNES having published 1,000's of home-repair

automobile mechanics on 100's of different model cars,

it was time for them to make some extra cash, and do a book

on bicycle repair, too! Having seen the automobile books, they

do come in handy for cars built back in the 80's and some in

the 90's, but increasingly, home repair has become next to

impossible as cars become electronic gadgets and computerized

in all aspects, and I'm not referring to remote car starters,

or even GPS systems or boomerang anti-theft tracking devices,

either.

Specifically, in regards to this book, it has a lot of glossy

color photos, but only average desktop publishing skills in

arranging text, and photos. It's practical, for sure, and is not

introductory, either.

Part of this book, reminds me of PARK TOOL's school manual they

give out after their quick weekend-course on bicycle

maintenance, in the sense that dozens of different specialized

tools are seen in the pictures, that the home mechanic will not

have, obviously, and considering they're specialized tools, with

low sales volume, are probably very costly to acquire from PARK

themselves, or through your LBS.

The final conclusion on this book, is that it's definitely worth

the price, if you're interested at all, in maintaining a bike,

doing work on it, and repairs. I'm not referring to high-end

bikes, MTB's or road costing $1000's of dollars, but your low-

end, mass-marketed and sold bikes costing $200, for example.

It has walk-thru's, color pictures, diagrams, explanations,

lists tools you need to do the work to repair so-and-so

situation, is sturdy, and almost 200 pages.",5.0

"This is a great instructional book for bicycle maintenance. It is written so that a novice in bicycle repair can understand the procedures.

"This volume contains even more information than previous Haynes manuals I have used.  It contains good, clear photographs of various parts of the car in place and partially dismantled, not just line drawings. I was pleasantly  surprised to find information on how to get the ""check engine  soon"" light to go out after changing oil and other service procedures.  It also includes a pretty complete set of wiring diagrams.  These are  things not always found in car repair manuals for the do-it-yourselfer.",5.0
"This manual is well worth the approx $20 investment. It will pay for itself upon 1st use for a repair, or to find technical and reference  info, in order to confidentally consider and take on a repair on your own.

I have used this manual for years. Very thorough and well written for use in shop. I am not a mechanic but feel like I could do many jobs a mechanic could with this book.

"haynes is much better than the chilton for anything more in depth than changing oil and spark plugs. i only had the chilton when i changed my cv boots, and the chilton manual omits a lot of small but important details  ie. pins holding the drive shafts on my legacy are inserted into a tapered  hole. the holes look the same if you are not watching for this. changing  the clutch is also a pain with the chilton book. with the haynes i have  been able to do everything from the top end of my supra to replacing my  brake system.",5.0

The car did not have any type of manual.  We needed a guide to help us with some service issues.  This repair manual was an excellent source of information.,5.0
I have this one as well as a Chilton.  In all honesty I'd have to say I prefer this one actually.  It lays everything out in very simple step by step processes (with pictures for those of us that aren't too mechanically savvy) HIGHLY recommend this!,5.0
The book arrived quickly and looked new. I think it was great service and quality for a used item. priced rite as well,5.0
"The book was brand new, and it came quickly.  I had previously ordered this book from eagleretailers on ebay and it ended up going to the wrong address.  More than 2 months after I ordered it I still had not received it, so I cancelled my order and ordered it from Amazon instead and had the book within a week.  I'm happy with the product and service.",5.0
"This guide gives readers the mechanical confidence to wrench beyond the standard oil change.  If you are deciding between Hanes and Chiltons, go with Haynes.

I rebuilt an entire 1995 2.2 liter subby engine in my garage, relying primarily on this text and Youtube.  Its been running like a champ since August 2012.  Prior to this rebuild I had never removed nor done any major engine work.

Save your money.  If they can do it, you can do it.",5.0
The book I ordered arrived promptly. Amazon provided good information on the progress of the order.,5.0
"This is a very typical Haynes manual. Great detail about simple things you could figure out on your own, and then it glosses over complex things that leave you clueless and lost.

That said, I used this manual to work on my Legacy wagon for years before I sold it. I gave the manual to the guy who bought the car from me. It is good for describing things that are unique to Subarus and to the Legacy in particular. It is a great time-saver when you haven't done something before on that type of car. But if you are going to be doing serious repairs on the car, get the manufacturer's service manual instead and save yourself some time and frustration.",5.0
"I have not done as much work as I might have liked, so I have opened the book relatively little. In what little I have used it, it has been more reassuring than helpful--for instance, the book confirmed that the rear hatch lifter supports come without the entire ball-joint assembly, and that there is little one can do about this. Not really helpful, but reassuring for someone who wonders what is going on.

I consider the book satisfactory for its purposes, and I am glad I own it.",5.0
"In my opinion, short of an actual manufacturer's shop manual, you can't beat a Haynes book for completeness. And, given that they are written for the non-professional, in some ways they are far superior. Based on complete engine tear-down and rebuild, and covering standard repairs and maintainence, I never buy anything else.

If you are even reasonably handy, like to save money on basic (or even complex) repairs, this is the book for you.",5.0
"I have owned 3 Subaru Outbacks, 1996, 1998, and 2004, and I have found this manual to be useful with all of them.  I am only doing the home mechanic types of repairs, so for things like changing and bleeding brakes, spark plugs, fuel filters, thermostats, it has saved me a lot of guess work.  Not sure I would want it if I had to do a timing belt or head gaskets, or any other sort of major engine tear down.  Great manual for GENERAL MAINTENANCE.",5.0
"After having this and a Chilton's manual side by side, the Haynes book wins hands down.  There is less ambiguity and more info, tips, tricks, and warnings.  Diagrams are clearer.  There's still room for improvement, but aside from experience, it seems to be the best option around for keeping yourself out of trouble.  ;-)",5.0
"Of course this manual is not as detailed as a full shop manual, but it gave a hack amateur mechanic like me the information I was looking for regarding how to troubleshoot a high mileage '99 Town and Country.  Web sites can be useful, but they're not a substitute for a book with detailed information regarding how and what and where.",5.0
My husband purchased this manual guess this was ok as he used it ans didn't have any problems or complaints about it.,5.0
"I ordered it. It came as promised. I read it when Im fixing something on my Plymouth Voyager. My van is very happy. When its happy, it runs. When it runs, Im happy! We all live happily ever after. Amen.",5.0
"Received the repair catalog in very good condition, and very timely manner. Thank you for a very good first time customer experience.",5.0
"Save your money on Chilton. They do not hold near the information, clarity and in depth detail, thus VALUE, that Haynes Repair Manuals do. Having said that, I would like to address some complaints I've come across about both Haynes
and Chilton's Manuals.
1.) If your manual suggests at a point to seek professional input it is because MOST NON mechanics don't possess the skill or tools or shop equipment to perform a certain procedure (be it correctly or safely). The publishers' lawyer insisted on the ""seek professional input"" so as not to take on legal liability for an unqualified person attempting to perform a critical step in their car care. The reason is valid. You can injure yourself and damage your vehicle as well as render your
vehicle unsafe to be on the road.
2.) Prior to purchasing a repair manual, LOOK THROUGH IT. Almost every auto parts store in America sells Haynes and / or Chilton's. If the particular manual you need doesn't have the plastic removed, look for a manual that does and look through the sections. CAUTION most auto supply stores will get mad and make you buy anything you rip open. They're trying to sell information contained in the manual, not give it away. Some copies are USUALLY open and can be looked
 at. Does the manual seem logical, good pictures? Thorough? Then CHANCES ARE that brand will be a good choice for your repair. Also READ the cover front & back thoroughly. It will tell you if special vehicles aren't covered (AWD, Alternate Fuel Vehicles, etc) Know what vehicle you have so you get the RIGHT manual. The correct year, make, model, engine size.
3.) If you do encounter a problem in the middle of a repair, it's possible that it is YOUR not doing something correctly. Not the tool, or the repair manual. Go away from the car, get lunch or a cold glass of lemonade, read through the manual. Even start again in the morning.
4.) As automobiles become more sophisticated, there is truly less and less that a vehicle owner can do him or herself. It is a fact, you will need to take your vehicle into a dealership or well equipped shop for more things. In addition, used oil and other fluids are difficult to dispose of. DO NOT THROW DOWN YOUR DRAIN OR BURY IN YOUR BACKYARD!!!. Tires, batteries all have special disposal needs.
5.) There are some people WHO ARE NOT MECHANICAL. Buy them books, audio / video equipment, ties for Christmas. NOT A WRENCH SET!
6.) Neither Haynes nor Chilton are Professional Shop Manuals (these are available for hundreds of dollars).
As for the particular manual for the Haynes (ASIN: 1563923580) Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town & Country from years 1996 through 1999: This manual does NOT COVER All-Wheel Drive nor Alternative Fuel Models AND SAYS SO ON THE COVERS. Haynes breaks down into different sections each of the engine options (in this example: 4 cylinder,3.0 liter V6, 3.3 liter V6, and 3.8 V6) If you're say, changing an air filter, make sure you're looking at the right directions for the engine for the vehicle you have. The different engines have important items positioned in different locations and thus DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS for each item on each engine. You can even utilize Amazon ""take a look inside"" feature to check out if this manual is for you or not. .I checked it's description for changing wiper blades, oil and oil filters, air filters and general repairs and found it both accurate and easy to understand. I've been happy with Haynes manuals over the years and recommend all vehicle owners purchase one even if you don't expect to do any repair or service yourself. It helps to know the information, to be aware of how your car works and to talk in a reasonably intelligent manner (on your part anyway) when you take your vehicle in for service.
I'm happy with this purchase. And have been with every Haynes manual I've bought and used in the last 20 years.

VW Passats are hard vehicles to work on.  This repair manual has about everything you need to work on your card except wiring.,5.0
"I have used the Haynes manuals to maintain all my own cars.  They have always provided the information I needed, along with very useful comments on how to proceed.  Unlike other DIY manuals, Haynes does not try to cover too many different models - thus their information is much less confusing and specific to the model you are working on.  I have done things like changing timing belts, replacing cams hafts, etc.  I'm just a homeowner working in my own garage.  Get the Haynes manual, watch some You Tube videos, and you are good to go!",5.0

I bought this book to help my machine and now we have no problems.,5.0
"Great Price and cheaper than local retailers, as well as others that I shopped online. A must have for Passat owners!",5.0
"While not being as comprehensive as the factory service manual, it certainly peals back enough layers to make what can be a pretty intimidating vehicle to work on, fairly approachable. It got me through a timing belt and oil change with only minor hiccups, (the timing belt set missed some critical pictures, but was clear enough to figure out the tension). This book in concert with online videos from other sources will get you through most repairs.",5.0
"I've used Haynes manuals for a number of my vehicles over the years - they're hard to beat for the price and cover pretty much everything a shade-tree mechanic will want to tackle.  For completeness (on VWs), I usually also get the Bentley manual, as well, but they are pricier and not as easy to follow, at times.",5.0

"I think it does the trick for the price. A good manual to own if you're looking to save money when feasible with DIY projects. In addition to step-by-step procedures, there's a good amount of useful general vehicle maintenance information. Step by step procedures will often be supplemented with youtube videos. I'm definitely satisfied with the purchase. Gonna purchase one for my other car as well.",5.0
"Alright, there are 20 other reviews here, so I'll keep mine short.

1. It talks about easy (comparatively) to do maintenance and repair.

2. I used the information in this book IN ADDITION TO a whole bunch of youtube videos. I look at it as a reference and complimentary material to what you can find on the internet.

3. The torque ratings on many bolts is written in this book and is not easy to find on the internet. a big PLUS. Basically this takes a big question mark out of the equation and gives you confidence. (""Have I screwed up by over tightening this bolt? Maybe I should have paid a mechanic to do it?!"" No silly, just use a torque wrench and you'll be more accurate than your average mechanics shop.)

4. Everyone complains about the cheap paper, but somehow the paper gets less dirty when I flip through it with greasy and dirty hands in the garage. Just saying.",5.0

by doing the repairs myself.  Instructions were clear and right on.  Thank you",5.0
After looking through this manual I have found it to be very informative but lacking in a few areas. It needs to be a little more specific in some ares.,5.0
Great reference manual all my needs and great money saver at such a great price.....would recommend this products to others,5.0
manual proved to be very helpful in a couple small repairs I had to make. pretty sure I will come in handy in the future,5.0
"i mean really if you don't have any knowledge working on your vehicle then don't work on it, but if you want to learn and try the 'simple' things this book is great!!! even the adv stuff makes it seem easy.

was  new and  helpful,5.0
I've always purchased one of these for every vehicle I've owned; indispensable for maintenance and making repairs.,5.0
I have one of these for every vehicle I own. Probably the very best accessory you can buy for ANY vehicle. A monkey with a wrench can fix a vehicle using one of these manuals. Too bad more shops don't use them!,5.0
"I have had use with CHILTON, but Chilton I think is more domestic base, because when it came to imports it lack the overall of the vehicle you are working on. In other words, Haynes expresses between 4cycl to 6cycl, 4x2 or 4x4 on repairs; where as Chilton is broad when it says Nissan pickup trucks; and doesn't break it down as far as all pickup trucks are the same; which they are not! Haynes in my opinion individualizes your vehicle; such as Xterra time frame to the frontier time, same chassis and engine. Chilton would have never told me about that, and not thinking of looking at Xterras, only specially frontiers. Also, the price is significantly less with Haynes compare to Chilton.",5.0
Great Shape. Just what I needed to help get the job done on the truck. I enjoy getting all my car manuals from Amazon!,5.0
"So far so good being a guide for my 2001 Xterra.  Only done the basics so far (oil changes, spark plugs - the worst possible piece of maintenance on the v6 Xterra -, and brake pads) but its got me through it step by step.",5.0
"It's what you would expect from a Haynes manual: concise, detailed, pictures of the parts and repairs being done, etc. I've been able to keep my 2001 Frontier on the road now with over 164,000 miles on it, no serious repairs, and all the basic maintenance being done in my home garage.

The book is a little light on the front suspension and some of the optional equipment (i.e. cruise control, fog lights), but otherwise it hits the nail on the head.",5.0

"I truly believe that every car owner should purchase a Haynes manual to go with their car. Even the most seasoned DIY owner can be thrown off by the unfamiliar designs of their new car and owner's manuals can often be lacking in certain critical areas (and as seems to be the very bizarre case with Audi A4s of the B6 and B7 generation, the owner's manuals oftentimes seem to just be lacking- as in totally absent from the car. It's a very well known thing... check it out), so something which goes into deeper detail is a must. Having all the torque specs, gap settings, bolt types, fluid levels, OEM part numbers, etc., a book like this is essential. As simple as Google is to use, it can be frustrating to try and look up torque specs on a car that is known for having a gang of gnomes seemingly roaming around stealing the manuals, then you go onto a forum, ask what the torque specs are, and the first reply you get is ""Read the manual""

Even in cases where the manual is there, 99% of what is contained within the pages of the Haynes manual isn't there. If you're just looking to change the plugs and belt on your car, this is the manual for you. If you're looking to rebuild the head and you're comfortable with the job- this is the manual for you.",5.0
"I recommend everybody purchasing a repair manual for any vehicle.  Even if you're not mechanically minded and don't intend on doing any repairs yourself, being somewhat familiar with the inner workings of your vehicle will help you to properly maintain your vehicle as well as assist a professional in properly diagnosing and repairing an issue.  This could save you some bucks down the road and potentially protect you from a crooked mechanic that wants to replace your muffler bearings or flush your blinker fluid reservoir.",5.0

Haynes does it again. Written in straight forward language which was easy to understand. All the major areas I wanted to see were in this manual.,5.0
"Another in a series of fine Haynes manuals and a must for Civic owners even if you're not a shade tree mechanic. Procedures are described in detail and accompanied by photos and diagrams. If your auto shop says you need a brake job and it's $800, look at the procedures and maybe you'll either do it yourself or see why you're willing to pay someone else to do it. Also includes troubleshooting tips, periodic maintenance chores anyone can & should do, 'check engine' trouble code maladies and remedies, etc.
Note to other DIY'ers: No manual is a panacea. Use this (or any) manual in conjunction with YouTube, Google, Chilton manuals and your friendly parts desk guy/gal's advice. Just don't lend your Haynes manual to a friend and expect to get it back soon. It's a great reference tool.",5.0

"With factory suggested maintenance of just checking the fluids and changing the oil until 36,000 miles, with just an air filter replacement at that point, I'll do my own maintenance with the guidance offered in this manual.

"If you're a shade tree mechanic like me, then you need a repair manual. Honestly, this is not the best, but i guarantee it will get the job done. Money will spent i say.",5.0
You'll know everything you need about your car. Very helpful. Have had it during 4 years and I'm still getting useful answers from it.,5.0
"I bought this manual when the repairs from an auto-shop started to be more expensive than the worth of my car.  I figured if I can start repairing some stuff myself, I could save hundreds of dollars. I am by no means mechanically inclined...I haven't taken any classes relating to motors or mechanics.  This book has helped me save literally thousands of dollars by me doing repairs myself.

The only problem I have is that some of the steps require you to have some understanding of mechanical jargon.  Luckily a quick search on Google usually explains what a word or process means and I'm on my way.  If this book had a glossary of terms it would be better.

If you have an older car where repairs by a professional would not be cost effective, I would trust a Haynes manual to help you fix it.",5.0
quality manual with all the necessary information for DIY work at home.  called numerous auto parts houses with prices between 20 and 50% higher than here.  saved money and got the item in a timely manner.,5.0

"every time i buy a car i buy a haynes manual for it. most people have no idea how easy some repairs are or scheduled maintenance is. haynes makes the basic things much easier and well the harder things will take some time. anyways these manuals are essential for d.i.y. people. if you have a si then of coarse there will be some things left out because it has a different engine. you can buy a si supplement manual from honda for that. oh yeah, i didn't have any printing issues with my book like the previous reviewer.",5.0
"I'm not a machanic, but with this Haynes manual I now have the confidence to do almost every minor and moderate repair to my vehicle.  Thanks Amason and Haynes.",5.0

"worth every penny in time saved under the car.  not quite as good as the big old chiltons  manuals or the manufacturer's service manual but damn close.  I have hte haynes for honda civic, chevy corvette, dodge dakota and they are all top notch this mazda was no exception.",5.0
"I have a Haynes manual for every vehicle I own. These manuals go in depth from top to bottom front to back.

Book was helpful and answered the few questions that I had left for my repair. Not the most detailed but it has all the details u need.,5.0

My Husband was thrilled,5.0
Always a great book.,5.0
"Remember if the choice is available between Chilton and Haynes. Always choose  Haynes. I have had one of their manuals for the last 3 vehicles I have owned and they have saved me THOUSANDS of dollars in repair costs. I particularly like the troubleshooting section based on symptoms/ noises, very handy. I am not the only person that will tell you this. Ask any old car guy that has been doing this for 20+ years they will tell you it's a good idea to have one of these manuals no matter how skilled in mechanics you are. NEVER BUY A CAR WITHOUT ONE OF THESE MANUALS!!!",5.0

"I've always bought one of these for my car when I purchase it, it gives you decent visual pictures of the items you want to locate, and the information of what tools you'll need.

"i have had haynes or chiltons manuals for every vehicle we've owned for many years now other than for our jaguar and that we just leave to the dealership. when we picked this vehicle, the hhr we got it as a running around vehicle. i assumed it would be simple to find a manual and do all those things i am used to doing so we don't have to drive all the way into town for every little thing. but i was so wrong, checked three different auto parts stores in person and online and none carried haynes or chiltons for the hhr. checked the dealer, no, checked online with the hhr owners forum said none were available. even checked with amazon online granted it was last may but still i hoped but no such luck. then on a whim i checked again two weeks ago and there she was. i didn't hesitate to buy it and literally as soon as had mine ordered the other had been sold as well. i just got the manual in the mail yesterday and could not be happier. i have absolutely no plans to rebuild the engine or tear into the electronics but no i can at least change a headlight bulb, aim the headlights, swap out the oil filter, cabin air filter, the very difficult to figure out access to the engine air filter, capacities and so many other things i don't have to rely on others to do for me now as well as saving a small fortune in labor costs to do things i am perfectly capable of doing now with haynes in hand! unless you have a vehicle like a jaguar or range rover for example you really must have a manual like this. it is the best investment for the dollar you can make in your vehicle imho.",5.0
Finally found this book that is a great reference manual for any DIY.  I had been unable to find it locally going back to 2007.  Immediately was able to find what I was looking for making the routine maintenance procedure much easier and quicker.,5.0
Anyone who does all their own maintenance or just wants to back up what mechanics tell them will find this book more than just useful.,5.0
"Considering that the factory manual for the HHR now costs $200, this is a bargain. All the average owner will ever need. This manual covers the things that most owners will attempt on their own and has many illustrations. I have many factory manuals that I have bought over the years. Most of the information in the factory manual is not needed unless you are a professional mechanic dealing with the car daily.",5.0
Great book for making repairs.  Essential for beginner DIYers like me.  Tells you step by step how to do stuff.  It matched with YouTube is a great thing.,5.0
"I've already used this book to change my serpentine belt, spark plugs and oil. There's a lot of good information. I bought the Mercury Cougar repair several years ago and it came in very handy.",5.0
The owners manual doesnt tell you everything about the car if you need to know how to perform some types of maintenance. This manual will allow those that are mechanically inclined to do routine and not so routine work on on whatever vehicle you buy it for. It is also cheaper than what I would have paid if I bought it at an autoparts store.,5.0
"I'm a big fan of Haynes Repair Manuals, but I was a little concerned when I looked at picking this one up for my 2010 Mazda 3. You see, in 2010, Mazda redesigned the 3 virtually from the ground up - it was a FULL model redesign. Often, when this happens, Haynes releases a completely new manual for the new model (e.g. 2010+) instead of just slapping the entire run of the car together. I took a chance and ordered the guide.

Haynes impressed me once again - this book deftly describes the differences between the 2010+ model of the 3 and the 2004-2009 model; it truly covers both series of the Mazda 3.

It's worth noting that another user mentioned the book doesn't cover the Mazdaspeed version of the 3. Since I own a i Touring, this didn't affect me at all, but if you own a Mazdaspeed, take heed of the note.",5.0
Great on finding where you need to work and parts to get.,5.0

One brake job in the driveway paid for the book several times over. I never get a vehicle without then getting the Haynes manual for it.,5.0
"Never leave home without 'em.  You never know when the mechanic will need them.  Once, found a short circuit that caused the glove compartment light to signal a left turn (flashing with the turn indicator) by following the wiring diagram to find where those two circuits were in the same piece of wiring harness (on a late 70's Lincoln).  (The harness was ""squashed"" and shorting under the battery tray!!!)",5.0
"I got the factory manuals when I bought my Optima in 2004 since I figured on keeping the car until the wheels fall off.

The problem with the factory manuals is that it assumes I know something, the Haynes doesn't.

Plus the Haynes has lots of pictures, and each one can be worth a thousand words.",5.0

"after reading cover to cover I feel im pretty well sure that a lot of these repairs are above my pay grade , aside from an oil change or spark plug rr I think I'll consult a person with superhuman intelligence to make the other repairs . Thank you VW  for an awesome car and some crazy cool engineering .",5.0
"This book was just like brand new. No show of wear and tear. The price was less than half of what I would have spent at the store.
This is just the thing I needed to help me do some of my own repairs.
Thank you!",5.0
"Amazing guide.  It will guide you step by step on how to change just about everything.  It has everything you need to know from changing oil, to checking the automatic fluid, to changing a battery, to checking the brakes.  An absolute must if you don't know anything about mechanics; like myself.

I was able to change the oil using this guide.  Yes, I know... changing the oil is as simple as sleeping but I had no idea what to do and his guide provided all the information I needed; saved me a good $75 (yes I did pay that much when I took it to a local shop, and I don't think they used the right oil). With this guide I only spent $35 on the oil and the oil filter and I made dang sure I was using the proper oil and oil filter, not some cheap or recycled crap.

Yes you will have to buy tools, but those tools will become an investment and you won't have to pay hundreds of dollars just to get a simple thing fixed.

This guide is for the self-starters and self-reliant, this guide will teach you just about everything you need to know your CTS.  I love my CTS and with this guide I can make sure I give my precious CTS some TLC.

If you are a veteran mechanic then you probably won't learn much, but if you have little to no knowledge about your CTS or cars then there's a plethora of useful information you can use.

Pros:
-It's a $20 investment that could save you THOUSANDS of dollars
-Instructions written in plain English
-Covers everything you need to know about your CTS, even has electrical wiring diagrams!

Cons:
-Some pictures are dark and kind of hard to see the details",5.0
I recently took my present car in for maintenance and was shocked at the prices they wanted to do certain things. I felt that I could do these things with the right instruction.

"I had to have the AC compressor replaced on my 2003 Mini Cooper. A local shop which specializes in BMWs and Minis priced the job at $1650 plus. At the Mini dealership the price would have probably exceeded $2000. One reason for the high price was that the OEM AC compressor was $1200, and the shop would only use this part. On line I found a new OEM compressor, clutch, evaporator and other required parts for $400. I then found a local shop which does not specialize in Mini repair. They would only do the work if I removed the modular front end from the Mini which was required for an AC compressor replacement. I read the Haynes manual and removed the modular front end in less than 3 hours. I then took the car to the local non specialty shop. They replaced everything , but the parts did cost $450, which included recharging the system with Freon and oil. The labor was $200, so I saved at least $1000 for ,4-6 hours of my own labor. I am somewhat mechanically inclined but could not evacuate the Freon or test the electrical systems, so I left this to the professionals, but my labor saved me at least $1000; and I could never have figured out how to remove the modular front end of the Mini without the Haynes Manual.",5.0

Anyone that has the necessary tools can provide their own maintenance at a fraction of the cost of having a professional do it.

Most importantly is with the manual you have the confidence to tackle work you wouldn't have attempted otherwise.

I have used Haynes manuals extensively in the past.

It is a typical Haynes manual - concise, compact and easy to follow.  Some might find the format a bit ""tight"" compared to a Clymer or factory manual.  However all the required information is there.  Electrical diagrams are in colour.  Photographs and diagrams are clear - if a bit small.  Instructions are easy to follow.

Some may find the Haynes physically easier to use with its hard cover and more compact format than a Clymer.

I prefer the Clymer for its layout and its diagrams and photographs.  There are simply more of them.

"The overall fit is superb and does not restrict body movements in comparison to the ST-6000 in the same size.
I'm 5'9"" 38"" chest and 32"" inseam. Long arms.

The material is more flexible and lighter than the SR-6000, and the liner in the AS-3000 makes all movements easier.
The huge zippered gussets in the legs make getting these pants on over boots a breeze, and the wider cuffs and velcro on teh sleeves also helped immensely. The SR-6000 was a pain in general to get on, especially if your leathers got a little wet before putting on the rainsuit.
The longer inseam and better stirrups, plus the addition of suspenders, make movement in the pants a lot less restrictive.
The set-and-forget adjustable elastic waist is a lot more comfortable than the permanently tight waist on the SR-6000.

"XL fit perfectly at 5'10"", 205lbs, 46"" chest and 32"" waist.  Thicker than I anticipated.  A bit harder to stuff into a small space, but I'm sure they will last longer as well.",5.0
Great suit for the price. Seems to be of good quality. I have no doubt it will be waterproof.,5.0
"Came Fast, Fits great...needed for the coming storms...got it quick!!!
Wore it in a Hugh Downpour and came out of it Bone Dry!!!",5.0
Great product.. sizing was right on. I am 6ft tall and 220lbs and the XL size fits great. The pants go over my riding pants comfortably and the jacket fits over or under my jacket. It has been a long cold spring 40-50 most days and have been able to ride in comfort..,5.0
"Just got it so I can only comment on the feel and look...and both are very good. It's not your lightweight, plastic rain gear. I got the 3X so I could wear it over outer heavy clothing but it's a little snug in the waist; I'm hoping there's enough adjustment in the stretchable waist band to let it out.",5.0
Great item,5.0
Only have had it a few weeks but living in Portland we get more than our fair share of rain. Combining this with my boot covers and gloves and I stay completely dry. Also I wear it on cool mornings to help with the wind. Easily fits over my riding jacket and pants. Extremely happy with the set.,5.0
"This rain suit is really well constructed. Water tight and was a life saver on a motorcycle trip to Sturgis and Yellowstone. My buddy had a Harley rain suit that cost way more, but this suit was far superior. I definitely would recommend it. I rode two days in hard rains and stayed dry and warm.",5.0
"Excellent shipping ordered this on July 5th and received it on July 7th.
The jacket fits good but the pants are little to long but should not be a problem
This is a good quality rain suit, it's thick and very sturdy
The jacket is snug around the waist I thought it was a women's XL but after some research found out there made that way
Well worth the price",5.0
It fits and works well keeping the rain out.,5.0
"Bought as a gift for my 18 year old son who thinks he's pretty cool! He loves it!!! It keeps him warm and dry, but it is lightweight and comfortable. It is so nice that he doesn't feel 'uncool' wearing it! He will pull over to put on his rain gear before any of us, so he must really like it!",5.0
Fits true to size.  Kept me dry on my bike during those unfortunate times.  All in all I am happy with my purchase.,5.0
"got the product,  find out that the pant were kind of
to large for me but the coat fit perfectly.
so i bought the medium Joe Rocket RS-2 Rain Suit and
the pants fits me perfectly.  the rain suit is use for bicycle
when raining.  the suit is 100% waterproof,  but have to
put some very warm shirt under the rain suit when it is cold
weather.  i am very happy from the product,  i would recommend
this rain suit to anyone that is sick and tire of getting wet from the rain.
the velcro ajusting on the coat is really great, does not let the rain go
in the coat.  great product.

Sincerely,  Steve",5.0
"This thing keeps me completely dry in the Florida rainstorms. I just wish that A-I could get smaller pants as I'm only 5'4 and B-The pants totally unzipped to make it easier to put on with boots. It does get you warm, but I was surprised at how cool it keeps you while riding. That was a nice plus. I highly recommend and the material is really nice and you will be seen at night in this.",5.0
"I rode my motorcycle into work this morning in the rain.  It's about a 30 min drive and this morning it rained the whole way.  This suit kept me dry (except for a small part under my right knee, weird).  I'm very impressed with this suit.  I like the looks of it and the heavy duty feel to it.  I wish there was a pocket on tge pants but everything else is amazing! Thank you for this great rain suit!  I'm very happy with the price and the product !",5.0

"Please note that the image for this sticker is incorrect (as of September 1st, 2015). The sticker I received does not have an apostrophe in ""don't"". After contacting the seller and researching the flag's history, it turns out the original Gadsden Flag did not have an apostrophe. It was created before the apostrophe became an accepted standard for spelling ""don't"". While it pains me to display a flag that contains incorrect spelling, according to current standards, I definitely prefer to preserve historical accuracy.

Nice sticker. Will be buying more.",5.0

I bought two Barrels of Monkeys - one for my grandson who is 2 and one for his sister who is 4.  They both loved them and don't really play with them as a game but love to make long chains of them.,5.0
Bought this as a gift for my son. He and I play it a lot. Just as much for him as iy was for me many moons ago!,5.0
"Although the quality of the monkeys has diminished since I was a kid, today's monkeys are much fun for my boys as they were for me.

We have accumulated many sets over the past few years, (thanks to donkey kong and the barrell thing).  My boys are forever linking them from everything in our house that they can imagine.  I often find long chains of monkeys hanging around the house in various creative places!

Monkeys are great and they are worth buying a few for the imaginative and creative play that they inspire.",5.0
"My six year old got a Barrel of Monkeys for Christmas.  After dumping them on the table and trying to hook them, we both found it a bit difficult and frustrating and put it aside.  And then I recalled similar feelings from my childhood.  After reflecting on this, I decided, instead, not to dump them on a hard surface, but to hook them from inside the barrel.  This is more fun and the ability to hook more than a very few becomes attainable.  My six year old is now having a great time with the monkeys and has been able to hook seven at a time.  If you're frustrated or bored--try hooking them from inside the barrel--still challenging (especially the last one!) and much more fun.",5.0
"The ""Barrel of Monkeys"" game may be one of the easiest, simplest games ever to be marketed.  It consists of a plastic barrel about the size of a grapefruit filled with little plastic monkeys, arms extended and bent.  (You've seen them, either in Toy Story, 12 Monkeys, or in your genetic memory.  These things have been around forever.)  The goal of the game is to pick up a string of monkeys by holding the top one and looping arms together.  It's about as complicated as pick-up sticks, and more fun -- after all, it's monkey-based.
The fun of Barrel of Monkeys isn't the game.  It's the score of plastic monkeys.  Monkeys are inherently funny, plastic loop-armed monkeys even moreso.  Consider the price, too:  a couple dollars for a whole barrel of monkeys.  How can you /not/ afford to buy it?",5.0
Classic!,5.0
"Big Hit & such a small price!
Buy two & double your fun!",5.0
"Small children love these!  I first gave these to my 1 year old grandchildren to play with, and, of course, the monkeys go in their mouths.  The children will take them out of 1 barrel and put them in the other barrel unless the monkeys are in their mouths.  Now at 2, they don't put them in their mouths, but they still love to play with them.  One day, when older, we will play with the monkeys according to the rules of the game.  I do wash the monkeys before another grandchild plays with them.",5.0
The game was presented to each child invidually ages 4 to 7.  It was a delight to watch how they enjoyed making up their own games with monkeys.  Later we layer the game by the rules of the company.  All the ways were enjoyable.,5.0
Worked how wanted them too thanks,5.0
"These monkeys are cute. I don't have the nostalgia of some of the other reviewers, so it didn't matter to me that they weren't exactly like the old-school ones. They work well and they're well made.",5.0

"I remember these from back in the day and expected much less quality, but was pleasantly surprised how nice a product this was for the price.",5.0
"The monkeys look a little different than they did back in the '90s, but these are still as entertaining for my kids as they were for me. A little on the expensive side, maybe, but I may just feel that way because I had to order one set per kid since there's only ten in a barrel.",5.0

If it wasn't for my 3 year-old son I wouldn't have purchased the barrel of monkeys but now we have them and he LOVES playing with them and I admit I love it too.  They are exactly how I remember them!,5.0
This is the very same product that I remember having as a kid some 40 years ago. My granddaugher loves playing with them.,5.0
"In addition to the intended use they make a great bath toy because they float, don't hold water (and don't grow mold). They usually live hanging from the basketball net in his room.",5.0
Purchased for our 3 year old for Christmas - We wanted a classic toys Christmas and this was the perfect addition.,5.0

"Perfect little barrel of fun for my two year old, we actaully got 13 monkeys!  Not sure if that is the norm.",5.0
"It was as described and as a surprise the monkeys were blue just like the barrel! I'm hoping to get a variety, but the company sends random barrels, so we will see what happens. If the company reads these reviews pink is a requested color.",5.0
My 6 year old has fun with this game. It is challenging for him but with practice he can do it. I love the classic games.,5.0
This toy really helps my 15 month olds motor skills. Taking the monkeys out of the barrel and placing them back in.,5.0
"Can't beat the classic barrel of monkeys game!  Even my 2 year old loves linking them together.  She can't really play by the rules just yet but loves the game anyway!  Love that we got the classic red color, but would have been happy with any of the bright colors!",5.0
I got them for my 2 yr old Toy Story fanatic and they came in blue he made the connection and made them part of the gang right away.,5.0
This toy came within a few days and was in packaging as described.  Classic toy for a fantastic price!!!  Very satisfied,5.0
I didn't even know there was a game involved with this toy before reading the other reviews.  The point of a barrel of monkeys isn't to play a game - it's to play with a bunch of monkeys linked arm in arm.  My 2 year old son dumps them out and practices cleaning up.  We use them to talk about quantity and counting.  We tell stories with them.  We link their arms and string them around the house (or off my glasses or his hat).  It's a barrel of monkeys - don't over think it.,5.0
"My son recently received a Power Wheels jeep that had been in use for over 3 years before he got it.  The batteries had not been charged as specified in the instructions, and they died shortly after he started using it.  The jeep couldn't run on concrete, much less on grass.
I replaced both existing batteries with these, which incidentally are a different colour from the picture, and the jeep now runs fine on most surfaces.
It requires 18 hours charging time before you can use the batteries, so be prepared for some impatience before the vehicle can actually be used.  You have to charge them after each use, and also once a month if the vehicle is not in use, at 16 hours each time.
Tech support from Fisher Price is non-existent in my part of the world, where 800 numbers are not accessible, because their site doesn't have a customer service or tech support e-mail address listed.  I needed important information, because I learned that the model I have was recalled for electrical problems, and I wanted to see exactly which parts needed to be fixed to solve the problem.
I'm sure that these batteries will last a long time with proper care, but wish the tech support was better",5.0

"Used on a dual battery barbie jeep and a single battery caterpillar dump truck.  If you have a 6v  powerwheels from the 90's with the white single battery plug or the dual battery plug, the plug needs to be converted to this type of socket.  It's under a recall.

"Battery works great. Seems to last longer than my son's attention span when driving the car. Just a side note, after doing my research, I thought this was the proper replacement battery for the Lightening McQueen car. It is not. The connector didn't match what was on the car. Being a bit handy I was able to make my own connector for both the car and the battery so it wasn't a big problem. Just make sure that this connector matches the one on your car or truck.",5.0

"Battery is what's required for the 4 wheeler. Plugs right in and works fine. My 3 year old grandson has no trouble taking it in and out and charging it. It takes over night to fully charge it and he puts it on early in the morning and plays with it on and off most of the day. He has a lot of fun playing with the 4 wheeler.

I recommend buying it if you need it.",5.0

Make sure you get the right one (6V or 12V) and the right connector. This was a direct replacement for the original battery that died after a few years of use. It works well and holds a good charge. Don't forget to charge your battery after each use and over the winter for longer life.,5.0

I have a 2 year old and those PW vehicles can be pretty pricey. So, I stopped and asked if it worked. The man said it did but it needed a battery and batteries for PW are really expensive. Needless to say my next stop was to Amazon, which had the PW battery for far less than I could have bought it any store. Very happy.",5.0

"This Power Wheels 6-Volt Rechargable Battery arrived quickly and in great condition.  We immediately plugged it in to charge it up for the recommended time.  We felt like we were taking a chance somewhat since we were fairly sure it was the battery, but not 100 percent.  Something could be wrong with the F-150 Power Wheel truck also.  So, holding our breath, we plugged it in and it worked.  When my 7 and 3 yr old grandkids come over they ride the truck all over, and I have a 3 yr old living with me, and he likes to go for a drive every day or so.  We try to charge it after every drive as recommended, but did slip up and it almost went dead.  I had to use a tiny power wheel to push it home by myself with a toddler who had not learned to steer.  It's recommended to not let the battery drain.  We recharged the battery again, and it seemed to have even more power.  We did compare the battery to the Fisher Price website to ensure we were getting the right item.  It plugged right in with no problems.  I would totally recommend this battery because the price so far has been the best that I've found.",5.0

"I received a used Barbie Jazzy Jeep Wrangler (model B2077) from a friend with the intention on giving it to my Granddaughter.
The battery was dead, so I purchased this one as a replacement for the original: Super 6 volt 9.5 amp red battery with A-style connector.

The original (dead) battery number was 0081-0712 and I was a little concerned after reading some reviews if this was the correct replacement since it had a different number.
Turns out that this is the correct one and the numbers are different because it replaces the obsolete original one.

I'm very pleased with this purchase and assure anyone that it will work perfectly for the same item that I have mentioned.",5.0

Does anyone have an answer about the compatability OF my old with the amazon adv  6Vbattery.  Thanks for the replies!",5.0

"Original 6 volt Power Wheels battery.  Durable and includes built in fuse to protect the battery and Power Wheels from overheating and catching fire.  There are some alternatives to the original batteries, some of which can be less expensive.  But that means you have to add your own fuse to the battery.  The only reason to use batteries other than these factory ones is if you plan to modify your powerwheels to go faster using other batteries (i.e. running 18 volts into the 12 volt powerwheels system).  Google it  if you want more info.  Otherwise, if you're not handy nor interested in modding your powerwheels, then this is the battery you're looking for.",5.0
We have a battery powered ride on toy that requires 2 of these batteries.  The two that came with the toy lasted for 5 years.  We purchased 2 more this year so that our daughter could enjoy the ride hopefully for another 5 years.

I'd buy again from this seller in a heartbeat.  Thanx,5.0

"We received the Harley Motorcycle Power Wheels as a hand-me-down item.  The batteries that came with our toy no longer had any life in them and no longer worked at all.  I came to Amazon and found these batteries.  My Harley requires the two 6 volt batteries pictured.  I ordered two and the vehicle works beautifully now.  My kids can't get enough of it.  I felt the need to comment because one previous reviewer indicated that this battery did not work in her Harley toy.  It works perfectly in ours.  Did Fisher Price put out two types of Harley Power Wheels?  I don't know, but I know that if you are careful to look at the pictures here and compare them with the toy you have at your house, you can see that they match.  I'm a happy Harley owner and this battery works at my house.

My only issue is that my vehicle runs beautifully for a long while and then it seems to need a rest.  It slows down to a crawl and seems to be out of life.  To most of us, that would indicate that it needs to be recharged.  Yet when my children get off of it for the night and come back to it the next day, it goes again for a good lenght of time - although not as long as the previous day.  After the second day of use, it does need to be recharged.  I only mention this because I'm under the impression that this type of battery needs to be fully empty of a charge before being put on the charger in order to prolong the life of the battery.  Could just be my older Power Wheels because I have no experience with a brand new machine.

Still, I'm totally happy with my purchase.",5.0

"It works wonderfully with Dewalt DWP849X. It fits like a glove on Dewalt DWP849X. I used this brand new Dewalt polisher on two cars, 2002 and 2012. The results are remarkable. It really brings the shine on the cars. After washing the car, the polisher will dry the car and wax the car. I used Meguiar's Ultimate Liquid Wax - 16 oz. I used the microfiber towel in the Meguiar's after waxing. I used 1000RPM on the speed with pulsing. The hair on the pad will come off the pad if polishing the plastic. I will purchase another pad.",5.0

ok,5.0
"Ok, after considering a few got this just wanna say totaly satisfied....

the wool becomes heavier when u start doing  the cutting with this works perfect with Meguiars ultimate compound or Sonax fine abrasive.

CONS (NOT REALLY)
Only cons mentioned is that it looses some wooll the first time, but after personaly using it, it isn't that much, just over exaggerated.

With so many many Positive this cons is not at all a CON",5.0
"WORKS GREAT, WONDERFULL SHINE.  JUST KEEP CLEAN WITH SPUR TOOL.  I WASHED MINE WITH DISH SOAP AND MY FINGER FOR 4 MIN., LET IT AIR DRY OVERNIGHT .LOOKS BRAND NEW.

"I am very satisfied with this buffing pad.  It is much better than the foam pads I was using before.  It kids some fuzz around, but it really does a good job cutting and polishing paint.  I've even used it to de-fog headlights.  It's a good buffing pad.",5.0

"Work great!!! I love it, its washable can be use over and over, hold up to my expectations for the price",5.0
"This is a heavy duty pad that I used for applying Finesse-it II. It worked great.  I suppose I could have used a foam pad instead.  When it loaded up, I dipped it in a little bit of water.  Don't use too much cause it will throw the compound all over.  That's where a variable speed buffer comes in handy.  Don't try to use the pad for differing grades of compound as it is impossible to clean the pad without leaving residue from the previous compound.  The backing pad and hook and loop is very durable as well.",5.0
I'm using it to polish my 38' 5th wheel trailer. As a buffing pad it works great. It's thick and does a super job in taking off the applied polish to a high shine. The hook and Loop is very secure. I've had zero problems using it even in small crevices tilted on it's edge. A very fine product and highly recommended.,5.0

"This 7 inch hook-n-loop WOOL Buffer wheel was purchased in conjunction with the Klutch buffer unit.  Make sure if you purchase a buffer, it has the 5/8"" dia. arbor, you will be able to buy disks and pads anywhere.  Definately get the hook-n-loop system, it will save you lottsa time and aggrivation in setting up and changing over the pads.  This wool buffing pad is really heavy duty, with a curved outer edge to eliminate the possibility of burning the the paint.  The pad cleans up easily, even if you use an old fork to clean the compound off.  There is a little wool blow-off, but thats common with a new wheel.  With the right compound and care, this Wool pad will last thru years of service.",5.0
"this is a very thick, wool pad for polishing.  i bought two, one for the rubbing compound and one for the polishing compound.  the wool goes over the edges, which is extremely important in not gouging the surface.  they tend to shed some wool if you hit anything that projects from the surface, but i think any pad would do the same.
i used these on my boat hulls with excellent results.  they wash out easily by hand and dry fluffy for the next use.  well worth the money!",5.0
"This is a good product, it's much wider than the backing pad to allow use at an angle as well as more surface area. The wool is thick and cuts well. About the only draw back to this is that it will throw off A LOT of lint, at least with the first use. This is common with wool pads though. I don't regret this purchase at all, but think that I will use foam next time to save myself the mess of all that lint. Made in USA",5.0

I needed something for my vehicle that would allow me to fully use what I have available, power wise.  I feel much better having this at the ready.  I bought a cable bag for it, and recommend that.  A few dollars more, but means that the clamps don't get stomped, the cords twisted, or the wires broken through misuse.  It's expensive enough, and potentially vital enough, for me to spend a few dollars more.  Last summer, someone needed a jump.  I felt like a putz for having to walk away.  Won't happen again.

"When my car battery died, we got a jump-start from someone with a big truck. He looked at our ""light duty"" booster cables and laughed, saying that we should get heavy-duty cables in case someone with a big truck jumped us--light duty cables are not meant for bigger vehicles. Luckily, the truck guy had his own cable to use to jump-start our car. We bought these so that we'd have them, and they do what they're supposed to do. I always keep them in my trunk now.",5.0

This is one of those items that even though you hope you don't have to use you, you should spend the extra money and buy a good quality.",5.0
Love it I have already used it and it works like a charm thank you so much ! Thank You Thank You,5.0
"Disclaimer: I have not yet had to use these cables. I am reviewing solely on inspecting them. With any luck, these will stay in the box behind the seat in my truck and I will never need to use them.

A good set of jumper cables is a must in any vehicle, especially if you live in the frozen North (Cleveland here). Sure, you can buy some cheap 12 gauge or whatever at your local big box store. But I have personally been in situations where the cheap-o cables simply could not carry enough current to jump my vehicle. The cables were too thin to charge the battery in a reasonable amount of time, and could not carry enough juice to turn the starter.

ALWAYS buy 2 or 4 gauge. ALWAYS buy long cables. I don't care what anyone says. Cars are low voltage but high amperage. A starter cranking needs a TON of juice. Those dainty little WM cables will not cut it. Enter these cables.

At 4 gauge, these could probably jump a semi. At 20 feet, you can easily link two cars together even if one is in a difficult spot. When life happens, you do NOT want to be stuck somewhere with cables that aren't adequate.

These cables fit the bill. The handles also appear to be fairly durable, which is important. I have had cheaper cables have the insulation on the handles flake off. Makes for a painful jump.

Overall I am impressed with the workmanship and specifications for the price. Hopefully I will never need them: but if I do, and they do not live up to my expectations, I will update this review.",5.0
I was very pleased to see what arrived when I open the box for these cables.  They were very high quality. We didn't have booster cables for the SUV so I was looking for something to put in the back. Again Amazon had exactly what I was looking for and a selection of products to choose from. The Coleman Cable 8660 heavy duty booster cables are a great buy and I would recommend these to anyone.,5.0
These battery booster cables are everything they advertise and more.  I was very impressed with the build quality and craftsmanship.  I would definitely reccomend these for anyone with a pickup truck.  I drive a diesel pickup and have used these twice now to jump start other peoples vehicles.  It's kind of funny I never was asked or needed to jump start anyone's vehicle till after I bought these......oh well I enjoy helping people out!,5.0
"I need a long booster cable since in case i ended up my car needed to be jumped (and it's 2 times already in like this year),  i need a long jumper cable that can reach far enough regardless of the position of my car.  The 2 times my car run out battery, the car is not in a good position where another vehicle can just park side by side..",5.0
"I haven't used them yet. All my cars are 6 months to a year old. I purchased these as back up. I just had a situation where I tried to jump a friend with a booster pack I have that did not work.

"Can't comment much on these since they have not yet been used (I will come back and update my review is I find any issues after first use) ... but they are built solid, nice tough big hard clamps and love having a long cable so I never have to move cars around or anything if needed. I bought these to have in my new truck since you always need cables ... but another reason is for when I tow my travel trailer and we run the batteries with no shore power they may die after a couple days ... if you are in need a quick small recharge they are the perfect length to pop my hood, run the cables to the back of the truck and hook up to the batteries that are on the tongue of my travel trailer ... running the truck for 30-45 minutes with this nice large gauge wire connected from my battery tot he trailer battery will give me a bit of a charge if ever in a pinch and I have no shore power, solar, or generator to recharge.

"The length and quality of this booster cable helped me get out of a tough spot when I needed a jump and was distanced a cars length away from the booster car.

I difinately recommend these cables. they are not the cheapo skinny ones.",5.0

It is so nice to have 20 ft cables. With the cheap jumper cables you have to park right next to the car to be jumped. At times that is not possible. It makes you really appreciate the length of these cables.,5.0
"fast ship. secure packaging. fit and finish is great. for the $$$, you cant beat these. 4 guage is the way to go. extra long cable length with great quality insulation. the glowing pos/neg cues work well, but are kind of a gimmic imho. if you cant tell the difference between pos and neg, you should probably call AAA. clamps are sturdy and solid with very strong springs and good bite on the pole.  great product. highly recommend...",5.0
They work great and a good quality!  Good value!,5.0
I have a 4 cylinder 2008 Honda Civic and I was able to jump my dad's 8 Cylinder Lincoln with these jumper cables. I was surprised because I have heard that small cars have trouble jumping cars with large engines. In any case these worked great. I also love that they are made in the USA.,5.0
These worked great. If you need them there's no substitute. This item came in a timely manner. It was as advertised. A good vender with Amazon so I knew it would work out.,5.0
"So glad I bought these before I had a problem. Since I've bought them I've used them about 8 times usually on my wife's beach-beater (the starter was going bad -- the battery was old too), and they work great. The clamps are effective and the cables are sure. They're not too thick that it's cumbersome, but it's thick enough for the current to flow through well. Very pleased with these.",5.0
I like these cables much better than my old ones.  The old ones had the two clamps joined too close together without enough slack to reach from the battery to a proper grounding spot on some cars.  These have plenty of reach and the construction seems quite durable.,5.0
"Fortunately, I've only had to use these cables once so far, but I love that they are longer than my old cables, as I don't have to finagle the cars around as much, because these cables are so long.

I've been looking for a carrying case, and I'm sure I'll find one eventually.

I'm not sure what else to say - the car jumps perfectly fine - I don't think I've ever owned light-weight cables, so I can't compare to that, but these work wonderfully.",5.0
"This is a great product, came in handy the first week we received it, with a dead battery, very sturdy.",5.0
Received promptly in good order. It was needed to go the length of my Prius while parked in a narrow stall.,5.0
A necesity if you have a car.  I was able to help someone at the greocery store parrking.  One of these days it will be me needing to use them to jump the battery in my car.,5.0
"I drive a large diesel utility truck, not the easiest thing to maneuver close to another vehicle to give a boost, but with these cables I don't need to.  Heck, I can even park behind them and still reach.  That 25' length really comes in handy, and I've had a lot of guys ask where I got 'em.",5.0

I finally got to use my Coleman Booster Cables a few months ago when my battery died in the commuter lot. They worked like a charm.

Pros:

1. Heavy gauge construction  makes for a quick jump. (you have to hold them in your hands to appreciate how heavy duty they are) Well built.
2. 20 Foot length let's you jump a car from behind without parking side to side or nose to nose. Much safer on the highway.

Cons:
None so far.

August 6, 2012  UPDATE: I just jump started a stranded mother and daughter's Nissan Murano in the parking lot after the Coldplay concert. The Coleman cables worked as advertised.

December 10, 2012 UPDATE: A neighborhood kid was trying to start his Mom's Acura MDX by popping the clutch as he rolled past our house. His SUV is an automatic. I jump started his car with no drama, other than the comedy of watching someone trying to pop the clutch with an automatic transmission. (?)",5.0
"Thankfully, I have not had an occasion to use these cables but it's nice to know that they're neatly packed away in my trunk should I need them. They're well made and come in a nice compact case. Just nice to know they're there.",5.0
These big wire cables are the best ones i've seen around. They are good for jumping that big truck battery or small car battery. They work very good and are some what compact. I would tell all to buy them. They are the best value around.,5.0
"These were priced right and have a heavy gauge.  To be honest, I have not used them but the build quality is very good.",5.0
Dear All. Product had been tested @ -22 degrees Fahrenheit. Worked perfect on midsize SUV. Isolation stayed flexible. My recommendations.,5.0
I have not had the need to use these cables yet but they are well built and of obvious quality.  It appears that they will last many years and may be the last set of cables I will need.  Recommend these cables and not the smaller cheap ones.  I once had a cheap set of cables that got damaged while trying to jump start a van.  Get these cables.,5.0
Bought these to keep in the car for emergencies. I've only needed to use them once and they didn't let me down. They seem well made and do their job appropriately.,5.0
"My wife bought a new car and I created an emergency car kit for her, including this cable. I ordered the 4 gauge 20 feet version. The cable looks and feels very durable. Its very heavy and easy to unravel, so I kept it in its original box and threw it in the trunk.",5.0
bought these for my k2500 suburban plenty of length front to rear. i ended up using them right out of the box as i for a dead battery in my truck. they worked great. several people have complained about the clamps. they worked well for me and i had no issues with poor connections. cables are well made.,5.0
I was surprised by the good quality of these cables and their light weight. Then saw they were Made in the USA.,5.0
"Product feels well made and surprisingly is not as heavy as anticipated. Box comes with handle and clear, bilingual, directions for how to boost a vehicle are listed on back.",5.0
"To be honest, we haven't need them yet, all we can say is that the product seems surdy and well constructed. The only flaw that we saw is that they don't come with a case for easy carry arround.",5.0
"Sure, you get what you pay for.

After reading all the reviews on this product I noticed that several complaints were about the cables being copper covered aluminum (CCA) instead of just copper. Well, guess what folks, pure copper cables in this gauge and length are around $150! I ordered the 20 feet/4 ga. cables for just under $40. True, being a trained electrician I would prefer all copper but 4 ga is 4 ga. I don't have $150 to throw into my trunk for a product that if I'm lucky, I will only use once or twice.

Yup, the ""Polar Glow"" is just a little sticker on each clamp that glows, not the clamp itself. So far I haven't needed to use these but they look great. The box they come in is fine for trunk storage (comes with a handle), no need to get a separate bag. They do seem to be heavy duty and I can't wait till I need them...lol",5.0
"They are very sturdy, carry a great electrical charge between batteries, and are very durable.  I have bought a second set.  Highly recommend.",5.0
"Solid, sturdy, and easy to use jumper cables.  On sale, too!  Just tested these out last week for my roommate who had a dead battery.  They did exactly what they were supposed to, and we had no problems.",5.0
"I received the subject Battery Booster Cables and almost immediately had a need to use them.  My son needed to have his car started, and these heavy duty booster cables were easily able to accomplish the task.  They are easy to use, and the extra length (20 feet) is nice when you don't have the ability to pull the vehicle close together to make the connections.  Definitely worth the investment.",5.0
"I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a ""jump"" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.

Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The ""booster car"" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.

The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a ""dead"" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.

Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the ""dead"" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...

A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!  They are inexpensive and top notch quality!",5.0
They're pretty much as advertised.  Good quality cables with enough length to jump with cars parked one behind the other when necessary.  I shopped around probably entirely too much before this purchase and am pleased with my selection.,5.0
"Get the 25 foot 4-Gauge jumper cables.  They are made very well and could be the last set of jumper cables I own.  It's a great investment.  I bought a pair for each car. If you have to use them, parking will not be an issue with 25 feet.",5.0
"I bought these cables for my grandson who is in the military, currently living on base, and he was so pleased.  Thanks to all the reviews, I had no idea which cables to buy and he said all his buddies couldn't get over not only the durability, but length of the cables as well.  He's happy so I'll rate these cables 5 star!",5.0

The box the cables arrived in would be a fine carrier in a pinch, it has a handle i might not trust after a couple of years but its ok for storing in a pinch.

The spare canvas bag I had barely fit the 8 foot cables I had, so I knew I would need a new one. Picked up the offering from

The bag will not be fitting much more than these cables, but thats my goal - I want her to be able to stuff dirty cables into a bag without other stuff getting dirty.",5.0
"What more do you need in a set of jumper cables? I had a car safety kit and need to give a friend a jump so I pulled out the cables and hooked them up. After 10 minutes of waiting his car still did not start. I left the cable attached to my car and touched the other two together and nothing happened. I ended up having to tear each handle apart, strip each conductor end, and reattach to get the cables to work. Even after that the cable were extremely hot after using them. With this set I will not have to worry about any of that.

If you think your cheap, thin gauge jumper cables are going to do the trick, think again. Without a set like these you are likely to end up stranded or start a fire.",5.0

"I just used the cables this morning and they were great!  I knew the car was dead last night but didn't have time to deal with it then. So this morning, when it was 6 degrees out, I tackled it.  I pulled the cables out of the trunk expecting to find them stiff, but they were just about as flexible as if I had stored them inside!  I hooked them up and 'snap' the car started.  I had been using a ""good"" set from Sears.  They were either 6 or 4 guage and were supposed to ""remain flexible to 'x' below"".  They usually worked but were always VERY stiff and difficult to use.
  These cables are both heavy duty AND flexible. GREAT product.",5.0
FIrst class.  These are a must for all cars.  Spend a little more than  the cheap jumper cables at Walmart.,5.0
"These Jumper cables are heavy Duty, Yet easy to Store. I keep them in one of my containers on my delivery vehicle. They are high quality. They are 4 gauge cable, so they are perfect and long enough to Start are Utilimaster Diesel trucks when are batteries are run Down. There are more expensive cables and even more sever duty use cables. these are perfect for this type of vehicle in an Emergency. The cost is reasonable as well. With 25 feet, you don't have to get real close to the other vehicle. you can pull up to the back and or side and just run the cables under or down the side of the vehicle.",5.0
"I used standard length booster cables for years, then found and bought these 25 ft cables and now look for situations to use them.  I don't worry where or how my car is parked. Recently I had to park behind someone at the grocery store to jump their battery when there were no other parking spaces. Worth every penny!",5.0
"Over the years I probably  owned 3 or 4 cheap jumper cables prior to these. You think I would have learned after the first 1 or 2. True most people don't use cables very often, but when you do use them you need something that works well. It seems I use them more for stranded people in parking lots or friends and neighbors than I do for my self.

 I have found the cheaper 8, 10 or higher gauge cables, in not to much time and use will deteriorate to the point when you really need them they won't work. These are a heavy duty 4 gauge wire that will last for many years. In fact they might be the last jumper cables you ever have to buy. My vehicle as do most newer vehicles have side battery posts. These cables slip on them and lock in place, making a nice solid contact with no worry about sparks. For posts mounted on top of the battery it has a alligator type clamp on the end which will lock on tight, since the handle is spring loaded. This cable is 16 ft long for easy access for cars, SUV's and smaller trucks. If you have a larger truck or motor home you might want to consider longer cables.

I also "" as Reviewer George C writes "" had cheap jumper cables literally melt when using them, it is not unusual for cheap bargain basement cables to do this. It's a scary and dangerous situation when this happens, particularly  when battery acid is in the mix.

I feel it is well worth the couple of extra $$ for the peace of mind, knowing these cables will work safely  when I need them.",5.0

I didn't own any jumper cables and had not needed any for many years.

"i got this one back when my old car used to die on me all the time

when i finally got a new car i was almost upset that it always starts by itself thats how good this cable is

i also have another ( even more heavy duty 2 gauge ) coleman cable but that one is TOO heavy and clamps are too hard to compress.  this 4 gauge one is ideal IMHO for a mid-size car.  clamps operate smoothly, the cable itself is not too heavy or stiff and power transfer is good.

i had a cheap cable literally MELT on me once and wouldn't start the car because it was too thin.  don't use cheap jumper cables - go for a nice solid one like this.",5.0
"I bought these and brought them to Colombia, S.A. because the cables here are not well made. Anyway, though I have not had the unfortunate opportunity to use them - they at least appear to be high quality.

I am very particular when it comes to purchasing things - and after doing my homework, I decided that the Coleman brand was reputable and could provide the quality I desired.

Well, the cables and clamps are well made - and I don't think that the clamps will let go of anything - kind of like alligator teeth.

So, if you are looking for a set of ""jumper cables"" - perhaps you might consider Coleman Cable Systems.  Now, I just need the opportunity to use these things.",5.0

I have a 2003 Ford Explorer and the battery was getting old and could not hold enough charge to start the car.  After 45 minutes of trying to plug in this devise multiple times and getting multiple cycles of charge my car still would not start.  The devise also gave off a smell of burning plastic so there's that too.

"I bought this in April and finally got a chance to test it this winter when a work colleague needed a boost.  Their car battery wasn't completely drained, as there was enough power for them to use the radio, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to put this thing to the test.  We plugged it in, as per the manual, turned off the heat and radio, and waited for the indicator light to change from red to green.  Twenty minutes passed, the amount of time the manual said it should take to change, but the indicator light was still red; another 10 minutes passed, and the light was still red.  We couldn't wait any longer and figured enough time had passed, so we tried to start my friend's car, but the engine wouldn't turn.  Frustrated, I got out my regular booster cables and the other car started on the first try and we were on our way a couple minutes later.

I had bought this for my wife as it sounded like a much easier way to jumpstart a car; unfortunately, this is the kind of product you probably won't get the chance to test if it works within the return period and can only hope that it'll work when you need it to.

So, if you buy this or someone bought it for you and you decide you don't want it, you're screwed.

You see, while I had noticed this fell under the battery & accessories section, I thought it was along the line of jumper cables, which requires no battery, and therefore wouldn't fall under the Non-Returnable section. Amazon should make more of an effort to label items that fall under the Non-Returnable section as not all items in that area are obvious to the average consumer.

So save your money, buy some regular jumper cables, and, as you are obviously reading this online, Google how to use them if you don't know how (that's right ladies, I'm talking to you - and don't raise your hackles at me in feminist outrage, I'm female too.)

In short, if you still want to get this, be advised that this is considered a hazardous material and cannot be returned.",1.0
The item did not meet my expectations after reading the hype.  It just takes too long to get the charger to jump the other car.  It's a great idea that will work only if the battery of the needy car is just under a proper charge.,1.0
"I bought this item in 2004. It has been in my car since then. Package unopened. Now, I had to jump my car last week. Opened this package. The product did not work. Tried several times with multiple cars. No use. Its just a junk. I was so happy I had this with me for emergency. But,its useless. Finally my roadside assistance saved me :). Stay away from this product.",1.0
"Never worked. Got hot, smoked, and did not charge the second vehicle. Good thing I taught my wife to use standard jumper cables. Great idea, just turned out to be junk.",1.0
"I plugged it all in and thought it was going to work because I heard the door ding on the dead car, but when I checked it 15 minutes later, nothing. Not even the charger seemed to be working. Then I figured out that it had blown my cigarette lighter fuse in the dead car. I also found out later that my battery was completely dead so I don't know if that had anything to do with it blowing a fuse. I'm sure I'll try it again someday. So, not fair to rate it either good or bad. All I know is it did not work for me in this situation.",1.0
BSI550I-W portable electric generator with a date code of 09-10-01 is subject to a leaking fuel tank recall. DeVilbiss has not received any reports of injuries from these generators. My rating of one star is based solely on the recall and not based ownership of this generator. I like the fact that the handles fold down and has more electrical plugs than its $100+ cheaper T550-W near twin model.  I ended up buying a lighter and more expensive Yamaha ES2800 generator.,1.0
"The unit failed after I owned it only five weeks.  I was only actually used it a few times for short durations. I tried to use it one day and the fault light was illuminated and no ac power was coming out of the outlets.  I returned it for repair or replacement 3 weeks ago after receiving a RMA number. I contacted Xantrex and they say they don't know anything about it, and the RMA number is not in there system.  The customer support is impossible to get on the phone, and email support takes days to get back to you.  They do offer to sell you another unit for 40% off though instead of sending me a replacement.

After the warranty expired I had some issues with this battery. The charger started to not charge and made a strange noise. I tried to contact the company 3 times with no success.

"This integrated unit looked so good and so convenient that I bought two of them. Bad move. Like all batteries, they are doomed to weaken after about 3 years -- they don't hold much charge any more, and they're virtually impossible to replace. Now one of my units has an inverter that instantly goes to ""Failure"" when I when I switch it on, even with no load and a fully charged battery pack. I'll be junking the whole thing soon.

Much better is to buy individual AGM 35AH batteries (for example) and a stand-alone inverter. That way, when something fails, it can be replaced. And while one battery is being used, another can be re-charging. Separate components are a much more sensible and flexible way to go.

The shipping charge alone to return this turkey for repair can buy a nice fresh battery.  Phooey. This is the first negative review I've ever written on Amazon, but this product earned it.

UPDATE: July 14, 2014: Local ""authorized service center"" replied to my inquiry about repairs with this one-liner: ""I regret to inform you the Xpower power pack 1500 is not serviceable."" Really. Wow.

The unit is only 3 years old and now worthless as an AC power source. Batteries still seem to have some life in them, so I can power an external inverter, but when they go, I'm done. Big waste of money on this turkey. Shame on Xantrex for not producing a serviceable product and then not standing behind it. I would recommend that Amazon simply stop selling it.

I repeat my earlier recommendation: Buy a hefty battery, some thick power cables, and a standalone inverter. Make a wheeled cart for it if you want to. At least then you can service the thing yourself.

Note also: If you plan to power a refrigerator or other device that needs a lot of surge power to get the motor running, make sure the inverter can handle it ... read reviews from those who've bought it ... even for a small refrigerator, I needed one with over 2000 watts continuous power rating. Inverters with lower power ratings simply switch over to ""fault"" mode, leaving you high & dry.",1.0

It lasted only an hour with a refrigerator and small radio plugged into it.  It would not recharge and had an awful odor while charging.  We have had a 1000 watt Xantrex in the past and were very pleased with it and used it for 4 years.  That was why we chose Xantrex, but the 1500 watt did not stand up to our expectations.",1.0

"This item worked well for a short time but you had better keep an eye on it. I left it in a temperature controlled environment and initially checked it every month for charge. I got a little complacent and let three months pass without checking it, needed it during a power outage and, as luck would have it - it was completely dead. Apparently one of the cells in a battery shorted. This caused a complete discharge of both batteries. You would think the system could monitor this for the $300 price.",1.0
"After searching for a battery powerpack I was excited to find this product. After receiving it I followed the manufacturer's recommendations and plugged the unit in overnight. The next day, nothing - no power. I went to a Xantrex forum and found that sometimes a battery needs 7 days of charging to restore it. I plugged it in for 7 days and, nothing, totally dead. I am still waiting for a call tag from Amazon for return.",1.0
We purchased the 1500 Watt power pack. The only appliance connected to it was an answering machine. It was charged daily for about 8 hours. 3 weeks later the battery would no longer charge. Sent it back and have not heard anything. They are very hard to get in touch with,1.0
"This is a great idea, badly executed.  We bought one three years ago as a true emergency generator.  We have a medical device that requires power, and our area is known for outages during the summer.  But since we bought it, we have not needed to use it.  We followed all manufacturer instructions for when leaving it sit idle, yet the batteries died anyway and the inverter fried itself.  Replacing these cost more than buying a new unit.  One of the batteries must also have developed a small leak (due to the summer heat, perhaps), and when I went to try to replace the batteries, there was corrosion all over the terminals and cables.  I have to think that keeping the unit inside might not be a good idea if this happens to you, because of the potential for gas and acid release.

Xantex customer service is nearly non-existent and is geared only to selling replacement parts (but NOT batteries, which you have to look for elsewhere).

I really wish this thing worked, as a silent indoor generator is a wonderful notion.  Too bad.  We're still stuck with gasoline units and long extension cords.",1.0

the tire with my foot so it wouldn't flip over from jumping
around. It sounded like it was working hard when connected.
I connected it for about 30 seconds, then tested
pressure with a tire gauge. Only got a pound more.
Reconnected for 1 minute, got up to 12 pounds.
Hmmm...This is going to take a while....

watching the tire carefully. After about 3 minutes I look down

I purchased these seat back protectors for my suburban that has leather seats.  I have a 3 year old and a 10 month old and the 3 year old is constantly putting her feet on the seat.  The ties on the protector don;t line up with the head rest which makes it bunch up at the top and I didn't put the velcro adhesives on the bottom of my leather seats because they are too expensive.  The protector just hangs on the back on m seat.  I have recently thrown the protectors away.  I would suggest investing in a good cleaning agent instead of buying this protector.,1.0
I purchased a set of these for my new VW Jetta with cloth seats - the velcro does not stay at all - and the ties didn't line up with my headreasts - so they were VERY UNUSEFUL to me - I ended up throwing them away.,1.0
This product might workout for other states but I live in Phoenix Arizona and thought this would be a great idea for scuff marks not!! The adhesive part to stick to your back of the seat because of the heat kept the back from staying on to the seat. So now there is no adhesive left and they just hang on the car and pretty much are worthless not a good investment for the Valley of Sun.,1.0
This seat protector is a nice idea but the quality and endurance are disappointing. After using it for about a month the corners started folding down and the velcro bottoms never reached below the leather on the car's seat. My 15 month old daughter can kick them until they end up in her lap. In order to get the velcro to reach the seat bottom we had to tie the tops with the least amount of tie. This makes the tops floppy and the velcro never stuck for long anyway. The blue trim comes apart from the plastic and makes the whole thing look very shabby. I threw them away after about two months of use. They may be cheap but they aren't worth it.,1.0

This means the voltage output varies between 107 V to 123 V or more.  When installed, this inverter would operate a printer and some other items, however it would not charge a laptop battery.

"Judging by the price and brand name, I expected a much better product. Unfortunately, I was left sorely disappointed with a lighter wallet. I ordered this unit to run a small blower, a small refrigerator and some small appliance chargers (phones, iPad, etc). It worked great for less than a year. Ran large cable (00-gauge) through my truck and had it done right. After a short while, it suddenly stopped providing power. The LEDs on the side lit up and appeared normal, but no power would be provided at the outlets; the manual only gave options for troubleshooting when the LEDs didn't come on. The wiring in the truck checked out and a separate power supply confirmed the issue was with the inverter.

Contacted the manufacturer and could not resolve the situation. Now I'm out of pocket over $250 and have to find another inverter. For the price, I expected much better. Zero reason an inverter would last under a year. Looking at other reviews, looks like I'm not the only one to experience this malfunction. I recommend trying another brand.",1.0

A few minutes later the door display was blank.  A little checking showed that the inverter was putting out 159 volts.

"This is my second Tripp lite inverter/charger product.  I previously had a larger model inverter/charger and it worked fine for about 3 years.  It maintained my back up batteries for my sump pump.  Then in January of 2013  my home started to have an odd odor which grew worse daily.  I had plumbers over (more than once) as the smell was like sewer gas.  I had employees search my home.  Finally a plumbing employee inspecting my sump pump thought the smell was coming from the Inverter/Charger.  I and a bunch of others smell the unit and it was hard to discern it coming from the unit but one could detect it if you did a sort of wave or fan of the hand near the vents.  We decided he was right.  I disconnected it but I was still skeptical it was the source.  I then interacted with Tripp light technical support about this bad odor and they said a slight smell sometimes happened near the end of the life of the unit. But they did not describe the odor as noxious, sour, disgusting and its all those things.  The smell went away slowly.  But it went away.  So the inverter/charger was clearly the source of the smell.  Ok  I tossed that Unit out.  So I bought this one in January, about 9 months ago. Last week my house started to smell again.  I immediately when down to unplug this unit.  The smell has now gone away.  I plan to return it if possible under its warranty if it exists. However, this is a major flaw.  I use this to power my sump pump with about 7 marine batteries. [Its capacity is far more than 7 and it could do 50 or more it says]  So I have to warn you about this smell if you buy this and it reaches this point of its operating ""lifetime"".  By the way the technical person said it would still operate while smelling but that this was a sign it was nearing the end of its useable life.  I urge you not to use it in an building or space where there are people as the smell permeated 3 floors at my home very easily and very quickly.  This is because it is so hard to determine that this is the source of this really bad odor.  You should avoid this unit and these Tripp Light Inverter/Chargers as my two experiences have had this bad odor develop.  I wanted to change brands, but I did qualify for a return under the 1 year warranty.  I sent in emails etc but did not get a response.  I called. I got through and they proceeded by return and gave me a return authorization.  They got the unit.  They could not recreate the smell according to them which I find not a credible claim.  Regardless they did authorize a new replacement unit at no cost.  But note that the replacement only came with a ""continuation"" warranty so because my first unit was say 11 months in of 12 months in warranty I only got a 1 month warranty on the new replacement unit.  I did receive it.  I am using it.  So far so good.  As to their service, I like when I deal with the people.  They did not really respond to my emails except when I had a specific person I was writing.  After that it was fine.  So keep at it and they will respond and it appears that they will honor their 12 month warranty.  But if this goes bad then I am done with warranty so then I will change brands as they warranty claim did not make up for the 2 bad events in my personal history.  If they had acknowledged the smell issue and why it occurred or why it might not occur going forward I would feel differently but the did not they basically denied it existed.  I know it does exist as I experienced it twice now.  The period of returning it; them confirming it was covered and then getting it back to me took about 3 weeks and I didn't like that as I was unprotected for back up on my sump in that period but I had not choice as I did not want to own two of these units even if the other one was from a different manufacturer.

So that is the update January 2014.",1.0
"I was excited to find this inverter/charger for a camper project I'm working on. It's everything I wanted. It seemed to work fine for a few hours while testing it at home. I was running an 1800 watt stove top from a pair of AGM 225 Amp-hr batteries just fine. Mounted it in the back of my truck and drove around for a couple weeks.

Once I got out to the campsite though, inverter was now broken. It could only put out 100V and maybe a couple of amps - shutting down anytime a load was put on. It was also much noisier than when I was testing it at home. Battery voltage and indicator lights from the inverter all looked fine.

Something fragile must have broken a solder joint or something while in transit. Tripp Lite advertises that this product is suitable for mobile applications. I can only assume that they engineered it to withstand typical vibrations from traveling. Not sure and not willing to spend the next 2 months with Tripp Lite support trying to debug it.

Well, after only two years this thing took a dump.  I contacted Tripp-Lite and after answering their questions and requesting a schematic so I can fix it myself (because it is out of warranty), they responded with, Well, yes, you're right it sounds like it is now in need of replacement. But,,,,we don't provide schematics for safety (and some other half-assed reason) so well, just go buy a new one from us, K? (I think not!!)

Wow, 2-years!!! and I thought the Xantrex was crap, well okay, it's a piece of is crap too.

This inverter also has a heavy transformer in it and Trip-Lite mounts the whole unit in an abs plastic case. The very weight of the unit broke all 8 corners. IF, I rebuild this thing I'll have to build a case from 1/4 inch plywood.

Now I guess I'll try one of those AIMS brand 2K units, watch for the review on that.

"I live out in a very rural area of the country with frequent power interruptions. I have a mid-sized portable generator, but you have to be home to connect and tend to them.  We didn't want to spend a small fortune on an automated backup generator set up. Our essential loads are small. We are often away for one to two days at a time, so I decided to purchase a Tripp Lite APS1250 from Amazon.com. I almost purchased the smaller APS750, but dug deeper into my wallet and bought the APS1250 ($402 delivered) to be sure it would run what I wanted and not be working hard. My plan was to have this inverter/charger keep the essentials running in our home until I returned and could fire up the portable generator if needed. Essentials to us mean keeping the refrigerator cold in the summer and keeping the furnace running in the winter.
  I purchased my Tripp Lite Inverter/Charger model APS1250 from Amazon and the service was excellent as usual. Upon opening the factory sealed Tripp Lite box, I discovered the four screws and plastic cover plate for the inverter battery cable connection terminals were  missing. This was not Amazon's fault, so I called Tripp Lite directly hoping they could send them via US postal service saving both myself and Amazon shipping expense and hassle. After two ridiculously long phone calls to Tripp Lite's customer service, I couldn't get anyone to understand what little plastic piece I was talking about. I gave up and decided to forget about that stupid little plastic piece. The unit will work without it.
  I had previously measured the startup and running power needs of my fridge (1100 watts start up, 170 watts running) and furnace (600 watts start up surge, 300 watts running) with a Fluke 87 multi meter. The lesser expensive APS750 would have been able to handle things, but again I didn't want the unit to have to work too hard. Now with the APS1250 inverter hooked up, I proceeded to test run the inverter/charger using a 12 volt marine battery on my refrigerator and furnace separately to ensure it would work for my purposes. It appeared as though it would satisfy my needs.
  I read the instruction manual and set dip switches for my wet cell battery and set up the APS1250 connected to only my refrigerator with my 105 Ah marine battery.  Then I purchased two more large high Ah wet deep cycle batteries to achieve a 36-48 hour back up power supply system for the cycling loads I would have hooked to the inverter/charge unit.  A month went by and I noticed the batteries getting a little wet on top. A quick voltage check showed the APS1250 float voltage was too high at 13.85 volts continuously and the Tripp Lite unit was boiling the batteries. This time, an E-mail to Tripp Lite's previously unimpressive customer service and I'm told this is not adjustable, all normal, and the unit is working as designed.
  A little frustrated because I am into this for a $400 inverter/charger plus another $200 for additional batteries that I cannot return, but I was still convinced that this will do what I need it to do.  I decided to just turn the thing off when I'm home and turn it on when I'm away for my one to two day trips. Time goes by operating it only for short periods of time this way, the 12 month warranty expires, and at 15 months the APS1250 expired and ceased to function as it did previously. Now when turned on it emits an electrical hum that is louder than a conversation, a smell of something burning is quickly noticed, and the unit keeps tripping off with no load applied every time within seconds  after it's turned on.
Another e-mail to Tripp Lite's customer service yields no hope. My intelligence is insulted because I'm told the unit is operating normally. Additionally I'm told the warranty time period is up, the chance of any customer good will is ZERO, and getting the thing repaired even at my expense is out of the question, and I quote ""Tripp Lite is not equipped to service our products.""

  My Tripp Lite Inverter/Charger experience has been completely disappointing. I don't know which is worse, the product, or the customer service.",1.0
"OK.  This is VERY important.  This unit does NOT output a real sine-wave when on DC power.  The output is a chopped up ""sine-wave"" which drops to zero volts many times over a single wavelength.  This unit does NOT play nicely with most furnace or pellet stove blowers, certainly not my 1/6 HP blower on my Lennox furnace.  NOWHERE IN THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION does it say that the output on DC power is a ""PWM sine wave output"".  However, if you go to the Tripp Lite website, find this product and go to the specifications tab, this is what you will find:

LINE POWER (AC): Maintains 120V nominal sine wave output from line power source. INVERTER POWER (AC): Maintains PWM sine wave output voltage of 120 V AC (+/-5%).

Freaking great.  So much for ""clean, computer grade power"".  That is a load of B.S., honestly.  If I had known, for even a second, that this unit didn't output a real sine wave, I would have purchased something else.  Apparently, you have to get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRIPP-LITE-APS1012SW-1000-Watt-12-Volt-Inverter-Charger-Pure-Sine-Wave-120-Volt-4A-40A-Hardwire/dp/B006R64SM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRIPP LITE APS1012SW 1000 Watt 12 Volt Inverter / Charger Pure Sine Wave 120 Volt 4A/40A Hardwire</a>&nbsp;at approximately TRIPLE the cost to get a real sine wave output on DC power.  So now I'm stuck with this thing, as I bought this thing, then researched batteries, then got that, then tested the setup out on stuff besides my furnace, then had to modify the wiring to/from my furnace by cutting it and putting an outlet in one box, and a power cord in another, so I could insert this setup in between furnace and mains power, and thus it's been more than 30 days.  Nor will Tripp Lite help me, as it ""clearly"" says in the specifications that this is a PWM output on DC power.  They will allow me to trade up to the 1012SW if I pay the difference in RETAIL prices.

So, yippee.  Just dandy.  If you buy this, make sure that you test it out within the return time on the actual equipment you want to backup power.  And if you have a pellet stove, chances are it won't work according to what the Tripp Lite representative told me.

[EDIT]***FIVE STARS TO AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!***

So I called Amazon mainly to tell them that they should add the PWM output on DC info to the product page, but also with the slim hope that they might be able to do something for me.  And they WERE able to do something for me!  I couldn't be more pleased with Amazon.  This is precisely why I always try to buy from Amazon when I can![/EDIT]",1.0
One can get this level of dirty power in a $100 inverter. I am shocked. Maybe it is defective as the previous reviewer had the same experience. Some of us have distortion meters and scopes. Very disappointing. returning.,1.0
"I have been spoiled with APC UPSes because they are cheap sine-wave inverters.  I hooked a scope up to this thing, and the garbage that comes out is not even relatively clean power.  It has spikes in it and all of my downstream UPSes don't even recognize the output of this as real AC power.  I really wanted to like this device, and all of my decent UPSes use 24 volts, but I wanted a 12 volt UPS.  I will attempt to post the waveforms on the product page.  I returned it.",1.0
"I bought one of these to provide uninterrupted power to my computer, internet and a NAS. The device failed less than two months after the 1 year warranty had expired. It no longer charges my batteries and says it's over loaded, even when nothing is plugged in. I now have a 400 dollar boat anchor, not to mention another 400 worth of batteries, cables and the trip-lite remote switch that I bought to go with it.",1.0
"I have the same problem as S. Taggart. It worked great until my wife used her hair dryer and since then it beeps, the overload light blinks and it will not work. The 20amp external fuse did not blow. I have pulled & replace the fuse several times to no avail. Guess it is just junk now. I do not recommend this Belkin AC Anywhere 140w Inverter.",1.0
"I have had two different models of the Belkin PcAnywhere inverters over the last 5 years.  Both have failed and they are not reparable. One unit had an external fuse the was not blown.  That unit always showed ""overload"" with nothing plugged in.  The other unit (with no fuse (inline or otherwise)) simply gave up and would not even power on. I would recommend staying away from these units.  I have a ProStat 250 that is still working great.",1.0
Worked OK for what I needed it for,1.0
"Looks cheap, easy to install but be careful of the cheap plastic tabs and overall brittle nature of the entire thing. Does not properly fit a 2005 Honda CRV. Gap at the top. Looks like s***.",1.0
"If there was 0 star, I would rate this garbage 0 star. I don't know what the previous reviewer got. The one I got was useless. It doesn't clean the water at all.

Perhaps s/he got a different thing.",1.0
"After buying 3 different squeegee's from Amazon based on 4 star glowing reviews, I have determined that all these people must have stock in these companies. Please check out all my reviews of these worthless products. This squeegee has double lips on it creating a chattering noise that will wake everybody in the house if you shower @ 5am. It hardly removes any water off the glass Doors and tile shower and it does not come with a hanger. The rubber is very ridged and hardly flexes. I bought a $1.99 Squeegee from Walmart a year ago and it was the best $1.99 I ever spent. Going there tomorrow since I cannot trust these reviews at all anymore.",1.0

"I bought it to help wipe the windows of my car after a wash, but it didn't glide smoothly over the window surface and wipe the water. Instead, it kept dragging and left smear marks from the rubber probably burning against the window. Not sure if there's a 'correct' way of using it, but I couldn't figure it out...

So I really can't recommend this at all.",1.0
Does not work. Will not stuck up and hold water. Will only hold about a third and leaks without pushing on handle.,1.0

"Received this product today.  The box only contained the stick without the mop head.  There was also absolutely no packing material, nor a packing slip of my order.  This was very strange as I have always gotten a packing slip in every order from Amazon.  This was too expensive a product to not get all the parts.  I am trying to just getting the missing part instead of having to pay to return the entire box.  This seems to be a problem, but am working on it.  I would give this a 0 star rating if I could.  Buyer beware!",1.0
"I take pride in giving my car a good wash and thought this would be great. Unfortunately no. This junk head does not form around the surface of a car. There is a slight curve to the head that ends up only allowing the outer sides to come in contact with the car. It does not clean crevice; like the body to where molding comes together. The lamb head does not allow you to clean any crevices such as light molding, grills, door handles, etc.  Also the handle gets shorter and shorter when applying a little pressure. Save your money and buy a simple soft wash brush and cheap extension handle. In conclusion, garbage.",1.0
"The rigid,saddle shaped washing surface is not suitable for washing flat surfaces. There is a 1 inch depression in the middle which means only the edges make good contact with the surface that you are washing. Even on a curved surface, the head does not swivel, which means you constantly are trying to adjust the stick angle to get better contact of the mop head with the surface you are washing, and it darn near impossible.  This all requires much more effort than using a plain sponge, or my favorite car washing tool, a shaggy mitt with nylon mesh on the other side.  I have used the Wash Stick twice on my car and will not use it again. This tool would be much improved if the head were flat instead of concave.",1.0
"This wash stick is useless.  It actually broke the first time I tried to use it, the 2 pieces coming apart where it extends.  I got it put back together, but it wouldn't stay extended with any pressure being applied at the brush.  If you only need it to wash 3' up, fine, but I threw it in the trash that day.",1.0

"This product has an internal flaw since it doesn't stay still!  Isn't the point that it needs to be perfectly kept still for you to get the ""same place"" parking?

I was confused by that response, so I called the Customer Service phone number and was informed that the details of the email were incorrect and the guarantee was not available to me because I had not sent in the registration form within 15 days. I stated it's been 30 days since I purchased it and my vehicle was stolen, is there any guarantee that they would stand behind if I sent in the keys from the Master Lock steering wheel lock, police report, copy of receipt.

She's not exactly a strapping young auto theif either.  Try another product.",1.0
"I bought a similar lock to this about 6 months ago, filled in the paperwork and sent it in by certified mail as requested to get their warranty in case my car was stolen. A few months later, my car got stolen, first time I've ever had a car stolen. First, this lock was able to be picked by a standard flat head screw driver. Except for it becoming loose, it would still be ""useable."" Second, when I went to file the warranty, they claimed the original registration never got to them and therefore not entered into their system. I attempted to show them that I had the receipt for the certified letter and a copy of my original receipt, but the representative basically told me they do not honor the 1000 deductable grantee. I was a faithful customer, but with this I'm going to be using other brands for my personal and business use. I expect they'll lose more than they gained by this decision over the course of 5-10 years.",1.0
"We had a car stolen (in Montreal, of course, the car theft capital of North America; Americans should NOT visit there; our cars -- even the older ones --are targeted by thieves, and the police REALLY don't care about it).

Masterlock is supposed to cover deductibles up to $1000, as they proudly display on their packing. However, after being bounced between the US and Canadian offices, I was told that the fine print said that you have to send in the product registration within 15 days of purchase BY CERTIFIED MAIL, or they won't pay anything out.

"Wow, I never thought I would give California Car Duster a bad review! I have used the plastic handled version for years with no issues. This model must be from a new manufacturer or a new manufacturing process. Here are the issues, mind you, I have not had these issues on the older, less expensive plastic handle one:

1. Leaves red dust fibers all over the car. You can't shake them out at all. Being used on a brand new car. Unless your car is red, you are going to see fibers all over it.

2. Seems like less brush! Best way to describe it is that it seems like less product. So as I wipe it almost gets down to the center core, not enough
brush.

3. The wooden handle simply adds cost, nothing more. It makes it heavier to use!

Please go back to the original design! Find a way to stop those red fibers!!!",1.0

"This duster is just not getting better! I read the reviews and read a lot about needing to keep using the duster until it got better. I've been using it every few days since I bought it and it has not gotten better. It leaves horrible streaks all over the place. Not scratches, but just streaks all over. I have a new black truck and it makes the appearance look worse than just leaving the truck dusty. I finally gave up and started using a micro fiber towel and that is working much much better. I had one of these dusters many years ago and it worked great. This new one unfortunately isn't working for me.",1.0

After I used it on the trunk, I wasn't interested in risking more surface scratches to the paint of my BMW.  I live in a dusty, arid climate and so desperately wanted a new California Duster.

"I just washed and waxed my car, a few hours later I decided to give this duster a try.  Does a great job of dusting the car, but while it may remove dust it instead leaves behind both clear and red fibers...which looks even worse. I have a black car so these fibers stand out and are easily noticeable. Whats even worse is that the duster has paraffin wax embedded within the fibers. While dusting your car the duster will leave behind wax marks that look like chicken scratch all along the paint of your car. This thing is garbage. I just spent a few hours washing and waxing my car and after using this thing ONCE it looks like I'm going to have to wash and wax my car AGAIN.",1.0
i paid more for this duster because it said it was the original one. We have used these in the past and always liked this product. My husband used it on his new truck and it left pieces od the dust all over his truck. Needless to say he is not happy with that product. The point of of this product is to remove dust not put stuff on it.,1.0
Leaves residue all over the paint.  This was the second one of these I have had.  My other one I had from 10 years ago worked great.  This one not so much.  Have to go back and use a detail spray to remove all the streaks.,1.0
"If you have a Black, highly polished car-stay away.  It will leave red lint everywhere, and wax droplets.  This is after following the break-in directions.  What a shame.  If you have any other car, it might be fine.  It does a great job of picking up pollen but is worthless if you have to go after it and wipe the car...",1.0
"Having a short gravel driveway to drive down after washing a black sports car, I looked for something to easily remove any dust without rinsing it again with water. I tried this brush and quickly threw it away after seeing all it did was hold dust and spread it around without removing it.",1.0

"I have used California dusters for many years and I love them. I purchased the wooden handle version recently and wrapped it in newspaper for 48 hrs as recommended, before using for the first time. It shed so much red fabric lint or residue that it was totally unusable. I shook it vigorously outdoors and so much loose fibers came off it was actually choking me. I put on a paper mask and continued shaking until I got a blister on my hand and it was still coming off. I called Amazon and as usual they replaced it without question. The 2nd one is exactly the same with the same problem. I sent the newer one back and kept the original one thinking that eventually the shedding will end. My wife suggested putting the head in the dryer with the air no heat cycle. After 1 hr the lint filter was totally red with the material residue. 4 1hour cycles later it's still shedding though not quite as bad, but still not usable. I ended up using my 20 year old California duster on my Corvette and stuck this one in the basement for now. 20 bucks down the drain. I will try and deal with it when the old one dies if it ever does. I could not recommend this product to anyone any more.",1.0
Duster left a film on car finish,1.0
"I followed the directions re setting the duster on newspaper for 48 hours, allowing the wax to be absorbed by the paper. I've had the duster for 2 weeks now and continue to leave it on the paper as the wax continues to come out. When I dust my classics it leaves many particles of wax all over the car. I understand this doesn't hurt the paint and can be buffed off with a clean cloth. My issue is I didn't purchase this item so I could dust and then go over the entire car again with a different cloth. I'm discarding this duster. The concept is valid but the product doesn't work. 1/4 star",1.0
"Leaves little red fuzzies everywhere, in place of dust removed.  Useless",1.0
I have owned 2 of these dusters prior to ordering this one. This particular duster left a horrible static to my black car. Every speck of dust and dirt would cling to my car after using it one time. I assumed this was the original California duster when I purchased it. The two prior ones that I bought at Walmart worked perfect! I returned this one after the first use.,1.0
"...""No stars""  Piece of junk! Some kind of chemical on this thing that stinks and left streaks on my new black paint, I wish I had known.
...I can't get those streaks out of my clear coat.
...I ran it through the washer / dryer and still stinks and streaks. So sorry I bought this thing and now I'm stuck with it.",1.0
A waste of 20.00 - The duster is treated with some sort of wax that leaves streaks in the finish of my back car.  It might work OK on a  light colored car but on dark paint its awful.  Don't waste your money,1.0
"I tried it twice. Each time the duster left what looked like grease marks which I had to remove with detailer.
Please do not waste your time and money on this product. Go with the Microfiber products!",1.0
It is horrible. I followed the directions & it is leaving red pieces all over my car. It also leaves swirl marks. Will not recommend!,1.0
"Leaves a paraffin-like residue on the car  which is sticky enough to adhere to the loose red fibers. I drove on the freeway for about an hour, & when I stopped they were still stuck to the car. The residue will be apparent when you wash your car because after combined with water  it becomes increasingly tacky, spreads, & requires additional time to remove. You might want to contact an auto-paint or professional detail shop before using. A microfiber duster does the job, no residue, can be washed, & is about half the price at Target for a size similar to the CA Duster.",1.0

"This is the worst product I have ever bought off Amazon-- the second worst product I have ever bought online. I'm shocked other reviewers haven't reported the issue I had with it:

Right out of the box, I think, ""A quality product, good-- solid handle, a nicely fitted, soft duster attached.""  I immediately test it on my dry, clean, slightly dusty, black car. I see countless pink particles dusted upon every area of my car touched by this duster. I shake it, and countless more pieces of fiber fall to the floor or float through my garage, depending on the size of the fiber. I think I should wash it and throw it in the dryer (low heat)-- this would get rid of all the extra fibers, dust, thread accumulated during manufacturing. I struggle to pull the extremely tight opening of the duster from its wooden handle; wash it, then clean the steel barrel in the washer, as it's covered with the red fibers of the duster. I think, ""Good. . . got rid of those extra fibers."" After partially drying on low heat, I remove it and drape it on a chair overnight. The next morning I notice pinkish red dust completely covering the barrel of my dryer, after removing the black clothes my husband had thrown into it earlier. (I had to shake off red particles from the clothes.)  Awkwardly but successfully, I wipe off the pink dust plaguing the inside of my dryer, using a microfiber cloth.

Before using the duster on my car, I stand outside, on my driveway, shaking the duster. Fibers and dust fly around me, nonstop-- they float upon my driveway and stick to my white shirt. I continue to shake it until not as many fibers fall out. I struggle to get the duster back onto its handle, but can get the last corner completely in, but it is fairly secure. I dust my car with it-- only a couple of strokes over the rear window-- and see the same tiny red particles I saw before I went through the above process.

The box it came in has already gone off to be recycled, and its not worth the money or effort to return this evil conglomeration of fibers;
however  I'm spending something more precious than money, my time, writing this review to warn other people.",1.0
This 1 is the ONLY 1 I rate poorly as I believe it was packaged prematurely without getting the chemical treatment that drsws the dust. Otherwise I love these things,1.0
"Stay away, it does not do anything special and for $40! No thank you. It is just a waste of money and actually very big and takes a lot of space in my trunk. Even for an SUV.",1.0
I bought this for my black 2010 gt mustang and it scratched the hell out of my paint do not buy if you plan to use on black vehicles,1.0
This doesn't work as good as it advertises and for $50.00 it should. I was shopping at walmart and they sell it for $11.99 and Autozone sells it for 14.99. Only difference is its not a wooden handle its a hard plastic. Worth getting a plastic handle to save $40.00 in my opinion.,1.0
"The product arrived promptly with the shipping box with no signs of mishandling or wear. That rules out the possibility of the product getting damaged in transit.
After opening the shipping box, there is a plastic pouch about the size of the brush. I opened the pouch only secured by velcro and the product inside is separated in 2 pieces. The wood handle and the brush piece. At first view, you can see that you have to attach the brush in the wood handle with 2 metal screws that is provided.
To my dismay, the wood handle was split in two, like what you would see when someone tried to attach both screws and crack split the wood piece in two.
The brush piece has both screws ALREADY ATTACHED to it! I notice that the screws were not aligned properly which shows signs of mishandling.
Next thought was, this is a product that has been shipped to another customer, returned, and shipped to me without even going through QC (quality control).
In my rulebook, this is enough reason to avoid this vendor like the plague.",1.0
"Don't use this product.  I did purchase one to try out on those ""dusty"" california days here.  It takes out all the dust, yes, but leaves very fine scratches on your finish.  because of it, I do need to use swirlx and scratchx to remove all the fine scratches it produced.  not so good.  Seeing that I have a black car, the scratches actually can be seen fairly well.  I was extremely disappointed and plan on returning it very soon.

I was very VERY skeptical once I saw the giant fibers on this thing.  Now theres a reason why detailers don't use normal towels on their cars -- its because of the bigger fibers!  They use a special weaved microfiber towel to help detail all their cars.  The fibers on the california duster are even BIGGER than normal towels!  How can this NOT scratch your finish.

I recommend avoiding it if you car about your car.  A normal wash, clay, polish and wax will do the job MUCH BETTER than this.",1.0
"My return policy expired before I got to use it, so I threw it in garbage bin where it belongs.

It is a sad attempt to capitalize on popularity of the original item from mid-2000.

1. It sheds red fibers EVERYWHERE it's used.
2. It scratches plastic because there's so little of microfiber on this product that it is impossible not to touch surfaces with a plastic handle base.
3. It's 1/2 size of the original duster. When I saw it first, I thought Amazon sent me a toy instead.
4. It comes with a crappy plastic bag that doesn't close and not even large enough to contain it!
5. It's not waxed at all. The original duster was slightly oily. This one is bone dry.",1.0

"I have a new 2017 white Ford Explorer with the black interior and purchased this duster to keep in the car at all times since black interiors are difficult to keep clean especially in terms of dust showing up on the dash. But, this California Car Duster made matters so much worse and I'm was disappointed and surprised at the same time because it sounds like this is the ""original"" car duster which many people seem to really like. But,  after following the instructions of shaking it and laying it out on newspaper, it still left red fibers all over the car. I would swipe the duster across the dash and any dust was now replaced with hundreds of red fibers which looked worse than the dust. So, I purchased another mini duster (a gray one from Carrand) and I'm much happier with that one. I gave the red one to my husband who has a lighter interior so perhaps, the red fibers wouldn't be as noticeable and he's also not as picky as I am. I definitely wouldn't recommend this if you have a dark interior.",1.0
"This red ""duster"" produces more dust than the dust that were inside my brand new car! I mean, it looks like it snowed red flakes inside my car every time I use it. I am still hoping for it to finally stop loosing its hair but after 3 month I will give up and get one from Walmart. 0 star!",1.0

this thing was made poorly. the hairs come off easily. I wouldn't buy again.,1.0
Since I have the large version of this duster for the outside of my car I thought I would get one for the inside. Mistake. It may be because my dash has texture to it but it left tons of red fibers all over my dash. I shook it out. Let it sit and air out. Shook it again and it did the same thing. I am super disappointed.

It's like the duster head has had a really bad haircut and suffered a massive amount of ""hair"" loss. Now seeing how it was the last minute we went to the auto stores hoping against the odds to find an ""original"" California mini duster comparable  to ours in quality as it was part of a gift. We did find that stores carry them but the quality was as poor as the one we received from online, albeit the difference was that the online purchase came in a baggy with a sticker on the bag and the store bought came with instructions and a storage package and it was less expensive. We found another brand that was almost equal to our old one, so all is well there.

However, while it has been properly stored,  just pulled it out to use for a 2nd time.  I planned to pre-chill it overnight as I leave for a 3 day trip tomorrow.
Well, VERY DISAPPOINTED.  It does not work.  I checked all the connections and even tried different household outlets.
The Koolatron 12-volt battery saver cost $25
Koolatron Multi-Purpose Adapter 110AC to 12 volts cost $30.75
The Koolatron Compact Kooler cost $112.73",1.0
"Does not function as described,better off buying ice! This unit might work well in cooler climes but in the Keys it sucks!",1.0
"This product is not good. I used it for one week in April '14 and on my second week trip in August, the fan broke and my food was spoiled. The first kooler I bought , was inoperable when I received it and had to return it for the replacement. I will not buy another.",1.0
Tried to register my P20 for warranty web site is not active.  Called USA number busy signal or no answer.,1.0
"Reason I sure could use a decent car fridge is so that I can use the 110V in the Inns each night, whereas the old padded cooler has to be unloaded into the hotel fridge every night.  Well, we could certainly hear the fan in this Koolatron. . . and there was definitely air coming from it . . . but it wasn't cool air.  I had previously tried an electric cooler for the car several years ago (which didn't work); and figured possibly by now the quality might be more improved.  So in view of the fact I saw a number of quite glowing reviews for this Koolatron, I took the chance.  As a consequence, we took the cooler on a 4,000-mile road trip and all it did was take up space . . . I had to carry it back home so that I could ship it back, which in itself was a huge bother, although I did appreciate Amazon's return policy. I won't be trying any more car fridges.  Will just keep taking along my old padded cooler.  I was hugely disappointed, as I had high hopes for this product.",1.0
it would not  get cold so I returned it to get a refund.  I would not recommend this product  at all.,1.0
"This product could be so perfect. When it works, it cools as advertised, it fit perfectly behind the passenger seat of my quad cab Nissan, the lid can be flipped up for access from the driver's seat and it is just a nice size. The AC adapter worked to keep things cold in motel rooms. BUT after 5 days, it stopped cooling. The fan ran just fine, but no cooling whatsoever. If you look inside this thing, there isn't much to it. Making it all the more totally pathetic that the manufacturer apparently cannot figure out how to make a reliable unit that works for any length of time. I read the other reviews and figured it was worth the 50/50 chance of getting one that would last. Not so lucky. I'm not going to bother asking for a replacement since the odds look fairly low it would be any more reliable.",1.0
"The cooler takes 12 hours to cool and will not work on and adapter, just A waste of anyones money. Lesson learned.",1.0
"I admit, it is my fault. How I could ever believe that a small plastic box with a giant hole in its side would ever keep things cold remains a mystery.  But I was persistent and tried time and time again... so much so that I have now exceeded the return window on this ridiculous excuse for a cooler. It is not worth donating to a charitable organization.  It is not worth using as a carrying box. It honestly has no value.  I could imagine displaying this as an rare artifact of engineering comedy, but my impression is that this is not so very rare at all.  In fact, I suspect many individuals have been lured by the glowing descriptions of this compact little unit keeping food and drink cold for hours on end to actually purchase this device with optional power adapter. So instead, I will consider this purchase my own small contribution to a sagging economy. In the absence of a Jerry Lewis telethon, we must give to something. I chose cheap plastic fabrication... what about YOU?",1.0
"My Koolatron P-75 cooler stopped working after 7 uses. When contacted, Koolatron did not want to be bothered with ""my problem"". They refused to answer my 2nd e-mail, basically telling me to send it to be repaired at my expense. Poor quality, poor customer service, poor customer relations.",1.0
"Let's make it a simple review.
Cons:
1. It drops temperature by 20 degrees, not 40, unless you test it outdoors in Alaska early Spring.
2. no AC power supply with the unit
3. razor sharp metal parts inside that will cut your zip-locks or your hand
4. cost way more then it is worth
5. has no good cover seal
6. tips over real easy
7. it is noisy and energy inefficient
Pros:
1. It looks good!
2. Is designed for people that don't know how to read thermometer.

Now you can check 70 other reviews (to date) and make your selection.
Yes, it was shipped back. Thank You Amazon for understanding!
Nough said.",1.0
Cooler lasted less than 5 uses and now does not heat or cool.  Customer service/warranty is also worthless.  Buy this is you want to waste your money.,1.0
"I ordered the Koolatron P20 from Amazon on October 13, 2010 and received it promptly from Ace Photo Digital, their outside source. In the car I noticed no real cooling, so I decided to try it in the house using the A/C adapter, which I also had ordered. The house temperature was 70 degrees. I used a refrigerator thermometer which I placed in the bottom of the cooler. After 21 hours of ""cooling"" the temperature inside the cooler was 63 degrees, nowhere near the advertised 40 degrees below ambient temperature. I didn't expect it to cool to 30 degrees--it is not a refrigerator--but I did expect better than 63. I have returned the cooler for a refund.",1.0
"We bought this for our family road trips.  We got to use it TWICE!  The two times we used it, it was great and kept everything inside cool.  The third time we went to use it, it was completely dead.  We bought all the recommended adaptors and followed the instructions that came with it.  Though it worked great two times, it's definately too expensive to only use twice then have to trash.  We were very disappointed and are still looking for a good RELIABLE cooler.",1.0
"I am greatly upset, I received this item within 24 hours of ordering it which was INSANELY fast delivery, however I received it WITHOUT ANY PLUG!!!! I cannot use this item AT ALL. It is marketed/advertised that it comes with an AUTO / D/C plug included to plug in and use in your car, and if you wanted to buy the optional A/C HOUSE plug it was sold seperately. It is supposed to come with the AUTO DC plug, which I am shocked and pisssed off it didn't. I am returning this ASAP and will never order another product from this company ever.",1.0
"I bought this for a cross county trip.  It worked great for three days, then it stopped working. Now I'm using it like a regular cooler and adding ice.  Although I bought it through Amazon, it was from a third party vendor who doesn't return my e-mails on how to return it.  Very expensive ice chest.",1.0
"We were very sorry that this item broke down for us - even after we returned the first and then tried a brand-new second one. We purchased the first in June for a 3-week road trip in July. We also purchased the AC adapter, especially given that the manufacturer recommends when you're on the road to keep the unit going at night with the adapter so it remains cool. The first two weeks, it was fine. Then it all of a sudden, with no warning, stopped working. Whether using the cigarette lighter outlet in the car or the AC adapter - it was dead. We returned it to Amazon when we got home and they were wonderful about sending us a new one to replace it very quickly. Then we went for a 3-day trip with the new one over Labor Day. This time the new one lasted maybe 10 hours on the first day and also died. Amazon allowed us under the circumstances to return both cooler and AC adapter (minus 20% which I can't kick too much about). However, our experience leads me to question whether Amazon should continue to carry this ""product."" We followed all the instructions and did not abuse it in any way and it was definitely very nice - WHILE it worked. Sorry to be so negative but I'm sure you want the truth before you lay out this kind of money for something that can so easily and consistently stop working.",1.0
What a disappointment. We planned on using this cooler when we went on vacation but the thing didn't cool down at all. I plugged it in at the house for 12 hrs to get it cooled down then put some items in it (from the refrigerator) to see if it would keep the items cold. Guess what? It couldn't keep them cool. It barley got down to 65 degrees in the cooler and the house temp was around 78. So I returned it and got a regular cooler for 1/4 of the price.,1.0
"I bought this cooler-heater together with an AC Adapter through Amazon.
Subsequently I read where their AC Adapter caused fires.

I wrote to Koolatron to see if they  had modified the Adapter to prevent these fires and they refused to answer me.

I am not sure why Amazon still carries the product under these circumstances.",1.0
This is the 2nd Koolatron to just quit on me. Very unhappy with this company. No more.,1.0
got it pretty fast; 4 days delivery time. finally got a chance and a day off of work to install it and opened the package and the main face plate that holds everything together was broken. Trying to decide if i want to super glue it or just get one from an auto parts store. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT if you expect items that work and aren't broken.,1.0
"I've had mine for a few years and haven't used it much at all.  Yesterday I tried to use it an it was completely dead.  I checked it on 3 vehicles and it wouldn't even power up.  I took it with me to work and showed it to one of my friends.  He said he has one exactly like it and it's completely dead too.

I called Actron to inquire about getting it repaired.  The lady who worked in customer service INSISTED THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF A CP9135 AS ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS!!  I informed her that is was one of their most popular scanners.  She said there is no way she can help me, except that I can send it in.  I then spoke with another person in another department that blindly told me to send it in.  They couldn't answer anything about estimated repair cost or the amount of time it would take.  Naturally I needed it fixed soon.  Her response was for me to go online, register on some stupid website to get a repair order, then send it in.

Finally I insisted on talking to a technician.  In 5 seconds he told me not to bother sending it in (that potentially save me a lot of wasted time and money!).  He basically told me that they don't fix them and I'd only end up oweing them $75 for evaluating it.  Even if mine was under warranty they'd substitute it for something else.  I was very thankful that at least he was informed and honest.",1.0
"Some thing does not seem right on all the feedback I read, if I am not mistaken at least the first two feedbacks sound like they are posted by the seller. I am permenant shopper on amazon and I susually read comments and feedbacks from other customers before I will make big mistake.
  I saw diffrent model and brand which seems very interesting but it sounds it can help only with GM,Ford and Chevrolet cars, here are list of cars my family and I own, 2001, VW Jetta  VR6, 2001, chrysler PT Cruisser LTD. 2004 Mercedes Benz S600, and 2006 Toyota RAV4, if this machine can not work for all the above vehicles for me it has no value since I don't want to buy 4 different one for 4 diffrent vehicle.

  The one I am really interested in is Equus 3150 Innova ABS + Professional CanOBD2 Diagnostic Code Scanner for OBDII Vehicles, but I want to know more about it specially if it will work for any vehicle, I am ready to buy it.

  Please can someone e-mail me let me know for what kind of more vehicles it works better beside GM,Ford and chevy?

"Ordered this product for my husband a month ago for $69 through Amazon.

The excellent spouse asserts that he used this product a dozen different times on various makes and models of cars. After a few weeks, the lights on the read-out screen dimmed and the cord exhibited a faulty connection. Attempts to jiggle the cord and restart would work for a few minutes, and then the unit would shut down. After a few such efforts, it failed to restart at all.

Do you have an AutoZone, Murray's Discount Auto, Pep Boys or other national chain automotive supply store anywhere near your house or place of work?  If so, did you know that all of these fine stores offer this exact same service (scanning codes and resetting CELs) for FREE?  Oh, as an added bonus, they'll give you a print-out that gives you possible causes for whatever code the device pulls as well as some solutions.

Unless you live prohibitively far from a national chain auto store, there's no reason to purchase this device.  It's a terrible deal.  Thumbs down to this one.",1.0

"These vector ""smart"" units are useless. I've had one for 3 yrs now and not ONCE has it charged a battery. I took the initial unit back since all it did was give me ""fault errors"".  Got the new unit, went to use it a month later, same fault error ""F03 Open Cell"" telling me the battery needed replaced. I have tried to use this garbage unit on at least TEN separate occasions the past couple of years....F03 fault errors every time! Funny thing is, my buddies old ""not smart"" Schumacher charged the batteries right up. Reading some reviews, i noticed someone figured out these units won't charge a battery if it is under 4 volts. WTH? A battery charger that won't charge dead batteries??? Save yourself the headache, avoid this company at all costs..",1.0
"I bought the 2/6/12 amp product at a local but national parts store chain thinking it was going to be a good one.
But it will not charge a battery that is dead and is still good. Sometimes the battery is new but not in use for a few month on one of my collector cars and needs the charge. Also the clamps are crap and break. The spring in the clamp is too strong for the plastic housing and they break in half at the clamping point.
No support from where I bought it either. They don't carry the product anymore...",1.0
"I finally through mine in the garbage today and decided to tell everyone about it.  It is Junk, The clamps broke but worse is if your battery is completely dead it will not charge.  Why would someone make a charger that would will not charge a dead battery.  Junk!!!!Rippoff",1.0
"On 1/16/09 the temp here in Indiana dropped to 8 below zero.  My diesel truck did not start and the 2 batteries were run down trying to get the engine to start.  I brought my VEC1093 out from the garage (it was about 45 degrees in the garage) and attemped to charge the batteries.  It has always functioned fine in warmer weather, but alas when I needed it the most it malfunctioned.  It kept reporting that the battery was fully charged after 5 min.  I wish it was.  The 100 Amp booster did not work either.  I had to get my 17 year old 20 amp Schauer and it charged the batteries enough to start the engine after 1 hour.  The Vector functioned fine after it was warmed.  What good is a battery charger that doesn't work when cold??",1.0
"Being a licensed electrician I was interested in this unit and I purchased the VEC1093D. The advertising does not tell you that this charger will not charge batteries that have less than 4 volts left. In other words you are purchasing a battery charger that will not charge a dead battery! If the battery wasn't dead why would one need a charger? It would not charge a brand new car battery that become fully discharged. I had to jump the car and let the alternator charge the battery. Some smart charger. You can turn it on and it will charge for awhile and walk away thinking it is charging and find a fault code and the battery still dead when you return. Sometimes it will give a different fault code on the same battery each time it is turned on. The labels on the front started curling off within a week. This ""smart charger"" is a waste of time and money. Get an old fashioned charger with a knob or switch on the front - they work every time.",1.0
"Ground clamp broke... only matter of time before the other one breaks as they are both made out of PLASTIC.  I plan on replacing both myself and if/when the charging portion does not work as it should, it is going in the garbage and I will never buy another Vector product again.  Customer service is horrible.  Save your money -- there are better chargers available for same or less $$$.",1.0
"I found the charger did not work when I really needed it. My car battery was totally dead after several days with the dome light on (didn't know at the time). When the charger was connected to the battery, the charger would not start charging and would display an error that it was not connected to the battery. The owner's manual confirmed that the battery charger will not work if the battery has less than 4 volts in it. For me, this is unacceptable. There should some sort of override on this.",1.0
"I bought this charger based solely on the advertisement...Big mistake....Had it a very short time and both the clamps broke.  I called the manufacture and they said to send it back and they would replace the clamps.  Shipping cost would be my responsibility of course.  They told me they will replace the clamps with the same cheap ones the broke when I had it. As far as I am concerned, customer service on this charger stinks.  I would not recommend anyone buy this charger if dependability is a requirement.",1.0
Bought this unit new instead of reconditioned . Used it appx. 5 times and it broke.(had it for 5 mo.) The shipping is appx 14.00 everytime it is sent back for repair.

The reason I don't like this product and can not recommend it is two fold.  First, the beep beep noise is actually like a beep beep squack squack beep squack.  The pitch changes all the time and it actually is embarrassing.  It was my fault that I called to inform the company about this like 6 or 7 weeks after I got it, as it was just not high on the list of things to do.  They have a year warranty.  Well, they want me to pay the shipping to return it.  I explained to them that while I did fail to call sooner, I am not a liar and the product was bad upon receipt.  I already blew 25 bucks on this piece of junk, so I'm not sure I even care to spend another $5.00 to get a replacement.  That is my experience and how I feel about this product.  I bought this item at etrailer dot com and because of the way they are handling the return I learned the hard way that I should have got it from Amazon and now I know where I will not be shopping.  It's not a huge amount of money, but I have to budget every penny I spend so it affects me more than someone who might have discretionary income.",1.0

I left the other one in, being I needed a new bulb anyway.",1.0

"4 hour install time worked great first night only to realize when i got in my car i had no power to my heater...

checked all wiring again to find i hooked accessory wire wire to ignition wire no problem fixed this and now it starts and i have heat. great.

second night 4am rolls around i go to window to push button nothing i hit the stop button no lights flashing even go out to car dead battery
and remote start box is clicking grab jump starter hook up let charge for 30 min start car via the key only to notice the remote start box is still clicking press brake pedal clicking stops.

thinking this thing is going to show a huge fault / rip off when i go to run a draw test on the battery latter to day.

well check all connections all are solid still as i soldered them with silver solder ran draw test unit draws 1A and also no longer works
reset the unit using the turn key 5 times as per instructed in manual hit start with key out of ignition and lights blink once nothing more.

i would bet the bank on the unit fried it self as obvious 1 amp draw is way to much.  and when first installed was 43 milli amps or 0.043 amps
now 1 amp and when i disconnect unit it goes back to 0.039 guess i know where the problem is

Junk from Junk company hate to half to write a bad review but i have herd stories while working in a parts store for a year about bulldog products i will be sure to help people steer clear of bulldog products as now i have found out first hand the root of the cause poor manufacturing.

will open circuit box later to day and up load photo i am sure i will find a few burnt chips and marks on the board along with terrible connections with small wires to support 1~5 amp draws that are normal of ignition wires let alone accessory wires running heaters with normal being 10~15 amp on high.",1.0

"This has to be the worst remote start ever made. It was installed by our local auto toys store and paired with a pkall unit for my Lexus. Every time it started the horn would blow, and would only ever start from a few feet away. So if I was more then a few car lengths away I was out of luck. The car place told me this is truly the bottom end brand, so after a year of suffering with this unit I had it removed and a python installed. Now that's a REAL remote start.

It came out of the box not working and now I have to pay to ship the unit back to bulldog for repair. It was pretty easy install but now I will have to wait a week or so to get a working replacement. I do not think it is fair that a product I purchased 4 days ago should be replaced by my refurbished original. The issue in a nutshell is that there is no range at all. I have to be within inches of the box or yellow standard antenna for it to work. I even went to the store to get a new battery for the key remote but it did not help.

"Put many of these ""Bulldog Security"", brand remote starters in our vehicles for many years. Mainly because the had a ""Lifetime "" warranty.

Cause when I called customer service, I am told, that the company was sold and all they can do is offer me an upgrade for $40. plus whatever it costs for me to ship it to them. Years ago, with original owners of the company, They would have you return the defective unit and would send you a new one for free. Can buy brand new, unopened (never installed) sets, on craigs-list for $20. to $50. lately. Now I see why they are going so cheap. So much for ,""guaranteed forever"". Those days are gone with the old company. Their products are priced much higher now, yet no warranty.

So I brought this item for my husband fpr Christmas. He really wanted a remote starter so I thought I'd save a few bucks and buy one online.

"This is my wife's logon name.  The bulldog remote start system came with a 2001 ford ranger that I bought but the previous owner had to replace the battery in the truck.  That should have given my a clue.  The remote had lost it's program so i went to the website for some troubleshooting.  I followed the steps to the T and got remote reprogrammed.  It worked like a charm.  A few hours later i used the remote and the truck started just perfectly.  Three or four minutes later I went to get inside and head to McDonalds but the truck had already shut off.  I thought that was odd because i have heard of other starters letting the vehicle run for at least 15 minutes.  Oh well though I figured I'd just start it with my key and head out.  With a turn of the key...nothing, just a click.  So i pulled my wife's HUMMER up beside my ranger and tried to jump it off.  Nothing but clicks.  So i hooked up my battery charger and jumped in my van and went for dinner.  Got back home and check the guage on my charger and the battery was fully charged so i tried to start the truck and nothing but clicks.  Either the starter is fried or the silinoid is fried.  I check all the wires and hook-ups and everything is hooked up correctly.  I'm not even going to attempt to contact the company unless they want to come help me unhook it and drop it in the trash can where it belongs.  The next time I get a remote starter it won't cost $50 or $60.  I'll pay for the best to stay away from the headaches of CRAP merchandise like this one.  Thanks a lot Bulldog now i have to take my starter off tomorrow, buy another one, and then put it back on.  You could repay me the money for the cost but you could never repay me for the time that i will have to waste tomorrow fixing your mistakes.

"I've tried 2 different remote starters by Bulldog Security. To me they were easy to install with the ""T"" harness. But they just don't work worth a darn. One of mine had a stated range of over 1,000 feet. It would not work more than 10 feet fom the car. It would not start the car in the driveway while I was standing at the back door of my house or while standing at a window about 30 feet from the car. And it was supposed to have a range of 1,000 feet ? Yeah right ! And like almost everyone says, it's like going through hell and high water to ever get a live person on the phone. And then they act like they don't give a rat's a_ _. They are definitely not customer oriented. Very inferior product and company. I will never think about purchasing one of their products again.

I then tried to call other departments, sales, tech support, customer service, even accounting, accounts payable, receivable. Not one human ever answered the phone, or called me back.

It then became a sport, I was determined to get a human on the phone.

"This company blows. First off, they sent me an installation video in FRENCH. I do not speak French. In addition to that, they probably have the worst tech support I've ever encountered. Music on-hold for an eternity, then it goes to a ""this mail box is full and cannot take new messages"" and you can either press 1 to get put back on hold until it cycles back thru to the mailbox being full again, or just forget about it. Either way the result is the same. I'd call it technical non-support. The one time I did get to talk to someone it was determined that my transponder key bypass module was defective, and I was told I could send it back for repair. Honestly, you can't just send me a new one. It was seriously the cheesiest piece of garbage in the first place. It looks like it couldn't have cost $5 to make, but I have to wait a couple weeks while I send it back, they fix it, and then send it back, instead of just sending me a new one.

"I saw this product on dealnewsdotcom when it was on sale for 28.37, with shipping.  My due diligence resulted in not making the purchase even at that low price.

Toyota Camry from 2007 to present includes a factory installed immobilizer device.  The engine can't be started unless the car detects a radio frequency signal from the key fob.

This arrangement makes stealing a car much harder for younger, less experienced, ""grab and go"" car thieves.  The usual method is gain entry, break off the key lock with a slide puller, then turn the internal lock mechanism with a pair of pliers.  The car is gone in 60 seconds or less.  The technique is reputedly well known to young teenagers.

This method, or the more difficult technique of hot wiring, will not start a car that is equipped with an engine immobilizer.

Obviously, a DIY remote starter faces the same problem.  The remote starter can bypass the wiring but the car will not start without detecting the RFI chip in the key fob.

The ""solution"" for this Bulldog RS1100 or any other DIY remote starter is that you have to put your spare, factory supplied key inside the unit.  The ""bypass module"" can be a separate unit or it can be integral, as it is with this RS1100.  The car can then be started remotely because the car detects the RFI signal from the spare key.

This also means that you have permanently stored a spare key inside your vehicle in a place where every car thief will know to look.  The placement of the remote starter module is dictated by the wiring within any particular vehicle.  You're not going to have a lot of options for where the module, with your spare key inside, is to be found.

Decide for yourself whether this breach of security is worth the convenience of a remote starter.  Personally, I think it's foolish.",1.0

The installer arrived on time but did not know much about the Bulldog Product. He kept on having to look at the paperwork that came with the starter. When he finished the car would crank and not stop cranking for a long period of time then it would shut down. I checked the web site and found a so called fix, this did not work. We tried some other adjustments with the tach mode and that did not work. Long story short I had the starter in my car for 4 months trying many fixes and adjustments, no luck. Well last night I finally just ripped the starter out and put it in the trash. What a waste of $400 including the install.",1.0

"Tried to install this recently. Discovered I would need a 791 bypass for my vehicle. Put everything in and the car will crank but not start. Move the antenna loop around and shazam it starts. Put everything back together and the car will crank but not start again. Went throught this exercise several times. Bottom line when I put the cover on that goes over the steering column the transponder ring is not effective. I can take the cover off and move the ring near the ignition switch key hole and everthing works. Now if I want to leave the cover off this is a great peice of eqiupment. Of course this will not look like junk and therefore I will not do so.

Today I have a vehicle with butchered wiring that will not start with the remote. There is no apparent solution to this problem as tech support is short and unconcerned. I have called and emailed several times. They are quick to talk over you and come off quite cavalier.

Bottom line after spending $65 for the unit, $26 for the 791 bypass, $100 for the extra programmed key to go in the 791, the best part of the day installing this thing, and then another day or so troublesooting I would have been much better off spending $200 at Best Buy to have them install one of their units. A buddy of mine did so and has been starting his car remotely while I have not. This is a Rube Goldberg device at best.

"I got one of these as a Christmas present a few years ago. I am not technically inclined, but the ad made it seem like any idiot could do this no sweat. Well after about a week of freezing and laying in ridiculous positions, I got it installed. I had a mess of wires everywhere and there is not much room to work in my car. Maybe if I had a garage, or liked working on cars I would be telling a different story, but I don't. Well it worked well for a while and then my dash lights stopped working. It wasn't a fuse, and my mechanic said that electrical stuff can be expensive just to trouble shoot so I have been without dash lights for a while. Recently, I had to 'panic stop' to avoid hitting a black bear and my starter has stopped working ever since, in addition to all the other problems the sudden stop caused.
  I won't lie. I hate working on cars and I'm not good with them. I got this so I could have a warm car on cold mornings. That much was really nice. I wish I had a professional install this though. It was a headache, and honestly, I would not have gotten this if I knew it would be this much trouble. For car people this is probably no sweat.

"Let me start off by saying that I was a mechanic for a few years and now have an electrical engineering degree so installing this should not have been a problem.  I also have the shop manual for my car which gives me info on were all the wire are.  They also do not sell a T-harness for my car (97 Lexus ES 300) so I had to splice in all the wires myself.

Install took about 2 hours.  When the unit after install the car started ran for 5 seconds then shut off.  It did that again then the alarm went off.  I call tech support and they tell me the only way to operate this unit with my car is to use the factory transponder to unlock the car first.  Well that sucks who wants to do that, + you have to have two key fobs with you,+ if you forget to unlock first the alarm will go off.
So I figure out a way around that by taking the FASD wire and connected it to my unlock wire in the door.  This way before it remote starts the car it will unlock the door like you put the key in the door and unlocked it.  The tech support said there was no way to do this

Now it should work it starts and runs for a few seconds then turns off and keeps repeating.  I connect the TACH wire from the remote start to the tachometer feed in the car.  Program the unit for TACH operation.  Then teach it to learn the TACH.  Same dam problem.
Call tech support and ask him about the problem.  He says the unit is not seeing noise after the car starts.  I tell him that's why I connected the TACH I also know the unit learned the TACH because it confirmed it did when I was programming it.  His advice is to remove the TACH wire and connect to an ignition wire.  To me this is crap half ass solution.  Asked what signal the remote start is looking for so I could go out with an oscilloscope and check the TACH output or make it look like the unit wants and he could not tell me.
I cannot trust this unit without the TACH connected.  Last thing I want is to be replacing the battery or the started because this unit kept trying to start the car over and over again when i am inside waiting for the car to warm up.

You get what you pay for (the RS1100 and RS1200 are the same thing I asked tech support)",1.0
"I agree with other negative posts. the tech support is a scam.  Anyone putting in 4star ratings and talking about cheerful tech support agents has got to be a plant. I installed the unit on a Dodge Stratus with moderate success.  Took about 6 hrs.  It worked for a couple weeks, now just restarts every 5 seconds.  I emailed tech support a couple weeks ago and never heard back.  I have called tech support about a dozen times and get nothing, not even an answering machine.  I'm sure my problem could be answered pretty quickly by a knowledgeable support person, but it appears that no such support exists.  I'm tempted to rip it out and try to get my money back.",1.0
"I was given this product as a gift, and after looking into reviews I wasn't overly excited to get started working on it. I realized I needed a security bypass, which was not currently available online. I tried to call them, no one answered. I proceeded to call 4-5 times a day. I then tried to call other departments, sales, tech support, customer service, even accounting, accounts payable, receivable. Not one human ever answered the phone, or called me back.

It then became a sport, I was determined to get a human on the phone. Embarrassingly I probably called a total of 35 times. 3 days later, I realized I probably could spend my time better by just writing bad reviews online. So do yourself a favor, don't buy this product, and support a sham company.",1.0
"The starter seems to work, just not on my Jeep Cherokee. After 2 phone calls and several emails to support, it was determined that the unit was bad. Got a new unit, installed and the same thing happened. The unit doesn't see a voltage increase once the vehicle is started and shuts it off. Tried to get in touch with support again...not happening.

Support just stinks, you have to leave a message and hope they call back at a convient time. Email takes 2 days or better.",1.0
"Let me start out by saying I have installed at least a 2 dozen different remote starters so far. I know how these things work and how they are supposed to work. I have installed remote starters in many different brands of vehicles with and without transponder keys. I did read the install manual from front to back before purchasing the unit and then before I installed the thing. I did solder the wires like the manual suggested instead of the wire crimp method. I even double checked that I was using the proper wires with a VOM and compared the results with the wire diagram Bulldog had on there web site. They did have a couple errors for the Honda Element 2004-2008 diagram.

So after installing the remote starter and the transponder bypass module, module 791. By the way, the 791 module is a cheap piece of crap. The key almost falls out of the thing when you finally get it open to place the key in the loop. The key can just flop around in there and more than likely short out some of the electronics. Now the starter is installed and the moment of truth arrives. I hit the start button and........... the car turns over but won't start. I double check my wires and check the transponder module. Everything is correct. I try it again. Nothing. The starter try's 3 times then quits. I unplug the thing and check my wires once again. This time the car starts. I didn't change a thing. I feel pretty good. 30 seconds later, the car shuts off. God F@#$%ing dammit POS!!!!!! Now I am pissed!!!!! There has to be a problem with the transponder key bypass to shut the car down. I put a key in the ignition. Same thing. I took it out of the car and tried to bench test it the thing just starts and stops.

So let's fast forward 4+ hours of troubleshooting. Conveniently the DIY kit tech support is not available on the weekend. There hours are like 9:30 to 5pm. How convenient, a DIY kit with tech support with normal hours. Because all DIY people install stuff during the normal work week hours. I write them a long email about the problems and what I did to troubleshoot the thing. They write back, yup it's bad please send it back with a $25 check. That's it, you pissed me off. I packed it back up and returned it to Amazon.

So my advice is stay away form this thing like the plague. It is a piece of crap. I wasted at least 5 hours with this thing. I can normally install a car starter in a hour or so. I was trying to install this without my wife knowing so that Xmas morning she could have a remote start key fob in her stocking to just start her car and be on her way. To late now. Thanks Bulldog for building a total piece of crap. Now I have all there wiring tied into the car that needs to get taken out for the new one and it's too late to reinstall a new one to make it a surprise. So I now have to wrap up another one as a gift. That just sucks. I mean seriously, does your wife or significant other want to open up a remote starter that isn't installed? No, I don't think so. Then they have to wait to get it installed. I have done this type of thing for other were it gets installed before xmas and it is awesome to see the look on there face when the car starts. So I will never purchase a Bulldog product again or ever recommend it. I will be sure to recommend other brands as they actually DO work.

Seriously disappointed",1.0
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PRODUCT BUT DO NOT BUY FROM NORTHERN TOLL + EQUIPMENT THE  ONE YOU GET IS NOT A BULLDOG IT IS A PRESTIGE AND WHEN YOU CALL THEM ABOUT IT THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE THE SAME THING AND THEY ARE NOT!,1.0
"I have installed two of these units now and they BOTH had exactly the same problem... they work for about a month and then quit working. Once they stop working, you have to unplug all the wired from the unit and simply plug them back in and that seems to reset everything and allow it to work for a few more days until you have to reset the unit all over again! WHAT A PAIN IN THE A**. This thing really should be called bull**it security!

Not only are the directions extremely vague, but they simply leave you guessing at almost every wire splice!",1.0
"I spent countless hours on trying to get this to work. I even bought the T-harness to make the install easier. The T-harness only hooks up the remote car starter part of it. I was under the impression that it would hook up everything just to find that it doesnt. I also bought a bypass for the anti-theft system. I put this system in but couldn't find the power lock wires that I needed to. So I went ahead and figured I could go without the locks. This is where it got interesting. After spending hours and getting everything hooked up,I pushed the start button. The Trailblazer started........and shut off. Tried it again and the same thing happened over and over. Well went to the computer and found that the $120.00 bypass module I got needed to be reset because it was giving me a code. Huh,no problem,went through the list to reset it and got to the next to last step. You need to hit the lock/unlock button. Remember me saying I didn't wire the locks. I went back hooked the lock wires from the remote starter to the bypass module. Went through the reset list and nothing happened. After a hour of trying to wire this and that I came to realize that it must have to go through the anti-theft system itself and I couldn't find those wires to wire it up. I called support and left messages to which I still haven't heard anything yet to date. I emailed support and still haven't heard anything yet to date. All in all,I spent $240.00 for complete junk that I counldnt get to work. I also spent hours on the computer doing research because their directions suck and aren't clear. If you have no expereince in automobiles or wireing STAY AWAY from this crap. Its nothing more than a headache. Remember nothing is universal!",1.0

"The unit I received has a different end where the tow ball attaches. Instead of being square, so that the ball's shaft can go all the way through and the nut tightened underneath, it is cut at an angle so there is only a hole on top. The shaft goes into the tube and the nut needs to be tightened inside the tube. I can't find a wrench or socket that can fit the 1-1/8"" nut on the tow ball shaft and fit inside the tube. I'm not sure how much I'd trust it attached only to one wall of the tube anyway.",1.0

Yah, we should have noticed this at installation, but didn't.  So we did not return and my husband is going to try to weld a reinforcement bar so that we can use it.",1.0
"I recently purchased Nikwax Glove Proof and used it today on an old pair of leather ski gloves.  I have not tested the gloves in the snow yet, but I wanted to comment on the ""sponge-on"" applicator.  I found the applicator to be very difficult to use and would not buy it again.  I understand not wanting to super-saturate the gloves, but it would be nice if you could simply ""sponge-on"" the wax.  Instead, I had to dab, press, dab harder, press harder and hold, wait, press more, dab vigorously, wait, bounce the applicator up and down on the glove, until I finally found that if you almost beat the glove with the sponge, wax will slowly ooze it's way out.  Maybe I received a defective bottle??  My wife suggested I hacksaw the top off the bottle and use a rag.  Regardless, I'll try a different product next time.",1.0

The white filter inside is 1/8 inch think and retains gas. Unless you have the opportunity to leave in the sun before putting away in your pack or car it is not very practical. Alternative is remove the filter and toss as I did. It is also bigger than necessary for backpacking so I cut the height  in half and saved the weight. Works great now with the modifications. Fits tight in a Svea stove so no spills when filling and even has an air vent to let out air as fuel goes in.,1.0
"I purchased one of the older versions of this rack (when it was the current version), and after only 2 years it is no longer usable.

The lock is extremely susceptible to dirt, grime, road salt etc. Last time I removed the lock I had to soak the lock in penetrating oil and lightly heat pin with a torch, this was the only way I could get the key to turn.

My failing was that I did not exercise and clean the lock frequently enough, if your like me and want to lock it and forget it look else where.",1.0
I used this for a set of led back-up lights mounted for a receiver. In spite of packing it with synthetic grease and using the cap the lock seized.

"Absolutely useless for a permanent or even a semi-permanent repair. Followed all directions to the letter... I even set a timer to make sure i was letting the ""cement"" have the correct amount of time to ""dry"" before applying the patch (60 seconds)...

If you have ever glued anything together will rubber cement, like a picture in a scrapbook, you will have a good idea of how well these patches will hold, which is barely at all.... Brush up against them and they will peel off (even with the corners rounded)...

They will work for a (very) temporary repair of a pin sized hole if you are out camping or have no other options available... But they are not advertised as a temporary fix, they are advertised as a repair.... So i cannot give this any more than one star (i would give it half a star if i could)... This patch didn't even last through the night, i ended up getting my bottle of gorilla glue and gluing the SOB back on there after it fell off in about an hour... And the patch was on the bottom so i wasn't even rubbing my body on it or anything. (i don't advise using gorilla glue, as it dries stiff and is not safe for some plastics, but it was my only option at the time.)

Do not waste your time and money... Either get a bicycle repair kit, or another option is flex seal or somthing similar if it is a small pinhole.... even a drop of super glue would work better than these patches.... I cant beleive i spent $5 on these.",1.0

The hook may hold 1000 lbs. although the plastic that holds it into the pocket will crack and break.

I have a full-size (8-ft) bed, and just attempted to use this net for the first time.

"UPDATE: JAN 31, 2018
As an addendum, this cover (received vacuum-packed, like a slab of bacon) is STILL wrinkled - the elastic is shot and hanging limp - and the cable lock grommets have fallen off. I might also mention, the eyelet on my Budge car cover cable broke in half this week, rendering it useless. And, the Budge shackle lock that accompanied the Budge car cover cable broke months ago (shackle snapped off like a candy cane).

Needless to say, my Budge experience has been remarkably unpleasant. I should have trusted my instincts, the moment I opened the package, and RMA'ed it back to Amazon. Downgrading to 1-star (I hate it) ...

ORIGINAL REVIEW

1) I've bought various car covers since the 80s, but NEVER bought one that was vacuum-packed like a pound of bacon.  They usually come neatly folder-over in a large box.  As a result of this silliness, this cover will be probably be perpetually wrinkled.

2) The strap that secures the cover to the trunk lock is uber short, leaving the middle-half of the rear bumper exposed to the elements.  The choice is to not use the strap, and risk having the cover blow away in the wind, or somehow come up with a workaround to lengthen the strap yourself.

3) The elastic border that runs the entire length of the lower cover is ridiculously short and tight -- probably so they could vacuum-pack it into the space of a bacon package.  Hopefully it's made of cheap materials, like the rest of the cover, and will stretch-out after a few weeks of sitting in the Arizona sun.  If not, I'm returning it for a refund !",1.0
"Well.... the product is nice and all, but it doesn't fit my 61 Cadillac. The measurements I put on said that the size I got would be fine... but the tail fins poked right through. So now it is useless, and it is non returnable.",1.0
"I was pleased at first, because it was relatively inexpensive and fit fairly well. The construction seemed nice, but the material was thin and felt cheap. I will not buy this again... It lasted 2 months before it tore. The area of the tear looks thin and has the texture of dry paper. It basically disintegrated after 2 months of summer. Until these manufacturers use better materials, I'm done. It's like buying a yard umbrella, then it fades and crumbles in one season. You're better off with a standard blue plastic tarp and some bungee chords.",1.0
"You get what you pay for. Bought this to kept dust, sap and rain off the car after I wash it. Put it on for the first time this past Friday. Had a light rain Saturday morning. When I removed the cover the car looked great. Thunderstorms and hard rain last night. Took it off this morning and the car was soaked and something bled from the cover to make it chalky. Looked worse than if I had just let the car get rained on. If you live where there is not a lot of rain I think it would work good for protecting against dust, sap and those bird drppings",1.0
"The description says that it's good ""for light rain"" but this top is NOT WATERPROOF!!!!  My car now has water damage inside because of this misleading description.  I hope the manufacturer will add a statement to this so that other buyers will know that it's basically just a light dust cover.",1.0

"I bought this car cover in the 157 inch length for my boyfriend's 1986 Toyota MR2. It was a snug fit, just in case anyone was wondering.

The cover seemed to be fine when we put it on the car. We have two other Budge covers and they are holding up just fine. However, this one is not.

It was delivered on the 25th of June and we put it on the car about a week later. Since that time, every time I go out to the driveway there are more and more rips in the cover. At first there was only one at the rear corner on the spoiler - I thought maybe someone caught their bag on it or something and, oh well, we could live with it.

However, the more time passed, the more rips became apparent all over the car and when I went to inspect it, I was shocked. As soon as my fingers touched the cover it began to disintegrate under a very light touch. This cover is crumbling after only three weeks being on the car.

I am going to utilize the warranty to get a replacement and if the replacement is the same quality as the other covers we have, I will update this review, but so far I am very disappointed in this cover. It's not high end by any means, but it shouldn't be disintegrating after a month of use.",1.0

"I bought the Milton S-516 air chuck and couldn't wait to get it. When it arrived I went to my shop and hooked it up. When I went to fill a tire the chuck was shooting air out both top and bottom of the chuck. I had to try it several times before the chuck finally sealed and would stop shooting air out of the top. By then what little air in the tire was all gone.  The next problem was the pressure gage didn't work. I saw on the internet that you were able to adjust the gage by removing the end cap removing, 2 washers ,the end cap to the gage itself and adjusting the screw. After 7 attempts of disassembling and reassembling the unit I finally got the air gage dialed in. Shouldn't this be calibrated from the factory ? Even after basically rebuilding the unit I still won't use it because the chuck isn't reliable . I'm better off with a basic chuck and a separate dial gage. I'm wondering if the people who gave this gage a good review have even checked its accuracy.",1.0

I guess it is good if you keep the car in the garage, not so good if you keep the car outside - which is the point of having a car cover. Lame.",1.0

"I am really quite upset about the cover! The website made it very clear to the customer that they wanted to be sure the cover would fit!

Leaving our car outside with this on caused severe condensation to pool inside the car and messed up our CD player and electronics in the car as well.

"This product is not as described, but may very well work for your use.  I just want to cover some of my cars in the garage and I have an old Budge (B3) cover I really like that is a soft T-shirt like material.  The old cover is great as an indoor dust cover and washable, and I wish I could find more, but apparently that is not possible now unless you want to spend more than $200.

This cover arrived today from Amazon and it does NOT have the soft interior as described, although it might be fine and not scratch the car. I was ready to order 3 or more of these if it had been soft inside, but I guess now I will resort to sheets or blankets or just wash the cars when they get dusty. In my opinion it is too bad that no company today makes a soft inexpensive indoor car cover. Well also too bad that Amazon's description is not correct.  I will keep it and use it on one of my cars, but it will not go on any of the garaged cars I really-really like.",1.0

"Mainly, this thing indeed protects your glass from rain and it is generally good in providing clear picture in my rainy Northwest climate.
HOWEVER, instructions seems to overlook one very important fact about this product - it will form a while thick layer on your windshield once you will turn your wipers at the first rain! This layer will last for a minute or two before clarifying, almost completely blocking the view. Those 1-2 minutes of low visibility have cost me my car - I've missed a car in front of me doing a hard stop and totaled mine... Thanks heaven the speed was low, nobody was hurt, I even did not get a traffic ticket and my hubby received a new shiny car (I am driving his old one for now).

I would suggest to add next to the instructions: once you've applied this stuff to your windshield, wiped excess with soft cloth and polished using circular motion (see instructions), TURN ON YOUR WIPERS AND POOR WATER TO IMITATE RAIN AND GET RID OF THE EXTRA RAIN-X ON THE GLASS!!! Otherwise, it is not safe on the road.

"I usually consider this kind of product as snake oil- but when I priced the cost of a new plastic window on my 1990 Miata, I thought it was worth a try even if it turned out to be a dud.
The window was not only opaque, but had a yellow color (probably oxidized)- I could not believe that it made it transparent again but also clear!  No yellow!  I can see the contrast between the whole window and the edge crevices where I couldn't get into.
I bought the kit of 3 products- this one produced the biggest improvement, the # 10 a little bit better, and I am not sure if the # 18 did much- but supposedly that protects it- Maybe using all 3 will keep it clear longer, but it is way to soon to know-
It  is definitely  worth trying on any type of plastic!

UPDATE: I thought I got all of the M17 off with a soft cloth, I was originally thrilled with M17, but now I am just angry - I don't know if the problem was the M18 or M17- I used it to take the oxidation off my convertible's window- It did a great job- I removed as much as I could with a soft rag- but then something weird happened- when it rained, some of the residue was washed off the window onto the fabric around it- wherever it touched I have white staining and white dots- they seem impossible to remove. I am going back to the glowing review I wrote for the M17 and change it.",1.0

"Based on the many positive reviews, I expected this product to at least make some difference in the clarity of the plastic windows on my convertible top, but after considerable effort, I saw absolutely zero improvement. This stuff did absolutely NOTHING. I consider it a complete waste of money. Apparently it only removes scratches you can't see in the first place!",1.0
"The first sample I received had a deposit of dark dust on the bottle shoulder as if it had been setting on a shelf for a long tine in a dusty place. There was no seal on the bottle and the bottle was about 80% full. I requested a replacement.

The replacement bottle also was dirty on the bottle shoulders, had no seal on it but was about 95% full. Perhaps Meguiar's doesn't seal their product which is odd as it does evaporate and contains distillates. At least the 2nd bottle appeared to be filled to the appropriate level. Also neither bottle is labeled as pictured although the name is the same.

I used the product on the rear window of my mint 2001 BMW M roadster. This well care for, garaged car had minor scratching across the rear window as all of these cars get over the years. As my car was well cared for, the scratching was minor compared to most. The scratching is caused by the window rubbing against itself when folded.

I found the product useless. I tried gentle rubbing with a microfiber cloth, a cotton cloth and a foam pad  DA polisher. There was no improvement on these minor scratches. Perhaps the material BMW uses is so soft, the scratches occur easily and are impossible to remove entirely. I have owned 3 of these series cars from new to low mileage used and all the windows develop this horizontal ""stripe.""

Since this product did absolutely nothing to improve my window, I would question its ability to improve any soft window. This was my only purpose and usage of the product and I do not recommend it.",1.0
I used this on the headlights of a 2004 Mazda that was garage kept for all but one year in California.  The headlights had surface crazing from age.  The product did nothing.  I used the Meguire's Plastic polish afterward.  I consider both a waste of money.  I could have cleaned the surface with isopropyl alcohol and used any wax.

"This item was recommend to go with a specific spare tire carrier. Well, once they came in, it's glaringly obvious that this item, does not fit on that carrier. The ""exit"" hole for the bolt (what will stick out above the nut), is far too small, and will never work on any size tire carrier that I've ever used or seen. The only way this item will work at all, is if the nut ends up on the very end of the bolt, and unless you have a hard mounted mount with specific length all-thread welded on, then this will not work without taking it to the drill press.

"I was disappointed with this product and I seldom post a review.  But after installing as per instructions, the lock covered the lug nut, but loosely enough to leave a thief laughing at my attempt to provide a deterrent.  With a screw driver, I easily placed the blade under the loose fitting cover at the opposite end of the keyed lock and flipped the cover off.  I then backed off the lug nut and removed the back plate for the tire lock.",1.0
"Did not work for me!  The hole in lock was too small and would not go over the u-bolt.  Had to drill it out to size.  Once lock was installed (as per instructions) I could turn the entire lock assembly (a little hard but), and at same time, loosening the lug nut and  thereby able to remove the tire.

My fix was to install 2 thin lug nuts (grounded down to fit inside the lock assy.) and jam them together, preventing them from turning when the lock was turned.  I carry a pliers and a crescent wrench to loosen the jammed lugs for removal.

This way, when the lock is installed, you can turn the lock assembly all you want, but never able to loosen the nuts.

Should have sent me a larger lock for the u-bolt you sent; and maybe one with a swivel washer of some sort.  Then again, maybe there's something I don't know.",1.0

"I purchased this for my Seadoo Challenger and was very unhappy with the results.  I followed the instructions just as they were written.  It did not leave a shiny finish but rather a hazy one.  When I called the 800 number listed on the bottle the man proceeded to ask me if I used a machine to apply it.  I replied that I did not, I followed the directions for hand application as I do not have a buffing machine.  He proceeded to tell me that it was made to be used with a machine.  I asked for a refund as this was not stated any where in your instructions and it is even printed on the bottle how to use with hand application.  He gave me his email and said that it was no problem to return it.  That was a week ago and I have not heard anything from them.",1.0

"This charger may be fine as a trickle charger for an already charged battery, at least it did not do any damage when I hooked it up for a few days to my boat battery last winter. However, I have lost all trust in this unit after recently trying to charge a motorcycle battery which had been accidentally drained to about 7.5V. 1.5A would seem perfect to gently charge a motorcycle battery, so I hooked it up for an afternoon. The battery voltage rose to 11V within seconds as expected but when I came back a few hours later the unit was very hot and the battery was back down to seven volts, with a very weak red light on the charger. I tried it a few more times. It would start charging but then 30 seconds later a click could be heard inside the unit, as from a relay, and the voltage would start decreasing again. I borrowed an old-fashioned Sears 4A charger from a friend which charged the battery just fine within a matter of hours and it has been holding a charge ever since, so I know it was not a faulty or shorted battery to blame. Any ""dumb"" trickle charger would have done the job just fine, given enough time. I have lost trust in this unit and its ""automatic"" features.",1.0

There is not indication on-line or in the manual what could cause this behavior.  Also, Schumacher claims it this charger is okay to leave connected while not charging.

After examining them it is apparent that Fram is not what you would think they were.  fram filters have 1/2"" spaces in between the filter bends.  all the rest were nice and tight 18"" or less.  also the over flow valve on the fram is poorly constructed.  most were built in to the filter but frams just sat in there along with the sealing o-ring. still doing the job but not as effectively.  An instructor told me that they put the black grippy stuff on there because it is junk metal and if you try to use a filter wrench it will rip the metal.  I can't confirm that seeing as I used fram filters for a little bit and never used a wrench to remove.  thanks to the black stuff.",1.0

To cut open, I used a hack saw to cut about 1/2 inch from the base plate.  Go ahead, see for yourself!  Be a cut-up!

"Im a car fanatic and for decades I have been using microfiber towels to dry my car after wash. When I saw the advertisement for this product and read some of the positive reviews I decided to order and use it to dry my car. BIG DESAPOINTMENT! The concept of this product is clever but it doesnt perform well compared to a microfiber towel. First of all you barely move it a few inches and it adsorbs the water and it becomes very heavy and tough. I also noticed it leaves a trail of water behind. As a result you need to keep coming back to the same area to ensure its totaly dry. Second of all it cant be used to dry those hard to reach spots on cars like around the headlights, tail lights, door hinges, etc. therefore, when I was done drying my car (which took twice the time compared to when I use a microfiber) I still had to use my regular microfiber towel to ensure these tigh spots were dry. Bottom line: This towel made the process of drying my car longer, tougher, and not as efficient. I will stick with the microfiber towel to dry my vehicle and since I cant return this product I will use it to dry liquid spills around my house.",1.0

What they don't tell you about this little charger is that if it isn't plugged in to an AC outlet it actually DRAWS power from your battery. The eyelet connections implies you can hook it up and plug it in when you need to and leave it connected to the battery. This is not the case. Had this on my generator battery and it charged perfectly. I unplugged the ac cord and left the charger connection attached to the battery. Came back 3 days later and the battery was completely dead. Used another charger to charge it again and noticed that the red light on the original charger illuminate (it was not connected to ac at this point). When I pulled the other charger off the battery the light stayed on and began to discharge my battery again. If by ""fully automatic"" they mean it will automatically fully discharge your battery, then they are accurate. Very disappointed.",1.0

This is a common theme throughout the reviews for this product. Schumacher quality control must be extremely poor. The instructions alluded to the distinct possibility that this unit might be DOA. I will never buy a product from this company again. It seems like sending junk out the door is A-OK with them.

"We had an expensive Volvo Penta stainless steel prop and bought this McGard propeller lock set to secure our investment. We went out to the middle of the lake to swim. When it was time to head back and trailer our boat, it wouldn't move. We couldn't go forward or in reverse. WE HAD NO PROP! It had fallen off in the lake and was lost. Not only did we lose a very expensive stainless steel prop, we were also stranded in the middle of the lake and had to call the marina and pay to be rescued. I am NOT HAPPY! The prop lock set was installed correctly, exactly as instructed. McGard needs to redesign their propeller lock and make a product that isn't going to fall off and cause unnecessary expense. Perhaps they should incorporate a cotter pin into the design for additional security. I see that other people have had props fall off, also, while using the McGard 74039 Marine Propeller Lock Set.

He asked me if I used never seize on the threads. I said no. I did use the special grease that the mercrusier manual said to put onto the threads on the shaft. He said you can't put grease on the threads thats what made the lock fail and the prop spin off. Not so sure I accept this answer, especially when the manual calls for greasing the shaft.

"Let me first be clear that the Everglass filler itself it top notch and works beautifully. I've relied on this product many times in the past and will continue to use it in the future.

The single star rating is simply due to Amazon's lack of proper handling of this material, as evidenced by the damaged cans they continue to ship even though several others have already complained about them, and the lack of hardener being included with these when they ship (they come in the case these cans were originally packaged in). My guess is that they crushed the lot and are still trying to sell them to poor unsuspecting customers. These are damaged goods. Shame on you Amazon.

If you need this particular item, my suggestion would be to buy it locally instead of through Amazon since they don't seem to know how to deliver this quality material in a quality way.

UPDATE: I returned the dented can that was missing the hardener back to Amazon and indicated both of these as the reason why I was returning this filler. I took a chance and exchanged the item instead of just refunding it as I would have liked to use this filler. While Amazon was quick to ship me out another can - it too is dented and missing the hardener. So, returning to Amazon and purchasing locally after all. Shame.",1.0

I went through the routine as described on the bottle, at least 20 times over a period of two days, on my first sample.  These were nothing more than scuff scratches. After what must have been a total of one hour of work of buffing (with an old flannel shirt) on this same piece of plastic, I will say that there was about a 25% improvement, at the most.  The scratches are still there and quite visible.

Now, each of these eyeglass inserts goes for about $5 on Amazon.  Sooooooo, you do the math.  Was I wise to spend an hour of work on a five dollar item?  If I hired someone to do it for me, I would be prosecuted for paying below the minimum wage.

In retrospect, I have deteremined that there is indeed one scratch that this product will most definitely remove.  And dat be the scratch in yo wallet, bro.

Brought this hoping for a quick and cheap solution to fogging headlamp problem.  Applied per instructions and it just cleaned the lenses but did not remove most of the fog.  It is similar to the old turtle wax with a little bit of abrasives in the solution - cleans but not abrasive enough to take out the haze.  A waste of money.

Bonding is the same. Dries very solid but remains flexible. I'm using it to restore a 12 foot aluminum boat. Side note... I fixed my boots that have Vibram soles with the 24 hr 5200 and I can NOT believe how well it worked. A few weeks later the sole tore more but the glue did not.
Best hard core glue out there in my opinion,  just wish they made it in black.",1.0

"Im a car fanatic and for decades I have been using microfiber towels to dry my car after wash. When I saw the advertisement for this product and read some of the positive reviews I decided to order and use it to dry my car. BIG DESAPOINTMENT! The concept of this product is clever but it doesnt perform well compared to a microfiber towel. First of all you barely move it a few inches and it adsorbs the water and it becomes very heavy and tough. I also noticed it leaves a trail of water behind. As a result you need to keep coming back to the same area to ensure its totaly dry. Second of all it cant be used to dry those hard to reach spots on cars like around the headlights, tail lights, door hinges, etc. therefore, when I was done drying my car (which took twice the time compared to when I use a microfiber) I still had to use my regular microfiber towel to ensure these tigh spots were dry. Bottom line: This towel made the process of drying my car longer, tougher, and not as efficient. I will stick with the microfiber towel to dry my vehicle and since I cant return this product I will use it to dry liquid spills around my house.",1.0

Knowing the Meguiar name, and having been satisfied in the past with other produts, I bought this product with the expectation of it helping restore the finish, at least a little, as I'm not much for expectations. It didn't. After all three steps, the blotching between the fading sections and good sections was more pronounced, and other problem areas were not helped at all. I had better results before with a cheap liquid cleaner/wax, and about the same with some polishing compound. The product is not worth the price or effort. Skeet Pick in San Marcos, CA.",1.0

"I opened the box today, after 6 weeks, because I just got a 12v socket wired into my RV converter. Guess what I found? You guessed it. A used, damaged fan. Oh, it still works, but it's been deeply gouged and sliced on one side. Should they have notified me that I was paying top dollar for a previously used and damaged product?  One would think so, otherwise it's fraud, isn't it?

I also received a headlamp from another dishonest Amazon retailer that was dirty and stretched out, having obviously been used before.  It's also very poorly seamed on the same side. There are bumps, melted plastic as if a glue gun hit it by mistake. The edges are rough and very poorly finished. It feels rough and looks dirty in a section as if they couldn't successfully remove over applied glue.

For this amount of money, I expect quality. If I wanted a product manufactured this poorly, I could have spent a lot less money.  It's time to shop the competition when product quality declines while prices increase.i

I can't return it, but I will certainly report this retailer's subterfuge to sell used/damage/poorly made products at full price, -without- notifying the consumer that they are buying a previously used product.  This is theft, plain and simple.  The picture doesn't adequately illustrate the damage and how poorly made this fan truly is.  My lesson? Open the box immediately and the reviews are only as good as the source.  Don't believe the hype.",1.0
Weird texture. Doesn't work for cleaning or buffing purposes. Feels like a rubber rag. Not soft at all.,1.0

I used it to fill four screw holes where I had removed a depth finder transponder. 3 days later I wiped the excess off the outside of the holes and cleaned out the holes.

We set it on the table of the camper on high and you could feel it through the entire camper (18ft A frame pop up). The shaking also made a bit of noise.  Wife said there is no way we could put up with the shaking and for how much it cost the value was not there with the defect so we returned it. Since there are few other options for 12v fans we are just going to buy a small inverter and run a normal fan off it instead. Included is cose up video, the camera could not catch the speed of the bouncing but it help shows the length of the bounce and noise.  The noise is not as bad as the video shows but the bouncing is worse then it looks just imagine the bouncing 3 to 4 times faster then shown.

I called and there was a two week wait for an appointment.  They wanted me to drop the fan off to them because they need to get authorization and process the warrantee work  Once I arrived for the appointment they informed me that it would take 3 to 4 weeks for them  and the Dometic Fan-Tastic Fan  Company would be doing and inform me on what they decided to do with my bad fan issue.",1.0
"I received my Fan-Tastic fan and unboxed it, hooked it up to my Anti-Gravity XP-10 Micro Start 12v battery and tested it out.

The fan turned on and spun up, but it has the following issues;

- The airflow direction is completely WRONG and the fan expels air out of the rear of the fan instead of the front of the fan!

- The fan wobbles and vibrates badly on any speed setting and tends to walk across the floor!

- The fan is also missing FOUR screws on one entire side of the fan! The case is literally coming apart out of the box!

Special Note: The fan comes poorly packaged / protected in the cardboard box it comes in! There was no styrofoam of any sort of protection inside the retail package! The fan just kinda bounces around and gets damaged in transit / shipment. Horrible!

Didn't work for me.  I ended up junking the product and taking my project to a professional who used a different 3M product.  Product did not stick well like I expected and saw on the internet.  Not sure why. Was very messy to work with. I could only get it off my hands with alcohol.,1.0

Ordered 2 of these fans. One was clearly an open box return that had been resold without being repaired. Fan blade was rubbing against the vent grill. Tore apart the fan and added washers under the motor mounts until enough space existed between the fan blade and the fan box grill. Second fan was missing all eight screws that hold the fan grills to both sides of the frame. Trip to hardware store to purchase appropriate sized self tapping screws. I repaired these new fans because it was easy to to and I did not want to mess with returning them. Clearly this company has no quality control. Both of these defects were obvious. FanTastic ought to be ashamed of itself to tolerating this level of incompetence. If there were any other good alternatives I'd steer anyone to another manufacturer but there are no good alternatives to this fan so we're stuck with a manufacturer that should really not be in business. Expect to have to repair your new fan before use. I ordered one of these a year ago and out of the box one of the speed control resistors was only soldered on one end so it was a 2 speed until I repaired the circuit. At least FanTastic is consistent. All three required repair out of the box.,1.0

Marine it may be but not when it is exposed to the elements on an open center console boat. I re powered a small creek boat on the South Carolina Coast and wanted to be able to track the actual hours of use on the new motor. It lasted approx 60 days and had 11.4 hours on it when the unit died. I have replaced it with a Honeywell from www. Grainger.com. The Honeywell unit cost around $100 but is suppose to be good in damp conditions. It is exactly the same size as the Sierra. The Sierra is probably good in covered and dry marine conditions but not in the open.,1.0

"Unfortunately, I had to rate this with something.. and there are no negative numbers. I was dumfounded that this product demonstrated 100% failure to do anything it is advertised to do..even for the simplest of use. It failed as an adhesive... and where it would NOT bond it failed to seal. I swim 2.5 - 3 miles everyday and am in the water for anywhere from 80 to 110 minutes non-stop. I customize the swimming goggles I use because I can't find goggles that won't put ring marks on my boney eye sockets and over that kind of time they begin to really hurt. I glue custom cut pieces of an old wet suit to the soft material around the goggle lenses. I read many reviews of this product and bought it because I thought I had found a winner and I'd finally found something that would last... but that was not the case. Within one week the bond failed completely. Now maybe the glue isn't made to withstand chlorine, I don't know.. it wasn't indicated and if it is a marine sealant who's to say someone wouldn't be using it around a pool? It only makes sense it could be. And I might be wrong but it seems the silicone pads on the goggles and rubber wetsuit material would bond (that is to say ""melt"" together) but what I got was a nice clean surface on both the pieces when they came apart. I put the glue on both surfaces and waited over an hour for it to get sticky (otherwise it was like water), so maybe it doesn't bond to itself. Seems every glue I've ever used recommends doing this. I weighted the bond down overnight and because of the ""dry"" time, did not get them wet for over a week. I can't imagine using this useless stuff on a boat, or any type of motor, or condition where vibration would be constant. And the kind of set up time required the boat would likely sink if I'm trying to seal water out. I'm glad other people got some satisfaction from it, I sure didn't for that piddly little use...and I'd be willing to bet down the road they will all be doing it again. It took well over a week for the glue to become non-sticky. All in all.. I would not recommend anyone buying this stuff for anything unless you just like the smell of it. Sorry 3m but... best go back to the drawing board.. or put some information together about how, where, what.. maybe ""your"" definition of marine...directions for application and something on the literature other than the fear based stuff about getting it in the eyes or swallowing it. I normally would not say anything and just throw the stuff away but it was such utter failure...maybe I can save someone the trouble and time I went through.",1.0
"I needed the small end of the applicator to slip between rubber moulding and trim. I screwed the applicator on but it was stripped when I tried to snug it up.

I also noticed the sticker on the front of all of them was not even close to being center.  Seems like a little thing to complain about, but working in consumer electronic is they don't care about getting there stick right, then I can only image what they care about the rest of the product.  Seems another deal were a family starts a business with good morals, then they get bought by a large company and quality suffers because now they nickel and dime every penny.  One final thing,  Amazon needs to learn how to pack its shipments however.  yes this is opinionated, but to often I'm finding issues with products these days

After owning for 6 months, i can say this fan is way over priced.  I have 2 of them.  the legs are falling off, it vibrates and falls off wherever you place it.  how these are getting 4.5 stars is beyond me.  I wish they would not put made in america on it, it give OUR products a bad image.",1.0
"I was really looking forward to getting this fan based on the reviews I read.  I am going on vacation in 2 days and want to take this along for some tent camping on the way to and back from Disney World in Florida.  I anticipated the feet not being to great since it was mentioned in the review but found two other problems right out of the box.  The 12 volt DC plug in has a problem with the spring on the tip, it just loosely moves in and drops out when you face it down.  I have seen this sort of thing before and should be able to fix it.  The other is the fan switch.  It has a springy feel to it and doesn't correspond to the numbers on the dial.  When you flip it to the next speed, it springs back a bit.  It doesn't effect the speed and all the speeds seem to work fine.  I think I just expected the workmanship to be better, certainly not befitting a sixty five dollar item.  Will update review when I get back from Disney on the 19th of June.",1.0
Not what I expected. My repair had to come on part of the boat that required to apply adhesive upside down. Got on everything but what I had to repair.

If there were negative stars that's what I would rate this fan. I order this fan after reading good reviews and watching videos of it. When I finally received the fan I tried it out using the 12 volt outlet in my car. It blew good air. The problem. It spins the wrong way.  The fan spins counter clockwise and blows the air out the back of the fan. So I returned it and got another one. The second one does the same thing. No wonder they are so cheap on Amazon.

"Be aware that these fans have an audible whine even at the lowest speed. in outdoor conditions it may not be an issue but in less noisy surrounding this whine is very audible. The sound of a gentle breeze or moving-air is not disturbing to the ear, in fact most find it almost relaxing, but the whining motor does the exact opposite.

Also noticeable is a slight vibration in the frame. I'm being picky on this point but this is another aspect of poor quality. I'm not sure if I should give this two stars or one star...but honestly being $70, it's embarrassing that this comes the Made in USA label.",1.0

The fan is definitely powerful enough to ensure a substantial temperature change in the rear of the vehicle - while still plenty quiet.  However, after using for only short periods of time at sporadic intervals, I pulled it off the shelf in the garage expecting it to perform at pushing heat to the rear of the truck - but it failed to function as of the 26th of November, 2014.

"This fan COULD be great, but somebody at the factory really screwed up and molded the blades exactly backwards from the way they should be facing!  Recently I had to disassemble this fan to install it as the blower in an evaporative cooler project (a ""Unicooler"") that I was making for a certain desert festival when I noticed that the airfoil shapes of the blades were 180 degrees flipped!  If you look at any plastic fan you'll notice that the blades are shaped like an airplane's wing-- i.e., they have a fat leading edge and a thinner trailing edge and the underside surface will be flat or slightly cupped.  This shape takes advantage of several aerodynamic principles to increase the efficiency of any fan.  But the way the blades in this Endless Breeze fan are molded is bass-ackwards!  They have the fat edge as the trailing edge, the thin edge as the leading edge and the underside of the airfoil was curved outwards while the top of the airfoil was flat!
The way the hole for the shaft screw is molded you can't simply flip it over-- I had to dremel the opening so it could go on the shaft the correct way.  Doing this almost DOUBLED the output of this fan!!!  So they really screwed up at the factory.  If you get one of these reversed fans you should call the factory and see if they can ship you a corrected blade assembly. It's worth it because it really is a great fan once the blades are turned around.",1.0
"It took just shy of $76 to get this to my door.

First one was dead on arrival and was returned.  Thanks Amazon for making this painless as usual.

I got the second from a local RV store and also ended up returning it.  Here is my assessment:

Pros:
1. There are little brackets to mount it on a cage.
2. Switch is satisfyingly chunky and feels good to operate.
3. They used a decent quality cord and 12v plug, although it could have been longer.

Cons:
1. The feet are very fragile.  One was at a strange angle relative to the other which made the whole fan wobble around.
2. If you move the fan while in operation, centrifugal force distorts the fan and causes it to hit the case.
3. Motor makes a fair bit of noise.
4. Doesnt move a huge amount of air.
5. They go to the trouble of quoting current consumed on the various settings but the figures on the fan I measured were about 45% higher, when measured at 12.7v, more so at 13.8V.  They must have made their measurements somewhere in the 11v range.  I found this a little under hand.
6. It seems very heavy for what it is but has still feels poorly built.  This is quite an impressive achievement.

In summary: if this were a $25 fan (ignoring the first dead on arrival), it would get 5 stars.  But because of the price and the things above it barely scores 1 point.

They make much hype about Made in America.  I often complain about crap from China but at least the Chinese stuff is cheap.

My search for a decent 12v fan continues.",1.0
Makes you have to dry the truck with a regular towel anyways.  Doubles the work and stinks after a few uses.,1.0
"I was sent a previously used item.  It arrived in a box that was worn and crushed. I believe it had been opened, used and then returned.  Inspection of the fan indicated that it had been used.  The limited paper work was also worn.  While the fan works fine, I fell cheated.  If this company is going ship out returned merchandise, they should indicate that they are doing so.  I will never purchase from them again.",1.0

"As a microfiber towel substitute, I thought this absorber towel would completely suck up every bit of water after rinsing the car, but it didnt. Even being mostly dry and wringing out as much water as I could from the towerl, it still left streaks of water which I had to finish drying off with a microfiber towel.

Also, I followed instructions and left it a bit damp inside the plastic bottle then it grew mold all over the towel after not using it for 3 weeks. Ended up throwing it away. I was only been able to use it twice.",1.0

Ok I have these lights on my brand new Karavan boat trailer. They are truly just junk. Who in todays world would place a non water proof light on a boat trailer. You have to unplug them before backing into the water. If you don't expect to replace the blubs if you can. The opening is so tiny I cannot get my fingers in there to change them. I let my neighbor back the trailer into the lake and he kept his foot on the brake pedal and boom both lights blew. So I am now having to replace these lights (less than a month old). Save yourself the headache and spend a little more for some quality lighting.,1.0

"I trailer in saltwater and freshwater and don't disconnect (the lights are handy at night), so these really don't work for me.  Both times the main bulb failed with a green spot over the lens.  Submersible is a curious term for something that fails when wet.

"After one year I just had to replace both my wesbar trailer lights. It was a delight! I had to use a sledge hammer, a chisel and a sawsall to cut the bolts as they were thoroughtly rusted. The lights inside were still sealed and a blob of rust. After removing the reflector I could not get the light out of the rust blob it was in. Both tail lights were the same. Definitely not submersible.

Test the screws with a magnet. If they are attracted to the magnet they will turn into a blob of rust in little time. You will need a sledge hammer, chisel and sawsall because the bolts used do not have a nut inside the sealed enclosure the bolt end looks like a rivet and you cannot hold it to prevent it from turning as you turn the nut on the other end.

I replaced them with dry launch more expensive but I have had very good service from the on my big boat trailer.",1.0

I was really surprised at the poor quality of this Master Lock product.  It is next to impossible to get this thing locked with only two hands.  It just doesn't want to snap together.

"Worst thing I've ever bought.  I purchased the 1st one in January.

Then, it got to where you had to really work the lock to get the C clip to let go of the shaft, so that you could remove the lock. This went on for 3-4 times.  Then, yesterday, I was going fishing and I could not get the key into the keyway no matter what I tried.  After about 15 minutes, I had to get a bolt cutter and cut the lock, which I might add, was quite easy to do.  I bought a new boat in January and I've taken the lock off/on maybe 12 times.",1.0

Starter arrived quickly after order.  I hired a mechanic to install it.  I was excited and hoped that it would last as long as the 16 year old starter that it was replacing.

"My wife bought this for me for Christmas. Once the weather finally cleared, I installed it in the bed of my Ford F-150 a few weeks ago. Last week my neighbor asked if I could help him pick up a table and chairs. When we were ready to start loading the table I attempted to remove the bar from the truck bed but the release lever would not budge. There are two spring-loaded release levers on this bar and neither one would move an inch. This is not the first cargo bar I've owned and I'm fully aware of how to use them. This was simply stuck. I attempted to use a screwdriver for leverage to release the mechanism but it was completely frozen. With a table and chairs that needed to be loaded and a malfunctioning cargo bar blocking the way, I had no other choice than to PULL the cargo bar out of the bed. The already-not-working bar had to be bent in order to be removed.  Although the item was purchased as a Christmas present this was the first and only time I tried to use this cargo bar and it is beyond the time Amazon allows for a routine return/exchange. I would really appreciate a replacement or a refund.",1.0

Well, needless to say, I can no longer get it to ratchet without great effort.

Purchase experience was fine.  I don't like the rarcheting bar because it is can only be used by reaching in when tailgfate down.  If you want it further into bed you must get in bed.  This is my problem however as I don't get around that well anymore.,1.0

Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED.",1.0

This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.,1.0
"I was buying for my jeep cherokee for when I lower the back seat for storage.
When I went to tighten then ratchet down to lock, the bar would buckle a bit and jump a detent on the ratchet bar.

I will try the twist type system next.

"I purchased this item based on a recommendation on my RV forum to use in my motorhome, so I could watch the coach behind me when I was driving, since I don't have a rear view mirror inside the coach. I couldn't put it on the windshield because I have an electric sunshade that it would interfere with, so I tried to put it on top of my dash, but it wouldn't stick. I then purchased an adhesive disk, also from Amazon, that is supposed to work with suction cup mounts exactly like this. I tried the two together, because I didn't want to stick the adhesive to the dash until I was sure it would work. No matter how I pushed the cup onto the disk, it wouldn't hold, so now I'm stuck with both a useless mirror and a useless disk.",1.0
"Not worth the time it takes to order, don't know how it would ever stay on a boat windshield, I got it for the truck and no matter how much I clean glass and cup keeps falling off.",1.0
You get what you pay for this mirror broke first day.,1.0
Keeps falling off every few minutes.  Find something better.,1.0
plastic suction cup doesn't work because it has been crammed into a tiny package and is now forever creased,1.0
This does not stay and comes off when you're driving. It would help if you use a different mount. But why would you do that to double or triple the original cost?,1.0
"Doesn't stick to car window, had to buy separate suction cup as another reviewer suggested I went with the Garmin suction cup",1.0
Never could get it to work so its still sitting on a shelf in the garage,1.0
I bought this because of reviews that it never falls. I use it in my back truck window to see my daughter. I have to stick it up every day and it falls within hours.,1.0
"The mirror itself is good,  however,  the suction cup will not hold for more than a minute or so.  I have tried on both the glass windshield and a flat fiberglass surface.",1.0
It seems quality other than the terrible suction cup.  Total garbage.  There is no chance it will not fall down.  Will try another reviewers advice about rigging this with yet another purchase of a gps mount.  SUCTION CUP DOES NOT SUC.,1.0
Fell off many times and because of placement knocked our boats lights on and kill date battery.,1.0
"Suction cup doesn't stick to my rear window. Or any window, in fact. Useless.",1.0
"I hate this mirror, the suction cup gave out 6 times before I threw it in the bushes",1.0
Crap...! it does not stay on the window. Fall of again and again. The worst thing is it fall of to my wife's head. If you wanna buy consider to use with silicon which adds extra cost for the price of this item. Or the seller should include silicon.,1.0
The image in the mirror is so minute it is impossible to truly see what is going on past the seat immediately behind you.,1.0
broke,1.0
Terrible. The suction cup did not work at all. Would not suggest buying.,1.0
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOR A CAR, to use as a baby mirror. The suction cup is NOT reliable at all, and even when following the directions exactly, in very high heat the mirror (which is scorching hot) will fall off, and in our case narrowly missed hitting our infant, which could have caused an injury and probably a burn. I'm sure it works fine in boats, but it definitely does not stay suctioned to a car windshield!",1.0
Fell off the window after a few minutes. Bad suction.,1.0
Falls off every 4-6 hrs - last time that I went to reinstall the flimsy mirror cracked.  Now I am 2 days past the 30 day return policy! - The suction cups looks decent - glass and cup were wiped down correctly - still never stayed on.,1.0
This si too huge in size and will not hold on a glass if used the suction cup.,1.0
It doesn't stick....falls off the window frequently.  Junk and cheap,1.0
Broke at the first time I used it - buy something better,1.0
I cannot see thru this thing. The image is very distorted and hurts my eyes. I cannot even remotely tell spacing and distance thru this mirror. I tried using it for a car.,1.0
I bought for my jeep so I could see my son in my car. This never stayed up even on short trips. I can't imagine it would work any better on a boat.,1.0
Falls off every time,1.0
Purchased to use in vehicle to be able to see dog in rear section...however mirror is much to large to mount in the jeep! It's probably great in a boat.,1.0
Really didn't stick to the windshield for longer than a few minutes. Surprisingly heavy and larger than I expected. Recommend a redesigned suction cup.,1.0
Does not stick well to glass,1.0
junk,1.0
Mirror is unable to stay attached to the windshield.  Suction cup is too rigid and returns to a almost flat surface in a matter of seconds.  If it would stay attached I would have given it four stars.  Only four because the bellows also doesn't stay in place.,1.0
"Tried mounting it on the windshield, fiberglass dash, and plexiglas instrument sun shade. This thing is not sticking to anything... Very unhappy with the purchase.",1.0
This is a piece of junk...tried attaching to jet ski and with very little effort it broke in my hands.  Did not even get to use it once,1.0
The thing doesn't  stay up no suction  put it on my ranger and falls off the next time I go to use it,1.0
"Doesn't stick well, not very adjustable. Go with a fixed mount to the windshield frame and not a suction cup mount.",1.0
"The product broke between the mirror and suction cup. They were good about sending a replacement immediately however that one broke also. The other 4 I still have seems to be in one piece so far but am scared to twist it to move it, as afraid it might break.
The mirror image is good but super glue didn't work to hold it together.",1.0
"I put it up on the window, tried to turn it, and it snapped.  Ie, the metal holding it all together is weaker than the suction.  The worst.",1.0
"this is junk; i bought two and both immediately broke where the adjustment is between base and mirror. I am not even bothering to send them back, as it is a waste of my time, and ups' time.",1.0
"This thing is so cheaply made and badly designed that it broke in half the first time I made a SLIGHT adjustment.
How such items make it through the Amazon purchasing process I have no idea. The stem that connects the actual mirror and the suction cup is so weak and brittle that ANY movement will cause it to snap. I wish it were possible to rate this thing minus 10 stars.",1.0
"I may have got a ""lemon"", but the first time I tried to adjust mirror (as I took it out of box) the swivel broke!  I found a way to use it attaching it to another product with superglue, but I would not recommend this to anyone.",1.0
"First time using it, stuck it in the window and attempted to adjust it, and it snapped in half. Swing and a miss..will be returning.",1.0
"I ordered two of these; one for a  friend and one for myself. We each have a golf cart and planned to use them on the windshields. The suction cup is not strong enough to hold them. It took some Rube Goldberg planning and strong glue to make mine at all usable. Also, it is not easily adjustable. My friend has become discouraged after seeing the difficulties I experienced.",1.0
"One star seemed over-generous, but it's the lowest going. I installed the mirror according to instructions and it broke at a touch when I tried to adjust it.

Too much is required for reviews, which is why I don't do more.",1.0
"As shipped the screws on the bearing are too tight.  I tried to swivel the mirror and it snapped quickly and easily, not even that much pressure.",1.0
"know matter what I did, it would not stick. I cleaned and cleaned and it would last about 2 minutes.
gave up on it.",1.0
When installing this mirror to the rear glass of my car to use as a baby mirror it snapped off of the stem that connects it to the suction cup.,1.0
"This item is not made for pontoon, but tried and was very disappointed with it the suction cup would not work any where you put it, it would fall right off. I would not recommend it to any one.",1.0
"This product was great out of the box...as soon as we stuck it to the window, it cracked in half!",1.0
"The mirror is great. The suction cup works great too. But there is a piece that holds the mirror and suction that breaks so easily. Not even a real metal. Shank that connects the adjustment ball to the back of the mirror is pot metal. I agree with the other person (Mark Schoeppel) that gave this mirror 1 star. I tried to adjust it and align it. Yup! it snapped right off in half. TRUE! I regret buying this piece of ****! Don't buy. If you do, just be careful adjusting. Its neck will break.",1.0
"The product seemed like a great idea, that is until it fell off only a few hours after I installeed it! I tried a few additional times however with all the same results! Now that I have the product, I am considering glueing onto the windshield, even though that defeats the purpose of the suction cup. Oh well!",1.0
Broke during installation. The mounting bracket is cast metal that is very weak. This mirror broke while I was pressing the down to attach the suction cup. Exceptionally disappointing that this terrible product is offered by Amazon.,1.0
"This mirror is just not sturdy and breaks easily. I returned this and bought the Overton brand. On the other hand, Amazon return center is very very good. They were so courteous and professional and very prompt in dealing with their customers. I give amazon 5 stars for customer service but this product is not that good.",1.0
The shank that connects the adjustment ball to the back of the mirror is pot metal.  I put a slight amount of pressure on the mirror to align it and it just snapped in half.  Now worthless.,1.0
"Thought this would be perfect for the boat when I saw it this winter.  Ordered and received with no issues.  Finally took it out of the package to put on the boat this weekend and it immediately broke.  The mounting is obviously just not durable.  The tension in the ball joint that has to be overcome to adjust the angle imparts enough force on the rod to break it.

Since I waited to try it, I missed my window to return it.",1.0
"Yesterday I unpackaged and mounted it.  Today it broke when I tried to adjust it the first time.  Not sure it's worth the shipping charge to Michigan to get warranty coverage.  So CIPA wins, I guess.",1.0
Would give this no stars... The mirror adjustor was snapped out of package... Completely broken and unusable ? Would not recommend buying this product!,1.0
"Took mirror out of perfect condition package
With minimal pressure applied to adjust mirror the metal pivot ball assy snapped

I am going back to the glowing review I wrote for the M17 and change it.",1.0

"Most oil finishes cure after a day or so--you can see that process at work when you pick up a used rag from a previous day.  This

It is also an all-in-one product, meaning it doesn't clean as well as a standalone cleaner or oil as well as a standalone oil.

I love Meguiar's and use their car care products almost exclusively on my cars, but this is one product I cannot recommend from them.",1.0
"This looked like a great deal at the price.  Turns out you get what you pay for.  I only have one piece of teak on my expensive boat so you can bet I'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep it looking nice.  I should have spent more money on a better teak oil.  After thorough cleaning and about ten applications of this oil per the provided directions, each about a day apart, I finally gave up!  I might as well have been using mineral spirits for all the protection and final appearance I ended up with.  I've been boating for over 50 years and this is by far the worst teak oil I have ever had the misfortune to try!  Don't waste your money - I rarely make the effort to review a product but I""m so ticked about the incredibly poor performance of this product that I just couldn't let it slide.",1.0
"I was very disappointed at the quality of this oil.  It comes in a smaller bottle than what you purchase at the local hardware store, so although it is priced less, it is not such a good deal.  The oil is thinner than anything I have seen before, so it goes on easy, but it does not last on the the furniture, and therefore, does not protect it from the elements, not even short term.  I needed to reapply it each week!  I finally gave in, bought the more expensive, local hardware store Teak Oil, and am happy with the once-a-month touch-up maintenance that it requires.  Don't waste your money thinking you will save on this Teak Oil.  It is not good quality and will cost you more time and work in the long run.",1.0
Purchased on Amazon recently.  This pump took over five minutes to put 2 pounds more pressure in a tire on my car.  And the pump got almost too hot to hold.  Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.,1.0

"Got this pump for Christmas.  Terrible.  Barely tops off ONE car tire and needs to be recharged before you can do a 2nd tire.  And no way to plug it into car's 12V power source, so you can't actually top off two tires on the same trip.  HA!  Would not buy again!",1.0

Used the product twice  The product just randomly turns off before reaching desired pressure  Sometimes doesn't turn on at all.  Horrible product!!  Wish I could return it but vendor won't take it back after 30 days.  Unfortunately I was only able to find the product's flaws after that time.,1.0

"I ordered this because it was advertised as being from Champion and because the photo shows that the handles were rubber grips. I have no idea who the actual maker of this product is because I received it in a no-name white box and there was no manufacturer's mark on the product. The handles were covered with cheap foam. I returned it, of course. What a waste of time.",1.0
I was sent a product that had cylindrical foam grips - not at all as pictured.  There was also no indication this was made by Champion (usually has a Champion logo).  I felt very slighted by the whole experience and will not work with this supplier again.,1.0
This is badly made and comes with no instructions. I wish I'd paid the extra money for a better quality one.,1.0
"A lot of people probably have thier doubts about the effectiveness of a product of this nature. My comments won't offer any advice on that issue. I have used similar products with good results. My issue with this product is that the manufacturer seemed to rush this ""Ab Wheel"" onto a profitable fitness market without any checks and balances. The materials are about as cheap as they come and there is no stabilzation with the wheels, which (because there are two and too much space allowed) wobble back and forth. The result is that not only did the company (EA) decide to save the 20 cents or less required to at least employ stoppers to resrict the sideways wheel movement, but they apparently want you as the consumer to focus more on this design mishap then the solid, fluid motion that would be needed to achieve any results. I would not recommend this product and would suggest to anyone considering this product that they search out another manufacturer or make on themselves (PVC pipe, two lounge wheels, two bike handle bars and yes two rubber stoppers would be the equivalent).",1.0

I replaced this battery with a Yuasa (along with another rectifier) and no more problems.",1.0
"I ordered two of these for our wave-runners, and they came from different suppliers. I paid $125 a piece for batteries so they more than one season.  Walmart has a battery for $55, but they only last one year. Well, they were both on maintainers, and only one would turn over this year.",1.0
This battery won't hold a charge after one season.  Left it in my wave runner over the winter and it will not hold a charge this spring.  Waste of money.,1.0
Completely not the battery I thought I was ordering. My fault but I can't return it so I am just out $113.00.  Which is also way more than walmart would have been for this battery.,1.0
"this piece of CRAP lasted 1 year...cost me  twice what a Walmart battery costs and didn't last any longer. I would give it zero stars if they had that option...I see a lot of good reviews here but I hate it and will never buy another one...I will be telling everyone at my lake  that the odyssey batteries are junk and not worth the money

I posted this back in June....now it is September...I just came back to see if they actually printed my review...AND THEY DID!!  My position has not changed, these batteries are NOT worth the $114.00 I paid.. I will buy wal-mart batteries each year for around $50.bucks and have a better deal.. As far as I'm concerned this Odyssey battery is a total RIP OFF...  (Signed, feeling like a sucker for falling for the hype.)",1.0
Battery was dead after 1 year. I have 2 years warranty but no way to get the battery exchanged since Odyssey needs confirmation from a distributor that battery is defect. Battery Plus won't help me since I purchased the Battery here at Amazon.com. The next battery shop is about 50 miles away and I don't get any info over the phone if they exchange it for me or not and they told me to get in touch with Odyssey. Really bad. The battery is not as good as they say.,1.0

"i have had this for two years now.  I  have used it maybe 10 times, many months between uses.  the valve is created by the hand pump, and the vacuum is held by a rubber plug that has a rubber disk.  the disk lets the air flow in one direction and then blocks it the other way.  well the fumes from the oil attacked both the rubber of both the plug and the disk.  now the plug is too loose to be effective and the rubber disk does not hold the air.  When it was new, it was great.  and if they used materials that did not react to oil, it would be 5 stars.  however, using rubber that gets attacked by oil in a device that is used for oil, is poor planning.",1.0
"The spherical tank collapsed inward under vacuum once the warm oil reached the ""equator"" (half full).  It was rigid enough that I couldn't get it to pop back out.  I couldn't see anything irregular or defective about the tank.  I doubt if it would work very well unless the oil was warm yet I blame softening of the plastic for the failure. It would be my advise to take it slow and easy and not pump it too much.  Of course, best would be to design it to handle a full vacuum at say 150 degrees F.  I've returned the item.  Too bad, it's a great concept.",1.0
Wouldn't hold a vacuum---had to re-pump every few minutes.  It ended up taking 4 hours to extract 4 quarts of oil.  Quite a workout.,1.0
"Leaks air, no help from the vendor. Not happy with this product or there customer service.",1.0
"I was so hoping to make my oil change easier, but I came to find out the unit is defective during my first try.  The unit leaks vacuum, and will stop suction after a few seconds.  Leak was coming from the top rubber flange where I can hear a air leak sound.  Made my oil change difficult with countless pumps to extract 5L.  And now I have pay to ship it back.  Manufacturer really needs to have better qc check.",1.0
Didn't work. Wouldn't extract the oil.,1.0
Would not buy again for oil change for car.  Did not remove all of the old oil after a lot of effort.  Will use for 1 quart change for lawnmower.  About all its good for.,1.0
"I used this product 2 times and when I went to use it a 3rd it failed to work. After carefully inspection I noticed that the seal below the hand pump on reservoir top was ripped. After searching online I found many people have the same exact issue and THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE! DO NOT BUY THIS, SEAL WILL TEAR AND THEN YOU HAVE A NON FUNCTIONAL OIL EXTRACTOR. I emailed customer service but did not receive a response.... Guess they have better things to do then support their products which fail",1.0
"I've tried to pump hundred times but it doesn't works, so try with a bucket of water but still doesn't works.",1.0
"I ordered this product thinking it was gonna get the job done just like it says it does. I followed the instructions just like it said and let the engine warm up for 15 mins and i pumped the 10-20 times and sucked only half a quart of oil out.  I had to continually pump the entire time this mad the pump hot and kept losing suction.  This simple oil change took 60 mins to complete. The following day i called the manufacturer and the said to warm up the engine for 30 mins next time and there instructions say 5 min.
What a bunch of crap",1.0
"After 15 minutes,  repeated pumping,  extracted about 12 ounces of oil from my diesel Passat.  So little I don't need to top off before driving it again.  I'll buy a different extractor, or crawl under and drain the oil the way I've been doing it for 35 years.",1.0
Item failed to keep suction.  I double checked the directions and checked each piece to make sure it was attached tightly.  Returning it.,1.0
"Bought in August 2014 and broken in July 2015. I was so excited to get this product after so many high rated reviews. From the beginning the problem with the product was that it never retained the vacuum pull no longer then 30 seconds. You always ended up pumping every minute or two just to keep the draining going. Read directions, followed the steps and basically today when it took nearly two half hours to change the oil I gave up. The seal - o ring around the base of the container and the pump itself are pretty flimsy and are unable to create a proper vacuum seal for the chamber to drain the oil constantly. Going to buy a Fumoto F-106N Engine Oil Drain Valve. Advice is to avoid this product.",1.0
"Worked great for about 3 oil changes. Now, the pump no longer makes pressure and is useless.",1.0
It worked twice and then it completely broke! Waste of money!,1.0
Vacuum pump does not fully seal and leaks air so it takes a lot of effort to extract. Should work well if there's no air leak. Not sure if Amazon would take it back or exchange since oil has ran through the tubes.,1.0
Weak design that failed to work out of the box.  Save your money.,1.0
"Tried using this to pump oil out of my car through dip stick hole.  Would not keep suction for more than 5 seconds.  After trying an hour, gave up!",1.0
Doesn't work at all. If I used this to complete my oil change I'd still be waiting 3 months later. In this things defense I have a diesel that holds 3 gallons but I had to vacuum the thing for an hour for MAYBE a quart of oil. It was warmed up too.,1.0
I started and ran the motor for about 15 minutes to warm the oil up . Then i tried to suction the oil out with very little success . It was about 40 degrees outside don't know if this was a factor . I even ran the motor another 10 minutes and still no luck . I will tried again in warmer weather for as this was when I was winterizing my boat and the temperature was only going to get colder . Hopefully it will work better when outside temps are warmer ..,1.0
Completely useless.  The vacuum generated by pumping like mad is not sufficiently powerful enough to actually get the oil up.  You will spend all afternoon with it.  Much easier to get the car up (safely) and drain the oil the old fashioned way.  Do not waste money on this.,1.0
Worthless.  I had to return.  Would not work with my boat.,1.0
Tube was too short by 2 inches for Mercruiser  big block,1.0
"I bought this to drain the oil in my V6 marine engine.  The oil was virtually impossible to pull out through the dipstick tube, because the tube on this extractor is too small to pull the oil through at a reasonable rate. At the rate it was going, it would have taken hours to drain the oil.",1.0
Takes a long time to pump out oil..,1.0
"I have no idea where all of these good reviews are coming from. Maybe it's fine for doing your lawnmower, but certainly not my car. It takes FOREVER to remove warm oil- I don't even want to think about trying this on cold oil. I can do a traditional oil change in like 15 mins...this thing literally has taken 3 hours to drain like 3liters, despite going out and repumping every so often. This contraption is a reminder that sometimes we just have to roll up our sleeves.",1.0
It is definitely not for car oil change. I tried a few times and it can only suck out only 3 qt. of warm oil then it stops. The instruction says only a few pumps is needed but it is totally wrong. Even for 3 qt. of oil it takes me around 1 hour. I won't recommend it to anyone who want to diy oil change. I don't understand where these good reviews come from. A waste of time and money.,1.0
"Attempted to use on my boat's 7.4L.  It would only extract about 1/2 quart after battling it for 20 mins.  Too late to return it.  Waste of good money.  Stuck looking at it in a box, forever.",1.0
Does not work as described.  Only partially sucked out the oil from my car.  Will try different brand or type,1.0
"seems like it needs better sealing around the pump connection as it took an awfully long time to drain 6 quarts of oils from my car. Thankfully I only need to change oil two or three times a year, so I can live with it.",1.0
This product took over 2 hours to vacuum out the oil from my 4 stroke Yamaha outboard. It is advertised to hold hold 6 liters of oil but it was sucking oil into the vacuum pump before I got the 6 quarts of oil my motor holds. I changed the filter which took almost a half quart of oil out of the system before filling the Extractor. I would not recommend this unit to anyone looking for a system to remove oil from their outboard or car crankcase.,1.0
"not a very good procduct, however i did order another oil extractor that works very well this item was returned",1.0
"I read all directions on this, and even went on-line to insure I was doing this correctly. I will not extract warm oil out of an inboard boat motor that is low in the boat. I warmed the oil to maximum temps and the plunger continued to come apart at the tank. I ditched this and a more expensive one that worked flawlessly.",1.0
"Item was OK, but I have not used it yet. On the orders, however, I keep getting the message that my cart was empty so I kept trying to submit my order again. After 3 times, I quit doing it and gave up. Lo and behold, without noticing it, I ""ordered"" 3 units! So after I received the 3 units, I was surprised that I had ordered any, and I had to return 2 of them and pay the ""penalty"" (return fees) for making mistake (s) on my order. I am not ordering any more things from Amazon until I get instructions from my wife and my son who are ""experts"" in ordering from Amazon.",1.0
"This product should not be in the market.  Looking people's feedback, I bought this trash;  It took me more than 2 hour to extract 1 quart of oil.  Think again if you going to buy this Chinese trasn.",1.0
"After seeing all the great reviews on this extractor I ordered it thru Prime and received it in 2days.  When I saw the box, I immediately noticed that the name and model of the unit was different than what was shown on the amazon description, but the extractor looked similar, just a different branding sticker on it.  Then when i opened the box, I noticed some marks on the extractor tube, which made me think this item may have been used or potentially damaged.  Regardless, I was content with keeping it, if it worked with no issues.  I went to do an oil change on my audi a4 (b8) and it couldn't hold a vacuum in order to keep the oil (which was warmed up) flowing. I'm an engineer and have worked on cars since I was a kid, so I certainly trouble shooted to make sure it wasn't human error on my part and that in fact the product was not functioning as designed.

This is one of the first products on amazon that I've ordered that I've had a problem with and had to return, but it was bound to happen at some point.  Thankfully the order was fulfilled by amazon, so there was no issues with returning the item.",1.0
"Bought this thinking it would be a solution for winter oil changes and was dead wrong. Not only did it lose vacuum every minute I had to pump it every time it lost vacuum.

Took about 4 hrs on and off to take 4 1/2 quarts of of my car. This product doesn't only not work but when I shipped it back for a refund the seller is sayings its been used, not in original condition and can't accept it. Umm ya how am I supposed to test it if I can't try to extract oil. Its called a Oil Extractor!!

Don't buy this. Probably ok for small oil changes but not good for automobiles. Not to mention seller doesn't know how to accept returns. Also had to spend $10 out of my pocket to mail the thing back. There was no UPS return label. These must get sent back a lot or something,",1.0
Good work out  machine. But worthless. I pump 12-15 times then after 5 minutes the oil back flow back so you have to re-pump it. There a air leak where the black plastic pump. It's been over 6 hours and I haven't even come close to pumping out 7 quarts out of my BMW 330i. I highly not recommend this worthless pump,1.0

"If you have your own garage just do it the old way. I was working this thing for more than two hours, only be able to extract 75% oil. Save yourself headache, just let gravity do it's job.

"There are several issues with the product I received. The biggest was the extraction tube would not go all the way down the dipstick tube to reach the oil pan.  Out of four cars I changed the oil on this past Saturday it worked on only one, 2002 Z3. It took about 3 hours to evacuate the oil even though the engine had been warmed up. I polished the headlights with a 3M kit while I waited (!) often going back to pump more vacuum into the extractor (which is quite the chore as you have to hold it very tightly against the tank for the pump not to leak)  It helps very little to speed up the process if you make sure the extractor hose is not shoved against the bottom of the oil pan, but after spending all day babysitting this thing, making sure it had a vacuum, I conclude it's worthless.  Oh, and don't think you can get your money back.
DO NOT BUY!",1.0
"When I opened this package, the rubber gasket between the pump and the tank was missing. This makes this pump USELESS.",1.0
Bought this product to extract oil from lawn mower and snow blower.  It extracts at a very slow rate.  Took over an hour to extract less than 20 oz of oil.  Mityvac makes these products that will extract the same amount in 10 minutes.,1.0

I would say that if there is no way to get at the engine's drain plug then it's better than nothing.  I used it on my Acura then afterwards broke open the drain plug and drained out the rest from the oil pan.  I would have to say there was almost half of the old oil left in the engine.  It's not a quick fix or an easy way to do the job right.  Any way you look at it if you want to git 'er done right you still have to crawl around on your back!,1.0
"I bought this originally because a recently purchased lawn mower lacked an oil drain plug. (The only option was to turn the lawn mower over and dump the oil through the filler tube. - Talk about dumb designs!) This oil extractor did not work as expected; it extracted about half the oil.
Oil changes on the snow blower and another lawn mower produced the same results - only half the oil was sucked out.
Next I used it on the car. Well, I stuck the tube all the way down to the stop and drew a suction. After about a half hour it gurgled and there was a little more than 3 quarts in the container. Since the capacity for my Chrysler with a Pentastar engine is 6 quarts, I drained the remainder via the drain plug and collected another 2 1/2 quarts.
What a waste of money! Unfortunately by the time I used the thing it was well beyond the period for which Amazon would take a return.",1.0

Gauge doesn't show the right pressure.  Takes lots of pumps to have any impact on my car's tire pressure (e.g. 50 pumps for 1 psi).  Need to get something bigger.,1.0
"I bought this foot pump to replace my old one which finally ""folded"". As other reviewers have mentioned, do not expect an very sturdy foot pump that can take any type of force applied. As a matter of fact I would recommend to use it as a ""hand"" pump as this gives you more control and increases the pump's chances of ""survival"". However, I knew this before I purchased this replacement and did not expect a rugged device based on this low price. The reason why I gave it only 3 instead of 4 stars is the pretty much useless pressure gauge which gives you only a rough indication of the actual pressure and makes it therefore somewhat useless if you are trying to inflate a car or motorcycle tire to its proper pressure unless you have a separate and more accurate pressure gauge. For instance it would be difficult to inflate your tire to 33PSI +/- 1PSI given the gauge's scale. I ""fixed"" this issue by replacing the pressure gauge with the one from my old pump.
I would have rather payed a little more money for a pump with a more accurate pressure gauge.

Update 11/06/2013:

I am changing the rating for this pump to one star. The pump became useless after the second time of use. When connecting it to my car tire valve the air continued to escape the tire even after bringing the valve connector on the pump in the locked connection. In addition it was very difficult to remove the pump valve connector once back in the unlocked position. As a result a good amount of air escaped the valve. Thinking that I might had not connected the pump valve connector properly I tried again - BIG mistake. I lost so much air in that second attempt that I had to drive with an under-inflated tire to the next gas station to re-inflate the tire. I could have dealt with the fact that the pump was flimsily built and required careful operation. However, the valve connector not operating is a more severe issue that renders the pump useless. My goal was to have a small pump that I could leave as an too accessary in the car, however I realize now that I will need to replace it with a different pump. I would not recommend this pump.",1.0

I bought this pump for my son to use in his science project.  I figured the low quality wouldn't matter because he was going to operate it by hand for only low pressures.  Since he's not an adult stomping on it to get a high pressure, what could go wrong?

Well, the first time we put the inflation needle onto the pump hose, the needle piece fell apart, leaving half of it stuck inside the hose and making the pump unusable.  Didn't even get to use the pump once.

Don't trust this pump.  It will find some way to fall apart on you.",1.0
"Was using for the first time to pump up a BIKE tire, and the framework is so cheap and flimsy that it started to buckle and I kept having to bend it back to resume pumping. It eventually broke before I could inflate one tire. Note that I was using it correctly because I had an identical design, but older version of this pump for years and years. This one is an example of reaching the lower design limits for usability.",1.0
"The plastic piece below the valve broke off.  Irreparable and I'd only had it for 40 days.  Really, really cheaply constructed. Look at the other reviews.  Way too many complaints about breakage.",1.0
"Not very adjustable,  broke in less than two months.  Fragile lock system.",1.0
This came to me quite obviously used. It was dirty. The packing wasn't even attached just laying with it in the box. Shameful.,1.0
Complete garbage. Waste of money. Works on nothing I have. 100% not operator error. Stay clear.,1.0
Worked a few times but then the metal started to bend and one of the pins came loose. I would not recommend this pump to anyone.,1.0
"I am a petite female under 120 lbs. I've purchased this pump to inflate tires in my car. Unfortunately, the pump broke on my third tire))",1.0
"After reading the other reviews I knew that the hose was fragile, so I was very careful not to put any stress on the hose. Even so, the hose broke on the second use. I tried fixing it with duct tape, but to no avail. The pump itself seems sturdy enough and comfortable to use, but it is useless with a broken hose.",1.0
"This pump didn't last a year. Like another reviewer, it broke near the valve at the base of the hose. And it wasn't mistreated. It's just a cheap product. Don't bother wasting your money on this.",1.0
"After a few months and only using it maybe 5 times for balls and bikes, then hose became detached and the pump is now useless",1.0
"Here's my review: I purchased this on Oct 10. Yesterday I went out to my car, the club CANNOT be unlocked.  I found the duplicate key - the club CANNOT be unlocked. I have no access to my car. Am I supposed to pay a locksmith to take it off? I have an unusable car.  What now? What a nightmare.",1.0
"Don't waste your money. I own 3 other siphon feed sprayers - 2 of them a more expensive Campbell Hausfield. Don't waste your money on this one. One thing that I value is ease of use. This is very tricky to close once you have paint in it. It does not align well and I found it very frustrating. Unfortunately, I missed the return date by 2 days so now I am stuck with it. Don't waste your money and buy the next model up. You won't regret it.",1.0
"I purchased this gun to be used with latex paint. So far the reviews I read seem not to bet a latex spraying gun. I did not receive the gun yet, but I am hoping I can use it for latex paint. If  I can't, then it will be lost money.",1.0
"I don't write review very often. But I am doing this right now since I hope people who is looking for a product don't buy this one. I bought this pump because of its good review. It turned out I was wrong. I only used it twice before it's broken. The tube that connects to the pump side bump off when I pump my tire. I tried to fix it by wiring around it. When pump it again, the tube didn't bump off but the tube got a crack because of the high pressure(the car tire was only about 28 psi). I am not trying to return it. Never buy this product again.",1.0
"I understand you get what you pay for, but this thing doesn't really work at all.  It doesn't have a gauge, which is alright for an emergency pump but should be noted.  The biggest issue I found, though, was that it leaks when pumping.  Not just the valve, but it actually leaks internally.  Makes it very difficult to pump up anything.",1.0
I returned this item to Amazon. Could not remove the club from my steering wheel on my new car. Tried using all suggestions to remove it located on Club website and had to finally call in a locksmith to remove it so I could use the car ($110). Returned this particular club to Amazon and received a refund. I still had the club I used on my previous car (vintage year 2000) and it continues to work flawlessly.,1.0
There was no info included in description that an adapter was required to use on many common items. I did not return. Will give to my grandsons when their current pump is no longer useable. Please include the need for an adaptor in the item's description,1.0
"The top of the pump wasn't even attached to the cylinder, pulled it up the first time and the whole thing came apart.  Proceeded to throw in the trash.",1.0
"My wife and I recently purchased two bikes that have been sitting awhile and the tires needed some air. We thought this would be a great economical pump but while pumping up the second tire the hose sprun a leak at just 35PSI! We didn't even get a full bike operational by the time this thing gave way. Luckily, Amazon refunded our money promptly. We have since shelled out a little more coin and purchased a quality unit. Spend the extra money and only buy on pump. You never know when you will need it and the cheap one fails you.",1.0
"We purchased this product to attach to our compressor and do some quick spray painting. What a mistake. Followed all the directions, added the thinner, and could not make it work.  Cleaned it all out, went to the local hardware store and got their advice on how to make it work. Started all over again, and still no results other than a little spatter.  What a waste of time and effort.",1.0
cylinder leaks air after only a few uses,1.0
"If you are buying this as a basic pump to use on sports balls and bicycles, don't. First, there is no pressure gauge, so good luck figuring out how much air is in your bicycle. Second, it wouldn't securely attach to the same needle that I've used on my past two pumps. So you won't be blowing up any soccer balls. Third, the shaft of the pump arrived covered in a copious quantity of grease that stained the pants I was wearing the only time I attempted to use this worthless thing. Spend a few more bucks and get a quality product.",1.0
this is a piece of garbage i cannot believe i bought it with my hard earned money....do not buy it!!!!,1.0
Is not good.  (No lo recomiendo),1.0
This is a piece of Chinese garbage.  I can't believe amazon would even allow this product to be sold under their name.  Doesn't work.  The pump body doesn't even make an air right seal.  There aren't even enough threads to screw the body to the base.  This product is horrendous.  DON'T buy this.,1.0
The pump valve mechanism simply broke in about a year after regular use (pump once or twice a month). Poor build quality of plastic nozzle.,1.0
Had a hole in the pump cord a couple months later. Would never buy again.,1.0
I use it 3 times it stop pumping some thing inside broke in the pump.,1.0
"Valve does not stay clamped on when tire pressure exceeds about 20lbs so can never completely inflate tire.
Made in China junk.",1.0
The fitting broke before I had a chance to use it,1.0
"I went to lock it on the steering wheel, when I turned the key the locking assy. behind key came apart  (cap, spring & ball bearing) will not lock now the crooks now to dismantle the club",1.0
The hose came off after 4 uses. Was using to inflate my bike. Expected better.,1.0
"Despite mostly metal construction, doesn't last: the end perished after only a few months.",1.0
Save your money. This pump started leaking after a year of light use. Doesn't have the volume for an occasional car tire.,1.0
"All the thieves had to do was cut it off. Easy peasy - car stolen. I guess it is better to have it than not have it, but my car was still stolen even though the club was locked and secured on the steering wheel.",1.0
"Seemed like a good value at the time.  Had a similar pump growing up, but unfortunately, this thing is super cheap and failed after only 15 months of very light use.  Failure point was internal; the sealed pump mechanism ""popped"" while I was pumping and then offered no resistance and pumped no air.  Threw it in the trash where it belongs.",1.0
I loved this pump at first but than after 2 months of weekly use it developed a leak in the hose line. This is not acceptable. I spent $30 for a Spin Doctor pump from the bike shop and it is going on one year with no issues and it has a guage so I know how much i am putting in. This deluxe hand pump is also harder to use because the little metal feet that fold out are hard to keep from moving while pumping. I would imagine this pump would be good if you would need it just a couple times throughout the year but for sustained use it would be best to look somewhere else.,1.0
"Warning!  The lock on this is cheap junk and you could end up with this thing stuck on your steering wheel.

Don't worry, if this happens to you there's lots of options:
An expensive honest locksmith, a very expensive dishonest locksmith, let your car get ticketed or towed away, an all-nighter with a hacksaw, or a few intense spark filled minutes with some type of an electric cutter (careful not to melt your dash or upholstery)

Hopefully while you're doing this fun work you won't be interrupted by your local PD demanding you show your hands and step away from the vehicle (hope that saws all doesn't look too much like a gun a night) then having to show id and explain what your doing, which I guess beats the alternative of the local hoodlums waiting for you to finish and then relieving you of your wallet and car and possibly live.

Don't bother calling the company, they won't help you and they don't care. They already know there's a problem, mustn't let a few folks left with hundreds $$$ in damages or without a vehicle trouble their profits They won't even bother asking you if you'd like a refund or a replacement (as if).",1.0
I purchased the club soon after buying a new car. Within three months my car was stolen. It was a very small window of time  between when it was stolen and I discovered it missing. The thieves used my car jack to bend the club and take it off in less than five minutes. This product is a waste of time and money.,1.0
"I bought this item to pump balls and bikes in Winter, when I didn't use it much. When summer comes, I used it no more than 20 times and the pump suddenly doesn't work. It can move up and down just no air comes out.",1.0
Ours fell apart about three times after using it. not worth returning but I was very disappointed in this product,1.0
"The base of the pump is loose and broken when I first used it. After I put it on, it still leaking air.",1.0
"It comes apart very easily and didn't last. The ""pump"" came completely out of the tube and while we can ""sort of"" put it back together it's very wobbly.",1.0
This pump is cheap in price and 10x cheaper in quality. Really unfortunate as mine broke after only 5 uses,1.0
"After a few years of use the Club's lock cylinder broke apart... while it was locked on the steering wheel. After trying to pick the lock and then taking a hammer to it in order to free the steering wheel, it took a locksmith and $125 to succeed in removing the Club.",1.0
I gave this to my daughter for a gift and the key would not fit the lock cylinder. Now it has to be sent back.,1.0
"The hose head is made by very weak plastic, it broke at my first time use for car tire in 10 sec. This WILL work for your kids' swim inflatable gears or bicycle I guess.",1.0
This product is CRAP.  Hole in side of cylinder....Really....Made in China....Ouch!!  Hope to return for money paid and then buy another,1.0
"I bought this several months ago to keep on hand since my last one went missing. The very first time I used it, the pressure got up to 20psi and the whole thing split apart at the base. The metal threads were sheared off so there's no fixing it.",1.0
The handle is weak making this hard to use without breaking it.  Spend a little more to get a durable pump.,1.0
The part that connects to the tire came right off from the tube on the third time I used this piece of crap. Some build quality!,1.0
"After a month the key and lock froze up. Tried everything WD-40 trying to take pressure off the lock . Ended up cutting it off with a hacksaw.
I was surprised how easy the metal cut. Not sure what to buy next.",1.0
"Car thieves simply use it first to gain the leverage necessary to break the steering column lock.

Then they use a small hacksaw and simply cut through your steering wheel and remove the lock now that the wheel can spin freely.",1.0
Just cut the steering wheel with a hack saw and you have a club to hit yourself on the head with!,1.0
"Unfortunately this product has made me use my least favorite expression ""you get what you pay for"".

There is little to no seal, and the hose doesn't stay connect to the pump.
It will literally shoot off after a few depressions of the plunger.

Pumping up a single car tire was a full 20 minute ordeal after which my triceps were fully exhausted.",1.0
"At first I thought it was a great deal because it was cheap. But it failed to even pump my first tire. The moment I connected it with my tire, the thumblock broke and now it's just trash. (Or it just is in the first place)",1.0
"I bought this exact model lock for my steering wheel less than a year ago from a well known auto parts store chain.  Last week, while locking down my steering wheel with this lock, the entire locking mechanism broke off from the shaft.  After it broke, I was lucky that I was able to remove the club from my steering wheel.  Whats worse is that I took good care of the steering wheel lock.  I do not recommend this very poor quality product.",1.0
