"These made nice Halloween presents for my favorite children in the neighborhood.  I also love the feature that allows me to print them at home.  The feature that blew my socks off showed up long after Halloween.  I did not use one of the $10 gift cards I'd printed because I decided to give an older child a $25 certificate because this might have been his last Halloween for trick-or-treating.  I kept the $10 certificate and used it on an item I'd bought from an Amazon Marketplace vendor.  The item from that vendor arrived damaged.  I got that all straightened out, but I'd used my certificate for that transaction and I did not know how to recoup the value, so I figured I'd just lost the $10.  Amazon to the rescue!  The next Amazon Marketplace transaction I had the $10 was automatically deducted from the price and the notation was ""gift certificate"".  Amazon had fixed that glitch for me without my having to do a thing.  I love Amazon!",5.0

"Great way to let parents of newborn pick whatever they need, not have to return stuff you thought they might need or use. I love gift cards. I really think it's better than gifts, even off of a registry, because before your baby is born, you pick out ideas for a registry, but then reality sets in and you realize there are all kinds of things you didn't know you'd need more than that cute ""whatever"". A gift card helps fill that void.",5.0

This is great, especially for a full-time working mom of a 3 year old who has no time to shop at the stores for gifts!

It was so easy to do this online, personalize the card in the denomination you wanted. You can print out a card or have it emailed to the recipient.

Will definitely be doing this again!!",5.0

"I couldn't figure out what to send my 8 yr old nephew for V-day. We live 3000 miles away and I want him to know we are thinking of him so this went over very well!

I figured he'd get enough candy/sugar so I wanted to steer away from that (in the past I sent him candy or cash).

This was special because I put a little note with it (you can type it in and then it prints out with the card). I chose to print it out right here and mail it with the cute little v-day card we got him.

He got a Kindle for his b-day and I figured he could download a game or a few books.

He called me and was very excited and felt like a big boy I think because it was a gift card with a special number linked to it.

I was happy he was happy!!  I ended up doing it again for Easter but this time,, so that he  knew what Easter was really about, I purchased a childrens story bible and printed that out and then gave him a $10 printable card too :0)",5.0

"I went to Walmart looking for an Amazon Gift card for my bibliophile mom this Mother's Day, and the store didn't have any. Because I am a man, I had waited until the day before Mother's Day to buy her gift, and knowing that my mom loves to read on her Kindle, but often avoids purchasing the most expensive books for herself out of frugality, I really had my heart set on a Kindle gift card for her.  In a near panic, I scoured Amazon to see if I could purchase her Kindle credit outright.

After finding this online, my problem was solved!  I payed exactly the amount that I wanted to, not what was available at the store, and I printed the card out on my home printer right on the spot. So easy! My mother enjoyed a couple of new releases from her favorite authors, and I will never buy another Amazon gift card at a retailer ever again.

My only complaint is that Amazon is not doing more to advertise this option!  If I had known these were offered, then I would have never bothered to make a trip to the store in the first place!",5.0
Really easy to do and it was exactly what he wanted.,5.0
The basket was easy to fill and hang.  It's doing great on my covered porch.,5.0

So convenient to print the gift card out on line.  We gave it to our neighbor for her birthday with two kindle book suggestions.  Worked out great!,5.0
My family is difficult to buy for.  My sons are avid users of Amazon so these gift certificates allow them to choose a gift they really need or want rather than something I might pick out for which they have no use.,5.0
Gift certificate arrived in 15 minutes and I printed it out. It was perfect. My only complaint is that I had to use scissors to cut the bottom of the card to make it fit into a standard letter sized envelope. Amazon should've probably thought about that when designing the card.,5.0

I couldn't figure out what to get my dad for his birthday and then I remembered that he likes books.

"Don't want to schlep out to buy ex-husband (but baby-daddy) a gift, but know that your shared child can't show up empty-handed to Father's Day?

The printable gift certificates are good for 18 years, after which your child is on his or her own on FD.

"Had an uncharacteristically unpleasant experience with an Amazon Gift Card over the weekend.

Bought a $300 card for delivery via text. An hour or two later it still showed ""Scheduled"" for delivery. Contacted customer service, was told Amazon was waiting on my bank to OK the transaction. I went to bed thinking it would be OK'd and delivered overnight. Ten hours after the purchase time, still not delivered. Called my bank, was told Amazon had never requested approval of the transaction. Called Amazon, was told it could be four more hours before it was approved.

I told Amazon to cancel the transaction, they told me it would be done immediately, and I would get a receipt confirming the cancellation.

One hour later, I get notification that the card was delivered. Apparently the transaction was not cancelled as promised. I had been in the process of purchasing a different gift when the delivery notice came in, so I was lucky it came through when it did.

The lesson here? Let the buyer beware. Amazon's promise of ""five minute delivery"" in my case was way off base. What's worse, their processes for approving transactions leave very much to be desired. When talking to customer service - both the original representative and his supervisor - I was only told ""you just have to wait."" There was nothing anyone could do to help me.

Because I purchased this card to be delivered for a party (which didn't happen), this was a completely unacceptable situation that has left a very nasty taste in my mouth regarding the use of Amazon Gift Cards. Buyer beware",1.0

"I liked that the recipient has many gift options with the eGift card.  We chose the Happy Birthday card with balloons, which was shown on our receipt and all correspondence.  However, when we printed the eCard the only picture that would print was the Amazon ""a"" logo.  Our repeated efforts to print our choice were to no avail.  What should have been quick and easy, proved to be time-consuming, laborious and disappointing.",1.0

I was recently given a gift card from Amazon for Christmas. It didn't work and Amazon told me it had never been activated by the store. My uncle paid $25 dollars for it. So I guess Amazon ended up ahead by $25?  Its much better to give cash or a check than a gift card.,1.0

"The recipient of this ecard must sign up for Amazon to redeem. I feel this is something that should have been disclosed upon purchasing, but it was not. I did not like the fact of giving a gift that forced someone to become a member just to redeem.

I canceled it and sent a physical gift card that will allow the recipient to be just a customer and not forced into being a member.",1.0

They even called me to verify the purchase, which just makes it harder to dispute with either them or their credit card company. I guess I'm just out the money. Bottom line: Don't send cash through any card, online, anything. Unless you want to support scumbags who lurk just outside the view of the law, just don't send money to anyone.",1.0

"Tried to order a gift card for my daughter's Valentines day present.  When it required me to enter the account number for the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card (set up 15 days ago, with a published 1-2 week wait to receive the card), with which I have successfully ordered a phone and a book from Amazon, I had to cancel today's order - as the card still hasn't arrived.
Unlike so many of the other 1-star ratings where people had losses of money and time using Amazon gift cards, I lost nothing (except the time expended on trying to place this order for a surprise Valentines day gift and to write this review).  Amazon lost money, as my purchase:
 using THEIR Prime Rewards Visa card,
 of THEIR gift card,
 which would have been used in her AMAZON ACCOUNT -
wasn't made.
So THANK YOU AMAZON. I believe my daughter would rather see my Chrysler with a full tank of gas than have to figure out what to do with unexpected cash.",1.0

When I'd call my bank I was told that everything was fine on their end. I did tell Amazon that the bank is saying that my account has no problem processing the purchase but they still didn't listen and kept saying to call my bank. I got very frustrated and finally spoke to someone who REALIZED that the problem was on amazons end. This was probably the worst experience ever.

"I found out just the other day that my amazon account and my yahoo email account were both hacked. I had all of my credit card information stored on the site.

I had changed my password on both sites and placed 2-level authentication on both. Well, at around 8:30 in the morning, the gift cards showed up in my email account. I don't want these cards! Whats really interesting is that they purchased these itunes cards using and amazon gift card. In the rules and regulations for amazons gift cards, you are not allowed to purchase other gift cards or trade for a refund or cash. I just want my money back! The hacker also went to Coinbase and purchased stock in etherium using my name and information and using my email! Im currently in the process of changing my email and using a different company! This has been a very stressful weekend! Unfortunately for the hacker, I had called my bank and shut my cc down, so any money he was trying to get from that account wasn't going to work for him anymore! I even filed a dispute with the bank to get my money back! Heres hoping I can get my money back.",1.0

Amazon can spend $5m for a 30 second commercial, but demand $200 from me! Go figure!",1.0
"I just want Amazon to know that I was going to send someone an online gift card as a birthday gift, but WILL NOT be doing so because of the recent problems others have had as reported in their reviews.  Two issues:  (1) Amazon's system of issuing them is not secure enough if people other than the recipient can redeem them.  (2)  Given the security issue -- of which Amazon is fully aware -- their manner  of handling each of the complaints is way below par.  I was going to say ""their customer service""....except that from the reviews I read it isn't service.  I don't have the time or patience to have to go through what these folks did.  Not worth the risk.

Not to mention we were purchasing a gift card on behalf of several close friends, whose names we included in this message. When it was delivered the message was not included which made a lot of awkward apologies and clarifications happen because we didn't realize that they didn't know the gift was a group gift, and we only found out much later.

It seems so simple to just mail a gift card with a message attached to it but Amazon managed to screw it up. Really annoying and inconvenient. Is this review helpful? Probably not, but I needed to vent. Next time I'll just mail the card to myself and then mail it personally to avoid this hassle. Or probably choose a different gift card than an Amazon one.",1.0

After another day, he called again and after a half hour, the representative was still unable to help him redeem it. I finally emailed Amazon support threatening to contact my state's Attorney General's office. That finally did it and they applied the gift card to his account.

"I have sent and received 1000s in amazon gift cards over the years. So it hurts me to write this review but I want to make sure people are aware of how little responsibility Amazon takes to make sure a gift sent through them reaches your loved ones.

I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault. The rep said she would let the gift card department know. But next morning I get this email from a customer service rep in India..

""

I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better. We hope to see you again soon.

We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.""

One they don't want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients don't use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didn't work...just imagine how many gifts don't reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

Felt this was important to bring to people's attention with the coming holiday season. Please don't waste your money sending an Amazon gift card. Just send your loved ones cash instead.",1.0
"If nothing will do but you must buy an Amazon gift card, please walk into a store and buy one. Do not trust Amazon to get it to you on time!

Both cards showed up on the same day - 4 days after it was ""guaranteed"" delivered. What a joke!

Their reply? Oh, you should make a complaint with USPS - it's not our fault. No guys - YOU SHOULD MAKE A COMPLAINT WITH USPS! YOU CHOSE TO USE THEM TO SHIP THE PRODUCT, NOT ME! YOU SHOULD CARE!!!!!

Being I'd been given ZERO  instructions on what to do I contacted Amazon customer service via chat. The representative apologized for the hassle and told me to keep both cards as a gift from Amazon. Um, okay, that seemed really generous, but why would he make that up? I gave both cards the recipient (late, of course) and wound up with egg on my face when the second card didn't work. Thanks again, Amazon! UGH!

Their reply? Oh, he was wrong. We don't know why he would tell you that. Sorry. A chat representative encouraged me to continue to be a part of their ""awesome family.""

It took a couple of e-mails and an online chat just to find out that Amazon will only resolve their mistake if the purchaser, not the gift card recipient, requests a replacement. Luckily, we received this gift card from a family member so I felt comfortable notifying them to start the replacement process.

"Ordered 4 cards Dec 17, 2014 with 1 day shipping for my four grandchildren visiting Dec 20.  3 cards arrived Dec 19, 2014 mid afternoon when my mail is normally delivered.  Since the kids were to be there early on the 20th for a short visit I knew the fourth card would not arrive on time for one of the kids.  I did a chat and email with amazon with some rude and uncaring response.  In the end an email of apology was sent indicating I would have my account credited.  It did not say the card which was now in the mail to the grandson who did not get it that morning was canceled.  Needless to say this led to some embarrassment to my wife and I but I simply gave him cash when I next saw him and he was happy enough and understanding.  The issue is if you are going to cancel out the value of a card make it very clear to a customer before you do it.  Amazon has my payment info on file so to handle it the way they did really stinks.  The irony is I have read many reviews where customers who never received their cards had trouble getting a refund so I was blindsided by having it canceled for complaining it was late.",1.0

This is a ""policy"" they have no way around.  We use Amazon all the time and have been pleased in the past.  But now I feel like they have stolen my child's Christmas gift.

"It's a gift card with a greeting card included; there's nothing to like or dislike about the item itself.

I realize Amazon offers to do this for you, but I'd prefer to sign my cards myself.  As this was a teacher gift, I decided not to give it without the envelope.

"The card didn't work when my son attempted to purchase something online.  He called customer service, they told him I had to activate it.  I've never had to do this in the past, but things change so who knows?  I went online to activate it, there was no place to do so.  The direction was simply wrong.  So I called customer service (you provide a telephone number and they call you back).  The first time the phone rang I was on hold for a few minutes before the call was mysteriously terminated.  So I clicked on the button (online) again to have them call me a second time.  This time a human came online.  He was a confused human.  His English was OK, but what he was telling me was hard to understand.  He didn't seem to understand the issue.  I'd purchased a gift card for my son, my son had attempted to redeem the gift card, and was told there was a problem with it.  So this person put me on hold.  I took the opportunity to 3-way my son into the conversation.  So when the person came back we provided the activation code and all other relevant information, we all navigated to the various pages of interest, my soon looked at the Amazon Wallet in his account ($0.00), the person asked him to input the code (he did), the same message came back ""problem with card"" and the balance was still ($0.00).  The person went away again, and when he came back he said there was a problem with these cards.  So the Christmas-themed card I'd purchased for my daughter would also not work. My son told me that after we all hung up the customer rep called him back to ask my daughter to try her card, just to be sure.  It didn't.  Another 15 minutes wasted. So AMAZON is resending them.  As you may have gathered, collectively my son and I probably spent close to two hours attempting to resolve the issue.  Since the new cards have not arrived as of yet, it is still up in the air as to whether or not it has been resolved.  And since the customer rep said there was a problem with the Christmas-themed cards, this may end up being a disaster for AMAZON.  BTW, the Happy Birthday themed gift card I purchased for my daughter at the same time worked fine.",1.0

"Are you kidding. I ordered three cards, of different denominations. I ordered them wrapped, and boy did they. I had to open the wrapping, (No, they didn't leave one end untaped so I could get into it without destroying the wrapping.), then I had to remove a sealed envelope that protected the card that was with an envelope. No, the card was not in the card envelope, just with it in the utility protection envelope, which shouldn't be in a gift!
Make sure you fill out gift card information, if you order these wrapped, since the people wrapping these don't comprehend, or don't care, that you will have to open one end of the packaging so you can find out which card is in which wrapping.
Also, the wrapping was very poorly done - the packages were not wrapped square, and ends of the paper were not folded under before taping on two of the wrappings.
So, you can pay Amazon two dollars to wrap each card, then unwrap them so you can see which card is in which wrapping, and so you can remove the ugly protective envelope, and also put the card in the card envelope... and then, re-wrap them...",1.0

Not horrible, but it did drop my overall rating on this down by 1 star.

"My Grandmother ordered a 30 dollar greeting card with amazon gift card.  When I tried to use it to buy my school book I couldn't because the code did not work.  I tried it again and it still did not work so I called Amazon Customer Service.  After talking to someone (who was easy to understand) for ten minutes she hung up on me.  Then I called back and got a lady with a very heavy accent who was super hard to understand.  I talked to this lady for over 30 minutes and had to deal with her asking the same questions over and over and not helping me at all.  I finally asked for a manager and she told me she will let him know that I want to speak to him.  After 5 minutes on hold she came back to the phone without the manager!  She told me he was busy and she did the best she could to help me and was about to hang up on me! I told her that I needed to speak to the manager and I was willing to wait.  She put me back on hold and about 2 minutes later the manager came to the phone.  After talking to the manager who did nothing to help; he told me he was going to forward this information on to the gift card department by email and they would get back to me within 24 hours.  At this point I learned the manager was just as unless as the employee in customer service and nothing was going to get done with them.  So a few hours later I got an email from the gift card department and it said ....We would best be able to help you if you call our customer service line.  ....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!  At this point, I was pissed so I waited a few hours to reply in order to gather my thoughts and calm down.  About 5 hours after the gift card department replied the manager replied tell me that he sent my request and they would get back to me within 1-2 business days --- This was different information then what he told me on the phone and a delayed reply since the gift card department had replied already.  ....This story is getting too long ...so long story short after talking on the phone the next day to two more people someone finally worked out it out; it was almost not worth the 30 dollars!

"I purchased 3 gift cards for my family members for Christmas through amazon directly and sent them all to their house. Then I had received an email from amazon on Dec. 10th stating the 3 gift cards that were issued to me, were in fact never activated so they would be sending out another 3 gift cards, in which no one ever received the new ones, just the old cards, but then of course never worked. I called Amazon customer service and they told me they did not show any evidence that I had purchased these gift cards (even though my bank card stated I paid for them) and they would have to contact a ""gift card"" representative to figure the situation out and it could take up to 3 business days. Since then I have talked to numerous customer service representatives, of all whom I could not understand fully because they were based out of the country and it wasn't until the last person I talked with, that she said at any point I could have asked for an American based representative, even though I had asked numerous times to speak with someone who spoke better English, I never got anyone.  Last night was the last straw for me when the unclear customer rep stated the same dialog I have been listening to for the past 4 times, I just told them to refund me my money and to be done with this nonsense.

I ordered 2 gift cards for Christmas. Was told Free one-day delivery. Ordered them on Dec. 21st..today is December 26th ..day after Christmas  still no delivery  Have been tracking the package since the promise of one-day delivery Supposedly its in transit today..which is too late for Christmas delivery...hopefully I can use them to pay off these cards that I bought thru amazon.

I was so happy to see that I could send a visa gift card through Amazon to my son and his family who live in California.  I had seen a program about all that Amazon was selling now and how quickly they could send items.  So I purchased a gift card for  $150 so they could go Christmas shopping. When they went to use the card they were told that it was for use on Amazon only!  I am just crushed and so are they.  I went ahead and sent them $150.00 by Western Union so it would not be a total loss.  I would like you to refund the $150.00 that I spent on the spent on the gift card.,1.0
"Unfortunately the gift card never arrived, UPS tracking tells me it was delivered but it never came.  The problem is that as a gift card Amazon doesn't give you any easy way to complain.  No ability to return or otherwise tell them you didn't get the card.  Save yourself the large amount of trouble and don't order a card that has to be mailed.  Print your gift card at home and Amazon make it easier for you to be told a gift card never arrived.  I will not be buying this way again.",1.0

Really pathetic service!!!! The website STILL states free one day shipping even though once you order them there is a delaty. If you need these by Christmas buy some other gift card you won't get it in time. THEN, even though you order a gift card you get a paper receipt. Huh you don't have anyone in position of authority that nows you need plenty of plastic and paper cards on hand for Christmas. That inventory would have cost what $20? Then you would think that somoeone, someone, would have enough sense to delete the one day delivery from the website.",1.0

Customer service even poorly handled the refund.  I was completely unable to get a Manager to get on the chat, but was told that the manager would e-mail me.  Never received the e-mail.

Crap. Said 1 day shipping but hadn't shipped after 2 days. Are you serious? It's a gift card. Get your stuff together. Amazon has gone way down hill. The past year I have been buying products from retailers on your site but going to their homepage and I save a ton. So many times going to their site and paying shipping is still about 3-5 dollars cheaper. Plus if I order more than 1 item I'm saving 10 dollars. I now buy my nutritional supplements from a site I bought on Amazon and with a $200 order I save about 70 - 80 dollars. I feel like I've been screwed for years but no more. I only order a very few certain things now from amazon now.,1.0

They left out the message I submitted for the greetings, and the gift card is different then pictured. I contacted support and all they would say to me is submit a return and print a new one. No credit, no were sorry, just use an automated system and tell me to make my own solution. The main reason I got this was so I'd have an actual gift card, and not cheap looking piece of paper! I did not contact support to be told your out of luck! I like Amazon, but this type of service is very upsetting! I recommend looking else where if you want your gift cards done correctly!",1.0

4 days for next day delivery?!

So I opened one of the 20.  Wanted to see how the Gift Message looked.  Discovered it wasn't there.  (The envelope containing the

So let's not bother to enter the Gift Message.

"Be careful when you order a gift card. I ordered one for the holidays as I do most years, and opted to have a card delivered to my home so as to have something for the recipient to open. Unfortunately the card did not show up. When I went to see if there was anyway to have it reissued, turns out someone, who was not me or my intended recipient, used it. So now I am out of luck with no options to recoup my lost money as Amazon has a policy that they will not get involved in lost or stolen gift cards. I'm sure they are able to track who used it, but I doubt it is worth their time or effort. So be careful. It's probably best just to give cash.",1.0

Am I suppose to believe this????

My giftcards looked fine except someone forgot to add my gift message; it was on the invoice but not on the card! Very Disappointing ... will probably not buy from them again!,1.0
Extremely disappointed when item was ordered early to deliver on 11/28 and didn't arrive until 12/3.  This was a birthday present for my daughter - so of course I looked bad by not having a present or card there on her birthday.  I would not use this service again.  HUGE disappointment.,1.0
"On November 27th I ordered an Amazon $100.00 gift card to be sent to my sister for her birthday and it was delivered to her in Wimberley, Tx on November 28th as promised; HOWEVER, why in the world did you enclose a packing slip telling her it was $100.00 gift certificate to her for $100.00 AND SHE HAD NOT EVEN OPENED THE CARD.

Is this the way Amazon handles gift certificates because if so you need to review your procedures.  Packing slips should be sent to the GIVER and not the recipient telling them what their gift is  - her birthday is not until December 7th and I had no clue you would tell her what was contained so thanks for spoiling the surprise.",1.0
"I found out the hard way that Amazon Gift Card points can not be used to purchase Kindle magazine subscriptions.  This was validated by contacting a customer service representative.  I currently have $76 dollars credited to my account but the only way to purchase a magazine subscription is to use a valid credit card.

My guess is that Amazon's stance is that once they have your money, they can choose on what it can apply to.  Kind of a sleazy way to do business if you ask me.

Careful about buying a Gift Card as a supplemental gift to a Kindle Fire HD.",1.0
"I consistently had issue with amazon's gift card delivery this year. My last three orders are all delayed. One time it even messed up my party plan. This time, they even delivered to a wrong house, not the one next to us. It is half miles away. Luckily, they are nice and find my house to give to me.

It was very good before. I was able to get cards in just one day. So whenever I need a gift card, I always order from amazon. It is no longer the case. Don't believe the one day service.",1.0

NOTE WELL: there is no way to report this failure in the AMAZON system! It is the October 25th & nothing has been done about this.

"Well, I usually scoff as bad reviews but have to agree that this item was totally mis-represented.  One day delvery is not possible in many locations but you find that out after you place the order.  Then I get a message saying it was undeliverable and to go to USPS for redelivery.  I did that and again it was not available at that location.  It was funny because it said that if it was delivered to a PO box then the item was probably too big for the box - a gift card?  I had put in a street address and a PO box.  Just disappointed because the service was not anywhere close to being what was presented in the blurb on the card.",1.0

If it would be possible to give negative stars, I would be giving that rating. I ordered a $75.00 gift card that could be enclosed in a birthday card. The advertised description said the card would be delivered to my home address within 24 hours. To make a very long story shorter.....I still have not received this card 16 days after the promised delivery date. I have received 5 notices of extended delivery time. I called to cancel the order on day 14 and was told that the order could not be cancelled because it was ""on the truck"". I was promised it would definitely be delivered by the 16th day without exception. The 16th day has come and gone without the card being delivered, but I have received another extended delivery date email. After contacting Amazon customer service 3 times during this time period, I have elected to send the gift card digitally. I would have done this 16 days ago if I had any idea of the delay. Amazon said they could give me a $30.00 ""promotional"" credit on my account. Then, I was told I couldn't use the promotional credit toward the purchase of the digital gift card. Come on, Amazon, you can do better than that! Most reputable retailers would have likely refunded the full amount based on the level of inconvenience. At a minimum,the contractor for the plastic cards should have made things right. I was not allowed to talk with an Amazon supervisor to voice my complaint--and I asked numerous times.

If you want the recipient of your gift card to receive your gift, better to play it safe, and buy your gift card from another retailer. I'm still hoping that the digital gift card will reach my recipient with my apology note. Not the birthday gift I had hoped to give.",1.0

"I gave this gift card to my son-in-law for his birthday and when he went to use it on line, his debit card that was stored on line was charged instead of the gift card, even though he put in all the gift card info.

"I recently ordered an amazon gift card with a birthday card included.  When my order arrived it was bent in several places, including the gift card.  I was very disappointed.  When you give someone a gift card you would like for it to look nice.  I can't return the card for another one because I am on a time schedule.  I am very glad I didn't send the card directly to her address as a gift.  Very disappointed in Amazon.  I have always had good results from all of my orders in the past.",1.0

"I wanted to ordered two books and an iTunes card for a high school graduate.  On Amazon's website, I typed in ""iTunes"" and Amazon auto-filled with ""iTunes gift card"".  I clicked on it, but Amazon took me to Amazon Gift Cards.  I did not notice this, and placed the order.  Several days later, I went back to the order, and realized my error in ordering an Amazon Gift Card instead of an iTunes card.

It turns out that Amazon does not sell iTunes cards.  Since that is the case, Amazon should NOT auto-fill ""iTunes Gift Cards"", but rather take you to a page saying they do not sell them.  But Amazon should NOT have taken me to Amazon Gift Card.

Amazon's customer service is the the best, and this was no exception, as they offered to take the card back and return my money.  However, as this was a gift that had already been delivered, I chose not to involve the recipient in an exchange effort.  I thank Amazon for that effort.

But, Amazon, you need to fix the auto-fill so that it does not auto-fill with any item that you do not actually sell.",1.0

It really doesn't look that way:  What a disappointment.  If I'd known this, I would have taken the email option.  Why do you offer 1 day shipping when you don't honor it.  This is NOT a good way to do business and NOT what I have come to expect from Amazon.  In particular, with the way that you replied saying that it would arrive by today, which would have been 1 day late but acceptable.  2 days late is not acceptable (because the graduation party is today).

"*DO NOT BUY* Purchased 20 $50.00 Amazon gift cards ($1000.00 worth) through this site with the ""Thank You"" cards attached for employees at work. I've been an Amazon customer for over a decade. All the gift cards were claimed when I asked all the employees to check their claim codes after one staff member complained her's wasn't usable. I called customer service, received the same ""call your bank"" email response. I called again this time extremely frustrated. They escalated it to the gift card/escalation department. They had me prove to them that all 20 gift cards were compromised. I asked all 20 employees to take photo copies of their cards, where then I prepared a document showing all 20 card numbers with detailed explanation. In short, I had to ""work for it"" - proving that indeed, they're careless service of not checking these card numbers were recycled and unusable. When I mentioned a couple of times, ""Do you guys read your comments on how most of these gift cards have the same complaints?"" They acted clueless. Also, they only do customer service responses via email, even after repeated requests for them to call me back - they never do. You have to initiate phone contact. After over two weeks, and constant nagging on my end, I did receive the amount back, but not in the form of 20 gift cards as I originally intended to give as employee gifts, but a credit on one account. Are they expecting me to purchase more gift cards from this site to give to the employees? What do they expect me to do now that the money is on just one Amazon account? I will NEVER purchase Amazon gift cards again. UNBELIEVABLE.",1.0

It's the worst gift card I do not recommend buying it because I bought one of them $ 50 and I was very hard to buy a Ram for my mobile phone at $ 42.39 and $ 7.61 remained in this card and unfortunately did not allow me to use the rest of my balance. To work I have contacted the customer service and the employee told me that you can not use the rest of your balance in this card unless you enter your bank card. This is bad because they withdraw from my bank account without my request for something so I have canceled the bank card from my account in Amazon so as not to withdraw money Without my knowledge.,1.0

They screwed up and entered the wrong serial number.  Now my neice was embarrassed at a store and unable to purchase her items and I look like a thief who tried to give a stolen gift card. Thanks a lot Amazon.  You have lost all of my personal gift card business-- and all of my company's gift card business which totalled another $5000 this year.  I would have liked an apology but all I got was 26 minutes of some foreigner on the phone telling me that the best she could do was update the card in the next 48 hours to work.

"Warning amazon will not back these up in the event that gift card thieves redeem your card. There are people who know how to get access to issued gift card numbers and redeem them. I stocked up on amazon gift cards throughout the year for Christmas gifts. I had saved up 12 $100 gift cards and of the 12, 3 were redeemed by thieves. Amazon would go as far as to tell me the names of the people who redeemed them two were on Chinese accounts and one Im not sure. (Not me is whats important.) but they say they take no responsibility for stolen gift cards....... no help no reissue no nothing . If you look this is a common issue for many customers too. Be wary of these gift cards if they are not redeemed within a short period of time they are very likely to be e-stolen. Amazon if you can verify the card was redeemed to a fraudulent account you need to help your loyal customers out very disappointed in your lack of customer service in this regard.",1.0

"So again, as others have indicated, the gift arrived to the recipient without the designated verbiage to indicate that it was a birthday gift from me.  The recipient had no idea who it was from and I had to ask if it had been received.  This is inexcusable.

On 10/11/17 I was looking for gifts for 5 teen nephews & nieces who have birthdays in Oct & Nov on Amazon.com because I can 1 stop shop & can get gifts to them in time for their day since I live in NY & they live in Hawaii can be a challenge. Saw an ad for Amazon gift card promo buy $50 get $15 and thought yippee even better than 1 stop shopping. I wanted purchase and try for myself to be sure it would be a great gift and easy for them to use as well. So I purchased $25(2x) =$50 for myself to see how the process works & was pleased to see a great selection choices for those birthdays coming in couple days I could send them E Cards & for those I have time to mail actual wrapped cards. Then I was happy to receive via a statement by Amazon that I did qualify for the $15 gift with my $25(2x) =$50 purchase and that I would receive that in an email in couple days. Awesome! Once I receive notice of the 2 eCard I began to purchase things for my pup since it's her birthday too. But I had to call customer service to activate because at the time of purchase I had gotten the message my gift card was invalid. Doable fix with great customer service but not what you want to put a teen thru for a gift. But was thinking not a bad thing if your getting $15 promo in addition. Big disappointment is 5 days after purchase I hadn't receive the $15 gift promo email so today after time consuming research I find that I was not eligible for promotion after all even though receiving notice of qualifying on day of purchase. Disappointed! But glad I didn't purchase $100s worth of gift cards right away and went through the process to see what the teens could expect. 5 days did put me behind and with the sour taste am now opting to mail them cash in a card. Which I know they'll be happy too! Now off to the store & post office (it's really not that difficult).,1.0

This keeps happening. 25 bucks is 25 bucks and a 100 bucks is a 100 bucks. Dont be ripped off. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON. Im filling with better business after posting this.

"Compare the ease of use, Amazon vs. iTunes Gift Cards. The security feature of AMAZON gift cards is clearly inferior and very difficult to use.

I had received several of each (Amazon and iTunes) for Christmas gifts. The GIVER would not be aware of this problem; only the RECEIVER is inconvenienced by AMAZON gift cards security feature. Carefully scraping off the covering ""SCRATCH OFF GENTLY WITH A COIN FOR CLAIM CODE"" on the Amazon gift card often results in defacing the tiny superficial printing of the code, making the gift card UNUSABLE, since the code is unreadable.

Amazon, please fix this, you should have usability as good as or better than iTunes Gift Cards.

VERY DISAPPOINTED in AMAZON due to the poor design of this security feature.  I would not buy AMAZON Gift Cards unless this feature works better.

1. Compare with iTunes gift card, use of AMAZON gift cards is very messy. There is a lot of sticky, messy, waxy stuff resulting from the scraping, and after scraping the characters may be illegible, some completely unreadable.

2. The printing under the AMAZON security feature is tiny and often rubs off when trying to expose the code. This renders the card USELESS.

3. Be sure to use a coin with a blunt edge, not a pocket knife which will deface the printed code.",1.0

The gift cards were not delivered on Friday; I received notice from Amazon they were delayed. Then on Monday morning, one was delivered, but not the other. I don't know when the other card will be delivered.
Then I went to look at other reviews and see that the bow on the box that appears to be gold is actually Halloween orange. So the box for the snow globe gift card looks like a Halloween box. That's embarrassing.
So Amazon delayed delivery (by days) of what should be the simplest thing to get out on time -- and did not deliver both at the same time. In addition, now I find out the Amazon holiday gift box looks like a Halloween decoration.",1.0

As a follow up: Amazon customer service was able to confirm that all but $4 of the gift certificate had been redeemed by a third party whose name was unknown to either of us (i.e., the thief?).

That proved false as the users were denied again.  The final solution was a refund and purchase of new cards.",1.0

It was if Satan himself chose the gift------and there is NO EXCUSE for this type of behavior.  Clearly the efforts of someone who does not beieve in Christmas or has no concern for how the company or the gift giver is perceived.  Horrible...and we'll never trust AMAZON again.  It may sound silly to some....but we do care about what our recipient thinks of us releavnt to a $100 gift.

"I accidently discovered my gift card that I received from my grown daughter during last Christmas (almost 6 months ago), buried under a pile of papers on my disorganized desk. Wow! I actually forgot I had received this, and my wife had forgotten about it too. Fantastic! Let's use it. Yes, you guessed it, --- the card was not valid. Yet, neither one of us used it; it was still in the gift box. Based on reviews I read regarding how a large number of other people had also received invalid gift cards during the holiday season too, it appears to me that Amazon has a real security issue (or trust problem) with some of their employees or agents, especially when a high percentage of gift card recipients are reporting that their gift cards are invalid too. I received this gift card from my daughter who  lives across the country and I'm not going to bother her about this, --- it was the thought that counted, right. Anyway, I refuse to waste my life away spending days on the phone (as many others have reported) trying to argue my case. Nevertheless, based on what I've read from others thus far, I can assure you that our family will never purchase Amazon gift cards again, -- NEVER!

I told her the email I received simply states must be used by June 28, 2015. This simply means I have from now until June 28, 2015 to use it.

She kept on fighting with me verbally, kept asking have I read the promotional offer, did I read the words must be used.

I really am shocked why did she define her own promotional offer.

I'm going to tell my son to bring his right over to the post office window and open it then and there (since it sounds as if it will be after Christmas anyway), so we can claim through insurance if it's empty.",1.0

"This is literally the worst experience I've had with Amazon. I wanted to include a gift card along with a book, unfortunately you can't select that option. In fact, it's impossible to give a personal gift with a gift card at the same time. If I want to do that, I have to buy the book, have it shipped to me, buy the gift card at the grocery store, repackage everything and mail it to the recipient. WHAT?

I cannot believe I'm the only one with this use case. I contacted customer service and they confirmed that what I'm trying to do is impossible, however they could not speak to why. I'm just stunned with the stupidity of the process.

Fortunately there are plenty of places in my town to buy books and also envelopes with cash.",1.0
"Amazon shipment of gift cards does not require recipient signature.  Somewhere between it being scanned on the UPS truck and when UPS said the driver scanned the item as ""delivered"", it disappeared! Just saying, there's a lot of room for funny business here.  Are people inside UPS scanning items as ""delivered"" and pocketing them? In this case the ""recipient"" was waiting for delivery. Never saw UPS Truck or Driver, but all UPS will say is that the driver had to scan the item off the truck once delivered. No signature required? The Amazon ordering process does not offer the opportunity to request it be signed for.  According to UPS, only the ""shipper"" has the option to request a confirmation sig upon delivery and Amazon does not do that.  UPS says they are aware of their trucks being targeted and followed. A delivery is left on a porch and before the truck is gone, someone pilfers the package. The fact that they even told me that and don't mandate a recipient signature tells me that they don't have any concern for the customer. They stand by their driver, driver says it was left on a porch, then it was left on a porch. I was told that if I think it was stolen to file a police report. It took 3 calls to Amazon customer service but I found out that the ""delivered"" card had been redeemed by someone named ""Barbara"" who made a purchase thru her Amazon account. Call was escalated twice before I got the ear of a supervisor who took me seriously and attached a ""fraud"" alert to ""Barbara's"" account in that my stolen gift card was spent by her.  The matter is now in the hands of Amazon fraud dept.  YOU MUST READ THE GIFT CARD DISCLAIMER THAT AMAZON HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR GIFT CARDS LOST or STOLEN AFTER DELIVERY IS CONFIRMED.  Considering that no one has to sign as recipient, ""confirmed delivery"" is subjective. I am very appreciative that  Amazon tells me they will refund my gift card purchase and make me whole.  I will be visiting the police dept tomorrow to file that report.  You will NEVER catch me ordering a gift card on line for third party delivery ever again.",1.0

"Amazon statesGift Cards are the perfect way to give them exactly what they're hoping for--even if you don't know what it is. Recipients can choose from millions of items storewide. Amazon.com Gift Cards never expire, so they can buy something immediately or wait for that sale of a lifetime. I bought a gift card and my daughter wanted to get the Prime Membership.  Unfortunately she CAN NOT USE A GIFT CARD to purchase a membership!!!  I feel this is a rip off.  When I buy a gift card I expect it to be used on an item the recipient wants and don't feel I should research every item Amazon offers to see if they accept gift cards.  Gift cards are PAID FOR therefore why can't you use them the way they are intended.  If Amazon can't change their policies I'll NEVER EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER GIFT CARD FROM THEM.

"I ordered this gift card for my sister's birthday, which was Nov. 2. Since I was late to do any other thing for her birthday coming up in just 2 days, I was excited to see gift card with 'free one-day delivery', which turned out to be completely misleading.

When I was checking it out, it only gave me 2 options for shipping. one with 3-5 days, and one with two-days. There was no one-day as sparkled in the previous page! This is the first flaw. Without any other option, thou, I had to choose two-day, thinking it might make it in 2 days if they ship out right away. Wrong again!

The next day, I check the order status, it says it was being prepared to ship out.. meaning not shipped yet.. after 24 hours I placed an order.. Big second flaw. I chatted with Amazon to see if they could explain and help me. Guess what. Nothing they could do.. a response that I did not expected from Amazon.

Reason #1. ""free one-day delivery"" might have been a temporary promotion that they could not keep track of... which make no sense. They don't keep track of promotion???

Reason #2. ""Since the card had been loaded in the truck already, they could not do anything about it""..., which I interpreted as the order was sent to their vendor, and the vendor was taking time to actually ship out the card. Answers made no sense. Big third flaw.

Anyhow, I suggest the rep. that this misleading banner of ""Free One-day delivery"" should be removed, which I doubt she would. I wonder if they are out-sourcing customer service.

"I am a long time prime member with Amazon.  I do almost all of my Holiday shopping and the greater part of my regular shopping through Amazon.  Last month I received a email gift card from my brother for my birthday. When I attempted to apply the gift card to my account, Amazon advised me that it had already been redeemed.  I reviewed all my recent purchases and confirmed that I had not redeemed the card.  I attempted to resolve the issue with Amazon but was told that I needed to have the purchaser contact Amazon to resolve the issue.  They would not tell me who or how the gift card was spent.  My brother argued with Amazon for three days in order to resolve the problem and was ultimately told that he would have to dispute the purchase through his bank.  They told him that they could not confirm who spent the gift card or what purchases were made.  Both my brother and I are beyond upset.  Amazon is a HUGE company who certainly has the resources to resolve the problem with better customer service.  Lesson learned - we won't ever buy a gift card from them again.  Ultimately Amazon is the one who will miss out.  Moral of the story is be very careful when purchasing a gift card from them and don't assume that they will look into a ""fraud/theft"" and do the right thing for the customer.",1.0

"Dear Commander in Chief of consumer opinion--
How does one evaluate a gift card?
Do you give it one star if the card is for a store or service that does not exist?
Do you give it 5 stars if, for some magical reason, you can use the card over and over and the card balance remains the same?
Do you give it 4 stars if the artwork on the card is not historically correct?
Do you give it 3 stars if the card is the size of a Kindle and does not fit into your wallet?
I fear that you have taken the art and science of ""customer feedback"" too far.

It certainly made me fell bad.  She had to give me access to her Gift Card to buy other things for myself and I had to buy her the books separately and posted them to her much cheaper than Amazon said they could!

Poor poor poor!  This was an embarrassment to me Amazon.",1.0

"I'm not sure if i messed it up or not, I could have sworn I did (the cropping) right, but the recipient (my mother in law) of this card, while very happy about it, said the picture did not show me at all. It was supposed to be a picture of me holding my grandson. The only thing in view was him, which I guess is how it should be anyway, but she said I was completely cut out of the picture. Other than that tho I think it's pretty cool to be able to upload a photo and make a gift card unique. That being said, if it doesn't arrive how the sender thinks its going to it then somewhat defeats the purpose. I dunno, maybe I did something wrong.",1.0

Terrible!  My son NEVER GOT HIS GIFT CARD!!!,1.0
"If you are in America, these cards are great - can be used to make any purchase, personalised and handy. If you are in Australia, (or lots of other parts of the world) they are a frustrating trap. You can still buy and use a gift card to order something to be sent through the mail, but not to purchase ebooks, which are the most popular items wanted by those I have gifted. You see, the credit goes to Amazon.com, not Amazon.com.au, which apparently operates as a seperate entity. The Conditions of Use, in microscopic print, list some Amazon sites as not being available for Gift Card use, but not Australia, even if you have managed to locate that section. My address is in Australia, my account is connected to an Australian bank account, so it is obvious where I am from, so why isn't there a clear warning that flashes up to check that I am aware that I can't use the card here? Havng said all that, the help desk got back to us quickly, and after some fairly vigorous discussion, did refund the cash.",1.0

Was VERY disappointed with the card.  I spent a long time choosing a special picture to use.  Chose a picture of us with our son the day he was born.

"I ordered for Canada by logging onto Amazon.ca but the site deferred me to .com then would not ship the items to Canada. In Canada, Amazon asked me to repurchase the gift card and they would credit the initial order. The .com person turned out to be unhelpful on the phone, promised to call back and did not.

Adding to my disappointment was that Amazon made an offer that I would receive a $10 gift certificate/coupon, by March 10 - roughly 2 weeks, after my purchase. It is now March 21, and I have not received any gift certificate/coupon from Amazon. I looked around on the website for how to contact them about this, but I could not find a link.

"I purchased the ecard opposed to an Amazon gift card after reading all the terrible reviews about people receiving Amazon gift cards with no money applied to them.  I sent it 2 days before my son's birthday.  I checked my account and it said the ecard had been SENT!  A week and a half later, I had to ask my son if he received his ecard from Amazon.  He said he had NOT!  I was furious because I sent it early enough for him to have received it by his birthday and my account said it had been sent.  I went online and clicked on the link that said someone from Amazon will call you.  The phone rang and I spoke with a representative.  She said that the reason it had not been sent was because I had to give them the email address that my son uses for his Amazon account.  I told her that it made no sense.  Why would it matter what email address I gave for the recipient.  When does a recipient of an ecard have to have an account with the business?  She said she would resend it to the same address I gave, but she didn't think it would work.  Does Amazon even train their help?  I called my son again and viola, he said he had just received it.  If I hadn't called my son to ask if he received his gift, Amazon would have gotten away with charging my credit card which was charged for the ecard at the original time I ordered this ecard.  When the whole situation was over, I was asked to rate the representative.  I checked one star and all of a sudden five stars brighted up as though I had rated the representative as excellent.  Such a huge disappointment.  I thought it would have been great to purchase these......NEVER AGAIN!!!",1.0

"What year is this??  Amazon gift cards offers the (very cute) feature of uploading your own photos but then doesn't support files larger than 7MB?

10 or larger MB is the standard smartphone photo size now.

I've tried for 15 minutes to find a software program or app that will compress my file size so I can upload a picture, but can't find one.  FRUSTRATING.

But, the worst part of my experience trying to purchase a gift card was Amazon's error message was misleading.  The error messages I received were either that my file type wasn't supported (even though I'm uploading .jpg files) and THEY ARE SUPPORTED or that it just didn't work.  I didn't receive the appropriate error message that I was uploading a file size that was too large until about my 20th attempt.

Please fix this bug.  Immediately Amazon should improve their error messages such that when you attempt to upload a file that is 10 MB or larger you receive a message that you are uploading a file too large.  This happened when I uploaded a 9MB file, but not a 10 or 11 MB file?!!?

Amazon screwed up last year when the removed the functionality allowing me to send my grandkids and others an Amazon gift card to their facebook page.  I was never able to obtain an answer as to why that was taken away.  All that is left for placement on FB is a group card with less flexibility on the amount of the card.,1.0

I have bought both books and tools from you guys and like the format. But if this is how you follow through, I won't be spending anymore money at Amazon. There are plenty of other sites that I feel confidant this won't happen on.",1.0

All went well until he received notice and tried to retrieve it. Mind you, I was charged as if I had purchased an item for delivery.

No warning before hand, nothing.
I called Amazon and they explained that there was nothing they could do.
I had to go through the entire process of return and get credit..

Christmas gift. I had to order this card multiple times to get it right. Two of the times it was that my grandaughter forgot the passwords for the email accounts she gave me.

A woman named Judy worked in Mr. Cavanaugh's offices many years ago. She was the most difficult and mean person I have ever encountered. It was probably when that restaurant was starting to go gangbusters and that was the reason she was so unreasonable. Pure pompousness (is that a word?) I would never go to that restaurant nor buy any of that stock on the NYSE.,1.0
"Think twice, their food is not the same quality it was a few years back. I used to love thier burgers, but they changed them without changing the menu, thats wrong. MacDonalds makes a bigger burger, and yes,even though they changed some of their burgers, they changed their menu and burger options to reflect this change. I know many in the food industry have decreased their portion sizes,but did so without interfering with the quality.  TGIF didn't change their menus, but changed their food venues as well as quality, the menu reads the same but the food is very different.

Sorry,  but this is how I feel, very disappointed.",1.0

"I interpret a review of a gift card to actually be about the restaurant or establishment the gift card is issued from. The basis for my one star rating is contrived from repeated poor experiences at TGIF restaurants. My experience with their food has been abysmal. The sandwiches are meager, made with old and dry bread. The entrees are made from the cheapest ingredients that appear to be pre-made in mass produced corporate kitchens, frozen, and then reheated (microwave) to serving temperature and garnished with ""fresh"" finishing.
If only people would try the local mom and pop restaurants in their neighborhoods. They would find out that going out to eat is an experience, not a convenience of the lazy or time strapped. Also, eating at a local restaurant keeps your money and taxes local.
20 bucks for lousy food is never a good deal.",1.0

"Received a $50 Applebee's gift card as a Christmas present.  When I tried to use it by swiping it at an Applebees restaurant was informed by the machine that the ""Card is Expired"" -- only problem is, according to Applebee's FAQ the cards NEVER expire.  So what's with this message.  When attempting to enter the Card#, after getting home, on their Card checking webpage -- the card# wasn't recognized.  Then, after going to the trouble to track down their customer service # and giving them a call (the 800# on the card was ONLY for checking card balances), found that the card had a $50 balance and no declined transactions.

So, I guess, NOW I can return to an Applebees restaurant and have them enter the card manually into their system.  And then call their customer service whenever I wish to check the balance.

Safe yourself some grief -- pass on this card!  Get American Express instead, more flexible and works better!",1.0

3.  the sat I order the Starbucks card also order another item from amazon and it was received immediately on Monday

Amazon is too good of a company to put up with second rate suppliers . . .  .I hope!

if not - - - at least be honest with your customers with a notice on their front page of what the deal really is- - - - -easier to buy card at Starbucks or wherever and send it than put up with this . . .",1.0
"This came to me with a zero balance. I contacted amazon numerous times. They know who used this card, where the items went, and email address associated with the theft of this card and they have done nothing. I am out 500.00 and Amazon blew me off and told me oh well.",1.0

What a racket. 500 in the trash. I get 5,000 in gift cards every year. No more for Amazon. I'll take my money else where.",1.0

Amazon actually billed both the gift card and and her credit card. She paid twice for each book. When I cslled amazon the representative told me it was impossible. I ended up having to go threw her credit card company to get her. money back. Some gift. I won't be buying another!,1.0

"For a hundred dollar gift card, the graphic and animated options offered by Amazon, are less than satisfactory. could not personalise, and it ends up being what it is: Money, not a gift. You should at least offer through cheap, beautiful cards, the illusion of a gift. Picture options, take time. And usually, if you give a gift card, is because you could not find the time to purchase it yourself.
No Comm Strategy Amazon!!!",1.0

"I previously wrote a 5 star review of my experiences with Amazon gift cards.  That changed tonight.
As I have done for many years, I ordered a number of print-your-own Amazon gift cards for my office staff for our party the next day.  The web site says an email will be sent withing 15 minutes to print myself.  After 2 hours I contacted customer service to see what the problem was, since the status showed the order was ""awaiting authorization"".  The agent was polite, but couldn't tell me what the problem was. He had me contact my credit cared company while he was on the phone, who told me that Amazon had not requested any transaction. He finally got a supervisor, who told me the billing department was awaiting ""manual review"" of the order because it totaled over $500, and she would send a request.  She was not able to let me speak to them, not able to speak with them herself, not able to let me speak with another supervisor, not able to tell me what ""manual review"" meant if it had not even been submitted to the credit card company,and was not able to resolve the problem. She offered to call me within 4 hours (at 2AM!!!) or offered to let me continue to monitor my email for the next 6 hours to see if it was approved, none of which was acceptable to me. Apparently my staff will be receiving apologies rather than Amazon gift cards from me at the office party. I will not be doing this again.",1.0
"I requested the gift card on 10/14/ 2013 for a 10/15/2013 delivery. It was not delivered for over a week after the recipient asked for a search.

"This is the second time the person receiving a gift card I purchased had to call customer service to use it. They received the gift card e-mail, that's great.

I was embarrassed.",1.0

Then when they did it said zero balance.  After I sent the card, I began to buy some music (MP3). I noticed that I was not asked for my credit card as usual. I am thinking that maybe the puchase went through the gift card. How could this happen?

It is truly amazing that in this day and age and with Euros only around for the past 20+ years Amazon is unable to allow a US purchaser to buy a gift card for a friend who happens to live in Europe.

I would assume someone at amazon either stole the card and used it or gave it to another person to use or they simply sent my card to the wrong person, and they used it. Which ever version happened it is Amazons wrong doing and they must correct their problem. I want a new card sent to my daughter.",1.0

"Last April TurboTax offered me the option of sending my $4500 refund to Amazon and I accepted the offer, not only because of the nice bonus, but it would give me a nice pot of money to place many orders with Amazon.  I have placed many orders but I have been extremely disappointed in your policy of not letting me purchase gift cards with my tax refund.  The main reason I sent you my tax refund was so I could purchase many gift cards for my relatives, friends, and neighbors.  I can understand not letting someone use a gift card that someone has given them to purchase a gift card for someone else but my gift card is not something someone has given me; IT IS MY OWN MONEY which I authorized the IRS to send to Amazon.  I think you should have a  different category for peoples own money and allow them to buy gift cards.  If I had been allowed to buy gift cards with my tax refund money, I would have introduced Amazon to at least 20 new customers this year; I know that is not many but I bet I am not the only one who sent you their tax refund.  I cannot give gift cards more than one star until you allow your customers to buy gift cards with their own money which they have already sent to Amazon.",1.0

"I normally like cute little tins like this. They can be used for storage of buttons, screws, tacks, coins, etc. But this one is not just a top and bottom with a removable gift card holder. The bottom has a rectangular slot cut out with a plastic window sloppily glued in so the barcode on the gift card can be scanned. This, in my opinion, ruins the uniqueness of the tin and once the plastic (easily) breaks out, it's not an effective storage tin.

Thus it becomes trash and adds - at least a little - to some landfill. If you're going to give a gift card, of course do it. But perhaps think about the residue that will be left behind once the gift card is used. Is it any less thoughtful to send an e-gift-card code? Virtually no waste involved with that method. :-)",1.0
"Here is where the problem started.... I purchased this gift card because of the promotion for the Father's day which said that Promo runs through June 15, 2014.

I called Amazon and everyone on the phone was tossing me back and forth asking me where I saw that promotion... I even said that on the day of my purchase I had a phone conversation with the lady from Amazon if I purchase 2 gift cards May I receive 2 promotional gift cards? She said, NO, IT IS ONLY FOR ONE CARD....I said, that is fine and I purchased the card. Well, one promotion of $10 is something, right?
As I figure out today, there is no promotion for this promotion. If you are want to get a promotion from them, record the conversation prior purchase and let them know about it. Very bad service in regards of this specific order...",1.0

No dice.

The card was not here, and tomorrow is Sunday (6/30), so I have to hope against all hope that the card arrives 7/1... ON HIS BIRTHDAY.  As it states it is already shipped and somewhere in my area, I really can't stop it and get him an e-card.

"Amazon.com gift card was a gift request. I am extremely disappointed! This product should be easy to use. I.e. find desired product/s, add to cart, checkout like you would with a credit/debit card, confirm purchase and wait for selected products to arrive by estimated delivery date/s. This gift card was not that easy or convenient to use. You cannot go over the gift card amount and pay remaining amount with credit/debit card. This increases the likelihood of not being able to use the full amount on the gift card. When the gift card recipient attempted to use the remaining amount on the gift card after having made a previous purchase ($100.00 gift card. 1st purchase $30.00. $70.00 remaining on card.) Amazon.com stated, ""This gift card has already been redeemed."" This is not accurate. ($70.00 still remains on the gift card to be used for purchases) I am embarrassed that the gift ended up being so difficult to use...almost to the point of being a burden. I will not ever opt to give an Amazon.com gift card again. I am reluctant to continue making purchases from Amazon.com after finding out that they use unscrupulous business practices such as the scenario I have described the gift card recipient experiencing. I hope this review allows others to make a more informed decision before purchasing items or gift cards from Amazon.com /to be used at Amazon.com. Ultimately ;BUYER BEWARE, read policies/restrictions, read the details of the purchase agreement and consider other methods of gift giving. Thank you for taking the time to read this review!",1.0

Finally, after they told me about the issue, I stepped in and Amazon acknowledged that the code was not working and asked if I wanted a replacement card or a refund.  Since I don't trust them with a replacement card, I asked for a refund which they said was fine and told me it went through.  I asked them to send me a confirmation email which they said they had done.  I told them it hadn't come in, and they said they would send it again.

"Don't even take the chance ordering this, Amazon has an employee theft problem. The claim code is encoded in a QR code on the back of the gift card. An employee has to open the box, snap a picture and then steal the code at their leisure. Then you get to deal with the nightmare that is Amazon customer service.

If you have to get a gift card just order the claim number by email. It's not worth the hassle of dealing with a used card code.",1.0

I was disappointed that my message was not in the gift box.  So glad I opened it to check.  I ordered two $50 gift card with boxes.  Both had no messages in them.  The message were on my receipt.

"I have always had great luck with Amazon gift cards via email, so I assumed a physical gift card would be just as great.  I was wrong.

I ordered this gift card as a Christmas present for my sister.  I purchased it on Amazon.com and had it shipped directly to her.  Next day shipping was perfect given that I waited until the last minute to do Christmas shopping, but that's where the good part of this card ended.  When my sister tried to enter the claim code on the card, she got an error message saying there was something wrong with the claim code.  She emailed customer service and the response she got was that she needed to have the sender (me) contact the store I bought the card from to have it activated.  Let me remind you that I purchased this card on Amazon.com.

So I got in touch with customer service via the online chat option and was told that my issue would have to be elevated to the gift card team and that the card could be activated in 24 to 48 hours.  I told the customer service rep that this was not an acceptable option.  Then the customer service rep said he'd see what he could do... and came back with the response that I need to go to the store I bought the card from and have make sure the store activates it.  Let me remind you yet again that I bought this card from Amazon.com.

Then I gave the customer service rep the card's claim code and the Amazon.com order number.  The next response I got was that the gift card's claim code did not match up with what was listed for the order number.  Ugh.  At this point the customer service rep suggested handing this off to the gift card team, which I agreed to.  A few hours later I got an email saying that my credit card would be refunded for this purchase.  I never asked for a refund... just wanted to get the gift card working, but in a round about way it did solve my problem because I then went ahead and bought an email gift certificate and that worked perfectly.

After this experience with the card not working and the repeated suggestion from customer service to go to the store I purchased the card from and have them activate it, when I did in fact buy it on Amazon.com, I would definitely steer away from the physical gift card and go for the email version instead.",1.0

I truly believe this is not only bad business but a misleading sales practice meant to secure your money in their hands with no idea they can deliver as promised.  Be interested if the state AG has had complaints regarding this, to me it was a scam from the get go.

But when I tried to add the balance into my account, I found that the claim code is locked. Then I have to spend time making calls and scan the information for them to make these two cards work. After that I didn't get any response from them.

Few days later, when I check my GC balance, I found out that all my other GCs are added into my account as well without my autherization.(I ordered 15 of them with different designs, the above two problem GC belongs to the order) At this point, I have given a GC to my friends already. But now, they are holding an invalid GC and I have to call them to ask about their account information to transfer the balance back to them. The calls take hours of time.

So what is amazon doing. First send the wrong item twice then the GC doesn't work. Finally, add my own GC to my account without my authorization!!!!!!!!!!!!  And take me hours of time!!!!!!!!",1.0

"This ""box"" is actually a TIN - and if it had not arrived damaged, it would have been a great gift!

I called Amazon to report the damage, and the first person I spoke to was going to cancel the gift card, as she said that Amazon could not ship just the replacement tin.  I told her that I would just go get (at my own time and expense) another gift card holder from our local Target store.

The next day, I get an email so convoluted and strange that I call back to Amazon customer service, and talk to another lady.  She says, don't worry - even though it said in the email that we are canceling the gift card, we aren't, and there is no problem, and for your trouble I have given you a little credit on your Amazon account.  OK, thanks, Amazon.  That was nice.

On Christmas day, the person who received the card tried to use it at Amazon.com, and - yep - Amazon had canceled the card.  I checked my credit card online, and sure enough - there is a pending credit for the amount of the gift card from Amazon.

So, now I have someone who has been given a gift card, only to find out that it was canceled, which leaves a bad taste in both his mouth and mine.

UPS notified me on Dec 24th that the gift card will not be delivered till December 26, the day after Christmas. What's the point of making a promise that they could not keep.

It was more than just an inconvenience for us. We were buying this gift card for my son's best friend as his Christmas present. We didn't choose the electronic gift card because we thought we could present him a nice little gift box. It turned out to be an embarrassment for us on the Christmas eve.

I have received emails from both Amazon and UPS regarding the late delivery. They were pointing fingers at each other. UPS said Amazon did not make it in time for pick up. Amazon said UPS had a break down on their transportation network. Amazon did apologize in a separate email and offered compensation. However there was no apology from UPS.

It doesn't matter now. The fact was it's late and Amazon/UPS have failed. The lesson learned here is that if timing is important then go with electronic gift card.",1.0

"Ordered this gift card/box and it was never delivered. Contacted Amazon and discovered that UPS had lost the gift card in transit and then the card was used by someone else.  While Amazon refunded the full amount of the purchase back to me, I would be hesitant to repurchase. I've read many other reviews that have had the same or similar issues with these gift cards being used already. I think it would be much safer to purchase in a store.  In all, I'd give Amazon a 5 star rating for their customer service on this issue, but the lack of security in purchasing this item ultimately gives the rating a single star.

"2013 - December - Ordered 3 Santa design gift cards.  Only one box was undamaged.  Another was dented, and the third was very dented as well as scrapes.  Come on Amazon, this is what we're supposed to hand out to our gift recipients?

2012: I was very pleased and rated 4 stars.  I bought eight (variety, not all the same) of these gift cards/boxes at the same time and we love every one of them.  After reading all the reviews about stolen numbers I was concerned.  However, all these came in one box so maybe they were not recognized as being gift cards.  We didn't have any problems and every one of the tin boxes were exclaimed over.  Too bad the bottom of the tin has a cutout (so Amazon can activate the card easily), because it makes it unusable for storing anything.  Thus one star off on the rating.  And the tin with the orange ribbon - that's a real ribbon, giving an elegant touch, but yes, it looks Halloween-ish, but that's Amazon's colors.",1.0
"NO gift card was inside and Amazon basically said  "" TOO Bad "" After numerous phone calls and a lot of yelling they finally credited my account for the gift I DID NOT RECIEVE .

"This was supposed to be a Christmas gift going to an APO in Germany.  It was purchased on 12/21; the recipient received it 1/15.  When recipient tried to use the gift card on 1/27, she got an error message that the card had been canceled.  I called Amazon to resolve.  Amazon told me there had been a scanning error, and that the only solution was to resend the gift card BY MAIL!  Keep in mind that the recipient was trying to place an order at the time, so if I chose this, she would have to wait ANOTHER 3 weeks to do so by the time the second card arrived.  Since this was not an acceptable solution, I asked to be transferred to a supervisor.

Supervisor tells me the exact same ""solution"".  Every sentence was prefaced with, ""I humbly apologize...""  Humble apologies don't fix mistakes made by YOUR company, Amazon!!  Please tell me how in an age where everything is digital, my money that you have had since Dec. 21 can't be transferred to the gift recipient via email, Facebook gift card, or directly into her Amazon account!!!  But no, you can't do that because it doesn't agree with your accounting policies???  All of this was topped off by Mr. Humble Apology interrupting me every time I tried to speak.  SHUT YOUR MOUTH and LISTEN to the customer you are about to LOSE, Mr. Humble Apology!!

The only other option I was given was to let them refund my money, go online and re-order a gift card to be sent by email.  When I asked how long it would take for the refund to process, I was told that it would be up to 48 hours, but they would try to do it at THEIR earliest convenience.  Why should I have an additional $50 tied up of MY money to fix Amazon's mistake while I wait for their ""earliest convenience""???

End result?  I asked for a refund and will NOT be purchasing another gift card from Amazon AT ALL!  Thanks for being SO supportive of your APO customers serving overseas, Amazon!!  What an unbelievable display of POOR customer service!!!",1.0
"I clicked a link on the home page titled ""Amazon.com Gift Card - $50"". The product description page says ""Choose your amount from $50 to $150."" However, the only choices are between $150 and $1000. Where is the $50 denomination?",1.0
"Unaccustomed to giving gift cards, I happened to spot this advertised.  Though I did not like all the negative reviews about the packaging, I figured it was an in house gift so decided to continue pursuit.  Wanting to order a $100 version, I only saw versions to click on for $50 and $150.  Upon clicking on the $50, planning to order two, I saw that you could select other denominations.  As customary with my purchasing habits, I like to think things over a bit, so decided to have my breakfast and return.  After deciding to go ahead with the order, I went back to the gift card page, and selected this particular boxed display, and the denominations began at $150.  I made other attempts for about 10 minutes, all failing to provide the $100 option, and found the $50 links still led to the $150 minimum.  Next I tried to find how I could call Amazon and speak to a live person or a live chat, and though they do not make the process easy to find or execute, I did find I could provide them with my phone number and they would call me back.  That happened pretty quickly, but the voice connection was poor, and the operator that called was not exactly a genius.  It took forever for her to determine exactly what I was getting at, and eventually it took me about 5 minutes to provide her with the item's ID number and confirm its' accuracy through repeated dialog.  Finally it turned out she could not find a way for me to purchase a $100 denomination, and proceeded to suggest how I could purchase other denominations at $150 and above or I could purchase one of the many other options they have.  She did agree and comment on how nice the Santa display was, but insisted on suggesting other alternatives.  I declined other suggestions, and convinced her I had other local options that I could pick up with a short, local drive.

It still puzzles me how they could not provide that denomination at 10 am  but not 11 am, but still provide other denominations.  The free one day shipping is for today only, so I will check back later and see if they have fixed the problem or at least note a problem with lower denominations.  Annoyed!!!",1.0

First time, we had a portion of our Federal tax refund placed on an Amazon card as per an Amazon promotion.  Tried to use our money, our refund, to purchase a gift card for our son (same card as above). Told our refund was considered by Amazon to be a gift and we could not purchase a gift card with it. Again, no disclosure of that limitation.  What irks the most is that our income was considered by Amazon a ""gift"". Tried talking with customer support for nearly two hours.  Pleasant people but otherwise useless.

"This is nothing against the card itself, just the White Gift Box. I ordered this as a gift, and chose the White Gift Box package as it would be nice presentation.

I now have to purchase a separate box to hold the gift card.",1.0
"I received a plastic gift card packed in a lovely box. When I tried to redeem it - I removed the silver sticker from it, and half of the claim code remains on a sticker, while it is absolutely not readable.
Spent more than 1 hour on the phone and chat with customer support - they needed to escalate it to ""gift card escalation team"". Now it is the second day, and I receive emails from different CSRs asking to send a scan of the card (while it was sent to amazon before).
Such a headache... it becomes easier to dump this gift card to a trash than talking for hours with numerous customer support representatives.

Bottom line: skip this piece of plastic - use print-at-home version.",1.0
I bought a 200.00 gift card for my fiance. When he tried to use it it wouldn't go through. When he contacted amazon customer service they told him it wasn't in the system. Luckily they were able to track the order from my account. It irritated me. There should be no problems with a gift card!,1.0

"I ordered two gift cards; each with a balance of $50 each. One was a birthday gift card in the cupcake tin and the other was in a plain white box with purple bow. I received an email from Amazon saying that there was a problem with the gift cards and new ones were issued. They gave me the last four digits of the ""bad"" ones however neither one had the four digits on then nor the new ones so I had no clue as to which was good or bad! I ended up giving both cupcake gift cards and had to explain the issue. I replaced the other with a different Amazon gift card. I tried to check the balance on the one I kept and the only was was to scratch off the ""claim code"".....I now have a gift card balance on my Amazon account. There should have been an easier way to check the balance without scratching the code or just giving the two gift cards so that they could do it.",1.0

"Unfortunately, the lovely gift card that I was sending to our future granddaughter in law for her bridal shower was not in a gift card box nor gift wrapped as I had requested and was charged for. These little extras that Amazon offers or so nice for us long distance gift givers.  Too bad someone did not do their job correctly.  I have worked in gift wrap at Amazon and know how important it is to Amazon to fill the order correctly.  After reading the reviews others have had similar complaints.",1.0

"The item is exactly what I had hoped it would be. A gift card in a nice box. However, it also stated 1 day free shipping. I needed my package to arrive the next day, it did not. I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known it wouldn't arrive on time. Two day shipping is OK if it is occasionally 3 day shipping. 1 day shipping needs to be 1 DAY SHIPPING!!!!

In short if you need a gift card and want in a pretty box I give this 4-5 stars.
If you need a last minute gift don't order this. A great gift in the mail isn't a great gift... rated 1 star.

FYI: Amazon does not guarantee 1 day shipping so their is no recourse if your package arrives late",1.0

"Well, here's my second attempt at reviewing this product since Amazon wouldn't post my first one-star review for these dirty white boxes for some unknown reason.

The other reviews are correct. The white boxes arrive dirty and scuffed and unsuitable for gift giving. When giving a gift, you want the product to look nice and classy.  Glue, dirt, and random goop on the gift box make it embarrassing to give this as a gift.",1.0
"The case came dirty.  Can be cleaned with Alcohol, however.  Be cautious if you want to send someone directly as a gift!",1.0
"This is the last time I purchase another gift card from Amazon.  Their fulfillment center is a bunch of crack smoking idiots who don't give a hoot about quality.  In this attempt, the gift box arrived looking like it had been used as a hockey puck across the warehouse floor.  It is dirty, disgusted, dented, scratched mess.  The box itself appears to have come from a pristine white to a faded, been sitting on the shelf for 10 years look.  Certainly not going to present this box as a part of the gift so it's off to the store to buy a new gift box AGAIN!

And I say again because I had a similar issue over Christmas with another gift card and after 3 attempts and a month of running around with customer service, I finally gave up getting the right product shipped to me in the right box.  I'm telling you, Amazon needs to get a handle on this cause this fulfillment center is not living up to Amazon standards.  Trust me, go to the local super market and buy the cards there along with the appropriate gift box.  At least you can control the quality of your gift at that point.",1.0
"I ordered this on Dec 30th thinking it'll arrive in a day's time. Maybe due to new year or otherwise I am not sure, the package came in on the 2nd of Jan instead of 31st Dec. I had to print out a gift card since we needed it on Jan 1st.
Moreover the tracking was never properly updated. It kept saying it would arrive on Dec 31st even on Jan 1st. This is also non-returnable which means I better keep track of it and spend it myself. Overall very frustrating experience. I would recommend just printing gift cards or getting one from the grocery store, at least you are guaranteed to have it.",1.0
"The gift card itself is fine, but like other reviewers, the box arrived smudged and dirty. It was even dirty under the little stickers at the ends, making it really look used.  I used a magic eraser and was able to clean it up a bit, but overall I am completely disappointed in the quality.",1.0
"Gift box was dirty and crushed inside. Impossible to give as a gift and create the desired impression.  This box says ""I don't care about you, I am treating you like dirt.""

Instead, I went with optimism that mine would arrive differently, rather since this box seemed much prettier in the picture.  Makes me really angry!",1.0

"Should have read the reviews first, but one would think that a ""GUARANTEE"" in writing, no less, would mean something. Sadly, my guaranteed delivery date on the following day was later changed to a 2 day+ delivery date.

Horrible business practice.",1.0
"Don't buy this as a gift for anyone if you need it by a certain date.  Even though this product says ""one-day shipping"", it's an unreliable expectation.

I would give 1 star only for the box. Amazon says that the gift cards have 2 day fre shipping. But when I bought it I kind of had to buy it as a last minute gift for someone.

"I ordered a $100 gift card for a friend's wedding gift. It was a destination wedding and I wasn't attending in person but based on the expected delivery date it should have arrived before she left so I was ok with that. I just found out after chatting with her a month later that she never received the gift. She contacted amazon as it was on her registry as purchased and was transferred a couple of times. As the purchaser, I contacted amazon to request a refund and have them re-issue a card and expedite shipping. They said sure, just go ahead and order the new one and I will refund your account right after. That made no sense to me but I was going to do it until going through the process I realized I needed to change the shipping address. Now I'm really angry because I have to look up the darn address again. Seconds later I was told, I can't issue the refund because it has to go through the gift card blah blah blah department and I would get a call back on Monday. At this point I'm irate and asked to speak to a supervisor. After a long hold I was told the supervisor approved a refund now but I can still go ahead and reorder. My response is that I'm not reordering anything until I get evidence that a refund is going to my credit card. This was an awful experience and I don't trust ordering gift cards from amazon again. I don't know what carrier was used but whatever disconnect happened between the shipping of the gift-card and the delivery is not my problem. I'm also disappointed that Amazon has no controls in place that would show an order has been in transit for so long. I should have noticed as well but I'm the customer and I want my ordering experience to be seamless.

Update:4/29 - my friend told me that someone drove to her home in their personal vehicle and hand delivered the gift card to her on Sunday which was the day after I complained. That was a good move but I'm still very disappointed in this service.",1.0

When I review my orders, the request for the thank-you note is very clearly there  this is a major oversight by AMAZON. Each of the four recipients thought it was from AMAZON  as they all shop online  and thought it was a thank you from AMAZON for shopping with them.

After several rounds of that, I asked for a supervisor, ans his answer was ""it got stuck"". I still don't understand how that explains the delay or how that helps fix the problem. My other option was to return it. welll....how do i return a gift sent to someone else that didn't arrive??????? And it's a gift card, it's not like they are in short supply.

So when she went to use it, it was denied. How embarrasing for me!  I gave her $50 cash while I get this straightened out. Obviously, I don't want the card reinstated, but I have not received any kind of compensation for my trouble. Is that your policy...just to ignore people's embarrasement and trouble?

I'll have to take the card out and just give it in a regular greeting card.

My uncomplicated plan turned into a three or four hour nightmare that included a call to my bank, two calls to Amazon, and two calls to Visa, all because Amazon insists on extra security for card orders of $100 or more.  Ironically, each card was for only $50, but there were four of them.  We only sorted it out after I encountered a savvy employee at Visa who had encountered this nonsense before. He explained that if my address on file at Amazon and the one at Visa differed by even so much as a comma or abbreviation, it would be kicked out.  Amazon employees gave no such suggestion.
