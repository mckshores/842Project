"Love this paste!  I previously ordered it on TV channel show and loved it.  But they don't offer paste alone!  You have to buy rinse, pretreatment, etc.  So, I bought it here!  Works great for me!",5.0

"I have just started using ""Supersmile"", and I think it IS whitening my teeth and veneers.  I think some drugstore brand whitening toothpastes seem to make veneers look worse.

What I DID notice right away, was how smooth my teeth felt, without any scrubbing.

Also, I had quit using drugstore whitening pastes, because they are so hard on the tissue in my mouth.

I must have had a bit of dried toothpaste on my brush, and when I used it before I went to bed, it must have gotten lodged under one of the bones in my bottom palette, and burned a very painful hole that took a week to heal.",5.0
Have been usimg Supersmile for years and love it.  It does help to keep the teeth white and tastes great too.,5.0
I have been a loyal user of this product for at least 8 years now. LOVE IT!,5.0
"I love this toothpaste! I know crowns and bonding can't be whitened, but mine had gotten so stained I was desperate to try anything just to make them look better. This stuff did the trick! I had my doubts when I placed the order, but within a week my teeth looked whiter and cleaner again. The bonding on my two front teeth now looks like it did when I originally had it done. I hope this toothpaste works as well for you as it has for me.",5.0
excellent tooth paste,5.0
very good tooth paste,5.0
"This stuff is the bomb!  Really works and doesn't hurt sensitive teeth at all.  Also tastes good.  They come in different flavors as well, but this is my fav.",5.0
Thank you!,5.0
Excellent stuff. I like this brand because it doesnt burn my mouth.,5.0
Love it!!,5.0
"The jury is still out on whether this is making my teeth whiter.  I will review again later.  I will say that I like the apple taste, after years of boring ""mint"" flavor that is favored by just about every other brand toothpaste.",5.0
Excellent results in just one week. Removes coffee stains. The mint taste is good too.,5.0
best toothpaste out there.  have been using it since the product first launched.,5.0
This is the only tooth paste that has whitened my one bonded tooth. I whiten my teeth between dental cleanings and that one tooth on the side always looked a tad darker shade than the rest of my pearly whites.  Not anymore.  Great toothpaste.,5.0
"A real working teeth whitener!  Now you teeth are not going to go from Yellow to bright white, but they will whiten!  Plus the flavor of this toothpaste is amazing!  VERY minty - leaves your breath smelling minty fresh!
My kids even like this toothpaste!",5.0
Great taste.,5.0
fast shipping...great product,5.0
Love this toothpaste.  I have used it for years because my dentist recommended it and because it really does work to maintain tooth whiteness.  You only need a small pea-sized amount and a dry toothbrush to use it effectively.,5.0
As described. Prompt delivery. Thank you.,5.0
best toothpaste ever!!!,5.0
I've ordered this for years.  My dentist recommended.  Arrived quickly as usual.,5.0
I've used this toothpaste for years.  Found it at my chemist shop in NYC. After a few months I went to my dentist for a whitening session.  She looked at my teeth and told me that they didn't need whitening and what was I doing to keep them so white.  Well worth the money.  Last a long time because you don't have to use much.,5.0

"About 10 years ago I got veneers on all of my teeth.  So, I do not have one tooth in my mouth that I was born with.  They say veneers do not stain but the past few years I have noticed little brown lines on them and they aren't as white and shiny as they used to be.  I also quit smoking 3 months ago and have stains on the backs of my teeth near the gumline, where what's left of my real teeth are.  My dentist had told me to use Sensodyne and not to use any whitening toothpastes.  A few years ago, after a cleaning, I noticed that my veneers weren't as smooth as they used to be and food seemed to be sticking to them.  I can only guess that they must have used a polish that was too abrasive on them.  I was on the verge of buying an expensive tooth polishing machine but was nervous about the grit of the polish ruining my expensive teeth.  Suddenly, this toothpaste popped up in a search. I started using the toothpaste about a week ago and I already notice whitening of my veneers as well as all the little brown lines are gone.  After a few days use I smelled tobacco while I was brushing and, having smoked for forty years, I was used to that smell on my hands.  I suddenly realized I shouldn't be smelling that at all so I assume that was some of the stain coming off my teeth. I only purchased the toothpaste but I think I am going to buy a small tube of accelerator in order to completely remove the stains from the backs of my teeth.  Additionally, I had a couple of chewing teeth that food would get stuck in after every meal so I was constantly flossing there every time I ate.  Yesterday I noticed that is no longer happening.  I guess there was something sticky there causing all the food to get stuck.  One more thing to note - my teeth feel like I just had them polished all day and even when I wake up in the morning.  No more gross film in  my mouth so I assume no more morning breath!  If you are on the fence about getting this I suggest you take the jump.  You will not regret it!  BTW, this was delivered so fast I couldn't believe it!  And the price is half what you pay from Supersmile.",5.0
Works great! I have only been using this toothpaste for a week & they are so white! I cant wait to see what they look like when I finish the tube! Will defiantly keep using..,5.0
I have been using this system for a little over a month.  It works as advertised and my teeth have changed several shades lighter.  I use it with an electric tooth brush as directed which is use dry..Highly recommend this product.,5.0

"I have only used this twice so far, but this morning I woke up and my teeth were whiter! Good after taste, not really gritty, and tube will last a good while. I use a sonic care essence toothbrush. Good buy.",5.0
"Great Product, I been using supersmile toothpaste for twenty years . I love it my teeth are nice and white, you only need to use a little bit, and it last a long time. I love the cinnamon flavor.",5.0
"Expensive toothpaste, but I have been using it for quite some time, and my teeth look great",5.0
"I have been using this for about six weeks.  I noticed some improvement after a couple of weeks, then stopped paying attention.  Then the other day, someone my age asked how I keep my teeth so white!  I looked closely again, and my teeth are uniformly white and stain free!  It is worth the extra cost, absolutely.",5.0
use it everyday,5.0
"I have been using this toothpaste for a couple of years, maybe more. It really works. My teeth aren't dazzling, but they are definitely whiter. And, no problems with sensitivity (I tried one time to use strips, and my teeth were sensitive for over a year). It has fluoride, so I swish it around after I brush instead of using a rinse (I don't like mouthwashes). And I have not had any cavities. In fact, my dentist and hygienist have been very pleased with my teeth.",5.0
Love this stuff! Makes my teeth smooth & kept white used every day. This is my 3 order. If you use a pee size daily it will last a long time.,5.0
"WOOOHOOOS. Supersmile Icy Mint Whitening  Tooth Paste. The paste is used in conjunction with Supersmile Accelerator Tube. 1, Place on toothbrush(pea size) The two mix when you brush for at least  two minutes.  You should observe whiter teeth,  Love",5.0

I've been using supersmile for the last 4 or 5 years and will not use any other brand. I realize it's quite expensive but I love the taste and the way my teeth look. I recommend it.,5.0
Love this toothpaste makes my mouth and teeth feel so nice and clean after each use.  Its not a strong toothpaste with the smell and taste of mint.  It really does the job of cleaning before whitening.,5.0
This product really works. I've been using it for years and it does not disappoint.  Reasonably priced in place of expensive applications at the dentist.,5.0
This is a wonderful toothpaste.  A little bit goes a long way and it leaves you teeth feeling wonderfully clean and smooth.  My dental checkups have improved since using this product.,5.0
Should make the Gum in this flavor. It's refreshing! Will purchase more. This is the 2nd step of a 3 step program.,5.0
"I was skeptical but didn't want to pay hundreds for a dentist treatment.  With this toothpaste, I noticed the difference within one week.  I'm on my second tube now, and will continue to use this awesome product.  It even helped whiten my one ""dead looking"" tooth so it more closely matches the surrounding teeth.",5.0
"I have been using this product for many years.  Although it is expensive, it is the only toothpaste I use.",5.0
"If you have veneers you know that even though they stay white they will stain some in between teech.
I use this once a week to keep that from happening.",5.0
"Another good product and price to order through Amazon.  We tried other whitening products but none worked as good as this one.

"I DON'T BUY REGULAR TOOTHPASTE ANYMORE SINCE I'VE BEEN USING THIS TOOTHPASTE I NORMALLY BUY THE ORIGINAL BRAND SO I TRIED THIS KIND AND I LIKE THIS BETTER, THESE PRODUCTS IS WORTH THE MONEY",5.0
I've used this toothpaste for years.  It's the best whitening toothpaste I've found. I don't have any sensitivity from it either.,5.0
"No other toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling so fresh and clean, and literally polished.  It may cost a bit more, but it is completely worth every penny.",5.0
This product is great and has assisted me in overcoming sensitivity I have had for a long time. Thanks a lot.,5.0
"and i am serious- since i have found this toothpast, i have never used another kind (honestly) unless im stuck somewhere without it ;) it has made the biggest difference ever since i began using it. i always get asked what i use, and people are amazed that the white doesnt come from strips- its THIS TOOTHPASTE that whitens the best, more than anything i have ever used. you cannot get this in stores, so you might as well buy it now!!!! you won't regret it",5.0
"best whiter I have tried... been looking so long to find something easy, tastes great, and actually works.... even my husband will use it lol : ) highly recommend",5.0
I really love supersmile toothpaste. I've used it for over 2 years now and won't change. i'm getting ready to order more now.,5.0
"I love this stuff, your mouth feels like you just came from the dentist ! I have been using this product for about 2 years.",5.0
"Supersmile Whitening Toothpaste delivers on its promise  not only  to whiten teeth several shades, but to keep them white is the absolute truth.  I have used this toothpaste for 15 years, and I receive compliments on my teeth on a daily basis.",5.0
"Really works, brightens smiles in a few uses. You can see  your dirt being washed right off your toothbrush. Yummy!",5.0
I've been using this product for years. It does the job better than anything else. Whitens and cleans effectively yet gentle.,5.0
I actually got this toothpaste for my daughter to use because she doesn't like the minty toothpastes.  I tried it and it is so nice!  It tastes good and my teeth feel very clean.,5.0
Finally something that takes coffee and tea stains off my teeth without a lot of trouble. I use Supersmile everyday.,5.0
"I highly recommend. Does not give you dry mouth, has a great taste and you can definitely see the difference after only a week of use. My dentist sells this in his office, so I was pleased to find it on Amazon. Much easier!",5.0
"I got this for my daughter whose teeth were stained from peridex after having her wisdom teeth removed.  Like so many others, there is a lot of money invested in her teeth with braces, extractions, wisdom teeth extraction etc. Was so upset to have her teeth stained a horrible gray from the peridex rinse the oral surgeon gave to her.  The only caution with this tooth paste and all the other ""whiteners"" is that  you will have very sensitive teeth if you use only this toothpaste all the time.  Alternate this with a regular toothpaste or toothpaste for sensitive teeth.",5.0
"People always comment on how pretty my teeth are, and I credit that to SuperSmile toothpaste.  I drink tea and coffee, and this toothpaste seems to remove that stains that typically come from those types of beverages.",5.0
"Since I began using Supersmile toothpaste more than a year ago, my dental checkups have been great---almost no cleaned required making the visit fast.  Teeth feel clean and white and it tastes good.  I have sensitive gums and this works well with that problem----does not give me sore gums.  Yes, I would totally recommend this product.",5.0
This is more expensive than colgate or crest. But it works 10 times better. Tastes better too. Also have the whitening gel made by supersmile.,5.0
"My new dentist recommended this - he said he's seen really good results. Well, it tastes good and yes it does work! I do recommend to use it everyday - brush with dry brush for about 5 minutes - and not just once in a while so as to get the results. Yes it does whiten the teeth, and yes i would buy it again.",5.0
This toothpaste is amazing It is my favorite because I drink a lot of tea and it does a great job removing the stains!,5.0
"I used toms natural toothpase spearmint for 20 years on my veneers but now that I have 16 brand new porcelain crowns that were very expensive I switched to supersmile. I love original mint because it tastes like toms, very spearmint and not burning fake mint. If you have porcelain teeth you should know that using whitening toothpastes can take away the protective glaze of your teeth and then stains can happen faster then real enamel, like from berries or coffeeeeeeeee.....so, this supersmile whitens without scrubbing off any layers, just absorbing stains.....so it is a must!!",5.0
I feel that it has lightened my very yellow teeth and removed the plaque. The minty taste cleanses my teeth as well.,5.0
"I really like this toothpaste. It's pricey but worth it for me.  Other whitening toothpastes irritate my gums, but this one does not. You only use a little bit of it, so it lasts as well or better than regular toothpaste. I like the taste also.  It has helped brighten my teeth and  also works on my veneers, which is why I bought it for a try in the first place.  I've used the strips and other toothpastes and this is the best product I've found to date.",5.0
"I read the different reviews and this was the "" Whitening"" toothpaste  that was top of the list...
Guess what? It works...",5.0
"This is a Fabulous Product.
It actually whitens your teeth every day. Takes away coffee stains easily.
Recieved my package quickly.
I will buy from this seller again!",5.0
"I was very skeptical of this claim to whiten veneers, but it works even on my 20 yr old veneers which had become discolored just with age.  Whitening strips had worked for years, but had stopped working, so I had spent the money for trays from the dentist and used these for a couple of weeks.  They would probably have worked (from the back side of the teeth according to my dentist) but I needed to stop due to sore gums.  So I was using the toothpaste and saw more change from it than from the trays and with no soreness (and I do not have tender gums at all) so stopped the trays and do not plan to use them.  Brushing in a circular motion for two mins morning and night is not a big deal and when I used it 3-4 times daily due to having forgotten to take my other toothpaste on a short trip, the extra brushings made a difference, too.  I am concerned about one reviewer's comment that the teeth re-discolor when one stops using the toothpaste, but will wait until something unavoidable happens to provide the test...meanwhile just continuing to brush at least twice daily and appreciate the fact that something does seem to work with minimal expense and trouble.....I do drink tea and coffee daily, but not red wine.....",5.0
"I have been using this brand for a year now and my teeth are whiter. It is pricy. I prefer the cinnamon flavor. I have tried colgate and other name brands but they didn't whiten my teeth, even though they promised to do so.",5.0
"Fantastic product
So great to be able to ordef on line instead of waiting for my dentist to order it. Have and will continue to use for years",5.0
"I use this toothpaste alone in the middle of the day to freshen up, however when combined with Supersmile Accelerator it is the only thing that whitens my Tetracycline stained teeth. When I was a young child, I had tonsillitis quite often and was given Tetracycline because it was a widely prescribed antibiotic at that time. Unfortunately If you take this drug while you have your baby teeth, your permanent teeth may develop banding stains ranging from yellow to gray in color, and slight to severe in intensity, plus they may become translucent. My teeth developed slight yellow banding and translucency, and after trying many other bleaching and whitening methods (professional and over-the-counter) to no avail, I tried this and it's worked better than anything else. I've been using the toothpaste with accelerator twice a day for about 3 years and my teeth are brighter and more opaque than they've ever been. I'm very pleased with this system.",5.0
"I have always disliked mint in anything but ice cream, and I do NOT want my mouth to tingle.  I was delighted to find the Green Apple, which leaves my teeth smooth and my mouth feeling clean without the harshness of mint or the cloying sweetness of most toothpastes.  It's not abrasive like so many other tooth products, so I don't have to worry about scrubbing the enamel away.",5.0
I love it.  Teeth are getting whiter.  Tried the toothpaste and can't wait to try the other products. Buy it,5.0
This toothpaste is excellent for whitening. I've gotten several compliments on how great my smile looks! The toothpaste has a great flavor too!!,5.0
This is my favorite toothpaste. I've used it for years. Makes your teeth feel so clean & smooth. Be sure to use on a dry toothbrush. Just takes a pea-size amount. Amazon has best price!,5.0

Love it!",5.0
"I buy this toothpaste almost exclusively and have used it for years. You really need only very little at a time, and one tube can last for several weeks. It tastes great and does seem to help my teeth maintain their whiteness. An added benefit seems to be diminished ""morning breath!""",5.0
best whitening toothpaste around.  I originally bought it on QVC as a today's special value but now their prices are higher than what I can get here.,5.0
Remember to use a dry toothbrush.  I only use once/day at night and regular toothpaste in the AM.  No sensitivity!,5.0
My teeth feel like I have just come from the dentist. I Think as we age our teeth darken but this super smile toothpaste help keep them white. I am hooked. I liked it so much I bought it for all my children to try.,5.0
"My son had lots of antibiotics when he was a baby so when his big-boy teeth came in, they were typically stained.  This helped to whiten his teeth, not remove all the staining but a big improvement.",5.0
I use this all the time.  It did whiten my teeth.  You do have to continue using it to keep the results.,5.0
"this stuff is good for upkeep, i use it occasionally and it does the trick! I recommend it to smokers or coffee drinkers. besides crest whitening strips this toothpaste is the best.",5.0
"remember use a dry tooth brush its perfect to maintain your whitened teeth twice a day no sesitivity
i have sensitive teeth",5.0
"Took a couple of weeks until I started to see a real whitening difference. Did not use the acuator (?) just the paste from the gitgo. Like it because it is not gloppy like most toothpastes; my teeth feel the cleanest they have every felt, not ""sweaters"" ever. I have mild periodontal disease and my gums seem much healthier looking too.",5.0
"Got my teeth whitened over a year ago. So far, no need to return for a treatment. This stuff keeps the whitening going.",5.0
"I was browsing the net and ran across this product, the first place I looked for it was amazon thanks, the very first time I used the product it did remove coffee, juice, and other stains from my teeth, my teeth were whiter the first time I used  the product, great seller and fast shipping, thanks again.",5.0
This is a great toothpaste! It tastes pleasant and very effective whiting maintenance. My whole family loves it and prefers it over other toothpastes.,5.0
"I can't explain it, Of all the toothpastes I've ever used my mouth feels amazingly clean when I use super smile.
What am I comparing it against? Colgate, Toms, and Blanx.
I used to be a blanx user, but they don't distribute the artic moss blanx into the states anymore. I switched to supersmile and I wouldn't look back if they did.
Pros:
Clean mouth feel
subtle mint flavor
Cons:
Price... It is very expensive. But if you want to feel like you love yourself, this is something worth trying. Go on indulge yourself. even for just one tube.",5.0
Using any abrasive toothpaste will gradually remove your enamel. This  keeps your teeth white and healthy. I will purchase this toothpaste again.,5.0
I had used the Super Smile system since January. I HONESTLY see a big difference in the color of my teeth. I bought this to use ans an 'upkeep'. Remember to use with a dry toothbrush.,5.0
Great toothpaste. It whitens without causing sensitivity. Don't expect a dental bleach white but it does whiten really well. Flavor is good.,5.0
this was a good product and good value. The purchase came quickly and I would buy it again when needed.,5.0
A truly wonderful product for a mega watt smile. Works best with the accelerator .whitens my veneers too.my natural teeth match my veneers,5.0

Works great!!!  This is the best product ever!!!  I absolutely love it!!!  I recommend it to all who want white teeth!,5.0
I have been using supersmile for years. Once you try it you cant use anything else. Makes your mouth feel like you just had a cleaning at the dentist and whitens your teeth.,5.0
"This toothpaste whitened my teeth several shades after I used it for a few months.  The ingredients seem to be very strong, so I try to mix up with other toothpastes.  It is also a good acne remedy if you mix it with a little neosporin : )",5.0
SuperSmile has always been worth the price to me but the sometimes I'm just not in the mood for the overly minty flavors (ie icy mint) Cinnamon burst does the trick and the cinnamon is very subtle.,5.0
Brush your teeth with this stuff regularyly and it will help whiten your teeth.  It won't may your teeth pearly white but it definitely helps and is worth it.,5.0
I have sensitive teeth and can't use a lot  of tooth pastes that contain whitening properties but have been using this one for 6 months and haven't had any issues but a much whiter smile!,5.0
"Several years ago my Dentist gave me a tube of this toothpaste and explained why he recommends this product. I have now used this toothpaste for over 10 years and ever since I started, my cleaning have been much easier, not as much plaque build up and gums are in great shape.",5.0
Love the taste and results of this toothpaste. Amazon also offers it at a very good price and it really whitens your teeth -- even after just the first usage. I use it daily and am very pleased with it.,5.0
"Here are my mandatory 16 words to be able to send this review.

I have been using this toothpaste for about 3 years now. Love it and my smile and teeth look GREAT and are nice and BRIGHT. Thank you Dr. Smigle :-),5.0
"This toothpaste does work, I have been using it for 4 years, better than any other brand on the shelf.",5.0
"My 10 year old veneer was starting to show discoloration and I researched ""how to lighten veneers"" online. Well, you have to replace the tooth or try Supersmile. I opted for the toothpaste to save a little money and am now signed up for the automatic shipments!! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!",5.0
"This brand is our favorite because teeth feel so much cleaner. The baking soda is non abrasive cleaner. However, this flavor is more of a cloves taste than cinnamon. Not my favorite flavor but certainly is a burst of flavor.",5.0
"Supersmile toothpaste is a low-foam toothpaste that has a soft abrasive that gently removes stubborn food stains from coffee, tea, berries and red wine.  There is no chemical burn or bad taste and is excellent for veneers and sensitive gums.

As a frequent traveler to countries where the water may not be safe to drink without boiling, beverages such as coffee and tea (instead of just plain water) are the norm in my diet and I had unattractive stains on my teeth no matter how hard or how often I brushed with regular toothpaste.  I hate the chemical taste  and burn of chemical whitening toothpastes so my dentist recommended Supersmile toothpaste as a way to help with the stains between visits.

By using Supersmile's toothpaste with an electric toothbrush at night before bed, I was able to remove most of the stains on my teeth and get them as naturally white as possible.  I love how the Supersmile accelerant is in a separate tube so I can choose when I need to use it in combination with the toothpaste (to get the inbetween teeth stains) to get my teeth beyond natural white (but not optical white).

To get the most out of this toothpaste, it needs to be used without water on an electric toothbrush for the full recommended 2-mins.  I use it mostly as an additional treatment with a dedicated toothbrush rather than as my primary toothpaste.",5.0
"I love this toothpaste.  The flavor is just right, not overpowering but very tasty.  I have been happy with all of their products.",5.0
"Ya know $15.00 is a lot of money for tooth paste but it is a whole lot cheaper than a tooth whitening session.  Needless to say, I am very, very pleased with Supersmile.  I am addicted to tea and hot chocolate and it was starting to show.  I was shocked to see immediate results after one use.  I am now on my 2nd tube for maintenance.  Love this stuff!",5.0
"It really works wonders in teeth whitening!  Peridex can really stain teeth, but I can already see a difference after a few days of using it!  It is so far the best teeth whitener that I have ever used and is definitely worth the price in the overall scheme of teeth products and services that could be used to remove stains.",5.0
I originally bought this toothpaste from my cosmetic dentist in Scottsdale. It is the BEST. You actually notice a difference after the first time. Its the only whitening toothpaste that has the same ingredients as the pros use in the whitening trays. I can't live with out this product!,5.0
"This toothpaste was recommended to me by my cosmetic dentist as the only shot to re-whiten my veneers -- and BOY does it.  I could see a difference in only a few days and then, after a few months, they were as white as the day I got them.  My whole family and a lot of friends now use this with great results.  None of us have any gum irritation or problems and another bonus is that nothing we've ever used leaves your teeth/mouth feeling so absolutely clean. It's pricey for ""toothpaste"" but worth every penny. Thank you Dr. Smigel you're a genius for inventing this!",5.0
"I've already written a review, but I'll do it again for you.  Dealing with amazon is so nice and easy.  Every purchase I've done with you has been great.  I love the Supersmile toothpaste and hope to get some more when I run out.  Just hope the price is low for me!

Thank you for your follow-up.  Would love a Kindle, but they are still too high, even on Amazon.  Any last minute sales, let me know on anything.

"By far the best whitening toothpaste I've tried.  It does not have an offensive taste and really makes my teeth whiter.  Only drawback is the price, but it is definitely worth it.",5.0
"This is a third Supersmile what we are using. I am recommending to everyone. I have tried many whitening toothpastes before, but they didn't help. My dentist recommended Supersmile and my teeth are really white in a very short time.  This toothpaste is really very very very very good for smokers, as well. This is the best toothpaste so far what we have use. Fast delivery. Good price. Happy for my purchase.",5.0
"I've been using Supersmile toothpaste for a little over 15 years and I will NEVER use anything else.  Regular toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling gritty, like I can't get them clean enough no matter how long I brush.  I drink red wine and coffee and ocassionally smoke with no staining whatsoever. I go to the dentist regularly for my semi annual cleanings and he is amazed that I never have any tartar buildup.  My husband uses regular toothpaste and I have to buy him a new tube every few weeks.  Because it's necessary to use only a pearl size drop of Supersmile one tube lasts a couple months, so in reality the cost is not significantly more.",5.0
My wife and I both use Supersmile.  It really does keep your teeth white.,5.0
"This has a nice flavor and I was surprised how well it whitens teeth on its own.  I am a red wine & coffee drinker and this really helped.  It is a little pricey for everyday, but nice once in a while.",5.0
I love this product and have purchased 3 tubes now.  I get compliments everyday on how white my teeth are.,5.0
My daughter's teeth are beautifully white. She has been using SuperSmile for over 1 year and she recently had her check up and does not have any cavities.,5.0
"I NEVER received my order!  Do not order for American Discount Beauty Supply!!!!  I emailed them and called them and they will not even return my inquires as to why I never received my order.  Wasted $36 (I also ""bought"" the Supersmile Whitening Floss).  Amazon needs to drop this supplier...",5.0
"I don't know about tooth whitening, I bought this because it isn't so strongly flavored that my mouth is burning when I am done brushing. It is nice and mild with no overt ""backing soda"" flavor.",5.0
"Forget every over-the-counter ""whitening"" toothpaste out there.  Nothing available in the stores can match even half the whitening power this can.  This is the one and only you'll ever need!  Within 2 weeks, I noticed exceptionally whiter teeth, and I had relatively white teeth to start with.  This product has actually whitened my teeth more than the chair-side bleaching I got at my dentist's office. I was just looking for something to keep them white rather than using white strips, which caused too much tooth sensitivity for me to use more than 3 days.  Super Smile caused absolutely no sensitivity at all, which is the 2nd best thing about it.  Just use it twice a day (along with the whitening accelerator gel) for two minutes, and after a few days, you'll be thankful you bought it!",5.0
"Loved the product! Didn't give me sensitive gums, and it certainly whitened my teeth. Will buy again, worth the price.",5.0
"I have tried many different lotions, but this one is the best by far.  It really soaks into your skin and there is little, if any residue left behind.  And the fragrance is subtle but very pleasant.",5.0

Best loation ever.  I love how it makes my skin feel tingly.  I get the hand cream after getting engaged since my finder was swelling and a friend reccomended mint hand creame.  I loved that so much I got the body loation.  HIGHLY RECCOMEND,5.0
"Absolutely LOVE this lotion! It smells like real mint, not the mint gum smell you get with some mint lotions.

I took it to work and I had to hide it because everyone was using it; which due to the price I paid, I can't afford to just let anyone use it.  It has a very good smooth feeling and not watered down.",5.0

"I have been using this particular lotion from Archipelago for many years. It was originally given to me as a gift and after that I continued using it. I think it smells heavenly, in addition to be a superior lotion. I have no retail; stores in my area so online is my way of purchasing it. Sharon Ferris",5.0
"I absolutely love this lotion - it has to be my most favorite over the past 18 years!  It has a very light, clean mint/herbal smell that I enjoy.  I do love pairing it with the body wash, but the lotion is where it's at for me.  I bought this years ago at a Marshalls and could not help but think - why on earth is this so expensive?  Is it worth it?  IT IS.  I have very dry skin and this goes on very smoothly for me and soaks in pretty quickly relieving any dryness I have, but also not making me itch or break out.  The only issue I have with ordering it on Amazon is that nobody seems to want to take the 30 seconds to make sure the lid is on tight, the pump is closed and its not covered in dirt.  I mention this issue - because for me it is an issue.  I don't want my lotion to spill out - which it has both times I ordered it, nor would I ever buy a lotion that is spilling out and covered with a layer of dirt and dust.  The sellers need to step up their game on here.  Next time I will look for it where I can buy it in person or directly from the manufacturer.  It is worth the extra expense to makes sure it is done right.",5.0
I love this lotion! Smells great and works great!,5.0
Yay,5.0
Great product fast delivery I recommend to all.,5.0

This is the best hydrating lotion and it smells so good.,5.0

"Smells amazing, less real MINT like than I thought it would be but it still smells like absolute heaven. Moisturizes great, non greasy, high quality, you get a lot for the price. I like the metal bottle it comes in, and the convenient pump. Even my husband likes it! I also like that it has essential oils in it. It is a very refreshing, uplifting lotion to have for summer, and makes you feel and smell so fresh!",5.0
great product my wife loves it  quick to ship well packaged will do business again  thanks,5.0
Amazing smell and does wonders for dry hands!! Experienced this at a spa and am so glad I found on Amazon to order.,5.0

I LOVE this lotion.  Smells great and wonderful for dry skin.,5.0
"I have been using this everyday for over a month; it is the best lotion I have used so far while living in a dry western state; I only need to apply once a day, no dry/cracked/itchy skin once since I started using and we have only had 8-15% humidity for the past several weeks; nice light clean scent; I also use the morning mint body wash",5.0

"I really like the smell of this lotion and it doesn't feel greasy...not cheap, but worth it. I've been buying it for years and haven't gotten tired of it.",5.0
"This lotion has a wonderful scent to it.  It is a real waker upper.  The lotion itself is also very hydrating.  I originally found this product in a dayspa and fell in love with it.  I am so glad that I can get it on Amazon. If you don't like a scented lotion that I would not recommend this for you, however, if you like a refreshing smell then you need to buy this.",5.0
"I first experienced this product in one of the myriad hotels/motels we stay at when we travel.

I love the smell of it as well as the fact that it is not greasy.

The best part of this product, however, is the fact that it keeps my skin hydrated, which, to-date, no other product has.

I live in Tucson, Arizona and other than two months in the summer during monsoon, and given my age, my skin is extremely dry even though I use products advertised to take care of this dryness.

Morning mint has been the best skin product I have ever used.  Would definitely recommend it for dry skin.",5.0
"I bought this for the fragrance. It is just beautiful.  Clean and light.  I wish the fragrance would last on my skin all day, but I only notice it for a couple of hours.  Beside that, it is a great lotion.  Goes on great and dries to a non oily finish.  The pump makes it very convenient to use after shower.",5.0
"This is a soy based lotion that is not oily but also does not instantly absorb...it's perfect, which is why the price is what it is.  My skin is very soft as a result of daily use, and I love the smell of the morning mint.  I also have the regular when I don't want this light mint scent.  Regardless, this is the only lotion I like to use.",5.0
"I always recommend this product and guests in our home often ask where they can find it.

The packaging this time was much better - which I greatly appreciated.",5.0
"The lemony minty scent of this lotion is my favorite.  It also comes in shampoo and other products.
It's expensive, but if you want a fresh, 'soapy' clean scent, it's worth the price.
I mix a little of it with a cheaper, unscented lotion to extend it!",5.0
I would highly recommend this product to all women. It is so refreshing and I love the smell. I do not like heavy perfumed lotions so this one is perfect.,5.0
This lotion is absolutely wonderful.  Love the fragrance and it makes my skin feel soft without making it feel oily.,5.0
"My wife this year was in love when she opened her gifts,. She loves this stuff. I don't really know why. But, a man just doesn't question a woman's desires. :)",5.0
I buy this product over and over.  I gave some to my sister and she loves it also.  Bot 4 for her for Christmas,5.0
I first found this in Colorado as a small sampler bottle. I loved the lemony fragrance. It is wonderful to use in the morning as a moisturizer all over.,5.0
I LOVE the fresh tingly sensation and wonderful minty smell of this lotion.  and it absorbs quickly so I can use it under make-up.,5.0
"I don't often use body lotion, and when I do I am very particular about the scent. I do not like smelling like vanilla bean or sugary chemically smells like lots of these new popular lotions. So when I came across this lotion in a spa, I had to double take and try it again and again. The texture is thick and buttery and really soaks into the skin, but the scent! It is refreshing, awakening and just bright and crisp. I'm not quite sure how to describe it. I couldn't get the scent out of my head and drove back to the spa to purchase it. It was costly, but the bottle is lasting many months now and show no signs of depleting. I will definitely get another bottle when this one is finished.",5.0
Love it...smells fresh and clean..Will purchase again...Will purchase other scents in future...wish I could find in stores...if you use lotions try morning mint,5.0
I love the Archipelago products. They really help me to unwind and feel pampered. I would recommend them to any person needing to reduce stress.,5.0
"Great hydration, wonderful smell! Leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized. Have given as a gift also! We turn the bottle upside down when we run low and this allows us to completely use all the product. The pumper is hard to start sometimes. Would recommend this!",5.0
I ordered this as a birthday gift for my sister.  She had been using the bubble bath and loved it.  The lotion was in good condition with none running out.  It was taped and wrapped so that it arrived in great condition.,5.0
"This is hands down the best smelling mint body lotion on the market. Its expensive but its worth it. I found a stash in Aspen, CO for half off. Best deal ever.",5.0

Bought this for my husband who suffers with eczema.  The scent is delightful and it does help to moisturize his hands without the greasy feeling of other lotions. Generous sized bottle as well.  Will order it again!,5.0
"This lotion is very nicely strong smelling if you like mint. I know some people will say ""too strong"" but for me it is a great lotion. I use as a hand lotion in the morning - kinda like strong Italian coffee!",5.0

"I have used this product before and I love it, but this is the first time I've purchased it at [...].  It is cheaper, but with S&H it's about the same, but more convenient.  The feel is luxurious and the scent is a light and energetic.  I love it.",5.0

"I have sensitive skin and unfortunately have suffered painful reactions to certain brands of deodorant (mostly of the aluminum free or natural varieties from brands I otherwise like). I can't get enough of CK One and wanted to try this deodorant for a little while-so glad I did. Definitely the CK One fragrance I adore but a little lighter/ more subtle, no skin irritation, long lasting (most surprising) and I'm happy with the results and experience of wearing it. Smells fresh and clean which is what I want.",5.0

"It has a very pleasing aroma to it, because of it I have been using it for years, and will continue to do so. I have seen, real, ck one for about 26$ for a larger bottle at malls, so if you can look for it locally, much cheaper.",5.0
"CK One by Calvin Klein is the perfect fragrance to add a touch of excitement to your daily activities. Papaya and pineapple blend with a touch of sweet jasmine to create an energetic base. Warm notes of green tea and amber add to the fragrance's subtlety. Introduced in 1994, this energetic unisex scent is perfect for daytime use, whether you are at work or enjoying weekend adventures. Splash it on your skin for an instant burst of confidence that will last the whole day.

I have been a fan of CK One since it first came out. I had stopped wearing it for a few years after I fell in love with another fragance but have recently started back wearing it. I get so many compliments when I wear it and I just love it. It's the perfect scent for summer, it's light and not overbearing and it mixes well with your favorite body lotion. CK One has become my favorite all over again!!! Love it!",5.0
"I love perfume and colognes that are not overpowering or too flowery, and Calvin Klein One is such a scent. There are undertones of musk and green tea which I like. I have many green tea-scented products at home, including other perfumes. Both men and women have reacted positively to this scent too. I will wear this a lot.",5.0
Smells great! No too strong like a cologne. Like by both my wife and son.,5.0
"I wasn't sure how I'd feel about a unisex cologne but I was very pleasantly surprised by the light, crisp, scent that reminded me of summer mornings. I like this because it is not overwhelming, rather subtle and understated though obvious. It has a nice combination of sweetness and citrus that lightly lingers all day. Delicious in every way. Bonus, my girlfriend is a big fan too!",5.0
"I'm not one for scents or cologne, normally, however as the Vine Program offered this and it is billed for men or women, my wife and I decided to try it. The fragrance is clean and sophisticated but not overbearing and does indeed suit both men and women. Amazon's price is still a little steep, coming from someone not into frangrances, but there is enough here to last a goodly while.",5.0
Excelente,5.0
"Scent is not strong. I like the mildness of it. It is very pleasant and last the day. A little goes a long way, so all I really need is a couple sprays.",5.0
"This is one of the great modern classics.  I think every man (or woman apparently) should have a bottle of CK one in their arsenal.  Out of the 20 fragrances I own, CK One is probably top two with Aqua Di Gio Essenza.  Just a pleasing scent and one which some like but most will love.",5.0
A wonderful scent that both ladies and men can wear.  This fragrance has been around for many years for a reason.  It smells divine!  Not overpowering at all.  Highly recommended.,5.0
"So I do love fragrances, and wear them regularly for work. I initially was skeptical about whether a fragrance would ideally work for both men and women. How is that possible? Well, this one does. The scent of this is a perfect compliment to spring. It was refreshing without being too strong, and very clean smelling. It is very different from the Tommy that I usually wear, and a couple of people that I met up with yesterday noticed the new scent. I would buy this one again!",5.0
Great Fragrance.  Subtle but detectable.  Long lasting.  Quality you would expect from Calvin Klein.  They say it can be used as unisex and I would say that is accurate.,5.0
"This is a good scent to use if you are looking for fresh and youthful scent. It smells very crisp and citrus with a slight bit of spice on the backend. It comes across as an energetic fun smell with a slight touch of sensuality. The notes used in CK One are: Bergamot, Cardamom, Fresh Pineapple, Papaya, Jasmine, Violet, Rose, Nutmeg, Musk.

I read many reviews about this product being questionably authentic. I have purchased CK One many times in the past and this seems to be a legitimate. The packaging appears the same, the screw top cap and spritzer are the same. I think the reason people are questioning the longevity of this product is the duration of the odor. There are different strengths of colognes/perfumes you can buy. Sometimes designers give different options (at different price points). This product is an Eau de Toilette and not an Eau de Parfum. Eau de Toilette is only about 5 to 8 percent of the perfume essence, and is designed for shorter wear on the skin. While, Eau de Parfum typically contains anywhere from 8 to 15 percent of the essential fragrance and lasts longer on the skin.

Overall, I have always have been happy with this scent. I tend to use lots of different colognes in my collection depending on mood and occasion. I personally only use this as a casual scent and occasionally for parties. However, it could easily be a scent that works for any setting. While this scent tends to fade after a few hours try not to put too much on with each use. It is very very strong on the front end then subsides over time.",5.0

"And quite simply, she does too. She recommended it, but I really do actually like it for myself. Its not overpowering like ""I can't breathe let me out of this elevator RIGHT NOW"" and its not too light like ""I wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator"". Its strong, bold and crisp.

And she really likes it. So there's no loss there EVER.",5.0

My oldest SON's first bottle of cologne and he LOVED it! The price was reasonable and well worth it! Amazon has a myriad of perfumes and colognes to choose from. Thanks!,5.0
"I bought a bottle for myself after wanting it for a while, and it's cheaper on Amazon, so why not? I was confident ordering this online because it is shipped directly through Amazon and I don't think Amazon would sell fake stuff. If they did, I'm sure that they'd back it up. Anyway, this is the legit CK One. I bought a bottle for my mom after I found out it's legit. And they packaged it really well, too. No way anything could've gotten damaged, and nothing did. I'm a satisfied customer of this product, twice in a row. Highly recommend it.",5.0

"The CK One from the bottle I received smells pretty much identical to the cologne I used in 1996, except the newer bottle seems to give me more projection and lasts a lot longer  - almost all day, from just one spray to the chest.

I'm a guy so if I ever smell this scent, even though it works as a unisex fragrance, I think of cologne, I don't think of perfume; and, more importantly, I get absorbed by the nostalgia of 1996, that entire era of my life, from the seasons to the clothes, to the people.

CK One has a safe versatility about it, in that it's great for winter, has a masculine charm about it like a spicy flame, but it's also light and not overpowering, not offenisve or dense, and is therefore great for summer as well. The citrus overtones mellow out to a nice aquatic freshness with only small hints of the floral. This, imo, gives the hue of the fragrance a bias that makes it very suitable for young males.

My bottle came as pictured and with a screw-off cap that you replace with the provided sprayer. At its price I wouldn't worry too much about counterfeits. The unit I got certainly smells authentic and projects all day.",5.0

CK 1 is all my husband wears. The deodorant is difficult to find in stores but he likes it because it doesn't clash with his cologne.,5.0

I love the smell i have from when i was a teen. got it for my husband and he likes the smell too and he loves it more because i love the smell ;),5.0
I love this fragrance.  I've been using this product for year and think in the past I have been sold a bogus product since it smelled more like medicine than the light citrus fragrance that came in the box this time.  I'll be buying it from this company from now on!,5.0
I love that Calvin Klein makes one fragrance for either a man or a woman!  Okay... I admit sometimes I LIKE the MENs fragrances even more than the WOMENs!!  That being said you can definitely tell this is a combination of both a man's and woman's fragrance.  You can pick up hints of each in this cologne. It's spicy yet very clean smelling. I think clean would be the optimal word to describe this cologne though.  Not overpowering and lasts the day.  Price point is exceptional for this size and it's a prime product!!!,5.0
I get so many comments on this perfume.  I have used C.K. One by Calvin Klein Spray for 5 years and I love it.  This perfume will stay with you all day long.,5.0
"Fragrance is so personal and preferences are so arbitrary, so this review is only about practical matters, bottling, packaging, and delivery. All are excellent. The fragrance is exactly what was advertisied. The bottle is sturdy and comes with a screw cap and atomizer. It was delivered quickly, and the overall price was right. If you like CK1, then you'll like this product.",5.0

"I bought this perfume for a gift to a young man. It's really delicious and fresh, has liked a lot and plan to continue using. Suitable for youngsters.",5.0
"I selected this rating because the fragrance is lovely.  The product is exactly as described on line.  The spray attachment is enclosed inside the box and the bottle is tightly sealed with a screw top lid to prevent leaking.  This is truly an appreciated feature.  Once the spray top is in place it can be used daily, but the lid offers spill proof transport when traveling.  This is a major plus.  I would most definitely recommend CK One to others.  ABS",5.0

"good thing but for CK its little sweet and little womanly,i prefer CK be it more cold and skeptic smooth :))",5.0
This scent is a pleasant flowery-sweet scent that I think is more for a man than a woman.  It is a modern classic in my opinion.  I doubt anyone would hate it.  You either like it or LOVE it.,5.0

"I love this fragrance, I have been wearing it for years.  This fragrance is for those ladies (like me) that totally love the smell of men's cologne and have always wanted to use a man's cologne but were afraid to actually wear a man's cologne.  This scent strikes a perfect balance between a womens and man's cologne.

"Why I like it: Long-lasting, crisp, citrus-like, and not too strong. Clean, invigorating, not sugary or childish -smelling. I first received it as gift in my mid-teens, and it has been one of my favorites since then (I'm now 29).  I was never ""too girly"", so this is a great alternative to the strong floral fragrances. Even my boyfriend loves it, and has used up the bottle he purchased last Valentine's Day :|

Why I recommend: Can be worn around sensitive noses, can be worn by anyone!",5.0
"To me this is the best product for straightening my long thick wavy hair, I have tried many others with poor results. It gets much hotter than the other flat irons I have tried, there are ten intervals of heat and 10 is super hot, so people with thinner hair might not want to turn the heat on full blast. It makes my hair SUPER straight and smooth, and it is super durable, because I have taken this on so many trips and dropped it about 1000 times and it's still working as well as the day I got it. Highly recommended!!",5.0

Great flat iron. I shopped around a lot and I'm very happy with the high quality and price.,5.0

"I had one of these for about 12 years before it started flaking out on me. So glad to have found another one. Adjustable heat, long cord, works the FIRST time you run it down the length of hair, unlike the fancier, more expensive ones that take forever. Love this product.",5.0

"I don't use this as I am pretty much bald, however my wife LOVES this. She has owned this particular model and brand for as long as I can remember, which is about 15 minutes according to her. Seriously though, she has been using this one for what seems a decade. The high notes for her are the larger sized plates, even heat, and quick warm-up time. Her last one survived daily use for about 5 years. It still works, but the hinge broke. I fairly certain it was user error, but I won't say that her face. I am very glad they are still available for purchase and I hope they remain on the market until I die.",5.0

"I was so glad to find this item at Amazon. I'd owned one for many, many years and it just kept going and going. It straightened my hair easily and beautifully. Then one day I made a mistake and dropped it into the sink where there was some water... Ooooh!  I wasn't able to find one at any salon or at the beauty supply shops. I purchased a different unit and it dried my hair badly, even though it was ""ceramic"".  I should have known to just go to Amazon.com.  When I saw it on Amazon, I purchased it immediately. Now I can straighten my hair without inflicting the amount of  damage as that 'other unit'",5.0

Works great love this straightener,5.0
This is my 3rd order. I was getting this iron from Sally Beauty Supply until they stopped carrying it. I have not found anything else that works on my hair nearly as well. If you drop it a few times it will start to crack and fall apart. I always find a way to knock it around. This last time it developed a crack that my hair got stuck in and a few strands broke off. The larger two inch is the best for long long hair with layers. (Mid-back to waist length) I have never had any issues with the heating elements not working.,5.0
"This is by far the best iron I have used.  I am about to purchase this one but had to write my review on my previous experience with this exact one.  For one I love how it's not as expensive as when I first bought one in 2002.  I prefer the width of it as apposed to the regular 1 inch flat irons.  I have used both ceramic and metal and they all seem the same to me as far as keeping my hair healthy.  I have gone through many flat irons since my last one broke in 2010.  Got to say I love how long it lasted considering how many years I had it and how many times it fell.  I have very long hair and very thick hair and lots of it, so it is great that I can flat iron my hair a lot faster with the hot tools.  I love the durability and how fast it warms up.  Can't wait to purchase this again.  Highly recommend.",5.0

Straightest electric flat iron out there.  I am African=American and went relaxer free four years ago.  I was using a CHI which worked fine on my relaxed hair but was not successful on my natural hair.  I was so happy to find this flat iron which was one of the original irons I began using 20 years.  My advice to Helen of Troy.  If it's working no moderinzation is needed.  I wish this one was more available,5.0

This flat iron works just as good (if not better) than all expensive professional flat irons I have ever had. I strongly recommend this product.

"I bought this same model 15 years ago when I was in high school. Its barely starting to die out on me. At one point in my teen years it was so hot and the combo of the heat and sticky hairspray caused my hair to melt. It was the under portion of my hair so it was no biggie. Anyhow, it doesn't get as hot after 15 years and I payed well overs $20 for mine back then. I'm sticking with hot tools when I replace her, now to decide if I get the same model or upgrade?",5.0

"This product was availabe through Housewares @Amazon.  It came very quickly (even quicker than the usual amazon order and quicker than the shipping estimates) and did not require an additional shipping charge.  I have used the original Hot Tools Flat Iron since 2000, when a girl friend gave me one for a Christmas present that year.  It began to lose its heat on one pad after 14 years.  I am thinking that is a pretty good life for a flat iron!  It is also why I chose to order the same product 14 years later.  I am very well pleased with AMAZON HOUSEWARES and the efficient manner in which this order was handled.",5.0

I used to have a professional flat iron from my sister in law who is a hair stylist. When it broke I was devastated that it would be expensive to replace it.

So I bought me a new one!!! This straightner is great! And the price is worth it!",5.0
"I have try different flat hot irons after my first hot tools fell and broke. But none of the others warm as hot or give me that silky shine this hot tools iron does. The only bad thing about this iron is that if it falls it breaks easily, and the beauty supply stores in my area don't carry them anymore. I was very happy when I found it on Amazon, and am thinking of buying another one just to have it handy in case. I wish they would do one more sturdier. I truly would be willing to pay a little more for it. The description doesn't lie when it says that this flat hot iron will leave your hair silky and shining. A lot of people have asked me if I'm wearing a wig because my hair has a healthy silky shine, and at work I'm known as the lady with the silky long hair. Thanks to this product of course.lol",5.0

"I didn't buy mine from Amazon, but I figured a review would help anyone wondering if they should buy this flat iron. I've had mine for about 7 years now. I absolutely love this tool. I have thick, wavy hair, and this is the only flat iron that straightens my hair. It's never stopped working for me, the heat control is wonderful. I can straighten my hair on the lowest setting! It's very sturdy. I've straightened my hair every other day for the last 7 years with this tool, and I would never even think of using anything else. I would HIGHLY recommend this flat iron to anyone over and over again. It's wonderful!",5.0
"Before I bought this flat iron my hair would pop back up with waves with in a couple hours.
With this Iron set at the highest setting because my hair is so difficult to work with it actually stays flat!!
My friend told me about this specific one, I tried hers and I love it, I will never again buy one from the local department stores.
In case you wonder I have thick, wavy hair naturally.
I would suggest a good conditioning spray before you use irons though just to save your hair.
I love this iron....",5.0
"This flat iron lasted me over 7 years!!
I have thick, frizzy hair, and it takes me five minutes to straighten my hair!
I love this product/brand. It's seen me through high school and most of college, and I'm not about to switch!

The only downside is that it doesn't curl hair like some one the smaller flat irons do.

Anyways, love it!",5.0
I used this flat iron as a hairstylist in the salon so im very familiar with it. If you know what your doing and how to use it correctly it works great. Also I have extremely thick long wavy frizzy hard to manage hair and when im done its sleek straight and shiny. The only probly with these flat irons is they are easy to break. This is the secound one i have owned for personal use. The last one was dropped a couple times. Very high heat fast heating. I would reccomend using a flat iron spray with this to protect you hair at all times. I hope this review helps you,5.0

"I have curly hair that has a mind of its own.  When I found the Helen of Troy straighteners I rejoiced!  But after a few years you always need to replace them.  I was extremely upset when I couldn't find another HoT straightener, until someone told me that they were now HOT Tools.  This straightener gets VERY hot - hot enough to actually straighten my hair!  It is the only straightener that will actually straighten my hair and keep it from frizzing, even in the DC humidity.  When my straightener dies (which I'm sure it eventually will, but it's 2 years old and still kicking!), I will buy another one of these.  Excellent price, excellent product, excellent hair!",5.0

"I have thick wavy hair and this is the only straightner I have tried (and I've tried a lot of them) that works in my hair.  It has 20 temp settings and heats up quickly.  I can't say enough great things about this straightner.  It does seem to crack depending on how many times you use it or drop it, and when it does crack your hair gets caught in it... but other than that awesome awesome awesome!  No complaints",5.0
I got this same exact hair straightener in the summer of 2007 and it has lasted me till January of 2011 almost four years. When most of the hair straighteners last maybe a year tops this line lasts almost 4x longer and to be honest is the best straightener I ever had. I have had the in-styler and this one beats it by a lot. If you need a straightener and you have very thick and wavy hair this is the one for you. The seller got it to me within a couple of days.,5.0
It works really well and the price is a bargain. I have bought this one before and will continue to buy it.  I borrowed my sister's expensive flat iron and the Hot Tools works better.  It covers a lot of hair at once and only takes me about 7 minutes to do my whole head.,5.0
"This is the second time owning a Hot Tools flat iron.  The first one I had for at least 6 years, but it broke when it fell of the counter onto the tile floor.  I haven't been able to find one that worked as well as this one.  The prices on alot of the flat irons are outrageous.  Hot Tools works great and the price was great.",5.0

"I bought this 2-3 years ago when my cheap vidal iron poofed up and died within 8 months. If you do not want to spend a ton of money but want a straighter that is much better than conair, vidal and such, this is the one to get. I almost bought the smaller ceramic one but thought that maybe straighteners did not last so long and did not want to spend the extra money.  However, this one works way better than my old one and it was actually cheaper!!! If it breaks I will definitely buy the hot tools ceramic large one.  Right now I am seriously considering getting the 3/4 inch one so I can try the curling technique :) This is my first experience with hot tools and so far it is a great product!!! I just ordered a hair dryer, triple barrel waver and, ribbon curling iron because of how satisfied I am with this product!!!",5.0
"I have really thick hair, and I absolutely love this! I used at my friend's house and I normally have to straighten my hair 50 times with my straightner at home, and it doesn't even come close to the level that this striaghtener has done ONCE! I can't wait to buy my own!",5.0
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE WITH CURLY HAIR THAT NEEDS TO BE STRAIGHTENED!!!!

I have been using this make and model of flat iron for the past 8 years and will never again buy another one.  I have purchased many other flat irons ... even the most expensive CHI irons and none straighten my hair as well as this one...in fact, my hair is so curly that the other irons are a complete waste of my time and money. No other flat iron has ever been able to really straighten my hair. IMO no other iron is worth even trying to use if you have VERY curly hair.

They don't last forever but they last for about 3 years...IF you take it traveling with you in addition to daily (or even more than daily) use.  If you use it less than daily and don't ""check it"" with your luggage on frequent airplane trips with you, you will get WAY more than 3 years of use out of this iron.  The plastic on mine EVENTUALLY breaks...where they are still completely usable but it pulls my hair a little (only after 3+years with HEAVY USE) so I just get a new one when that happens.  The price is AMAZING!!

My hair is extremely curly (cork screws) and comes to my bra hooks in length when it is straight.  I am committed to THIS flat iron and KMS Straightening Cream FOR LIFE!!! I wash my hair every other day (to keep it from drying out), blow it FULLY dry with a metal or ceramic brush...then use this iron...>> and my hair stays ""board straight"" through all 48 hours (unless I get sweaty or it gets wet...make sure you keep an umbrella around if you straighten your curly hair)!!

After drying my hair...it takes me less than 5 minutes to get all of my hair perfectly straight (with 8 years of practice...but fast even for new users).

Enjoy!!",5.0
"I own this iron, im actually on my second one. This is the best iron I have ever owned, it gets really hot and does leave the hair smooth and straight. The iron also does last a long time. I bought mine from overstock.com it cheaper there and so is the shipping. I do reccommend everyone to purchase one of these irons especially if your hair is thick and curly. I had a conair flat iron years ago and it does not compare to this at all. I purchased the hot tools salon dryer and it is also great I feel like im at the salon in the comfort of my own home. Hot tools is a great brand there products are worth the money. I know people spend over 50 dollars purchasing a flat iron,but theres no reason too. The hot tools iron is so affordable and the results are great.",5.0

It's not the most expensive one offered. In fact it's the least expensive one offered. That does not interfere with the quality of the iron. I was skeptical because of the inexpense but my daughter told me she has used it forever and she thinks it is the best on the market. I agree.

"After trying all the drugstore rosacea products to moisturize my skin and calm the redness and itching down, I gave up hope that anything would work. I have moderate rosacea that sometimes becomes severely inflamed across my cheeks, nose, and above my nose. Some products would give me relief from symptoms for a week or so, and then stop working. I tried creams, natural and vitamin supplements, mineral creams, yoga, everything I remotely thought might help. This product is the only thing that has EVER worked, and it works quickly (drastically reduces redness within an hour usually- two hours at my worst inflammation), leaves no greasiness, and doesn't mess with my allergies. It is the most expensive beauty product I've ever bought, so it was risky, but I was desperate. I applied sparingly, maybe two or three times a week only to my cheeks, entire nose, and small area on forehead, and the jar lasted me one year exactly. I use fragrance/dye free generic moisturizer for my daily regimen, but this product is so effective I never needed to use it daily. If I could afford it, I would use it twice a day as my regular moisturizer. It leaves my skin smooth, velvety (instead of oily or dry) and free of the redness and bumps. It also dimished my acne outbreaks, which I think were associated with the rosacea, and the fine lines I was beginning to get due to the constant dryness. I love it so much that I told my dermatologist about it so that he could recommend it. Now I'm looking for a DERMAdoctor product for the severe eczema I have on the rest on my body.",5.0

"This extremely soothing cream helps any irritation caused by weather, swimming, dryness from sun exposure, or hormones.  I use this during the times when hormonal breakouts would occur, and I don't have any breakouts.  This makes my skin soft, supple, and clear, and it feels cool and comforting.  I especially like this for soothing ""spider veins"" around my nose.  I have allergies occasionally, and sneezing and blowing my nose makes those veins pop out.  This cream soothes the redness and/or swelling in those areas, so the veins don't show as much.  This cream also stops my nose from appearing red when those allergies manifest.  This is an anti-aging, anti-breakout, healing product that's very concentrated, and very, very high quality.",5.0
"I rarely write reviews. When I do, the product is either terrible or wonderful. It has to be an extreme to prompt me to write. Calm Cool and Corrected is the latter. Fantastic! I have Rosacea.

I put it on every morning and every evening. I've been using it now for about two weeks. I notice such a difference! The redness is much reduced and my skin feels great. It's really worth the money.",5.0

"Ok.  I admit it.  I was a real sceptic. After 20+ years of Dermatologist appointments, prescripition medications and over the counter remedies I wasn't expecting much.  I've done the antibiotics, the prescription cleansers and even Accutane. I've tried what seems like a bazillion over the counter treatments. What has made it more difficult for me to use products is that I have dry skin.  Products made to treat the acne portion of my Rosacea increase the dryness and redness.  Using a moisterizer or product to reduce the redness makes the acne worse. So I tried this. Not expecting much. And I can't believe it.  It immediately reduced the dryness and redness.  The inflammation improved. And the Acne? Started to heal. Really. I'm not kidding.  This stuff actually works.  As for the many reviewers comments about the price being high.  Think of it this way.  How expensive has it been going to doctors, paying for prescriptions or trying over the counter products you end up throwing out after 3 days?  If it works for you....then the cost is much less than all those other alternatives.",5.0
I have rosacea and as I get older it just gets worse.  I've tried over-the-counter and prescription creams and nothing worked.  Finally plopped down the big bucks and figured it was worth a try.

"I was fully prepared to hate this anti-perspirant after reading the reviews, but I wanted to move away from toxins. I am not yet ready for plain deodorant (I like my pits dry, thank you), and EWG's Skin Deep database listed this product in my comfort zone (anything 2 or under).

Application is, indeed wet, but it doesn't say that way for long. I can get dressed in under 5 minutes, but a quick blast from the blow dryer speeds things along. But what completely sold me on this product is that it works and it does not leave brown pit stains in my whites.

"I was a bit skeptical since having tried every product out there, however after one month of use I began to see results! I had suffered from underarm discoloration due to a so-called esthetician waxing and literally tearing off my skin from beneath both my underarms. It took several months to heal and resulted in several different product trials.

I read about this product online through the dermadoctor website and really wanted to try it. I thought it was a bit expensive for an antiperspirant but realized that I had nothing to lose.
Like I said before, it took about one month to see some results (fading), which is alot sooner than the bottle claims to work. However as an antiperspirant I was not impressed. I always needed to add another antiperspirant on top (one that contained aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gyceride, as the active ingredient--hope thats spelled right)which according to several studies helps with keeping away discoloration, especially with women of color.  I use Dove--and it helps with perspiration and keeping my underarms clear from discoloration.

It's been since July of 2009 since I tried this product and I have not had any return of discoloration and it feels smoother too. You don't need to use alot, and I know because I still have some left! I highly recommend this product!!",5.0

"This is the absolute best product and fastest way to get rid of keratosis pilaris (aka bumpy chicken skin). I'm sorry to hear that some did not have good results because this product was made specifically for this skin problem. When I first used it I experienced results after 4/5 days and then after another week my skin was smooth. Now I only use this occasionally when I have a flare up, yes, bumpy skin can come back, but as soon as I use this it's gone in a day or two. I have tried a number of other OTC products (Amlactin, most popular) but none work as fast and as long as this one.",5.0

"I work in fast food, and we always need to use sanitizer everyday all day to clean everything and eventually the sanitizer dries out your hands so bad, the ends of your fingers start cracking and peeling. Eventually they start splitting and becoming painful, like painful constant paper cuts. I received this from Sephora and I can tell you it works- within minutes, literally. You put it on, and you can just rub it in and feel it working. It's probably the closest thing to a cure- all  and works wonderfully. I would use it only once a day though because as I said, it works and it's strong. I really love this stuff. I wouldn't buy anything else. If you have constant dry skin, or work in fast food, this is worth spending your money on. It lasts a decent amount of time too. Please give it a try, for your own sake!",5.0
"DISCLAMER: I AM NOT A PHYSICIAN. THE CLAIMS MADE BY ME ARE PURELY ANECDOTAL AND HAVE NO MEDICAL BASIS AND IS INTENDED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THOSE WISHING TO TRY THIS PRODUCT.

I love KP Duty because it works!! I suffered for years with red, splotchy, dry looking, pimply skin on the backs of both arms. I also noticed a much reduced version on the backs of my legs and bum especially during the winter months. I, as a retired nurse, was able to figure out that what I had was keratosis pilaris. I scoured the internet for a remedy way back in the early 2000's and happened upon ""KP Duty"" on Amazon, and IT WORKED!
I exfoliate in the shower, apply a thin layer to the affected areas and work it in well, then apply my regular lotion to the rest of my body.  I found it works well to apply the lotion directly after a hot shower. It is important to apply KP Duty PRIOR to applying any other lotion. To see progress with this product you must make a habit of using the product daily especially if you have a bad case as I did. With regular use you should begin to see a reduction in the affected areas  after about 2 or 3 weeks. To continue seeing results you must use the product daily; this is NOT a cure, however, it will reduce the symptoms as long as it is used regularly.
A 4oz tube lasts me 9-12 months so the $50 price point is not so shocking when you consider the price point of many other remedies. For me, KP Duty is all I need for my KP:)",5.0
"This is a little pricey, but WORTH IT! I never had the stupid bumpies on my arms growing up, but I'm 30 now and I guess they can just happen sometimes- doctor said it's normal. Conditions come and go throughout our lifetimes and, this KP Duty cream is absolutely amazing. It really works. It makes the weird red, kinda-zitty, little things totally go away. Ahhhh, I feel less gross without them :)",5.0
"When my 1 year-old developed KP on his cheeks and arms, we searched long and hard for a product that would work on his sensitive skin.  This product is amazing!  I've used it regularly on my son's face and arms for two years and it has kept his keratosis pilaris at bay.  It smoothes the bumps and alleviates the associated redness that my son had on his cheeks. Can't say enough good things about KP Duty!",5.0
"When I finally discovered what KP is it explained what I've been experiencing on my uppers arms for years. I was skeptical at first, but after diligently applying a small amount of KP Duty twice a day I started to feel and see a reduction of redness and bumps. I think it took about 3 weeks before I really felt a difference. Two weeks reduced the ""chicken skin"" look. It's a little less potent than the Rx creams, but still does the job. Try to avoid skipping applications. It doesn't take long for the bumps to return. While using it I think I could confidently say it's reduced the bumps by 80%. Not bad!",5.0
"I have tried a ton of other products and this is the one I keep coming back to. I started out with the overly expensive scrub and this overly expensive moisturizer.  I found any good scrub will do the trick. What will NOT work is any other moisturizer, apparently.  KP Duty really does the job for which it is intended. I can immediately tell it as soon as it's applied.

I agree with everyone who says $36 for a 4oz tube is very high-priced and probably when I am no longer working I won't be able to afford it - that's the bottom line, but I'll keep buying it as long as I can. Nothing else works nearly as well.",5.0
"This makes your skin into baby skin smooth even with rough KP. HOWEVER... the price is murder. Unless your rich or something it shouldn't bother you.

If I remember correctly this stuff burns for 3 seconds once put on, but then a soothing relief afterwards. It really does make KP go away. Temporarily anyway while your using this product.

If you really want to get rid of KP, I suggest using this, and if theres a sunny day, apply sunscreen and get a tan on your arms. I heard sun tanning or exposure helps with KP. (for those who have farmers tan and don't get enough sun)",5.0
This lotion works WONDERS and when you combine it with the scrub it's even better. I am very pleased with my results.,5.0
"I have had red bumps on the backs of my arms my whole life.  In the summer they aren't as noticeable but in the winter they stand out like crazy.  I bought this stuff two summers ago and my arms cleared up within a month.  They looked so great that I finally didn't mind wearing sleeveless dresses to weddings, etc.  The only thing you have to be careful with is this will make your skin incredibly sensitive to the sun.  I used it up until April the first year and had the worst sun burn of my life, on my arms, that Memorial Day.  I also wasn't wearing any sunscreen so that may have something to do with it too.  Apparently it takes a lot of time to work itself out of your system.",5.0
"For those who suffered Keratosis Pilaris, this product is right for you ! I finally found the right product that works for me. I have tried lots of different products and nothing happened.

It's a little expensive, but it's definitely worth it!!!",5.0

I used it until the bottle was gone and have not purchased a new bottle yet and have not used it for about 3 months and have had no outbreak! My skin is still clear, clean and smooth. I think this is for sure worth a try if you have KP.",5.0
"I've had nothing but a great experience with this product. I have really bad chicken skin all over my upper arms, and then I have patches on my thighs and upper and lower back. After a few weeks the product worked really well on my chicken skin, the bumps will never fully go away but definitely smoothed my skin out and made the bumps a lot less visible. I'd definitely recommend this product, the only draw back for me is the price. I'd love to keep using it but at this point in my life I can't afford to spend about $40 for a skin care product. Quite honestly of all the creams I've tried for my chicken skin this has been the only one that has worked for me, but like with every product people have different experiences with it.",5.0
"I love it, totally hydrates my skin and leaves it smooth, even though it goes on a bit thick. More effective than drug store brands, but more expensive.",5.0
"I have had a case of keratosis pilaris for years, and this cream worked great! I noticed an improvement after the first application. My case is probably milder than that of some of the other reviews on this product, but it worked wonderfully for me.",5.0
"I've had KP on my arms, and on my legs for my whole entire life. It was something that I had just gotten used to, and dealt with. In the summer the sun somewhat would dry it out, and it would look better. However, during the winter it just looks awful. I just received the product two days ago in the mail, and using it first thing in the morning, and right before bed has already improved the condition, and made the bumps on my legs almost disappear. When i wanted to purchase this product I read mixed reviews from people, how it worked for some, and did not work for others. The point of the matter is, that this product does have the ability to work, and it works fast. My arms and legs, FEEL and LOOK smoother. Smooth skin is something I never thought I would be able to achieve in these places. Also, the bottle is a generous size I don't think I'll be reordering for another two months",5.0

"We bought this product thinking that it wouldn't hurt go give it a try, actually assuming it wouldn't work.  However, it has greatly improved the condition of ""KP"" skin.  There are fewer bumps, less each day, and overall appearance and comfort/health of the skin is greatly improved!!!",5.0

After a week of use I already noticed that the redness has gone down and my skin is smoother. Long term results include the smoothing of the bumps. The price is greater than some of the stuff my dermatologist gave me, but I feel it is well worth it for the great results!",5.0
Does as it is supposed to. Got years of built up gunk off of my flat iron- can't get much better than that.,5.0
"I have always had flat irons to come to their demise after a year or two of putting out. Never did I think it was because of the heating element having to work overtime, and under extreme pressure, due to the fact that I never cleaned them.

With this last flat iron purchase I decided to do a little different. So before this one died I decided to clean it. Boy does this cleaner work. Coated with burnt on gunk about 1mm thick, this job was not easy, nor was it too hard. It just took a while to actually get down to the plate safely, without damaging it. I know for a fact nothing else would have worked. This stuff is great.

My husband can now use this on the house iron too, because he always leaves black crap on the iron; and it seems to happen when I want to iron a white shirt, or my white jeans.

Actually it cleaned the clothes iron so well, that it now glides over the clothes again",5.0
"I tried one other cleaner for flat irons and curling irons, but it smelled nasty!  And what was worse, was that it left my 'Hot Tools Professional Spring Curling Iron' stinky.  Every time it heated up, it would smell quiet bad.  I still used it, but it was annoying.  Yuck.

This stuff is great!  It smells a bit, but the smell does not linger in the air or on the tool.  Also, I hadn't cleaned my iron for 2 years, and this stuff took any build up right off.  I sort of -forgot- I had sprayed it on.  lol I remembered 30 minutes later, and wiped the cleaner off with a damp rag, as it says.  I don't think it even damaged the iron! I also used it to clean the new 1 1/2"" Hot tools iron I got.

Anyway, this shizz WORKS, and if you are considering cleaners for your curling iron/flat iron, get this! :)

My only complaint is brought about by my anal-ness.  The label on the bottle came with bits of the ink rubbed off, as if it had been handled a lot.  But the bottle was full, unopened.",5.0

"You may have to spray iron a few times if you have a heavy build up, or very old styling tools.
This works, it works on Gold, Tourmaline, Titanium, Ceramic tools (flat and curling irons).
You spay it on UNPLUGGED, WARM irons, So the best time for me is after I've used them I clean them,
If I need to go over it twice, I will, after the first time if irons have totally cooled, plug them up a minute or so, then
unplugged the iron and spray it again. The irons SHOULD NOT be HOT, it tells you that on the bottle they should be WARM.
That's why I do the cleaning AFTER styling my hair, If this review has been helpful, please click yes below. Thank you.",5.0

They say you can use rubbing alcohol and other products to clean your flat iron but none worked as good as this did for me.",5.0

She brought one out, told me they were a 'special buy' and there were only two left.  Hhowever, she also said that since there were only two left, that the purchase would be unrefundable.  The sales price was full price, $40.  I explained to her that if it were on clearance, say 75% off, then I would risk her no refund policy.  I cannot fathom anyone selling an item at full price and saying it is unreturnable!

"I am hair stylist so the marcel hot tools is perfect for me, if you are comfortable with that type of handle this iron is a classic favorite of stylist, now I have been tempted to get the no handle new style of iron but honestly I prefer the option to be able to use the handle for tips of the hair, it makes sense and without the handle you need to get a glove for heat, who needs 2 parts of an iron when there is no time to look for gloves, put them on and you still need the handle for certain styles but with enough skill you can avoid denting the hair.",5.0
I prefer marcel irons over traditional clamp irons. I've bought Hot Tools almost ever since becoming a Hairstylist 18 years ago.,5.0
"I love this curling iron! My hair is temperamental and sometimes difficult to style. This iron does a great job of creating the exact look I want that lasts throughout the day. The lever does not have a spring and is on the opposite side of most curling irons--this takes some getting used too, but is great once you get used to it. I love that you can set the temperature you want as well as release the handle to spin as you release the curl. The iron doesn't have an automatic off, which is AMAZING because you constantly get an even temperature which cuts down on curling time (you don't have to wait on it to reheat like most)and cuts down on ""frizzy curls."" Despite using the iron everyday, at the highest temperature setting, I have yet to experience any ""fried ends""!
Hope you enjoy as much as I am!!!",5.0
"I have a 3/4 inch hot tools marcel curling iron and I loved it, but my hair is getting pretty long now, so it's too tight of a curl. I ordered this one and it's perfect, just what I was expecting.

"Please don't ever stop carrying  this Hot Tools Marcel iron, it is THE BEST. Once you get the technique down, no other curling iron will be acceptable. If you've never used one, it's not spring loaded, and it takes a little practice. Don't forget to not touch the tip of it to your skin, cuz there is not rubber there and you will burn yourself.

"The design of these irons is meant to be used by professionals, meaning pointed away from the person holding it toward someone sitting in front of them. It's difficult to explain without seeing it, but while on a traditional spring iron, flipping the iron around doesn't matter, on a marcel, it requires you to hold the iron completely backward from how it's designed. There are a lot of other things that make a marcel tricky to use, but this means it's even harder to use on yourself than on someone else. So when people complain about the difficulty, they're not exaggerating. I was able to figure out how to use it reasonably well the first time I used it, but it took me at least a week of daily use to be fairly comfortable with it and another week before I was using it without thinking about it. I've been using it for months now, and for a while I thought it was a good iron, but I didn't really know if it was any better than your standard iron. That is until I forgot it while on a trip and had to borrow an old school iron from a friend. The difference is huge. First, a spring iron is actually a lot of work to use after getting used to a marcel. Second, the control and quality of curl with this iron is so much better. It's definitely worth the cost. If you don't curl your hair a lot or aren't comfortable with a normal iron, a marcel might not be worth it. But if you curl your hair regularly and have decent coordination and hand dexterity, this is a great iron.",5.0

"I have never been THAT great at curling my own hair but this totally changed my hair game! I have pretty thick (mostly straight) hair that is about at my collar bones... I had been trying to wrap my hair around a normal spring curling iron to get a soft wave but it just wasn't working... enter the Marcel Iron.  It takes a little getting used to, as everyone will tell you, but I honestly think it is easier than a clip and it must be better for your hair!

I don't do any fancy spinning. In case you're interested, this is my process:
- I divide my hair into three sections, bottom, middle, and top/crown because it's so thick
- I clamp at top of a piece of hair (that is so personal, I hate when people say to grab a ""one inch piece of hair""... you just have to experiment and do what works for you. Also, the size of the piece of hair totally changes the look)
- I spin once (either away from face or alternating away/towards for a messier look) to get the hair wrapped in a loop around the barrel
- Hold it for a second (since I'm looking for some volume near the root... a must when you have thick, heavy hair),
- Then I just drag the iron out (clicking the handle as I go down). I don't add any more spins or it makes it too curly
- Brush it out with fingers after hair is cool.

I get a million compliments and all my friends ask me to do theirs! FYI - this is what hair styles use (usually) and I can almost make my hair look the way my sytlist does = the ultimate goal! The marcel iron gives you more control, I think. This guy is so reasonably priced that it is totally worth a shot - Good luck!!",5.0
"There is no other curling iron out there worth a damn compared this one!  I always get compliments on my hair and get asked ""how do you get that curl?""

My hairdresser uses this specific product. Heats up in less than a minute. There is an option to lock the handle so it does not rotate.

I have been using the same kind of curling iron for 7 years. It curls very nicely. You can also use it to straighten your hair if you have to. It takes a while to get used to using this type of iron.

It has multiple heat settings for different hair types, which is great for making long lasting curls! I can't stop playing with my new curling iron.",5.0
"By far my favorite curling iron if all time. It heats up quickly and the temperature range fits any hair tpye. If you place it on the highest heat setting, curling the entire hair takes less than 10 minutes and the curls stay all day. This is a must have for every woman.",5.0
"I'm a cosmetologist and this meets my expectations in every way, I'm super lucky to say the least.",5.0
"I have purchased many of these over the course of 5 years mainly cuz I misplace them and I have a habit of wrapping the cord around the iron and it shorts out which is the chance you take when your not careful, but I love them and these are what I got used to using in cosmetology school. I saw a lot of reviews stating that it wasn't easy to use and all because of the clamp that holds the hair, you can see clearly the type of handle and clamp it has before you order it and this is a professional ceramic curling iron that they use in many salons so sometimes it does take some time to get the hang out it. But the curls last all day and you can sleep with them in wake up and do a little touch up and you're ready to go.",5.0
Excellent,5.0
It arrived as promised and is what I expected.,5.0
Love love love this curling iron! I don't know why it took me so long to finally purchase one that works!,5.0
"Why did I not get this sooner??!!  This changed my hairstyling completely.  It didn't take too long before I became accustomed to the marcel handle and I love it!  It's also great that I know how hot the curling iron is, so that I ensure that I don't sizzle my hair.  Love this curling iron!",5.0
I love this curling iron!! It's amazing.,5.0

Stylist used it so I bought. Works great,5.0
"best curling iron out there!!! Just be aware that from continuous use of twirling the iron, the wire can get loose and you have to replace the iron. It's a great price though and they will work with you if that were to happen shortly after purchasing them. They should hold up for a while. It holds the curls very well",5.0
Great professional tool,5.0
Love this product!!! have multiple sizes and have used them for about 15 years now .... It's a professional curling iron. You definitely have to know how to use it and practice with it. Created for professionals. This is exactly what a professional is looking for in a curling iron. When doing hair for a wedding party or just on myself the iron needs to heat evenly and be extremely hot in order to get quick even-heated curls. Should not be given to KIDS!! .... if you are not familiar with this product then just buy one from walmart or kmart.,5.0
"I never really curled my hair before because in the past it has never lasted and took forever to do. Recently, a hair dresser used a hot tools marcel wand to curl my hair for a friend's wedding and I loved the way it turned out and my hair lasted all night! I purchased the 1"" barrel - curls are bigger than I thought they'd be but the wavey/curly look is perfect for day-to-day wear. My hair glides very nicely with minimal catching because there are less ""joints"" than a traditional wand. I learned pretty quickly - I'd say about an hour or less of watching youtube and practicing on my hair before I was happy with the curls but I didn't have to break any habits of a traditional curling iron. I definitely prefer the marcel over a spring curler hands down!",5.0

"I was surprised by the lack of spring, but after a little bit of practice, I got the hang of it. It's a wonderful curling iron. My stylist recommended it for me. I love the Hot Tools brand.",5.0
Love this curling iron! Keeps curls for a long time! Definitely always buying Marcel in the future!,5.0
Great curling iron love the marcel handle .  It's better then the spring handle,5.0
Love it!,5.0
"Love this curling iron! There is a learning curve in perfecting your curls, but once you learn it's great! I love to use it as a wand to get a different look.",5.0
"I've had this iron for years, it's amazing. Advice for beginners with the Marcel style irons, watch tutorials or see if someone can show you how to use it. Or just stick to regular spring irons. Also, I'm a bag fan of holding the iron shut and wrapping my hair around it for the big curls! Love this iron! !!!!",5.0
GREAT PRODUCT!,5.0
"Best curling iron ever, I love it. My curls hold really well!
It does not have the spring in the handle which I appreciate, but when someone that is not used to this type of curling iron tries to use it, they usually burn themselves trying to hold the end.",5.0
I'm loving this marcel curling iron. Definitely takes a few minutes to get the hang of the spinning handles. I love how quickly it reaches high temperature & stays there making the process much faster. Curls look so soft and smooth.,5.0
Love it!!!,5.0
I ordered the 1.5 inch and loved it so much I had to have the 1 inch. It does take a little bit to get use to but once u do it's amazing.,5.0
"I absolutely adore this curling wand!! It gives more beach waves rather than curls with the smaller size but it depends on what you want.

Be careful, it leaves rad burns if the iron gets in contact with skin directly. I have to burn scars on my thigh from prom. :/",5.0
Hot tools hold up to professional use. Good price and service,5.0
"Good so far, have had problems  with this brand in the past.",5.0
"I really like the versatility a marcel iron provides. This gets hot fast and makes gorgeous curls. I have found out of all the sizes of barrels, the 1 inch makes the prettiest of the desired curls for all hair lengths longer than 2 inches.",5.0
I used this for my trip and it did the job.  For touch up when you are in a hurry.  The heating setting are perfect.  It get hot enough for my hair and I require a lot of heat.  I would recommend this product.,5.0
This iron has variable temp settings which I really needed since I have hard to curl and baby fine hair.  Handle material is somewhat soft and provides a good grip for holding.  I will always use Hot Tools!,5.0
I love this curling iron! It does have a learning curve to understand how the handle works as it twists but overall I am thrilled with this purchase.,5.0
I love this curling iron! It's a little tricky to use at first but there are YouTube tutorials on how to use a marcel iron.,5.0
"It was a little tricky to figure out at first, but after a few times I have it down and it is seriously the best curling iron I have ever owned.  After I curl my hair I brush through it and the curls last for days.  People are constantly complementing me on my hair and I almost don't want to share with them my hot little secret!! I go to a high end hair salon and I loved the way my stylist would curl my hair.  I googled for curling irons that looked like the one he was using (thinking I would be spending hundreds), and finally found the match. The price is awesome and the curling iron is amazing!",5.0
I am a stylist and I have always had good luck with the hot tool irons I've been using them for 20 years for professional and personal use you will love them in all sizes,5.0
"I ordered this as a gift for my girlfriend, whose a stylist, for Christmas. The product is great she has several other tools made by hot tools and loves them. I unfortunately ordered the wrong barrel size and this was the same size she already owned. The seller was awesome about it. I informed them that I didn't want to take the sale from them because of my mistake and asked them if they had the size I was looking for and that I would just exchange it. They were very prompt in their response and informed me they were sorry but did not have the size I was looking for and that I could just return it. Return was very easy and the seller was extremely nice and quick to reply.",5.0
"I have always used a traditional curling iron with the spring in the handle, but they always end up wearing out and loosing their holding power. I was a little hesitant to purchase the manual kind, since I've never used one before. I'm am soooooo glad I purchased this. It's pretty simple to use once you get the hang of it and the curls are a-ma-zing! I have very fine, thin hair that typically doesn't hold a curl, but these curls last all day! If you're on the fence, buy it! You won't regret it!",5.0
Works well. This is the best curling tool I have. I have tried several different ones before and this is the best.,5.0
This product heats up fast and can curl my long think hair in a matter of minutes! Once you get used to the spinning mechanism of the Marcel iron there's no going back. It's the best.,5.0
Nice professional iron. The ability to control the temperature is a must for pro use and this one delivers. I recommend this iron for professional use!,5.0
"Heats up fast and gives you curls in just seconds, plus it's so easy to use!  Love it!  Also, retail price is $55.",5.0
"Really enjoying this iron! With different heat settings its perfect for all hair types. You set your temp, turn it on, and with in seconds your ready to curl! Curls last all day. I have medium length thick straight hair and this iron does the job. It keeps it heat from curl to curl and has an extra long cord. I do suggest if you have not used this type before to practice rolling it with it off until you get the hang of it. Very different from spring loaded ones and you will get a nasty burn if you don't know how to use it. But once you master it you will love it and never purchase a spring loaded one again!",5.0
This was a gift for my daughter.  She discovered this iron when it was used by her hair stylist. She wanted one for herself and was thrilled with it.,5.0
"This was a birthday for our daughter...she loves it!  It took her a few tries to learn how to use, but her hair styles look great.",5.0
I think Hot Tools is the best brand of curling irons. I did not have any experience with marcel irons prior to this purchase. It took about 2-3 times before getting the hang of it. I had to watch a few you tube videos because the packaging did not come with instructions. I feel the marcel iron produces better curls than the regular spring clamp irons. I will purchase another marcel iron in another size.,5.0
"This is my second one of same model, last one lasted 6 years using it everyday. Worth the little extra it costs.",5.0
"It took me a while to get used to the handle on this curling iron and not being able to touch the tip, but once I was able to get the hang of it, I love it! I feel like this curling iron really has some heat to it which some of my other curling irons were lacking. After about 4 or 5 curls, I'd have to hold the curling iron in my hair what seemed like forever to get it to curl. Not with the Hot Tools curling iron. This curling iron stays hot the entire time that you are using it and my hard to curl hair always looks great.",5.0
"I have naturally curly hair, so why would I need a curling iron? Well, I like to have big full curls once in a while, yet most curing irons do not get hot enough, and just like with flat ironing my hair, it needs something that gets HOT. This curling iron works great, the curls last long, and is the right size.",5.0
"I haven't splurged on a full-size bottle yet, take that into consideration if you like. I received a sample of this, so the effects I experienced were temporary and immediate. I LOVED IT. When I used it, my skin looked smoother and was far less shiny for a long time. I would use it on evenings I wanted to look particularly foxy since I didn't have much to spare. I was able to eke out maybe 8 uses from my sample, and it was just a small packet.

My skin is normally pretty oily and prone to breakouts. Shine is always a problem, so I found this stuff quite lovely.",5.0
"Recent 'hormonal changes' have done a number on my skin. Since I've always had large pores and mediocre skin, I decided to try the Picture Porefect and the Wrinkle Revenge I cleanser. It took a few weeks (like four), but my skin has now stabilized with smaller-appearing pores and a much better appearance overall. It also cleared up (mild acne) on these products.  At first it seemed drying, but then my skin seemed to get used to it and my skin is not dry seeming at all.

They're not the cheapest products, but you get what you pay for, and small amounts go a long way.

I note some older reviews make mention of a bad fragrance - perhaps DermaDoctor removed that fragrance since then, as I don't detect any smell whatsoever.",5.0
"I bought this product to use on casual days when I wouldn't want to wear any foundation or look too ""made up"", and it is perfect for that. I have really large pores, and Picture Porefect makes them look acceptable and it de-shines my oily skin. I wear Body Guard over it, and I throw some little dots of concealer on any zits I may have that day. I hardly ever wear foundation anymore, and I get compliments all the time on my skin!",5.0
"Beautiful results, clear eventoned skin.  Love this product, non0sticky for bedtime, and delviery time is wonderful. thanks mam jersey",5.0
I really like this product and that my skin looks less oily and my blemishes are going away. It took about 2 weeks to really see the different but now I am totally hooked. My skin barely needs makeup!,5.0
"This product works as stated. I started to notice an effect after 48 hours. Pores are minimized, but I also use the SPF30 clarifying and matifying cream during the day and the cleanser #3 twice a day. The face need to be clean before application. Love it, just ordered my second bottle. I dab it on my face and I used 1 to 2 pumps twice a day. LOVE IT!!",5.0
"This product has worked great for me.  I have only been using it for a week, but so far I see results.  My face is smoother and my pores seem to be smaller.  I do agree that it does have an odor, but it seems to disappear immediately when it dries.  I have had no problems with peeling or it being sticky, but I use a very little bit.  Just one pump will cover my whole face.  This is a plus since it is a little pricey.",5.0
"When I saw this product on the Dermadoctor website I was really excited to try it. It shows the photos of the clinical trials and how the pores reduced in size. I bought it even though it was expensive and I'm very glad I did. Right away I saw a difference the first time I used it. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and have to say that I can't believe the difference it has made. A bunch of the pores that were enlarged have closed completely, and the ones that were very big have gotten smaller. I'm also using 10% glycolic pads that exfoliates my skin and so I believe that is why my results have been so good. If you have blackheads it will take longer to close the pores because they have to be clear before they can actually close up. It does work very well at removing the blackheads, but if you have a severe blackhead problem your better off going at it with a 2-step approach with the glycolic acid before applying. Especially if you want quick results.",5.0
I have had large pores in my cheek and nose area all my life and have tried a BUNCH of different pore reducing products. This is the only product I've tried that has made a noticable difference. I put it on first and let it soak in completely before putting on any other makeup and have not had any problems with my other makeup coming off. I'd say that Picture Porefect reduces my pores by approximately 50%-75%.,5.0
"This product is amazing!!  I inherited large-ish pores (especially on the apple-of-the-cheek area) from my mother.  She began using the product, and I could noticeably tell the difference on her.  I was quite skeptical, but I bought the product anyway.  After about two months, I began to tell a significant difference in my own skin.  The pores appeared smaller, and even the production of oil in my face reduced over time.  From what I understand, you have to keep using it for the effects to continue, but it is definitely worth it.

It's a bit pricey, but you certainly get what you pay for -- and it's worth every penny.",5.0
"Opi is the best quality polish I've used, and I especially love their Bubble Bath color.  If you're a fan of nude colors, this is it.",5.0
"Real deal.. Genuine OPI polish. Love this color, first time was at a nail salon and they wanted 20$ to order me a bottle and i found this online for A LOT less, 15$ less and free shipping. The color is so pretty it is dark but its a mix of almost black and burgundy and when it hits light it sparkles some.  not like glitter and you see the colors that are mixed its very pretty",5.0
"This is the best color by OPI. You will see that it matches just about every outfit. The color is kind of an orangish red. It's bright and vibrant. I wore this color for many years until they discontinued the shade. I am happy OPI brought it back. The polish is bright, clear and leaves a great shine. It's durable as all OPI polishes are. You will be satisfied with your purchase. I take this color to my nail place and they always are able to use the color with ease. I prefer to bring my own colors due to infection, thinning of polish and color variety. You will like this polish. I have used OPI for over a decade and trust the quality of the products they make.",5.0

"I bought ""You're such a BudaPest"", the color is beautiful and exactly what I expected(after looking up the color on pinterest to see in different lighting). It went on smooth and needed 2 layers. Holds up well with OPI top coat. It doesn't match my other OPI bottles because OPI changed their bottle around Sept. 2017...but the bottle is legit and OPI Quality. I purchased this bottle by going to the official OPI website and putting this polish in my cart then it redirected me to this page on Amazon to complete my order. It was over all a great experience, shipping was fast due to it coming straight from an Amazon wear house and not a third party. I am very confident in the authenticity of my product.",5.0

"I've used OPI Samoan Sand for years and still love it. But I wanted something (kinda) new and chose Put it in Neutral. I prefer a neutral color, makes my fingers look longer, and grow out and little chips are not as noticeable. Put it in Neutral is a bit lighter than Samoan Sand, but what I really like is that it is semi-sheer. I used base cost, 2 coats of enamel, and top coat. My nails look beautiful. My skin is rather pale so if your skin shade is darker than fair, it will look differently on you. For now, I'm in love with this color. Highly recommended.",5.0

"I  have been wearing white polish for many, many years, way before it became popular. When I first started wearing it I could only get it from Revlon and it was great but more recently I've been wearing OPI's Kyoto Pearl but when I went to Ulta recently they aren't carrying it any more. Promptly came home and found it on Amazon (of course) and bought two! Please don't stop carrying it!",5.0
Love the color.,5.0
Ive always loved a more subtle look on my hands and these two colors fit perfectly. I have the happy anniversary and funny bunny.,5.0
Perfect for me.,5.0
"I had used Opi nail polish a few years ago and really wasn't that impressed with it. Mainly because the brush was thin. I decided to give the black a try and boy am I glad I did! The brush is now much wider and this is by far the absolute best black nail polish I've ever used. I could go with one coat alone because the polish has a way of flowing into whatever streaks the brush may have left on the nail when first applied. I hope that makes sense. If not, take my word for it. Get it. You won't regret it. The pic is with only two coats. If you have found this review to be helpful please indicate this by pressing the Helpful button. This lets me know the time and energy I take to review products isn't for naught. I am not paid for my review. Thank you kindly!",5.0

"I love this polish and this particular shade.  I wear it all the time, and I'm delighted to get it.  You need to always order at least two, so the shipping charges aren't more than the item.",5.0
"Love the color and OPIs formula. It only takes two coats to fully cover the nail, the polish is durable and lasted about 2 weeks before it started chipping. Very satisfied with this polish!",5.0
"Hands down, my favorite color from OPI.",5.0

"Opi continues to be a great nail polish. My package was delivered on a day where the high was 15. The bottles were solo cold having sat outside for many hours. I opened the bottles and test painted for color match. First the cold didn't affect them at all! They both went on smooth, even and not too thick (as one might expect from a super cold paint).  About the color match, the Opi Red was pretty much spot on, exactly as pictured. The K.M.I.Brazilian was a %92 match, the end result being just a tiny bit lighter than pictured. Nothing to get your panties in a bind about, I'm very happy with both.",5.0
"A friend was wearing Put it in Neutral last week and I had to get a bottle! It's the ideal nude--not too pink and not too tan. She has dark tan skin color and it looks gorgeous on her, and I have pale skin and it looks just as beautiful. Goes on smoothly and easily. It's now my go-to neutral.",5.0
"I normally do t do my nails myself, I find they don't dry properly or stay sort of mushy and sticky or wind up all over the place. Thought Id give it another shot with a new bottle and a well known brand and I am so pleasantly surprised with this polish! Ive gotten so many compliments, I got the color I am amethyst which is totally a light blue, not purple, but still super pretty. Will definitely be purchasing more colors.",5.0

"I purchased OPI Im Not A Waitress because I loved the color and how long it lasted when I got my nails done at a salon. Decided to do them myself to save money. Applied a base coat, two coats of OPI color, a top coat (base and top coat by Sally Hansen) and then another layer of top coat the next day. The photo I uploaded is after a week of wear. I did dishes, cooked, typed, opened soda cans, and even chipped ice off my stairs - all I have is a small gap at my cuticle line from a bit of nail growth and a tiny chip from the tip of one nail on my right (pre-dominant) hand. The secret seems to be to make sure all layers cover the actual edge of your nail...plus getting a good nail polish that won't peel, like OPI.",5.0
Wonderful color that goes with everything. The polish dried fairly quickly and the coverage was excellent.,5.0
"If you're looking for something that's unpretentious and classy, this is it. The color or lack of is awesome. Gives you shine with a tad of light almost se through tanish great. I love it!!!",5.0

**I purchased this shade from the OPI Infinite Shine line** but I love the color and will forever keep it as a staple in my polish collection! It also lasted longer than most polishes (Saturday to Sunday without a chip).,5.0
This was a Christmas gift and I believe she was very happy with it.  Is her favorite color!,5.0

Beautiful long lasting color.,5.0
"I got the color Alpine Snow, and its my go-to white nail polish. It has such a crisp, opaque color, and works great. There's a lot in the bottle too. OPI is a bit more expensive than other brands, but has great nail polish.",5.0
"This is a fun and bright color that looks great with everything!  I have gotten many compliments on it, from young and old alike.  It goes well with my fair skin tones, and I think it would compliment most everyone. The quality of OPI is great and lasts about a month with top coat.",5.0
Probably my favorite color. Love it.,5.0
My favorite color of OPI! I receive compliments all the time. Has more of a purple hue to it.,5.0
Lovely color. Got it at a nail salon and liked it so much I had to buy one for myself. I really like the OPi brush too - wide enough to only have to use 2 swipes to cover the whole nail,5.0
Strange the print out of opi is in a different font size than store bought bottles but it gets the job done. Good color.,5.0

"Pale, but just enough color!  Perfect for a wedding, vacation or spring/summer.",5.0
love this as a daily shampoo,5.0
favorite shampoo,5.0
"I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.

I would recommend this for every day use for normal to slightly dry hair and scalp. It's gentle enough for regular use, but does not remove conditioning and styling products from my hair. For those with dry hair/scalp, a rinse-off or leave-in conditioner will be needed. I have normal hair with an oily scalp and found that just one application of this shampoo left my hair and scalp very well conditioned and I needed only a light leave-in conditioner for the ends of my hair. However, I could not use this daily without the additional, regular use of a clarifying shampoo to remove the conditioners and excess oil from my scalp. It is a clear, fairly thin texture with the slightest hint of a coconut scent, it lathers quite well and a little goes a long way.",5.0
Love this color!  Always get compliments on my nails when I wear it.,5.0
My polish arrived quickly and I love the color!,5.0

"Used this color for my wedding. LOVE IT! Almost a mauvey/pink color, not too light or too pink. Very classy.

If you've used OPI before, you know it's one of the most high quality nail polishes you can get. Lasts forever, doesn't chip. Check out the pics and see if it's the color for you!",5.0
I absolutely love the color. Its just the red Ive been looking for. This formula stays well on my nails which is great because I use my hands all day for work. Its so shiny that I don't need a top coat like most other polishes. I will be getting the nude colors next! Thank you OPI!,5.0
Beautiful color.,5.0
"I was bored so I bought this stuff and painted my toe nails. Went on easy and man does it have staying power. I don't have any nail polish remover, so now my toe nails are just black. Shiny, but black. I feel like the Krampus.",5.0

"I'm generally a natural-nails kinda gal, but when I dress-up I like a bit of polish and this is it.  I take it to the nail salon because I can never seem to find just the right pale, sheer pink in their stash. I ask for a clear base coat, one coat of this color (""It's A Girl""), and a gel top coat. It is a beautiful sheer polish that will last a full week or longer when done this way.   ",5.0

"i like to take pictures of my feet with or without shoes on, and i have an overwhelming # of pics with this color on my toes...it's too fabulous - reminds me of the perfect friday night and makes a gal happy.",5.0
"I have already ordered this product as well as OPI's glittery silver, rust and gold sparkly nail polish.  The coverage is fantastic and I have found other sparkly clear coats to put over whatever color I'm using and that makes it even more glittery
In the sun.

The product above and all the other OPI sparkly nail polish give terrific coverage with just two coats.  It is thick and sometimes I add a smidgeon of polish remover to make it less 'coarse' while preserving the fantastic color with a little more ease.
I would definitely give a 'go' to the blue, rust, gold and silver sparkly colors

If you like glitter and you love sparkly you've gotta' try these products!!

"This polish wears like iron!  It is thick for a glitter and coats very well.  The color has lots of shimmery blue, silver and a tiny bit of pink.  I will wear it on my toes all summer long.  Love, love, love!!  It says my hubby wrote this, but I am female! lol!",5.0
"I recently purchased this polish because I love glitter and I am a nut for blue. Glitter? Blue? How could I go wrong? I certainly did not with this polish. OPI Simmer and Shimmer is beautiful. It applies smoothly, dries fast and feels surprisingly smooth to the touch, even before topcoat. Application of topcoat just enhances the beautiful sparkle and scintillation of this glitter. It is long wearing, for a glitter, too. I wore this for four days with no chipping or tip wear. Love this polish!",5.0

"Both colors are available in this one Amazon listing, this is the only way to review each of them.

For both of these: Usual OPI high quality, goes on smoothly and easily, high quality brush.

""Rosy Future"" is a lightly-pigmented pale translucent pink with a shimmering periwinkle lavender-blue shine in the light. Perfect color for a one-coat transparent color or, as in the first picture I am uploading, a translucent pink-iridescent shine two coat color.

""Pompeii Purple"" is actually more of a deep dark pink magenta than a purple, but it has a sheen of purple-blue iridescence in the light. The second picture gives the best idea of the base color, but the third picture shows the blue purple iridescence with flash.",5.0
Nice and subtle,5.0
My favorite - especially on my toes. Goes with everything.,5.0
I love this shade. I get so many compliments. Very pinky and fun!,5.0
Gorgeous white/cream color with just the right amount of iradescence. Looks gorgeous on tan and not so tan feet/hands. ,5.0
"I am OBSESSED. Not only is the color a perfect shade of lilac-nude, which is a chic professional look, it also dries quickly and stays on chip-free for weeks! I am so blown away by this nail polish. I pick at my nails a lot and they still stayed practically perfect. People even asked if I had gotten a professional manicure! I can not recommend this polish enough.",5.0
Love this color for summer!,5.0
"This is for the ""Got Me Into A Jam-Ba-Laya"" color.

Usual OPI high quality polish and brush, took off one star because it is nothing like the color in the picture. The color of raw salmon flesh, but creamy.

After using it a few times, I thought I should note that with two coats, it still looks pretty streaky and the polish is a bit too thick to get a really even coat each time. The picture shows what it looks like after three coats, what I'm unable to show is that it's still not completely hardened after a coat of Seche Vite fast-drying top coat and 45 minutes. I'm going to add a few drops of OPI polish thinner and try again... I'll update if I can get it to go on better after thinning slightly.",5.0
"OPI is the best,in my opinion,nail polish that we women can use, It goes on so smoothly. The shades of the polishes are brilliant,each stroke  just glides across your nail making your plain,dull nail into a work of art! I usually put two coats on and if I happen to have some OPI around I will add a top coat.
If you slip up and happen to acccidetly smear the polish off the nail onto your,not to worry Amazon has got the answer for that. If you are like me and others like me,who have illnesses like Parkinson's don't worry when your body shakes at odd times you will have a  messy finger. Well Amazon has the answer for that,look wher to chosee the OPI Polish is sold and there you will find a greenish clear Pen that will keep your nails or rather the skin around the nail looking good,I don't know what you call it but just go to the OPI section and there it will be!
Try it and be patient because at first it is a little awkward,but you must persevere, and then you will have your reward,your nails will look like Picasso worked his magic! OPI has several shades to choose and you might want to practice on those pretty Iight pearly shades first. Good luck,and be sure you grab the pen,and doing your own nails will save you big bucks! Oh, when you use the pen,have an old cloth there to wipe the tip of your pen clean and the point nice and pointed!",5.0
"I loved this color, but it doesn't seem to be available now.  It is lightly crystallized and goes on perfectly. Try to find it again for me.",5.0
"Always love OPI. I've tried many others but 90% of my polish purchased now are OPI.

A true skin color nude that doesn't dissapoint.  I wear it in its nail envy formula which helps keep my nails strong and grow quickly.  (Yes, it works)  no chipping, but I still use the original nail envy as base coat.",5.0

"this shade is so beautiful in the bottle.  it is a less opaque that i expected, but I imagine this would look good to bring out the color over white or ""natural"" nail color or add a cute hint of glitter to black or navy.  if you wear it on its own, the more coats equals more opaque.",5.0

My new favorite color!!,5.0
Exactly the color I was hoping for!,5.0
"A beautiful neutral pinky flesh tone, with a hint of opal. It's not frosty or satiny, or glittery, but it's not flat matte either.  The faint opal color is perfect.
Amazingly long-lasting, also, on my terribly thin nails.  Polishes tend to chip within hours of application .on me. .but this one is still doing quite well after a tough 2 days.  I'm impressed.  That's like..a 200 percent improvement for me.",5.0

Lovely color. while it may appear blue on the website here its more of a periwinkle. I had been given a small bottle form my daughter to dry earlier this spring so I knew the shade I expected. I almost didn't purchase this as I wasn't sure it was the same. It was.,5.0
"Honestly, I love this color. It is a coral color and is close to the picture provided. For better and smoother spread, I highly recommend rolling and shaking the bottle. For optimal color, I recommend applying a single layer first then apply a fuller second layer. The coral color pops and is extremely juicy! This is a perfect mid summer or early fall color but can be used in an ombre for the fall.",5.0

OPI is always good.  I love the color.,5.0
"I finally found the perfect nude color in Samoan Sand! The only drawback that I found was that I had to apply 2-3 layers since the nail polish is pretty runny and clear. The reason that I gave it 5 stars is because this is by far my favorite nude color, and I don't mind applying multiple layers. I'm wearing 2 layers in these pictures.",5.0
Great polish - dries fast and looks great.,5.0
"Big fan of OPI.  I just love this color.  I had a professional saloon use this product on my toes over six weeks ago.  Other than the fact my nail is growing out and showing ""new"" nail, the manicure looks as great as it did the day I had it applied - no chipping.  And that includes a 10 day vacation with much hiking and walking in state parks.  OPI just holds up well.",5.0

"I had been buying some cheaper polishes at the corner drugstore, but finally got fed up with their goopy consistency and flaking off.  I came back to OPI and it's like night and day.  OPI goes on so easily and their colors are amazing.  I can almost go two weeks without re-doing my toenails.  This color is more of a pinkish bronze than a coral bronze.  It shimmers beautifully in the sun!",5.0

"I got the AmazON, AmazOFF color and it is superb. Smooth and easy to apply, mixes well and stores well and comes out vibrant and beautiful.

Great OPI color. Not sheer and wears well.,5.0
"I had had my eye on this cheerful pink polish for a while, but with the vast color options OPI provides, I kept running across other hues I could not pass up. After debating on different pink shades for the entire summer, I could no longer put this one off, and wow, have I been missing out! My only upset regarding this purchase is that I didn't buy it sooner and have this perky shade to sport the entire summer! It's a ridiculously obnoxious pink that I feel ladies of all ages can find endearing when they want to feel a little more feminine. It does take at least 2 coats to cover your strokes, or maybe it's only a problem for an amateur like myself, but the end product is well worth the layers! OPI is always my go-to brand and they never disappoint!",5.0
"Great color. It's a neon pastel blue, and I think it's perfect for the summer.",5.0

I hosted a dinner party at my place and spent days cleaning and prepping food and chopping veggies and washing my hands over and over again, and now the day after the party and clean up, these hardly have a chip in them! I totally recommend this polish. Its not quite as sparkly as I had hoped, but its still a fantastic color.",5.0
This is one of the best colors that OPI has every done! It is a a very vibrant pink and just makes me happy to look at it. I was very pleased to find it because the one I had clumped up (probably because I didn't secure the top). Glad summer isn't quite over yet so I can wear it.,5.0

Love the subtle gold/bronze color - my new go to neutral.  Long lasting and came well packaged.,5.0
Great color with the perfect amount of shimmer!,5.0
"This is a beautiful shimmer periwinkle that leans a tad more blue. The formula is a bit watery compared to the other OPI colors, but still OPI level quality. It is really sheer on the first coat so it could be used as a nice topper. It still builds up nicely despite this. You need 3 coats for full opacity, and you can get away with 2 coats if you don't care much about seeing bits of your nails still. There are no issues with brush strokes or pooling either. It is also definitely a hard to find color in stores so I would really recommend and stocking up if you like this color. Overall, I definitely fell in love with this color and I can't stop staring at my nails lol.",5.0

"OPI is the very best nail polish I've ever used.  This particular color, ""Tickle My France-y"", is notable, but not brash and ""in your face.""  It's an interesting neutral. HOWEVER, I'm sorry to say that you can get all the OPI colors for several dollars less per bottle at Target and Wal-Mart.  I really like to shop via Amazon, but can't justify the cost differential. :(",5.0

OPI rarely disappoints. I believe it's one of the best. Received this bottle in perfect condition and in a timely manner. Lilac is one of my favorite colors and this is pretty true to the color. I am a nailpolish fanatic - I get my nails done every week - and this is definitely beautiful!,5.0

If you like a certain color in your girlfriend but she never gets it right. Buy her the color and send her with it to the shop next time. (Never be asked if you like the color again!!).

"OPI nail polishes are IMHO the top of the line -- I've been using them for well over 15 years, and some of the colors I have are at least 5-10 years old! If you store them properly, they may still separate, but they totally retain their color and quality (same for Essie)! I go to a salon to get my nails done, and I generally like to bring my own colors so that I can do touch-ups or repairs. And I generally do my own pedicures, which with two coats along with my Out The Door topcoat, last for two months at the very least! I have paid full price for a nice OPI color, but you just can't beat Amazon for selection and price. Highly recommend! (I'll update this with photos as soon as I use this particular color). It is a very neutral, pretty champagne light frost color.",5.0

The photo of the purple polish shows a very deep rich purple color, well this color for Spring is not like that.  After two coats, I might describe it a very deep purplish-mauve color.

"Lincoln Park After Dark is by far and away my favorite nail polish color.  It's the perfect blend of black and aubergine.  This is my go to polish since it looks good with everything I wear.  OPI polishes are consistently great quality and with proper application technique last for a long time.  In fact, the polish I have on right now is five days old has gone through one night of drinking, one day of baking, a baptismal party, a family reunion and has exactly one tiny chip out of it.  If that isn't a good quality nail polish, I don't know what is!",5.0

"This color is lees blue than grey... This has been my color for a month, through 2 trips to the nail shop. The first time I got a colorful design, because it felt sky blue-ish..

"I am not much of a glitter or sparkle gal, but this one is truly, a gem. It looks like gems come to think of it!

I layer it on as an accent nail ; using a pale color for the first coat, layers of Servin' Up Sparkle  two layers of top coat. The result looks like diamonds encased in glass. It's a wow kind of effect .

This may be the only glitter coat I use, but it love it, and I hope that OPI will not discontinue it!",5.0
"I actually love this color because it's not too yellow but it's still warm. It's a great nude for my coloring, which is sort of light olive skinned, with yellow undertones. It does look sheer when you put on the first coat, but I find that layering on a second coat makes the color more opaque and it's perfect. It has just the right sheen that it looks like almost like I'm not wearing any nail polish and that my nails are pretty and healthy and buffed. I have gotten many compliments on my hands while wearing this color -- people say my fingers look long and pretty.",5.0

"Loved this OPI nail polish color. The glitter is very intense itself with the first application. By the third you've got glittery, perfect, unique, shiny nails. However as a recommendation to everyone who buys any OPI shimmery nail polishes, if you apply it directly to your nail, later on removing the nail polish will take you forever, since it's hard to come off with the polish remover. So to avoid this tiny problem, I apply a coat of clear nail polish first, let it dry, and then continue by applying as many coats of the shimmer nail polish as I want (depending on the intensity that you'd like). The combination of the colors in this shimmer vary from reds, silvers, blues, turquoise, and some golds. I really recommend this product, and for the price....I recommend it even more!!!! Really happy with my buy.... I'll be getting more pretty soon!",5.0
This is perhaps my favorite OPI polish. It is made up of  halogen dots sprinkled all over a base coat which is mostly clear and like most of OPI sparkly polishes it can be worn over  any other polish (as a topcoat) or several coats all on it's on. I use it all over the place; mix it with other sparkly polishes or over a pearlalized  product but however you use it you will love it and I guarantee that---just don't buy to many 'cause I'm coming back for more!!!!,5.0

"Beautiful deep real color. The only downside is that even with a base coat, it left my nails stained a weird green color. For this reason, I would not buy it again. But it is a beautiful color. I've never run into nail staining with a base coat before. I own a TON of OPI polishes and this has never been an issue before. The nail place I go to had the same color, same polish so I tried theirs and same staining occurred.",5.0

"I followed the direction of the person who said use a base coat and several top coats to keep the big flecks in place.  Thanks for the advice.  The other thing I would add is use only one coat of the polish and make sure you get a few of the chunky flecks on each nail.  Two coats is overload and you won't get the nice clean look like in th photo.  The polish really sparkles, glistens and is beautiful.  Less is more.",5.0

"This shade dries completely different then it appears in the bottle. I was unsure, but loved it by the end of the day. Always an OPI fan and a bit new to the liquid sand line. Some colors just do not look good in the sand and tend to just look like you slept directly after painting your nails. This color looks awesome w/ the sand and is nice and shimmery.",5.0

Over all, this is a great color and product.",5.0

"This OPI color was a one season opportunity. I had a pedicure done in this color and fell in love with it, but could not find it anywhere. This is a great color it is a cross between a silver, blue and green depending on the light you are in. I just adore this color. I love this color and was excited to see it on Amazon! I was just excited that someone had it!!!!! Tickled just tickled with the color and quality. If you are familiar with OPI this is just another gem in their collection.
One coat provides good coverage but I prefer two coats just so that my color is even. I love it!",5.0

"I bought Danke-Shiny Red and it's an incredibly gorgeous ruby red shimmer. It is opaque in 1 coat, but the color does deepen slightly with a 2nd coat. You can definitely get away with it in 1, but I'm usually a 2-coat girl and prefer the color being a bit deeper so I use 2 coats. It also dries very shiny. The formula is great in that it's not too thick or thin, glides on the nail easily, doesn't pool, and isn't prone to any brush strokes. It also levels out quite nicely. I haven't had any major chipping concerns, but I do use Seche Vite top coat. Only con is that it's rather messy to remove and can stain a bit, but it's so beautiful that it's worth it.
This is one of the few polishes that I always get compliments on. It's one of those polishes that catch the eye. Definitely my #1 holy grail red. If anything, I can probably say it's my favorite polish in my collection.",5.0

"The product I received was false.  The picture the product was shown was in a small face cream jar.  What I got was a tube like ointment.  This is not what I order!  Although it was the same brand; however, it is deceitful to display something else that you are claiming to be selling.",1.0
I've been using this for about a month or so and it hasn't worked one bit.,1.0

"My trusted facial technician raved about PCA skin care products and highly recommended I try out the acne cream to help with my minor breakouts. I bought the acne cream and the ""Clearskin"" moisturizer.
I get sporadic breakouts in the T-Zone area and all I usually use is Cetaphil Oil Free Face Wash and Aveeno Moisturizer, twice a day. Anyways, excited to try out this new product, I liberally applied the acne cream after washing my face and went to bed.
The next few days, I was horrified. My skin was INCREDIBLY dry (which never, ever happens), incredibly flaky, and red. But if that wasn't bad enough, I also began developing cystic-like, huge acne bumps (which also never happens to me).
Thinking that maybe I applied too much at once, I started using the acne cream at night once every three days and the moisturizer every morning.  My skin continued to be unbearably dry and I began developing more and more acne with each day.
Needless to say, I've stopped using the product. Since then my skin has returned to normal.
I'm incredibly disappointed with PCA skin products, because I really wanted them to work. Maybe this product isn't suitable for sensitive/normal skin but all it did was dry out my skin and cause more acne.",1.0
"I love this acne cream, but the consistency of it from this seller was completely off. It seemed watered down and smelled old. It was a lot cheaper than it is at the store. I guess you get what you pay for!

The original product is amazing. PCA is an awesome brand.",1.0
Does not work any better than Clearasil and costs about 20 times as much. You can buy three tubes of Clearasil and get the same ingredients  mostly and the same benefits and get a lot more of it. This is a tiny little jar that is way too much money in my opinion.,1.0

"Let me begin by saying, I love Jane Iredale.  I've used her makeup for years, and I've never had a problem.  I'd never used her mascara before, as I'd been quite partial to a cheaper brand that was discontinued a few years ago.  I decided to give this one a try.

Within two hours at work, my colleagues started asking if I was feeling OK, another said I looked as though I hadn't slept in three days (to be fair, it's a possibility in my profession).  I looked in the mirror, and instead of the picture-perfect lashes I left the house with, I had bare lashes and Raccoon eyes down to the apples of my cheeks.

Well, one makeup removing wipe later, I was makeup free, but significantly less zombie-esque.  Consider me disappointed.",1.0

"This product broke a week after I received it. ""Brushing"" your lashes up with the heated wand does nothing, rather the curl is achieved by pushing or bending the lashes back. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, and it did hold the minor curl it gave, but by the time I got the feel of the product it was broken. I get a more significant and rounded curl with a traditional curler, even if it means re-curling once more later on in the day.",1.0
"I agree with the other lady.  It gets warm, but myself and a few friends tried it, and it does not curl the lashes.  When you contact Blinc, they are sarcastic and unprofessional.  The Kiss Me mascara can not be used without curling your lashes first so the mascara sucks since when you take a regular lash curl after applying Kiss ME mascara to lashes, it pulls the ""tubes"" off.",1.0
"It does get warm, but it only pushes my lashes up, which doesn't curl them!  I would like to return it.",1.0
"it never worked, never heated, never curled.  I tried several times and just threw it in the trash.  BIG waste of money...I should have paid closer attention to the other reviewers that said the same thing.  Sounds like a VERY inconsistent product.  For some it works...others...not so much.",1.0

"When I first got my BLINC heated lash curler, I loved it.  All the positive reviews I read were a reality.  It worked great.  Unfortunately, after only a couple weeks it stopped working.  It seems like the area the battery goes is loose and just poor quality.  I am not sure if it has to do with that, but i tried fixing and replaced the battery, still nothing.  I wanted to exchange, but alas I am just over the 30 day window you get for this item.  It would be fantastic if I could just get it to turn on!",1.0

Originally I thought I had bought my last lash curler but once I tried it I didn't think it worked very well.  It took too long to curl the lashes and it didn't do a good job.  I ended up using my squeeze one (not sure what it's called!) anyway.  Not a fan of the lash curler but I will continue to buy their mascara!  That stuff is awesome!,1.0

"Just what I said. I swear by Blinc products. I've used only their primer and mascara for years. I've used traditional clamp-down, heated eyelash curlers but this is the new style and thought I would try one from a brand that I trust most.

It's crap. Sorry... still love their other products but this one is crap.

It was also easy to leave the button up or to push it up on accident when I was carrying it. I recommend leaving it in the case it comes in if you decide against my review to get it. The batteries were dying because it was apparently on when it wasn't intended to be.

But seriously. Don't waste your money.

It gets one star only because it didn't cause me to lose all my eyelashes like another heated curler on the market.

Consumers beware. It's very scary when you buy something and your lashes all fall out. Now I can't even get a nice result from mascara. I have to wait months and that's if they grow back!",1.0
While I was very excited to get this I am disappointed in the results.  It does not seem to curl anything.  I've tried multiple times to use this and it does not seem to work for me.  I have long thick lashes that are very hard to tame.  This does not help.,1.0
This heated lash curler doesn't work! I sent it back immediately and when I spoke with the seller she said that it wouldn't work forever. You see this does not require a battery so I don't know how it would work. The seller also told me they were changing this curler to one which requires a battery.,1.0
As I said...it's a piece of junk.  Great idea - too bad.  Do not buy this!,1.0
"Loss of money. With great expectations I tried the product but did not work the curler. I have long lashes, without any curve, my lashes are completely straight. the curler did not work for me. I did not get any curve, and the results are disastrous lashes. I think I would work another kind of curling as one with traditional type, such as scissor but heat. For me it was a bad purchase, the product did not fulfill my expectations.

Prdida de dinero. Con muchas expectativas prob el producto pero el rizador no me funcion . Yo tengo las pestaas, largas, sin alguna curva, son totalmente rectas. el rizador no funcion para mi.
Al probar el rizador trmico, not que no obtuve alguna curva, y el resultado son pestaas desastrozas y las puntas abiertas. Creo que me funcionara otro tipo de rizador como uno con forma tracional, como tipo tijera pero trmico. Para mi fue una mala compra, el producto no llen mis expectativas.",1.0
"BLINC heated lash curler (BAD DESIGN)

Before I could even try the product after I got it from the mail, I got really frustrated because I did not see any opening to be slided open to put in a battery, as the instruction said.

There are no pictures on how to slide open the end of the curler or to show where the end is. The instruction is simply terrible when the consummer could not find where on the device to slide open and cannot use it.

There is no additional instruction on the BLINC web site or anywhere else in the Internet.

I had to send them an email to their generic inquiry email address. No response yet. And, I cannot use the curler since I could not open it up to replace the battery.

Can anyone help?

I regret to say that the product design of this curler is just terrible.",1.0

Like previous reviews, the bottle is rigid and not like the ones sold in certified retailers like the department stores, etc...

The scent is similar but there's definitely something wrong with this facial cleaner.

Not pleased, DO NOT BUY.  Picture below shows deteriorating bottle label.  POOR IMITATION.",1.0
"The soap is great, BUT the pump is a notorious problem.  It's not really ""broken"" but very cheap.  Here's how to fix it:

- unlock the pump and remove all soap.  Clean the pump in warm water.  Submerge and see if bubbles come out of the pump.  This confirms it is sucking air from the tube and will unclog any hard soap in the tube.
- when you unlock the pump, make sure the grey lock ring stays on the cap part otherwise it will rise up/down with the pump which obstructs the pump action.
- After that is secured, keep (patiently) pumping for a couple minutes.  You will know it works when soap is going into the tube and rising.  This is a weak pump so it will take time for the soap to get to the top, where it'll finally dispense.

This is something nobody should have to deal with especially for a $70 bottle of soap!  This pump needs to be upgraded.",1.0

When reading the ingredients for the shampoo you will see that it uses sulfates, no different than any store brand product and far more expensive. Not to mention the bottle is very small so it really lasts only a month. The only product I was satisfied with was the gel because it was rather light and not sticky.

I have long coarse dry wavy to curly hair and have had issues with not getting enough moisture to stay in in my hair especially in the summer. I used this shampoo and conditioner together and later separately thinking the issue could be that it was  moisturizing too much either way it resulted in me having greasy hair by the second day and I eventually started having breakouts on my neck shoulders and back were my hair hits on my body.

I called up customer service. They sent me a replacement (along with ADG). Replacement was equally bad. I got a refund.

Please keep away from Amazon perfumes. If you go through all reviews, you would find that my case was not a stray incident. I strongly feel that they should do something to ensure the genuineness of the products they have on inventory.

Edit : Even though I mentioned I would never buy perfumes from Amazon, I bought two :&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burberry-Brit-By-Burberry-For-Men-Eau-De-Toilette-Spray-3-3-Ounces/dp/B000E7STWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burberry Brit By Burberry For Men.

Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces</a>&nbsp;These two are awesome perfumes and would recommend to anyone. In retrospect, I feel blaming Amazon was not the right thing for me to do. They do have good perfumes, but not all the perfumes they have are good.",1.0
I found this product in mall and it smell good. but it was too costly in the mall and a friend of mine asked me to buy it online to get it cheaper. Now am realizing cheap things are not always good. It is just like water. very very diluted.,1.0
"Love the smell of the cologne so I wanted to give this a try. While the smell is something approaching 'similar' to the cologne, there is something extremely off-putting about the balm. What made me truly not like this product, however, is that it felt like I was smearing a slew of synthetics all over my face and the tightness this balm left after it dried was a uniquely odd, if not uncomfortable, sensation.

After a couple of times using it and further noticing that a crust roughly the consistency of toothpaste appeared around the cap, I read the ingredients, and Lo and behold I hadn't the foggiest idea what 90% of these are:
Water, Cyclomethicone, Propylene Glycol, Fragrance, Diethylhexyl Sebacate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Glycerin, Allantoin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Bisabolol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Disodium EDTA, Galactoarabinan, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3 Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Limonene, Linalool, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Panthenol, Phospholipids, Polysorbate 60, Retinyl Palmitate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Xanthan Gum, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)

^And this list actually differs a bit from the ingredients as listed on the product I received, with the above actually reading as more benign than they read on the balm I received.

After a bit of research here's what I ultimately found regarding many of the ingredients in this product:
HIGH concerns: Neurotoxicity, Endocrine disruption, Persistence and bioaccumulation, Miscellaneous, Multiple, additive exposure sources, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Contamination concerns, Occupational hazards, Biochemical or cellular level changes
Other MODERATE concerns: Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)
Other LOW concerns: Ecotoxicology, Data gaps, Enhanced skin absorption

Needless to say, this aftershave balm is now in the garbage.

It is at the very least disappointing to pay nearly $30 for an aftershave balm that it in all likelihood harmful to one's health with sustained use.

I mean... $30. This carcinogenic goop is the best Calvin Klein can do?",1.0
"I am familiar with this product, it came perfect, labels, box, etc.
It smell the same BUT it doesn't last after I use it.

For some reason I use it and in less than an hour the smell is gone.

It seems to me like a fake product.

I tried to return it but I am not allowed.",1.0
"Product is old. I couldn't smear it into the skin. It was chunky and the consistency of the old timey shoe polish. It smelled like a rotting orange. I am not joking. Wasted my
Money.",1.0
"I actually tested the smell of CK Eternity for men EDT at Macy's and I liked it.  I ordered it from Amazon, since it was way cheaper than in Macy's.  But to my disappointment, and as many others have already pointed out, the smell of the bottle that I received didn't match the original (It smells like cheap soap water with a citrus tinge!).

This is second time such a thing happened (two out of two).  The last time it happened was like two years ago, and I thought I would give Amazon another chance -- I thought the products sold by Amazon LLC (I didn't remember who was the seller last time around) will be original and fresh.  But not so!!!

Either the products is fake, or is not fresh -- but definitely it didn't smell like the one I tested at Macy's.

I strongly advise anyone thinking of buying this, DON'T buy it from Amazon.  Bye it from a retailer.
**YOU CAN'T RETURN** this product to Amazon.  My money has gone straight to the garbage.

However, like I said, the original CK Eternity for men EDT is a good product, just not the one I got from Amazon.",1.0
"Wanted to love these but actually glad I hate them because they are pricey. Granted, I have a pretty sensitive nose, but the smell of these is just awful and I can't wait until I run out of these. Way too strong-scented.",1.0
"Don't waste your money.  One, it doesn't work.  And two, the cap is so hard to undo I would struggle to open it every time (1-2 x a day) and it has a very strong floral scent.  Did not like this.",1.0
Dried up as soon as I put it on. Helped out with the pain but failed to mosturize.,1.0
"Disappointed with the quality of this product. At first it was so soft and gelly I couldn't apply it, now it's so hard I have to scrape it.",1.0
Did not last. Did not apply smoothly. Going back to Clinique brush on liner.,1.0
"Great color, unfortunately it doesn't stay put.",1.0
"I was so excited about purchasing this product.  Looked to be exactly what I wanted. Then I tried it. The color gray was too dark, almost black.  Very difficult to apply.  I will say, it lasts all day and doesn't rub off. But It took me a long time to get it even close to how I wanted it to look.  I would not recommend this product to a friend.",1.0
"Horrible, dry, and smudges. Such a waste, its hard to get it on a brush and even harder to get it off the brush and onto my eyelid. Then it's annoying to look in the mirror and see that it has rubbed off and onto my brow bone (not attractive, btw).",1.0
I was so excited to get this so as soon as it came I popped it open. The packaging was covered in sticky glue. (And still is because I can't seem to figure out where is coming from) It totally dried out after only two weeks. Turned clumpy and hard and won't go on smoothly.,1.0
I thought this was an actual jet black liner. Instead it has glitters in it. Lots of glitters. I'm never gonna use this liner :(,1.0
MY pot arrived all dried up. Some contents had even spilled down the outside of the pot and dried. It looks like it has been in this state for some time. I'm unable to use it unfortunately.  As I live so far away its not worth sending back. Very disappointed :(,1.0
"This smudge pot came extremely dry and pretty much unusable.  I usually don't write reviews - actually, this is my first Amazon review, but this product is so bad, it's worth spending part of my day writing a review on it.  I decided to splurge on some make up, and I was excited to receive it, but it turned out to be way worse than any drug store make up I've ever used.  I would never purchase this product/brand again.  I'd return it if it weren't such a pain in the butt to so. Instead, I just threw it away. I'd give it zero starts, but that was not an option.",1.0
"I was so dissapointed with this smudge pot! It was about five days after I bought the product that the whole pot dried out. At first it went on really smooth but after it dried out it turned into a chalky mess that flaked off so easily! I tried to take out the dry eyeliner on top and get to a more smooth liner on the bottom but the whole thing was just a big mess. Even when it went on smooth after I first purchased it, I had to put matte black eyeshadow over the liner to make the shade darker. Don't waste your money. Try MAC Fluid Line or Clinique Brush On Liner instead.",1.0
This makeup goes on greasy and has very little coverage except making my skin look yellow because I have a very light complexion. It also made my nose breakout.,1.0
Love the product have been using it for years but my god with amazon and the shipping lately. 10 days later and I still don't have my order!!!,1.0
"I have ordered many times from Amazon, and this is the first time I was not happy.  When we received the product and took the top off, the pump part had been opened, and most of the makeup was inside the lid, losing more than 1/2 of the product.  We love the product, but the shipping/handling was very bad, we were very unhappy.",1.0
"I can not quite put my finger on why but I hated this product.  It gives minimal coverage.  The color was not right for my skin tone so I took it back to Sephora and exchanged for the next lighter color. That color did not suit me either.  I don't think it gave me the glowing, dewy look that I hoped for in a foundation.  I recently got a makeover from Laura Mercier and I love their foundation as well as concealer.  If you really want to add a glowing look to your skin I would recommend adding Artificial Light by Smashbox Cosmetics to any foundation that you purchase.",1.0
"FYI.  First time I bought Vincente longo thru Amazon because I have prime membership.  When I received the item, it was already opened & looks like some use a little spoon to scoop some of it out.  Nasty. I had to throw it away :(---",1.0
"I applied it with a brush for a light coverage finish and found that it did not settle into my smile lines. The Bisque color blended perfectly with my skin and there is no line of demarcation between the foundation's application on my face and my neck.

This make up is cruelty free, made in Japan and is oil-free, fragrance-free, hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic. Cruelty free in Japan is an oxymoron because the Japanese are depleting our whales, etc.

Those are the pluses. Here is the big problem. Because it was so expensive, I foolishly saved it for special occasions. It dried out completely after only a few months althought I closed it properly. I contact the company's customer service only to be informed that there was nothing that could restore it or that they could do, so I have to toss it. What a disappointment!

I tried using the dried up contents of the compact it with a damp sponge, it let me apply the make-up but it felt tight on my skin just the way pancake makeup of years gone by felt.",1.0
Have used this moisturizer before and i love it. Unfortunately this time i ordered it i received open and spilled all over inside the packaging,1.0
"In addition to the small amount of lotion, this product was like free hotel lotion in its quality. The lotion was separated in the tube (part clear watery liquid and part thick cream), it was not smooth or silky nor did it absorb or hydrate well.

Not worth the price--take the free lotion with you the next time you stay in a hotel.",1.0
"I use this product and buy it routinely from Sephora and love it but Amazon does not store this item in the proper conditions nor does it check the expiration dates. The item I recieved had completely lost its integrity and was a running water like fluid and had lots of condensation, all signs of shelf life expiration and improper storage conditions.",1.0
The consistency of the product I received was very bad. It looks like the oil is separating from the main lotion and it comes out as a glob. It may be a bad batch or fake product - was definitely not happy about this considering all the other positive reviews. Be careful about buying this from Amazon as it could be a fake.,1.0
Skin feels dry almost immediately after application. Ineffective product.,1.0
Very effective at... turning my face to ash; likely the worst facial product I've ever used & threw it in trash after maybe 8-9 uses. Avoid!,1.0
I bought this with high expectations since it was a little more expensive than other moisturizers and Jack Black generally has good products but I really don't like it. After I put this on my face still feels totally dried out and not at all moisturized. I do have very dry skin but I've never had this problem with any other moisturizers.,1.0
"The cap broke off on arrival.
The scent is not the lavender like smell from other Jack Black lotions.  Smell cheap like free hotel lotion
Amazon does not refund this product.
For the premium price, its not worth buying.",1.0
"Ive been buying this product for years, this is the first time Ive ever purchased it on Amazon, and the look, smell, feel, and consistency of the one I got from Amazon is completely different than every other bottle Ive ever bought. I don't know if I got a bad batch but this is nothing like what Im used to. You can see my pictures for reference. The dab on the left is the last bottle I had from Sephora and the one on the right is from Amazon.",1.0
made skin so dry it felt like it was burning. I will now use Neutrogena Healthy Defense for half the price. So disappointed!,1.0
"Leaves face feeling refreshed, but after a few days of using it I have embarrassingly noticeable flaking skin all over my face that wasn't there before. Seems to be drying out my face instead of moisturizing it.",1.0
Makes my face red for some odd reason. Synthetic chemicals maybe,1.0
"It just doesn't work.  I'd hoped it would, as I have very thinning hair.  I'd come to terms with it, but a friend suggested that this treatment has an excellent reputation.  Well, it did not work for me at all.  It smells potent.  Feels like it's doing something as it sometimes would sting a little, but it did nothing whatsoever and was a complete waste of money.  Do not buy this product.",1.0
"I wish there had been a review of this product before I decided to purchase it online.  The first, and therefore main ingredient is alcohol, which is very drying to the hair.  The product boasts in claiming to stimulate the production of Sebum, however the serum does more drying to the hair than creating any secreation through oils.  Please do not invest in this highly expensive, yet very adverse and ineffective product.",1.0
"I have been using these product for 20 years and it is the first time the ampoules are not cutting properly and resulting in pieces of sharp glass stuck in my finger and on the floor, and spoiling the serum at the same time which makes it unusable. on 12 ampoules, 2 had this problem which makes them even more expensive since 2 are unusable. Very disappointing ...",1.0
"Purchased this product to combat excessive shedding. The reviews were pretty good, so I figured I'd give it a try. Used as directed, twice during week 1. My shedding increased. Will discontinue use. If anything the product is making matters worse. Complete waste of $70.",1.0
after using the product my face broke out in a rash.  I went back to kiehls men's care and my face cleared up within days.  would never buy this product again.,1.0
TOO MANY CHEMICALS IN IT  My dermatologist said not to use it,1.0
"too expensive and nothing changed. i will never buy this again. thanks to fake reviews i spent all my money and nothing changed. i have the shampoo , and dietary suplement , i used all of them together , it did not change anything. i started using nioxin products now,i think when something is expensive we believe that it is gonna work. but no it doesnt work.",1.0
Useless purchase. Used it twice or three times a week and haven't noticed any change.,1.0
"I got this product since a week ago and immediately started to using it. im adding the viall 3 times per a week also taking biotin 1000mg  , Now after a week my hairfall got worst, actually I have to say super worst. I paid $65 to make myself bald. it realy disapointed me",1.0
This item arrived incomplete and was listed new.  It was missing 3 tubes.  Very disappointed.,1.0
i don't have sensitive skin and the creme was about the same as oil of ole everyday sun screen.  My problem is the pump. On my first order the pump stopped working when there was 25% left.  The second purchase the pump did not work at all. I give up on this product.,1.0
"The Phytocyane ampoules treatment is too expensive for the results that I've got (quasi none). However, I highly recommend the Phytocyane revitalizing shampoo for thinning hair, it gives great body to thinning hair.",1.0
not for me.,1.0
"Arrived as an empty tube. Was hoping this would help my 6 month olds eczema, as we have had success with the mustela cleansing cream and moisturizer. Very disappointed in the quality control. Will think twice before buying these products again.",1.0
I paid almost $7 for a tiny little stick of this stuff that's about the size of my pinky finger. So crappy for the seller to mislead buyer like this.,1.0
One of the worst moisturizers I have used.  Pretty much any drugstore brand provides more moisture... I don't get the hype.  The only positive for me was the smell.  It is also too thin in my opinion.  Facial Fuel by Kiehls is a much better alternative.,1.0
"this is the best chap stick money can buy, but you can only buy 2 at a time...anyone know where I can buy more at once!",1.0
"It's a good product, easy and convenient to use on my baby's chapping cheek, and it did heal the skin. However, the package is terrible. With normal use for one month, the plastic was broken this morning. How I dare to use it on my baby's cheek anymore?",1.0
My face breaks out after using this. Highly disappointed.,1.0
"I buy this for my child quit often, but this order may be an old product or not every time she use it get rash",1.0
"I just gave this a star because I think it might be a good product for someone else. I was having a sudden breakout of acne and decided to use it based on very good reviews, but all this does is make my face more oily and more acne. I will not recommend this.",1.0
Way to runny. Smells like bug spray. Doesn't come close to Doves men's face lotion. Disappointed that I spent so much on this. You don't get much either. Avoid.,1.0
Threw this away because it made my boyfriend break out!,1.0
Ok cold cream. Not for the money. This brand tends to be disappointing for the price and claims.,1.0
"After using this daily for a couple of weeks I began noticing pimples, especially on and around my nose and eyes. I stopped using it for a while to see if perhaps it was something other than the product. My skin cleared up within a day or two and I had no further breakouts. However now after using it in the morning for a single day I'll have breakouts beginning by the afternoon. This is unfortunate because initially I really liked the product!",1.0
Didn't really help with my baby's dry lips.,1.0
Pump was broken when it arrived. Disappointing for a name brand.,1.0
"Caused me breakouts.  A few months back I was experimenting with some new more natural face washes, and at the same time I used this as a moisturizer, and I was getting major breakouts.  After switching back to benzoyl peroxide and getting my acne under control I needed a moisturizer and decided to try this again thinking that maybe this wasn't the cause of the breakouts since I tried a few new things at once.  Within a week I got huge pimples around my nose and on my forehead.

If it wasn't for the breakouts I'd say it's pretty good, but its not for me.",1.0
"When I use this face moisturizer, my face still feels very dry:(.",1.0
Very unhappy with this. Leaves my face red and dry after an hour. Cetaphil works 10x better and is way cheaper. Not even interested in their other products if this is what I can come to expect.,1.0
"I thought I am very immune to acne and stuff. This lotion proved me wrong. I have tried many different creams and lotions, and never had acnes accept once before. This moisturizer caused acne after couple of days of use. Returned promptly.",1.0
"I use several Jack Black products regularly and LOVE all of them, so I was excited to replace my Kiehl's moisturizer + SPF with a Jack Black one. Initial use was great... And then the breakouts began. I haven't had acne in 10 years but within 3 days of using this product red bumps started appearing. They itched and looked almost like ingrown hairs. I stopped using the product and they slowly went away. A few weeks later I thought I would give it a second try. I did spend $27 on the little bottle after all... Breakouts returned within 2 days. I'm surprised and disappointed that I can't use this product.",1.0
The Jack Black Double Duty Face Moisturizer may work as advertised but I thought the it smelled like cat litter.,1.0
"AWFUL PRODUCT! It has its pros in that it does not feel greasy, smells good, and feels nice. I've used this product before but had bought it at Neiman Marcus. This must have been sitting in the Amazon warehouse for a long time and gone bad. It gave me a horrible skin rash and has completely wrinkled and dried up my face. I had to get prescrption medication from my dermatologist and will have to wait 2-3 weeks for it to heal. This may make your skin dry and look scaly (like a snake) due to the excessive wrinkles it will create.",1.0
"First off, I have never written a review about products I have bought on amazon. I decided this product line was so horrible that I needed to warn others to use at their own discretion. I was using some girly products before this and decided to get some face products for men. It ended up real bad. My skin has been blotchy, red, and for the first time in 4 years I have been having problems with acne. With all the other products I have used I have never had this problem. Oh, and I have been using the exfoliant, daily cleanser and moisturizer (by jack black) as the instructions instructed.",1.0
This product is basically a sunscreen and nothing more.  It is labeled a moisturizer but doesn't moisturize the face at all.  a $5 bottle of Neutrogena for Men will work 200% better and not leave an oily sheen on your face.  Just another high $$ product on the market that does nothing!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!,1.0
This moisturizer is not worth the price. I came from L'Oreal Mens moisturizer at half the cost expecting something amazing. Unfortunately it made my face feel dryer than wearing nothing at all. Big disappointment,1.0
"I wanted to like this product, however, it made me break out.  Unfortunately, I will go back to separate moisturizer and sun screen",1.0
Why do they say it has no parabens when methylparabens are listed in the ingredients!  That seems like false advertising to me!,1.0
"Does not do the job. I bought it as a moisturizer, something to put on after shaving that way it would serve as a moisturizer after I shaved, while serving as a sun blocker. It does not work, I have to apply it several times to moisturize. I don't know what it has but moisturizers are not a very strong ingredient. Personally, I would not recommend it.",1.0
"I have relatively dry skin.  Especially after a hot shower and a facial scrub.  Without lotion, my face gets a bit ""ashy"".  I had been using Nivea for Men's Revitalizing Q10 lotion, but decided to give Jack Black a try since it's SPF 20 and it says it's ""Double Duty"".  Sounded impressive.  Unfortunately, it fell way short of my expectations.  I will slather about 8-10 pumps of this stuff all over my face in an effort to get more moisturizing, and yet, in less than two hours, my face will be dry and ashy again.  As if I hadn't put anything on at all.  I'm sure some of you will appreciate that this lotion isn't ""greasy"", but you might as well not put anything on your face at all than spend this much money on a facial lotion that is gone in less than two hours.  Returning this and going back to my much more affordable Nivea for Men Q10 lotion.",1.0
"I was excited since it has good reveiws and is advertised as paraben free. Unfortunately, it has methlyparaben. I know I should have read the ingredients but one would also expect the advertising to be truthful. Really disappointing.",1.0
"Soothes skin after shave but, lacks in the moisturizing department. After about an hour or so I felt like I had just washed my face and let it air dry, granted its pretty cold right now but, when else do you need a moisturizer that is so called ""double duty"". It also has a very distinct scent not bad just odd, you'd think they could fix that for the price.",1.0
Did not like the color to clown like on me,1.0
"Doesn't work, but it smells good",1.0
I FINISH IT  ALREADY AND IT SEEMS DOESNT HELP ME TOO MUCH!,1.0
Doesn't work at all,1.0
Didn't see any improvement on the areas where I applied the product after giving birth.,1.0
Dosnt smell good and dosnt work at all,1.0
The product that I received was different that the one I bought in store. This one made my skin itch,1.0

Thanks",1.0
"As I believed that Mustela is well know and trusted brand I have bought pack of two of these Gels. I exhausted one packaging by using it vigorously twice a day, but unfortunately this gel is complete waste of money (and time). It doesn't do anything beside maybe moisturize your skin, just like any lotion (or in this case gel) would.",1.0

I  bought it after reading reviews but when i sprayed it the scent is horrible!! Smells like lime juice super strong nothing floral or sweet.. So bad for babies or kids.,1.0
I don't like the smell,1.0
"I'm a huge fan of Mustela lotions and soap for my son, so I got this because I thought it would be the cologne equivalent of those products. Instead this cologne smells like a grandma. :( I wish I never got it.",1.0
"The ingredient ""fragrance"" is unregulated by the FDA, and therefore can contain any number of toxic, hormone disrupting, cancer causing chemicals.  Please people, stop using products that contain synthetic fragrances on your children!",1.0
the smell is very strong and it doesn't smell like the other mustela products. I never used this on my daughter.,1.0
With extended use this made my child break out in little bumps. It also burns when we put it on her dry skin. We won't be using it anymore.,1.0
"I love the lotion, itself. However, I received the bottle and the top piece had completely broken off. So I can not pump the lotion out - which makes things difficult when you're trying to lather up a 5 month old. I wanted to contact the seller, however there is no way to do that.",1.0
The scent of this lotion is overwhelmingly powerful!! The lotion goes on nicely but still will have to return it due to the scent.,1.0
do not buy this you will receive damage condition,1.0
I opened the package to find the top of the bottle broken off and lotion all in the box.,1.0
I ordered the old formula and I received the new one. It smells horrible!!! Strong! I don't want my baby to smell like this#,1.0
"I love the Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream but don't like how expensive it is, so I decided to check out Mustela Hydra Bebe body lotion because it costs a lot less. What a mistake. The fragrance smells terrible and is overpowering.",1.0
"I am rather disappointed in this lotion. I think I received the old formula which has certain ingredients I would not expect such an expensive baby lotion to have such as petrolatum and mineral oil. I was checking this same lotion in store which must have been the newer version and noticed it does not have these ingredients.

Regarding the fragrance, I smelled this on someone's else's baby and it smelled great to me so I actually asked them what it is. However what I was smelling was the faded smell of this lotion hours after application. When you initially apply it, it is very strong and unnatural. I prefer baby products to have a light and natural scent. For the price there are way better products out there which are made with natural plant based oils and butters as opposed to mineral oil and petrolatum.",1.0
"this product, although it is stated as a hypo allergenic lotion, made my face very red, and caused my skin to crack, dry, and peel almost an hour after application. I have tried the spray one before and I did not get these results. If you have super sensitive skin, which I don't really, I don't recommend this product",1.0
I received my product empty.,1.0
Both my kids had horrible allergic reactions to this lotion. Head to toe itchy hives! I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.,1.0
This lotion has a very strong smell and it leaves and did not hydrate the skin as I had hoped.,1.0
"For 30 dollars I expected to get two since that's what it said but I got one, am I going to get the other one soon? Very upset",1.0
This is very fragrant and smells like soap. I will not use it on my toddler.,1.0
"If I could give it zero stars, I would. I really wanted to like it, but not only did it dry up my baby's skin, it dried up mine as well from applying it on him! The scent is also really strong and pungent. After a while, I get a headache. I like other Mustela products but this one is a no-go :(",1.0
Smells funky,1.0
had to return it because it smelt horrible and made me sneeze,1.0
Gave my boy a rash!!!,1.0
We have been huge fans of Mustela products. Yet it was such a disappointment when we purchased the body lotion and to discover the horrid smell! Wow..I can not even begin to describe this odor.,1.0
"Terrible for my newborn! It gave him a raised rash within a minute of application. He screamed as I applied it. Additionally, I found the fragrance unpleasant, too strong for a baby, but certainly that is just my opinion.",1.0
"I love this lotion.  Even though it isn't super cheap, it's my favorite for my babies.  However, it arrived without a pump.  I have no way to extract it.  Very disappointed.",1.0
"I received a sample of this lotion and I'm so glad I didn't purchase it. I see why it is called Mustela, because the fragrance is musty. The lotion didn't seem to irritate my baby's skin but the smell of it irritated everyone in the house. He smells like a little old lady. If they remove that awful fragrance I'd reconsider using this brand.",1.0
"if your baby has dry skin it won't help. I used if on my LO during the winter and had to switch to Burt's Bee which is thicker and non greasy. Mustela is more liquid. I decided instead of throwing it away to use it on myself and did nothing for my skin, same as my baby. I now use Burt's Bees baby for both of us and love it. It is the fourth bottle I just bought.",1.0

"This is for BABIES, right? The tiniest pump, and I get an instant headache. I don't know what they're using to perfume this stuff, but it's way over the top. That much perfume can't be good for baby's skin. Definitely didn't help my little princess's dryness at all.",1.0
"Father here.  From day 1 I would put this on my little girl after her bath, and although she was fine, my hands would itch like crazy.  I stopped using it, but my wife continued.  Tonight we ran out of the other lotion I had been using, went back to this for another try, and within 2 minutes my hands felt like they were on fire.  Upon closer inspection of my palm, I had very tiny hives which were impossible to sooth.  A few minutes under hot water and some neutral hand lotion, and my hands feel perfectly fine again.

Very happy it was me and not her, but I can't imagine a baby being allergic to this and not being able to tell anyone.  Be careful.",1.0
"This lotion was not what I expected.  It was thicker and oilier than I thought it would be, and the scent was not appealing to me- smells a little too plastic. Still, with it being winter, I thought it would keep my newborn's skin soft and moisturized.
Alas, after application, she broke out in a red rash. Tried it again after a few days passed to confirm it was this lotion.
Thankfully, Amazon has excellent returns program and I was able to return for a full refund.
Bought ""Noodle and Boo Super Soft Lotion"" and love it.",1.0
"This thing made me and my baby break out in a rash, twice! We double checked but it happened every time we used this product.",1.0
I bought this lotion for my baby before he was born knowing I have sensitive skin and he might as well. I used it 2 times. First time was fine and I loved the smell the second time he cried like it was burning his skin! Also his shins became very dry after the second use. I should have known that a product with such a great smell would cause irritation. Bottom line the lotion doesn't work for sensitive skin.,1.0
"Mustela baby lotion was recommended to me by my pediatrician because my baby has extremely sensitive skin. I ordered the lotion and the massage oil online after reading great reviews and when I used these products on my baby she seemed to be okay, but I broke out into a horrible rash. The only thing that has caused such a problem for me in the past is sulfa drugs, and the ingredients in these products do not include, sulfa, so I don't know what it is that caused the problem, but this is definitely NOT hypoallergenic.

It has a very strong scent that I wasn't very fond of as well. I would have tolerated the scent if I liked the products, but I can't imagine that anything with this heavy of a perfumed scent can be good for anyone! It certainly irritated my skin!",1.0
This product has mineral oil in it! It is the second most used ingrediant. Mineral oil is a cancer causing agent!!! Do you want to put something that causes cancer on your precious baby? It's up to you!,1.0
"I HOPE THIS REVIEW WILL SAVE SOMEONE'S CHILD...I have purchased the whole Mustela line before my baby's arrival, and I was convinced I am paying for a great European product. I stopped using the wipes after first week of use. They irritated my baby's skin. I did however continued to use this lotion and shampoo.. Today my baby is 7 weeks old, and I am fighting her super dry skin she got from using the lotion! We even made a visit to doctor yesterday where they confirmed the irritated skin and all these patches of super dry skin are from the lotion! Now we are saving the delicate skin with Aveeno product... which is FRAGRANCE FREE!",1.0
This wash is VERY perfumy!  It made my eyes burn just smelling it so I was not comfortable using it on my baby.  The only reason I gave it one star is that it did seem effective to getting rid of cradle cap...  But I could not get over the smell...,1.0
"I have used many Mustela products and love them, except for this one.

It makes my baby's cheeks red. At first, I couldn't believe it, so I kept trying and it irritated her skin every time..... My baby cried today when I tried to wipe this lotion off her face. Poor little thing! I thought I was giving my baby the best, but I was wrong. The stuff I am using now costs me only $3.48 and it doesn't bother her at all.",1.0

New formula is terrible. Mustela you just lost a very loyal customer.,1.0
"They changed the scent and it now smells like old lady perfume, yuck!  The previous fresh/clean smell was the best and I don't know why they changed it, so bummed.  I wish I had known before purchasing because this stuff is expensive.  Beware!",1.0
"I'm so sad, the new scent is so horrible and perfumey. The soap also seems to lather slightly differently than before. I was actually questioning if I had been sent counterfeit product from Amazon because it was so gross and cheap smelling, but other reviews are reporting the same changes from Mustela they bought at other stores. Mustela has been the only soap I've used on my children for 4 1/2 years, but I'm going to have to switch to something else now.",1.0

Very hard to rinse off. Will not be using again.,1.0
This product has a very strong scent and contains a perfume that caused severe rash and inflammation on both of my infants' skin not to mention I had a serious sneeze and allergy attack from the scent. It smells nice but why add perfume to baby products!?! Be aware that the product claims to be hypoallergenic but the perfume or something in the product can cause a nasty rash.,1.0
"Felt very soapy and slippery, I didn't think it washed off clean. Plus my niece who is sensitive to scented things broke out in a rash after I used this to bathe her... I won't be getting this again.",1.0
My baby hated it. Screamed in pain when I used it 2 times!,1.0
I purchased this for my baby's cradle cap. For some reason my daughter screamed and cried for an hour after I used this. I looked everywhere for anything about this causing that type of reaction and have found nothing. :( too bad because it smells amazing. Just can't use it on my 4 month old.,1.0
I don't know why this product is so popular. It's full of chemicals that you don't want to put on your baby skin. More than this when I washed my baby with this it made my hands very dry and itchy. I'm sure baby's gentle skin feels even worse than this.,1.0
"I purchased the Mustela 2-in-1 Hair & Body Shampoo at a local drug store because I had a coupon that made the purchase cheaper than ordering it from Amazon. I had read all the positive reviews and made my purchase based on that. I can't really address how well the product cleanses because I could not get past the smell. So many reviews described the fragrance as pleasant or fresh. For me personally, it was overpowering and smelled more like chemicals than anything I would describe as pleasant. When I opened the tube, I put a small amount on the back of my hand to see what the texture and smell was like.  I found the smell so overwhelming that I immediately washed it off. My hand still smelled an hour later and I had to get another soap to wash the fragrance off my skin. I realize the perception of pleasant/unpleasant fragrances is a matter of personal preference. I wanted to let those reading the reviews know that not everyone would find the fragrance used in this product appealing.",1.0
"Honestly, Johnson& Johnson or Baby Majic PINK bottle seem to have it made here.  I bought this overpriced item on the recommendation of a friend and falling into the belief that a French baby shampoo must be special.  No, it's not.  It doesn't rinse out easily.",1.0
I bought this after a raving review from a fellow new mommy and was very disappointed that I wasted my money on this. I should have read the negative reviews closer - this stuff smells terrible! Mustela prides itself on their formulas being gentle and safer than other name brands but they really missed the mark on this shampoo. My son has excema and his skin gets extremely dried out on it's own and after one use he was all chapped and flaking - how is that gentle cleaning? I figured I would use it myself since I have less sensitive skin and my skin was so dry and tight that I just threw the bottle away. Such a waste of money!! I will never buy another Mustela product again - they are liars!!!,1.0

"Hi people,purchased this product after reading reviews. Very bad choice. It has something in it that fills very stickey,and it has aluminum and a lot of other things that are not good for your skin. I wish the ingredents were listed so you can no before you get it home and find out the junk thats in the stuff. I would not recommed this to anybody. Don't like the way it smells, and again very stickey when you put it under your arms.",1.0
"I purchased this item hoping for a good shave gel without too many additives for my sensitive skin. My daily beard growth is relatively low; I don't look like a yeti every morning. For my needs most gels provide more than enough (at times too much) beard softeners and other lubrication additives to make the experience painless. However, this gel is a very very thin gel and even for my low beard growth rate the morning shave wasn't exactly ""easy"" to say the least. Then, being lazy one weekend I shaved after two days of growth putting on an extra dollop of this shave gel (and using a new razor blade) and that was an unpleasant ""grating"" experience. I went out and bought some regular shave foam  until I can get back to the Body Shop for their shave cream which I have used satisfactorily for the past few years. ( I wish the Body Shop shipped with PRIME shipping then I would be ordering their cream regularly through Amazon; are you listening Body Shop?)

As I said for a $16 gel Anthony Logistics was a complete disappointment and I don't intend to purchase this product again. Your mileage may vary because shaving is a highly subjective experience for each person; try and get a sample of this stuff (for free) before you drop $16 on it is my recommendation",1.0
"For the most part, I am a huge fan of the Anthony Logistics product line.  I got the shave gel as a sample.  It does not lather up at all -- which is excusable if it at least lubricates your beard.  It did not at all. I used it with my Futur Merkur blade, and neck was a bloody mess (literally) after my shave.

For the best shave, splurge on a badger brush and proraso shave cream!",1.0
"This is a GREAT lip stain, but the color I ordered (the one I always get) was mis-marked and not even close to what it should have been. Back it went, and I will get this product elsewhere.",1.0
"I'm really disappointed with this lip stain, although I suspect it is Amazon's failure to accurately depict the color.  Liquid Kiss is great - if you're going for the goth look.  Unfortunately, I'm not.  See the photo for what it really looks like.",1.0
"Wow, do I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered my new tube of Liquid Kiss! I am almost out of this product (originally purchased from a department store), so I wanted to order a new tube before I ran out. The new tube came and the color wasn't even close to the original. I am attaching photos to demonstrate the difference in color. In the picture with the swatches on my hand, the top swatch is the new Liquid Kiss that I bought on Amazon, and the bottom swatch is my original tube of Liquid Kiss. As you can see, the new tube has a dark plum-colored stain that is terrible on my fair skin. The original tube of Liquid Kiss was a bright brick red that blends in perfectly with my lips. I also included a photo of the two tubes side-by-side to demonstrate that they are both supposed to be Liquid Kiss.

The bottom line is that I cannot use this item. I am sending it back to Amazon for a refund and plan on purchasing my new tube of Liquid Kiss at the same store where I purchased my original tube. I am so disappointed, and I would not recommend ordering this amazing lip stain from Amazon.",1.0
color not as advertised,1.0
"This product came with the packaging open! Not just that the color is some kind of strange gothic dark plum color! This isn't the real Liquid Kiss shade.

I am horrified and I can't believe how much I paid for this to be so disappointed. I intend to contact the company, not cool.",1.0

I was looking forward to receiving this and ended up very disappointed. The stain went on watery and did not cover well at all - it took numerous coats to get it even looking.

When I ran out, it was not available for purchase so I bought this version instead.  This version is very different - it is NOT fragrance free.  After I started using it, I began to experience serious eye irritation - constant watering, burning, severe redness, sensitivity and puffiness.  At first I thought it was pollen-related.  Finally figured out it only happened when I used this lotion.  I started tracking it - taking note on the days I used the lotion and the days I had severe eye irritation and they coincided exactly.  I was very careful not to get it near my eyes when applying it.  Only thing I can think of is that the fragrance was ""wafting"" up into my eyes.  Since then have found the other version and will be going back to it.",1.0

The bottle they sent me had expired 2 years ago. I was less than impressed. But I'd used it for over a month and did not attempt to return it. I don't think it worked at all, but I believe it was due to the product being expired, not the product itself. Check your stri-Vectin SD for the expiration date right away.",1.0

"Horrible company and even worse product. I don't know why this seller and this counterfeit Strivectin SD is still on Amazon. I got the stuff and noticed it looked different from what I got from GNC, but thought that maybe they changed the packaging since it had (R). Almost as soon as it made contact with my skin it started to burn worse than Poison Oak exposure and it made my eyes burn. My room smelled of this nasty stuff for nearly an hour after I washed it off. I had to file a claim since I got injured and the seller contacted me to say that a pre-paid return label would be emailed to me. When I didn't receive that email for several days I emailed him back. This was from the 13th of March and I have yet to receive an email.

Short story: this product will hurt you and as you can see, it will take a long time for you to get your money back. GNC sells the real thing and I have since bought some from them and have had wonderful results.",1.0

Be careful if you purchase this cream to try and combat wrinkles.  I am 48 and I have sensitive skin. I used it just like the directions said and my skin swelled up so bad it looked like I was deformed! I had to stop using the cream and my skin did go back to normal after 3 days thankfully but it was horrible to go through that.  They did refund my money after I called so I had no problem with that part. Just be very careful and DO NOT BUY if you have sensitive skin.,1.0

"I have been buying this from various places at about $130 and was happy to find it for about half price. Wrong. I have been using this product for several years and was sadly disappointed with what I received. While I absolutely love the real Strivectin, what I received had a tube that looked the same, had all the same verbiage, but the contents were runny, had an ""odd"" smell, and were not in the box that normally comes with it.
Having said that, I still decided to try using it for a while and found it was really, really greasy.....almost like someone had altered the contents by adding mineral oil. Strivectin contains an analgesic to give a slight tingle on the skin.  This also gives it a distinct smell. The product I received runs out of the tube when inverted. Normally Strivectin must be squeezed from the tube. I mention all this for new users who may not know the difference.
I will stick to getting this from my retail supplier!!",1.0
i bought this back when they were selling it for 99 dollars.  i bought it to use on stretch marks i already have. i have some deep ones and some that are not deep just discolored.  Did not improve any stretch marks.  Save your money it won't make a difference at all.,1.0

I bought $400 worth of their products in order to get a better deal overall.  What a total rip-off.  I got enough so that I could really give it a chance.  I have  used it religiously every day without fail for over six months and NO results.  Even the teeniest tiniest lines have not altered in any way.  I have read many reviews that were negative from people who only used it for a few weeks to  a month.  I thought they just didn't stick with it long enough.  Well, it's useless and smells weird too.  I'm serious.  NO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!",1.0

"I received a sample of this product in the mail and was excited to try it. I put it on after I showered at night and went to bed. The next morning I woke up with a rash of red bumps that itched on and off anywhere I applied StriVectin and also on areas immediately surrounding it too. It took about a week for the rash to go away.

My sample did not have directions to test the product on a small area before first use, so I suffered a week of my hips, thighs, and breasts being covered in an awful rash. I'm just glad I never put this stuff on my face!!

It may work for some, but definitely test it in a inconspicuous small area first. I do not normally have sensitive skin so I am not sure what is in this product that made me (and other reviewers I have seen) have such a bad reaction. Due to this I would strongly recommend that anyone with any degree of sensitive skin or allergies AVOID this product unless you wish to suffer some possible side effects.",1.0

"I'm 46 and have pretty good skin. I was very excited about Strivectin and started using it religiously. I could have sworn that it was making my skin look better. It was one of the first cosmetic product I ever bought. After several months I became cynical about the entire industry after seeing marketing claims for various products that were obviously bogus. So I decided to really test Strivectin by only putting in on one side of my face. The skin regenerates every 28 days, but I kept doing it for 6 weeks.

No results whatsoever! I asked several friends which side of my face looked better and most of my friends would say there was no difference. A few chose a side, but they were evenly divided between both sides.",1.0
I still haven't received this product. Hopefully it will arrive any day but I have waited one month.,1.0
"I want to make clear I haven't bought this item from this seller, but I have used it every single day for almost 2 years, and I bought it in the UK and later here in Macys NYC let me tell you do not waste your money!!! it didn't do anything for my stretch marks and wrinkles, as I used it on my face as well. In fact do your own search about the strivectin scam. The company is shady and this cream has the same components as one of the Olay creams for a fraction of the price. They also say Idebenol which is also another fraud. I hope it helps.",1.0

"I purchased StriVectin-SD Intensive Concentrate for Stretch Marks in January. I decided to give the product a chance, being that I have heard rave reviews about it. After the first week of using StriVectin, my strech marks were smoother and so was the surrounding skin. I continued to follow instructions carefully, I even exfoliated three times a week, thinking this would also help the process. By the end of the month I noticed no change at all! I just had smooth strech marks, wtf? I decided after the sixth week if nothing happed, I would return the product. Just as I thought, after six weeks of using this product, I was disappointed to see that nothing changed. Don't waste your money, this is clearly for fresh stretch marks and companies should make it a point to say that.",1.0
"I purchased this product and used it only on my face for 7 days.  I developed terrible dermatitis. I discontinued the product immediately and am healing now.

"i am disgusted to recently have learned that this company and its products are complete hoaxes! i purchased a tube of StriVectin-SD on recommendation of a GYN for my pregnancy stretch marks. Imagine how anxious i was for a product and at the advice of a Dr. no less, i was impatient to try it and forked over the 80EURO for 50 ml/1.7oz. (that size is not even available in the US). I became severely disheartened when i read reviews about the product here on amazon.com and at [...]. they were love/hate at best. and many accused the product and its company of fraud stating over-zealous claims that are being investigated by the FDA. between this, the exorbitant price and the late logic that there is no such thing as a cream that will clear stretch marks in a few weeks (especially with run of the mill ingredients) i returned it, thankfully in time to stringent French return policies.
upon my new quest to find another product i came across striadril. seeing the cognitive link, i put the product in wikipedia's search engine and read that BOTH products are made by the same company under different sub-names (Basic Research makes Strivectin-SD and Generix Labs makes Striadril) , both made by the same manufacturer at the same location (Salt Lake City, Utah) however the only difference is; ""This company sells the product Striadril, which is billed as a generic version of the Strivectin-SD product at a fraction of the cost. Many customers are not aware that Striadril is the exact same product as Strivectin-SD, manufactured by the exact same company, just with a different package and price point to attract a lower-end consumer."" !!!! How GROSS!
Striadril can sell for $[...] USD and StriVectin-SD $[...]!!!! (again not taking into account the price gouging in Europe!) it's worth noting that there is a prevailing myth circulating that StriVectin-SD used to be a prescription and is now ""public"". Complete and utter BS. What's more, the cream is not only a stretch mark eraser but a wrinkle remover!! a veritable all-in-one beauty cure-all!! Ha!
(** the reviews i read on amazon.com a few days back also cited that many of the 5-star reviews were by 1 time reviewers made on the same days, i.e. possible deliberate company contributions. i can no longer find that product listing with those reviews, there were well over 30 on that listing. i decided to post here instead)

when Americans are so lawsuit-happy, where's the uproar over this?? more regulation in the cosmetic industry is overdue.",1.0
The only people who left good reviews didn't use it on their marks. That's because it doesn't work on them! Please save your cash for something that will work. I hope I find one that actually does work.,1.0
I saw this product at Sam's Wholesale. I hoped it would get rid of fine lines around my eyes and the stretch marks on my thighs. It broke my face out and I am not a person with sensitive skin. Red bumps came up everywhere. And the results on my stretch marks were zilch. Product does not work. For fine lines spend your money on botox. That actually does work!,1.0
"Because I saw that Amazon had this as a Gold Box Deal, I had to write a review and potentially save women lots of money.

I am 40, have okay skin but have some lines around my eyes. I bought StriVectin about three years ago and used it FAITHFULLY. When it didn't work initially, I added a daily application. This stuff just doesn't work. It's absolute junk. I don't think it's a wonderful moisturizer, either, because it's is not labeled as non-comedogenic and I am prone to minor breakouts. However, I do not break out under my eyes and had no adverse reactions to the product. It just didn't work. At all.

Someone mentioned Paula Begoun's site. Use Google to look up Paula Begoun StriVectin-SD. The company that makes this product makes claims that are currently being legally challenged. Did I expect StriVectin to actually be ""better than Botox"" as their ad claims? No. But, if I spend $100, I do expect it to at least work a little. This product-- althought advertised heavily and marketed in a 'medical-looking' tube absolutely does not work at all. Not even a little. I can't believe anyone got any positive results using it unless they never even used moisturizer before and are startled at the difference a little cream can make.

I would completely recommend Obagi products (specifically the CLEAR, Exfoderm Forte, and BLENDER used in conjunction with Retin A. I also recommend TriLuma cream-- for similar results in one step. Don't forget a strong sunscreen when using Retin A and Hydroquinone products! I've used Obagi faithfully for 2 years and my skin is completely improved. My breakouts have disappeared, my fine lines around my eyes are pretty much not noticeable at all and sunspots that appeared two years ago after a non-protected day in the sun have completely disappeared. Obagi is expensive, too, but completely worth it because it really works. The other day in Walgreens, I said something about my 16 year old daughter who was standing right next to me and the salesperson's jaw absolutely dropped and said, ""OMG, I thought you were friends. . . she can't be your daughter."" Of course, I don't think I look 16, but the message was appreciated.",1.0
"This product is all hype and ABSOLUTELY NO SUBSTANCE!
I bought this product thinking it would at least fade new stretch marks acquired through weight loss if it didn't affect old growth spurt stretch marks. I applied RELIGIOUSLY for 6 weeks...not even a hint of a fade. I am extremely disappointed. I will never buy this companies products again and I recommend to other women not to waste their time or money...you could be using another treatment that is more effective for 6 weeks instead of wasting your time with this peppermint moisturizer with a hefty price tag!",1.0

They are the same makers of that weight loss product that claims, ""Think $153 is too much to pay for a weight loss product, not if it works!""  (Gee, the same odd $153 cost-like they couldn't sell it for $150.  No!  They need to recover that extra three dollars or they wouldn't cover their expenses!) That product doesn't work, either.

Comparative Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Type A and Topical Creams for Treating Moderate-to-Severe Glabellar Rhytids.

Beer KR.

BACKGROUND: Several nonprescription products purport similar or better outcomes than botulinum toxin type A (Botox Cosmetic, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) for treating wrinkles, but these have not been documented in comparative clinical trials. Patients spend millions of dollars annually on the topical products, yet there are, to date, no data to support any of the claims made. OBJECTIVE : To compare the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A with placebo and three topical products in treating moderate-to-severe glabellar lines. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel study of 77 female subjects comprised five treatment groups: botulinum toxin type A, placebo injection, StriVectin-SD (Klein-Becker USA, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), DDF Wrinkle Relax (Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, HDS Cosmetics, Inc., Yonkers, NY, USA), and HydroDerm (Hydroderm, Beverly Hills, CA, USA). Baseline and follow-up visits (weeks 4, 8, and 12) assessed safety and key efficacy measures: blinded investigator assessment of glabellar line severity on the Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS), subjects' global assessment of overall change in appearance, subject ratings of glabellar-related self-perception pre- and post-treatment, and satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Botulinum toxin type A treatment consistently resulted in statistically significant reductions in wrinkle severity on the FWS than any comparator (p < .001).

Statistically significant improvements were similarly observed for subject-reported outcomes and satisfaction with botulinum toxin type A treatment, whereas treatment with any of the three topical creams did not result in a significant difference from placebo. Three adverse events occurred in three subjects who received StriVectin-SD.

CONCLUSION: Botulinum toxin type A provided significantly greater efficacy and patient satisfaction in the treatment of glabellar frown lines than StriVectin-SD, Wrinkle Relax, and HydroDerm, and in the objective measurements used, none of the topical preparations were better than botulinum toxin.

"I used this cream for my eye wrinkles for about a month and saw absolutely no difference.  Fancy packaging, false delivery claim ""Better than Botox,"" and a high price scams consumers into thinking this product works.  Don't waste your money.  This cream is so greasy it actually made my face break out.  It's amazing what marketing can do to sell a product that doesn't work.",1.0
"I used this product for one month.  I thought if I kept using it that maybe it would eventually work.  It made my skin old looking.  I stopped using Strivectin.  Now I am using a cheap creme and my face is back to normal.

This product is not what it claims to be..I have been using it for 9 weeks and I don't see any improvement whatsoever.... makes me wish I had saved the $140 and bought myself some new golf clubs. It doesn't even do well for a wrinkle creme...I've seen better cremes at Walmart.... plus it has this peppermint smell that makes me think of my wife's foot lotion.,1.0

"I have curly dry hair and wanted a nice leave in conditioner.
I was just using normal conditioner that I washed my hair with but thought I would get something new.

The bottle is big so new it would last but the smell is not nice.
I was thinking it would be a nice passionflower smell, NOPE its gross!!

"I'm African American with VERY porous coarse kinky/coily thick hair...I decided to buy this product because of all the great reviews, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me. First of all, the scent (Passionflower) is way overpowering, it gave me a headache. My sister even commented on it. She asked ""Are you sure it's a leave-in conditioner, cause it smells like a strong shampoo?"" I absolutely hate the scent! It smells artificial and is way too strong for a leave-in conditioner...

I applied the product to my damp hair and it seemed okay (besides the overpowering scent). I wasn't too impressed but it was okay, that is until my hair began to dry. When my hair dried I noticed that it felt a bit tacky and gross...On the back of the bottle it claims that it suppose to make your hair shiny, well it made my hair dull instead...I have not had any luck when it comes to hair products, especially leave-in conditioners. They are either too watery and don't do a thing for my thick coarse hair, or it leaves behind sticky or white residue...Like I said in the title, this stuff is nothing but ""fancy"" aloe vera gel with some sunscreen mixed in (along with other chemicals). I feel kind of silly cause it clearly says ""Passionflower and Aloe"" in the description but since every one is raving about it, I thought it may have something extra special or magical in it, but nope...basically nothing but aloe. I understand that we all have different hair textures and what works for some, won't work for all, but I still don't get all the 5 stars...So, if you have curly hair that's a SILKY texture, you probably will like this product, but it's not for me (a woman with porous hair).",1.0

I saw a few reviews that mentioned the same defect, but I still gave it a shot. Don't waste your time with this as you will have to return it soon after.

I hate that now I have to print the return label, box it up, and then take it to the UPS store in order to get my money back. Ugh, I do not have time for this!",1.0
"Was looking for a good replacement for my previous 2"" iron. This iron never got hot enough even at the hottest setting. It gets very warm at best...I can touch it even at the hottest setting.

I've used Hot Tools products in the past and they have lasted for years. I ordered this a year or so ago. From the beginning I had to put it on the highest setting and it still didn't heat up very much. The past couple months it has just gotten worse and worse and now doesn't heat up at all.,1.0

"I have collar bone length, fine but coarse hair, that typically curls extreme well. This iron basically just crimped the ends of my hair, and didn't curl what so ever.

Thankfully, this was a gift, otherwise I would return it.",1.0
Would not curl my hair. I returned this product.,1.0
"So very disappointed. I used the iron ONE TIME and it worked. It created beautiful, loose curls on par with what I've had done in a salon. I went to use it this morning - only my second use since I pulled it out of the box - and it simply does not heat up. I'd read several reviews indicating this had been a problem, but I ordered it anyway, hoping I would be lucky and not get a defective product. No luck. Clearly, there are manufacturing or design quality issues that the company needs to fix. I have a cheaper Conair 1.5"" iron for, literally, almost 10 years and it still works like day 1.",1.0

Sad because I cannot find a 2 inch iron that works this good so I am trying a third time purchasing because I can't find a better one just hope it lasts longer than 4 months....$120 total a year to use this product so far DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST",1.0

I wanted this one because I have almost every size and shape of wand/curling iorn, but my hair holds curls so well that I don't get beachy waves with the smaller sizes.

"I've never been disappointed in a Hot Tools product until I bought this one. I have a 1 1/2 inch curling iron from Hot Tools and it's AMAZING.  However, the 2 inch iron has never actually curled my hair.  I stupidly waited a few months to open the package, so by the time I did, the return window had closed and now I'm stuck with an iron that gets warm but never actually curls my hair.  I've tried it 3 different times and have tried to contact customer service at Hot Tools and the website is a mess...  Will probably only buy Hot Tools from a store in the future so I can walk in and get customer service.  Based on photos from other users, I must have received a defective iron.",1.0
Did not like it at all,1.0
I bought this at the end of November 2015 and then 4 months later the black cover on the handle ( you push to open the curling iron clasp) fell off.  I will have to look for super glue or something as it seems my warranty has expired.  I thought that was really cheaply made due to that.,1.0

"This product did okay with my hair and I typically only use it on my bangs, so it wasn't getting a ton of use but in less than 12 months it stopped working.

This is not the quality I was expecting from this company.",1.0
"I was so excited to get this! I know they're great curling irons.... In theory.... It looked like it had be opened before... And didn't get hot at all I cranked it all the way up and after 10 minutes I could grab it with my bare hand, it was barely above room temp. Sad to say I'm returning :(",1.0
"This curler is AWFUL. I have thick curly hair and wanted to create soft big curls. All this does is straighten, and because the Wright is mostly in the barrel and the heating element extends down to the top of the handle, it's impossible NOT to burn your face and neck.

Silly me for throwing away the packaging. Now I can't return it. I won't even donate it. Too dangerous.",1.0
"Not the best curling product for the amount you end up spending. The iron gets hot quickly, but the barell is difficult to use because of the size. It would be easier to use if the clamp was thinner.",1.0

I bought this iron because I was told it was a great purchase I've tried it several times on my hair and all my daughters hair and a curl never stays no matter what I do to try to keep the curl it falls out within minutes. Spent way too much money on this iron for this type of performance,1.0

Does not get hot not a good product.,1.0
"Girlfriend here - This curling iron does not get hot enough, does not curl, and leaves dents. It is a pointless iron to have. I use a clipless Enzo Milano and it gives me waves/curls that last for two days. If your hair is super bleached and fried, this iron might work for you, if you have any sort of healthy hair that is even *slightly* hard to curl, this is a waste of money. I am no novice and have tried many hair tools in my 20 years of self styling. I thought I would try a less expensive brand against my better judgement. Should have just listened to myself and stuck with more quality brands. This iron did not cost much really, but it is now taking up space in my cabinet and I cannot even give this to a person who could use it. Waste of money, could have had a nice lunch with that cash...",1.0
Don't like !!!!!,1.0
"I bought this because I saw videos on Youtube of people who were able to get glamorous bombshell waves out of this product. I also like the idea of the gold plating because I heard that it really gives hair a nice smooth shine. In terms of getting hair to shine, this product does that. In terms of giving a huge and beautiful curl, it does not. Maybe this works really well for people with hair strands that are fine/thin, but I have thicker strands of hair. Even with the highest heat setting and leaving it to curl a bit longer, I couldn't get this to curl my hair at all. The only thing it did was slightly add a bend to the ends, but I can do that with a hair straightener already. This tool was also really effective in straightening my hair, but again, I already have a hair straightener to do that. Other cons with this product is that it is super heavy! My arm felt like it was going to fall off cuz this product is just crazy heavy. As others have said, the cord is super long. Like ridiculously long. I think it would be great if you were in a room where the outlet is far away, but otherwise the cord just makes my bathroom counter so cluttered. One thing that was good is that it does heat up very quickly and the clip handle is long so you won't burn yourself. The end of the iron also has a large plastic tip that doesn't get hot at all, so you won't burn your hands holding the ends. Overall, I think while this product might work for some hair types, it didn't work for mine.",1.0
This curling tools is so big I had to give it away . You have to have super long hair for this size,1.0
"The curling iron fell off of the counter and for one brief quarter of a second, bumped against my right ankle, resulting in second degree burns.  It's been two weeks and the burn is still blistered and trying to heal.  I must say, it curls the hair nicely, but it's not worth the health risks.  Please, be careful!

"With all the great reviews, it was a no brainer to pick this curling iron among others.

I hope I could come to US to prove if it really works and gets deadly hot down there.",1.0

"sadly i had to return this item twice. contrary to all the other reviews mine NEVER GOT HOT ENOUGH. i htought maybe it was a fluke and i just received a defective one so i ordered another. the next one did the same thing :(  YES a gave it plenty of time to heat up, yes i started low and eventually had it turned all the way up, yes i left it in my hair for even over a minute or two and it barely made any shape. my hair naturally waves as much as this did. not sure if they tried to turn down the heat after so many complaints of it being TOO hot, but either way both are useless. i was fine with the design n such but like i said didn't get much use. i tried it multiple times in mulitple plugs in the house. nothing :( .. all my other curlers work fine, heat up in a minute and curl my hair in about ten seconds",1.0
"Doesn't matter how long you wait, or how many times you try to use this, it is just not meant for my hair.

My hairdresser agrees- she would never use this on me.",1.0
"New out of the box and the power indicator light does not work. The iron did begin to heat, which is quite dangerous as it is not possible to tell by looking at it whether it is on or not. It has the feel of a cheap knock off of a salon quality iron, and given the price I guess that should have been obvious. At least Amazon makes the return process relatively painless.",1.0
Doesn't get hot enough to curly. DON'T buy this item.,1.0
"This did not work on my hair. It would not get hot enough. Like if it is broken or something. It's supposed to be NEW, but it's broken? Maybe this curling iron I purchased was use before and stopped heating up so they made it look new and sold it. Returning.",1.0
"I was sorely disappointed by this product. It was advertised as being salon quality. It neither effectively curled my hair nor helped to even smooth areas into a semi-curl. Any kinks from sleeping were visible even after use. I was was also shocked at how clunky it was to use/ difficult to maneuver. Finally, the clamp would catch and then break my hair. The final straw was the frustrating return policy of only one month. I did not use it for the first time until just after that period and have not been able to return it, leaving me out-of-pocket for a ineffective product. Despite trying it several times since, it has continued to perform poorly.",1.0
"I have long medium thick hair, and was excited to have large loose curls. However when I used this iron, my hair didn't even wave. I watched 3 different youtube videos in hopes that I was doing something wrong. I tried the product three different times using the hottest setting and holding the curl for 25 seconds or more. I don't know if it would work on ppl with shorter hair, but i also have layers, and it didn't even work on the short ones.
I would NOT recommend this iron to anyone!

"I received this curling iron as a Pollyanna gift this Christmas and I was extremely disappointed with it! I have super thin wavy hair and my cousin, who is a hairdresser, used it on me before to give me big, flowy curls. I received the 2 inch and the same day I used it is the same day I immediately packed it all back up to send back. The curling iron did get super hot once I turned it to the highest setting. I left it on my hair for about 12 seconds and guess what? NO CURL! It actually appeared that it straightened my hair rather than curl it. I tried different techniques: I tried curling a whole bunch of hair, I left it on longer, and I even went out and bought a smaller size (1 inch) to see if it made a difference. NOTHING. Hot Tools is not a good brand and would not recommend to anyone.",1.0
We bought it as a Christmas gift for our daughter. It got warm but would not make a curl. When we tried to return it they refused to take it back. We are so upset with this vender and Amazon that we will not be using either in the future. Pretty stupid to loose a good customer over $25.00.,1.0
"I liked the same curling iron in a smaller diameter, so I got this one as well. However, this iron does nothing to my hair.

My hair no product in it when I tried the iron. I have thick, coarse hair to the middle of my back. I first tried the iron on the lowest setting - other reviews said the iron literally burned their hair out on the highest setting! Nothing happened. I turned it up about 120 degrees and tried again. Nothing. I finally got the courage to turn it up to the highest setting - nothing. Although, I did manage to burn my ear so bad the skin just literally fell right off. This definitely isn't the first time I've curled my hair, so I knew it wasn't ""user error"". I even tried it on my sister's thin, fine hair. Once again, nothing. The following morning it was back in the mail. It did NOTHING for my hair. Very disappointed. Not even a little wave at the bottom like others said.

"I purchased the 2"" curling iron for my daughter.  The good news is that it  arrived very quickly and the price was competitive.  The bad news is the 2"" curling iron does not curl hair.  I guess it is just tooo big of a diameter and because of that, it only gives a very gentle curl on the very bottom of the hair.  It acts more like a hair straightener than a curling iron.  I would not recommend purchasing this curling iron.

I wish I would have read the other reviews about this curling iron before purchasing it.",1.0
DO NOT BUY this iron.  It does NOT curl your hair.  I went and got another one at CVS for $20 and it works so much better.  This iron get hot but for some reason it does not curl.  DO NOT WASTE your time or money on this.  Go to the drug store and get one!,1.0

It came in an open box ( like it had been used)  so when I opened it you can see scratch marks all around the metal area that connects the bottle to the spray pump. Obviously someone has taken a bottle and tampered with it (disconnected the sprayer from the bottle then put it back on) . The smell that comes out is good , problem is you have to use so many squirts to smell anything ( probably watered down ).  I should have spent the extra $10-15 and bought this from a reputable source now it's so close to Christmas I can't give an open scratched up watered down item as a gift.",1.0

The glycolic acid is of such low content you can't even feel it. It advertised 20percent. But no way !,1.0
Bent the first day I tried to use them and scratched easily. Horrible products.,1.0
"Nothing like some acetone on your face. no, really. one of the ingredients is acetone. A chemical that isn't even regularly used in finger nail polish anymore and it's in a product that's meant to be put on your face, presumably because you have one issue or another with your skin that you're trying to correct. No thanks.",1.0
"These pads (used daily) did nothing for me. Moreover, they smell toxic.  Do not waste your money.",1.0
This wasn't nearly as good as DCL glycolic acid pad.,1.0
Just finished this treatment. I see no difference in my skin from the time I started using it.,1.0
"I love this product and what it does for my skin. It gets rid of wrinkles and seems to tighten my skin as well. I just can't understand why it went up eight bucks in three months and that is why I am leaving this review with one star, to hopefully send a message to amazon that even though I like what the product is doing for my skin, I don't like the games they play.",1.0
"I've used lots of glycolic pads, even stronger than these,  and yet these are the only ones that burn my skin.  I could tolerate it if they worked.",1.0
I break out terribly every time I use these and they burn so bad I have to fan my face for 30 minutes after each use. I've seen no improvement to my dark spots. Just a lot of pain and more acne.,1.0
Not good!!!!,1.0
way too drying,1.0
This the worst ever.,1.0
"I do not have sensitive skin by any means. I've done level one and two chemical peels and my skin didn't break out or become tender and red. I used this product for two days. After washing my face, applying at night, letting it sit over night, rinse face in the morning and apply moisturizer. I have little tiny red ITCHY bumps everywhere the pads touched. It's driving me insane. Not acne, so that's cool and all. But an allergic reaction for sure. No amount of Benadryl or cortisone cream is making this any better. Needless to say, this will be making its way to the trash can shortly. Maybe it's just my skin, but I've used other products with similar ingredients, minus the witch hazel, with no issues. My face is not a happy camper.",1.0
"I tried these after having success with another brands (The Magic Pads), just to see if all pads were created equal. NO WAY! After only a few days, my stubborn breakouts returned, so did my excess oil and I began to see cystic acne pop up again. I disliked the lack of texture to the pads as well. I know everyone's skin reacts differently, but these just are not for me.
I ended up throwing away almost a full bottle.",1.0
"Didn't like at all.  It made my break out insantly, overnight.  Threw it out.",1.0
"I tried this product and two days later I woke up with looked like a completely burned face and red bumps covering my whole face, not to mention the hives. I tried washing it off with a natural soap and it just made it worse. It took 4 days for the bumps to go down and the redness what unbelievable. I had to start on a high dose of Allegra. My experience was not one I want anyone else to have!!",1.0
They weren't sealed when I received them and the packaging looks dirty. Very disapointed,1.0
The jar had been opened!  Never again.,1.0
Several months ago I  used a different product that was 8% glycolic acid. I had good results with it so I decided to get a stronger % . After using the 8% product my face tingled after using this higher strength product there is no tingling sensation. I question the integrity of this product. There is no way this is 15% more like 2%!,1.0
I had an expiration date of 2013 and I order for the first time in June 2014.  I tried one pad and I had a significant reaction on my face.  I am returning this item.  I've used glycolic pads before and I never had that type of reaction.,1.0
"I used the Glycolix Acid Pads religiously every night for 2 weeks. My face started to look worse after only a few days and did not get better. i received no compliments on my skin either. Also, I started to peel, which is fine, I read all the other reviews so I expected that. However, I only peeled on my nose and chin which was very irrirating since those were the few areas that actually didn't have any blemishes. And my cheeks which looked like a war zone did not peel at all.

I really wanted this to work for me, but now i am back to the drawing board.",1.0
didn't do anything but smell funny and sometimes taste funny when i forgot to wash my hands thoroughly after using.  i didn't see any results.  not worth the money.,1.0
A dermatologist recommended so I bought to. Did not see results and burned after use.philosophy ones work better. Also Avalon has a nice one.,1.0
I wanted to like this product it did make my pores smaller but after two three days my face broke out in a rash.  It took a week to clear up with hydrocortison.,1.0
"I have been using a 10% Glycolic Pad from another company.  I've been very happy with that product but felt I needed something a little stronger.
I purchased the Glycolix Treatment Pads in 15% and 20%. I figured I would build a tolerance to the 15 so I also purchased the 20.
The first time I used the 15% I felt nothing. The next day I tried the 20% pads. I felt a very slight tingling sensation.  Hardly noticeable.

Tonight I tried my old 10% pads. I can still feel like they are working.  They give that burn / tingling feeling.
I'm not sure if you have to feel that tingling for the product to be working or not.  I would think yes.
Someone else wrote that these pads are a knock off of the real thing.

At this point I can not recommend this product.  I will still continue to try this product since I already have it.
If my opinion changes I will post it here.",1.0

"I was excited to try these out after reading great reviews by others.  I was disappointed though!  First, it came leaking in the package.  It seemed like the seal was broken.  Against my better judgement, I decided to try them anyway.  They made my skin so dry.  So I decided to moisturize well after with some Creme de la Mer, my normal moisturizer.  After a couple days of use, the only thing I got was breakouts!  I ended up throwing them away.  They really seemed to be just pads soaked in witch hazel.  Save your money and buy something else.",1.0
"I originally bought this from my dermatologist for $45 and up until a year ago he only charged $5 for shipping but now he's charging $15 shipping for the same product (?!?) so I decided to purchase this product online instead & when I got this in the mail I compared it to the old jar I got from the dermatologist. First off the label looks like it's been re-made to look like the original (it's noticeably lighter in color & the bottom of the label says: Topix PHARMACEUTICAL INC: N Amityville New York 11701)so WHY THEN IS THE PICTURE IN THE AMAZON LISTING NOT THE SAME AS THE ACTUAL PRODUCT???) The picture in the listing looks identical to the one I got from my dermatologist but the actual product arrived looking GENERIC. I used it today for the first time after running out of my original Glycolix from my dermatologist a few months months back & this one is definitely not as strong! There was no tingling, no stinging, no sign of burning I originally would get with the other one! My face did turn slightly red but that's it. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! WILL NOT RE-PURCHASE!!! =( I found a better glycolic acid product on Makeup Artist's Choice website.",1.0
"This lipstick is horribly dry & the colors depicted in the picture no way resemble the real-life product.  I purchased the ""Valerie"" & ""Peggy"" colors (from one of Amazon's sister sites) thinking they were in the beige-pink color range - the ""Valerie"" is actually orangey-coral & the ""Peggy"" is brick red.  I can't speak about the quality of other Jouer lipsticks but the ""Hydrating"" line is definitely a ""DON'T BUY"" & not worth $22/tube!",1.0
No safety seals on bottles so returned. With a newborn you can never be too safe.,1.0
Bought this for my daughter because I had heard great things about the product and had a horrible experience with it. The smell is really strong but I must admit I really liked that it came with a little pump so it was easy to get the product while baby was in tub. But my daughter right after the first use got an allergic reaction in her whole body. Red rashes and excessive skin dryness everywhere stopped using it after the first and only use.,1.0

Glass was broken and cracked in several places and I didn't realize until the candle burned down and started leaking all over my counted!,1.0
"Unfortunately, the candle was crammed in a box that it just barely fit into, with just one small piece of paper. I pulled it out of the box when it arrived, and the glass was cracked all the way down one side. Smelled wonderful. I'm sure it would've been great had it been packed correctly.",1.0
"Alright Amazon reviewers, you got me. I always buy the Aspen Bay candles because they are amazing. Read one of the reviews and one of the reviewers spoke of this hot mess. I said what the hell, I'll try the candle and the diffuser. Something  different... Got the candle today lit it, waiting for its aroma and Bam! Havana's brilliance gave off the aroma of sweaty butt cheeks after a night of eating Mofongo and doing the Cha-cha...Absolutely horrible. Worst part is, the diffuser is scheduled to be delivered tomorrow...Can you say, office Christmas gift? This will definitely be in the bag.",1.0
i have a vey small  space bought two and cant smell a thing! These are horrible,1.0
"As much as I like this candle, it is a rip off for the price. The candles are small...about 5 ounces..and the cost is not worth it. Try going directly to the company to see if you can get it cheaper as opposed to buying from these mom and pop vendors. You will be disappointed at the size of this candle.",1.0
"Shocking....I was very excited to obtain this candle but there is no smell when lit!  Some faint odor when not lit, but common people.  Very disappointing!",1.0
"I've purchased many candles for my apartment in the past, so when I came across many great reviews for these candles I felt that I must try them out.  The following was my experience, I can only assume from a defective product.  I got the candles (one in the first shipment, two in the second) and opened the box to read about them and look at the directions to ensure there wasn't anything crazy about them.  Once that was done I lit one and left it in my living room.  It says to only let them burn for two hours at a time and so forth so I did exactly that, after two days of using these candles I noticed something strange.  I woke up to blow my nose and in the tissue was thick black residue.  I was unaware of where this could have came from and honestly I just said well maybe it was something strange and just wrote it off that day.  This continued every morning when I blew my nose for almost a week, I then stopped using the candle since my brain finally realized that hey it could be this candle.  After two days of not using it, my nose is clear and needless to say I'm pretty worried about what I have been inhaling this whole time.  I contacted amazon customer service and they gave me a refund right away, I'm however concerned about what those candles did to my health and unaware if I should take matters further.",1.0
"As previous reviews have mentioned, this product has a serious smoking issue. Its odor is virtually non-existent. The sides of the candles do look like the wax has melted and re solidified.",1.0
"Purchased this based on the great reviews. The scent is great. No amount of wick trimming has solved the smoking issue. I have trimmed to .25"" and trimmed again and it still produces too much soot. For the cost of this candle this should not be a problem.  Other candles I have purchased do not produce the amount of smoke this one does.",1.0
"After discovering dermablend at the mall with my sister I knew it was the makeup for me. I loved it, I even got the setting powder in warm saffron to help the makeup last longer. However after trying it several times I realized I wanted to try the sheer setting powder and ordered it here. I am not convinced that this is the original dermablend product. Maybe I am wrong but I think this particular product is a knock off. I will try ordering the product from another seller and make sure the label says Dermablend professional.",1.0
"I like the setting spray, but the powder dried my skin.",1.0
"I really really wanted to love this, since the foundation is so great. But no, it left my face looking chalky-white. Plus, using the powder puff thing just makes an awful mess because it's just a large bit of fluff with no shape. It says it's for any fair skin, but no.",1.0
"I did not purchase this off of amazon. I did purchase it at Ulta. A store clerk recommended it to me and i don't think i have ever been so disappointed. I purchased the translucent powder and i already have extremely fair skin and this made me look pure WHITE! Like i put flour all over my face. I thought you received a great amount of product for the price and it applied very nicely. The fact that i wear porcelain foundation and this ""translucent"" made me look that white is unacceptable If someone with a medium skin tone were to purchase this there is no way they could wear it. Definitely will not ever purchase this product again!",1.0
Dont match like the reviews say.,1.0
Caused irritation on my skin and I CAN'T RETURN IT. Spray for 'Baking' on your skin is stupid and doesn't work. Just like spraying water on your face only it has chemicals in it. Powder is WHITE. Mine as well use baby powder!,1.0
"Maybe I received a phony product - I don't know. I received the Loose Translucent Setting Powder and immediately used it to set my under eye area. It made any fine lines appear ten times larger, so I stopped using it for a few months. I started using it again a few days ago to see if I was too hasty in my initial review. But now that I've been using it before I go to work, the natural daylight is only making things worse. After it's applied, it really highlights the difference between my foundation color and my concealer.  My under eyes look so yellow all of a sudden, like I'm jaundiced. It also gives me this really powdery look, as if I used one of those giant powder puffs from Looney Toons and smashed it into my face. I tried to counteract the powdery-ness with some hydrating setting spray - it helped, but my makeup still looks like garbage. I have this obvious white-cast to my face and it makes me look ill. It also cakes up my makeup, so my concealer is collecting in fine lines under my eyes (I bought my concealer mainly because it doesn't do that normally). It is just disappointing allover. Save your $$$.",1.0
"I have heard so many good things about this powder, but after using it for a bit I am completely at a loss as to why people love it so much.  This powder makes my face look ghostly and dry, it highlights every fine line and pore. Unless you have SUPER oily but otherwise flawless skin this doesn't seem to be a good product.",1.0
"This product is useless.  When I use the pad that comes with it, it takes off make up as I put the powder on.  Forget waiting 2 minutes.  Foundation leaves a permanent make-up stain on the pad even after washing which tells me it really is soaking up the foundation rather than buffing it. I tried this powder several different ways: with 3 (yes 3 different Dermablend foundations I also reviewed) another brand foundation, and on skin with no make up. It works best and looks best on a make up less face.  Next it works okay with another brand's foundation.  Not as much comes off and I'm here is a little bit of glow. Finally, it does nor work at all with Dermablend foundations. That's right. The pad takes off the most make-up and has no glow with the very make up with which it should be designed to work well.  I tried using a brush made for compact powders, and it was a little better across the board.  In no scenario did my make up last any longer or prevent any more shine than using loose or compact powder from another brand.  It makes no sense to buy this compact.",1.0
I have oily skin and this is not putting a dent in it.,1.0
"I really wanted to like this makeup. I've heard raving reviews about this brand and have seen their expensive products at Ulta but never tried them due to the price. I used this as directed and it's just not for me. I have very pale skin that is oily. I still felt like this left a white, powdery tint to my skin and it didn't set my make up very well.  My make up didn't last any longer than it normally does, definitely not the 16 hours that is claimed. I looked at the ingredients and all that's in it as talc. I'm not sure why a container of talc costs so much money.",1.0
"Product this time unlike prior purchases. The powder was compressed down so hard , difficult to get it to cover concealer. I have purchased this before and even though translucent it would cover concealer. Finally had to scape up and use like loose setting powder",1.0
"At first I would have gave this product a five star review however after using for a few days my skin is now red, flaky, and peeling. It's  like my skin is literally cracking and flaking off!!!! I WIL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!!!!!",1.0
"This is literally just super fine Talc. I put it on exactly how the instructions listed and it made me much more pale, and I'm already as pale as can be. I tried brushing off as much as I could, didn't really matter. The puff it comes with is huge, you will need a separate brush for under eye work. Not worth the money that's for sure.",1.0
When a product is listed as 'new' it shouldn't come used with residual makeup on the powder brush.,1.0
I did not like this but my daughter did.,1.0
"This is a rip-off. It's nothing special in the slightest because it's just regular ole talc. You can buy plain talc for about a dollar and here they want $25. If you buy this then you're just paying for a jar and the name on it. The actual product ingredients are: Talc, (may contain titanium dioxide and/or fake colorant. I purchased the translucent one which works for any skin tone... so there's no color, just plain talc. Furthermore, this powder does not last like they claim and it definitely transfers onto clothing.

I will using cornstarch instead because it works better and is much cheaper, plus you can place a small amount in a frying pan on low heat to match the color to your skin. Be sure to stir the cornstarch to evenly ""brown"" it. If it gets too dark, then just add a bit more white cornstarch. This works pretty well and won't cause you problems like the talc will.",1.0
Bought to use with Light Dermablend leg and skin cover up. The white powder does not act translucent on the skin and leaves a white powder residue. Also the puff provided leaves behind small fibers which are hard to get off if using with the cover up.,1.0
Still oily and it does transfer. Dissapointed!!!!,1.0
"This did not work at all for covering tattoos. Another reviewer's (Lynn) picture is exactly what happened to me, too. I watched all the videos, followed all the directions to a T, waited super patiently for the Dermablend concealer stick (which sucks too) to dry before applying this powder, and no matter what I did or tried it did NOT stay put. Like, at all. I have no idea how this product worked for enough people to earn the 4 stars it has.",1.0
Didn't give me the look I was hoping for. Made my makeup look clumpy.,1.0

"I got this to 'set' my liquid makeup, but this just doesn't work. It cakes up quickly and it doesn't set my face at all",1.0
Didn't cover as well as had made out to b didn't last the hours that was said don't plan on using the product would like refund if possible very costly to be sitting on counter,1.0
It doesn't set my dermablend foundation at all. I'm a dermablend lover but this is a definite dud. I wouldn't buy again. The only thing it really does is temporarily matte my face.,1.0
"I have been using derma blend since 2003. I bought the setting powder but it never works. When I apply my concealer, I dab on a generous amount of setting powder and leave it on for 5-10 minutes before I dust it off but the concelaer still remains moist/wet and rubs off if I touch it or brush up against clothing etc. Perhaps I got a bad batch but it makes absolutely no difference to me.",1.0
"I bought this product. I thought that it was a good deal. I had to throw it out this morning. It made my skin burn, whenever I use it. The dermablend powder from the mall had a different consistency and never made me burn. I threw it out , because I am not sure if it is really dermablend and I was concerned for my skin health. I have been using the real dermablend for years. I guess, I wanted a deal. Burning skin is not worth it.",1.0
Dermablend Loose Setting Powder had a lot of good reviews. I just did not have a good experience with it. I bought two different colors and neither looked good. I did not really like the loose powder. And then I broke out after using it though one of the reasons I bought it was reviews saying it did not cause break outs like other powders. I read so any reviews rating this highly I was surprised it turned out so badly.,1.0
Not what I expected at all!,1.0
Do not like it.  Plan on giving it away.  Do not like the return policy.,1.0
The product does not work. It does not have clamp to hold my hair around the iron. My hair slips out before it is curled. The box was inadvertently thrown away before I could return it.,1.0
VERY GOOD!!  GOOD SERVICE AND THE RIGHT PRODUCT.  WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN.,1.0
"It had no end cap and I burned three of my fingers badly.  I returned it.  Don't know if is suppose to have a safety cap on the end or not, but I sure found out how dangerous it was without one.  I have two other Hot Tools curling irons and love them.  This one is totally different from my others.",1.0
When I saw this on Amazon I thought this was a normal person curling iron; but alas it was not. It is meant for an octopus to use. I don't even know how a professional uses it since they have only two hands to try and use all the twisting and rotating wands. Too complicated and I just ended up returning it and getting the regular one.,1.0

This is the 2nd Hot tools iron I bought in 6 months! There is a definite problem with the wiring at the base of iron. Twice this iron has had a short in the wiring. I will never buy another hot tool product again.,1.0
"Arrived in the promised time, but worked one time before no longer heating up. Was expecting more than a one time use iron.",1.0

This broke within first two weeks !  I threw the box the first day I got it like a moron and can't return it to get a refund ,1.0
I wouldn't recommend this product to just anyone. It doesn't have a plastic piece on the end of the barrow to hold on to so I've burnt myself a few times now. Unfortunately I didn't notice this until after I threw the box away. Perhaps it said this in the description and if it did I missed it.,1.0

I thought the curling iron would have a spring loaded mechanism in the attached clip but it does not. It is difficult to manipulate and my hair did not curl properly. I am returning it and next time will buy one in a store where I can try it out first. Sorry I bought it. Does heat up well and fast if you can manage other problems.,1.0
I  really do not understand why after a month both of the irons i bought do not heat up any more the light goes on but they do not heat very disappointed in this purchase.,1.0
"I'm sure this is a very good curling iron.  My hairdresser uses one like it.  However, I don't know if it is because I'm left handed, but I can't manipulate it without it being spring-loaded.  I kept burning my arms and hands.  I hear you must learn to use one that isn't spring-loaded, but I don't like burning myself with it!",1.0
"Every time I buy one of these, it breaks immediately or within 3 months. I bought this, it was broken, got a replacement and it just stopped working. Garbage-no more!",1.0

Usually the spring broke with no replacement.  Now this curling iron has very little heating power, which is why I have stayed with this brand.  I have to have a very hot iron for my hair, but sad to report that my ole faithful isn't very faithful this time around.  Will be shopping around for a new brand.",1.0

"I had curly/wavy un-color treated hair. This product smelled SO STRONG of baby powder. Overwhelmingly gross. I would ignore the smell if it made my curls pretty and luscious like it promised, but it made my hair feel like straw and knotty and just all around gross.

If it wasn't so late when we returned from our outing, I would have taken a shower asap.  Not only that, My hair did not hold up under it.  It looked great for around the first hour then resorted to flat/wild.  So sad.  :(",1.0
It didn't live up to the reviews I read prior to buying it. I originally saw it advertised on a site recommending it especially for naturally curly hair that's fine. Better use of $ for fine curly hair = Sebastian Potion 9 and Ion Curl Solutions Conditioning Curl Whip.,1.0

Tried this and the Botanical Boost Moisturizer and both made my fine 2b curly/wavy hair just look dirty and weighed down. Very disappointed as I love natural products and had high hopes for this brand.,1.0
This product did not make my hair curl up and it made it very dry.  I honestly don't know who would benefit from this.  My hair is wavy and it's supposed to be for wavy hair.  I wouldn't use it unless your hair was very healthy. It is very drying.,1.0

I love PCA products but I will unlikely buy them on here again. The product was very dirty and banged up.  The packaging clearly looks like it has been opened up many times.

"Disappointing Product
Do Not Buy This Product!!!!! I have a small dark spot on the left side on my upper lip and have felt self conscious about it because it wasn't going away after a month. I went to a dermatologist and she told me about this product. I purchased it and it has ruined my life at the moment. My dermatologist told me to only apply it at night because the formula is strong so I applied only a small think layer with a Q-Tip on the dark spot and after it dried I hydrated it. The next morning I woke up with the dark spot soooo DARK. I went to my dermatologist after work and she told me to. It apply it anymore and to let a week go by. However, the spot seems to have turned into a small thin blister and when I went to clean my face with only water a small piece rubbed off and now you can see my flesh. This product has too many things it shouldn't be sold.",1.0

"I was looking into this product and was almost going to purchase it to try to brighten my dark spot.

Perhaps in low concentration it is ok. Everyone should take a look at this article to learn about hydroquinone [...].

Maybe this product works for other people, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1.0

There is only slight drying of very fine layer of epidermis which I can rub off but none of that drying and scabbing to reveal lighter skin that other reviewers have written about. Not even on my sunspots. I am disappointed so far, but will keep using until bottle runs out and may try using more and rubbing into skin more. Hope that starts to make a difference.",1.0

"I have had hyperpigmentation since 2004. As a guy i have tried so many things and this gel was kind of my last hope but I wished I had never used it.. The thing with gel/creams for hyperpigmentation is that many contains alcohol and this will dry the skin, creating crusts which you have to peel off to see new fresh skin. 6 days ago, i used it on my chin, and peeled of the crust the day after and it left me with a huge dark spot. It looks terrible and now, 7 days later it is still there=(.
Im guessing it will be there forever now.

Im giving up the battle againts my hyperpigmentation. You win skin. You cant have everything in life. Im healthy, have a home, a job, food on my plate but just not  a flawless skin. I have brown/yelloish skin, so be careful using this. You just cant have everything in life...",1.0

"As with most skincare products there is a certain amount of patience that goes along with using the product. Usually results don't happen overnight.

I even took photos to make sure I could evaluate before and after pics. I tried to return this product to brandnameskincare and was told that they have a 30-day return policy so I was out of luck.

You know, if a product is supposed to provide immediate results then I can certainly understand the need to have a ""standard"" 30-day return policy. However, this is not a standard product. It is a beauty product that is supposed to work ""over time"" not ""over night."" I know a lot of reviewers have had positive results with this Pigment Gel and for those suffering from melasma I encourage you to look into this product.

IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. It's almost impossible to make one small bottle last a month. $90- $100 every three months is quite a hefty price to pay.

THE SMELL : wow ;... it's plain awful. It's not something you should wear or use during the day because the smell is quite noticeable. People will be wondering how long its been since you've washed your hair.

THE WAY IT MAKES YOU HAIR LOOK: Okay here is what I hate most about this product. It does not seem to dry. If you have hair that your normanly combe or style this product will not allow you to do so. It makes you hair look extremely oily and heavy so it's makes your hair look horrible. I could never get my hair to it's normal style, but I decided to use it nights. Well, even after applying it 3-4 hour before going to bed my pillow would turn brown from the product.

this is a horrible product. I hate it completly. Does it work? It didn't work for me. I used it for over 6 months and it's a waste of money.

The way you hair will look while wearing this product will surprise you. If you still want to use it I would use it at night because your hair will look greasy, smelly and plain awaful during the day.

Good luck!",1.0

"*************************************
1/26/16 - COMPLETE! For those who don't want to read the whole thing, here's a summary:

I used Revivogen for 1.5 years. At first, I had a light shed, but that hair grew back. I noticed small, whitish hairs, but they never got darker or longer. The final verdict is that it didn't work for me. I'm currently trying another product called ""Lipogaine,"" which seems like a combination of Revivogen (DHT blocker) and Rogaine (follicle stimulation from minoxidil). I'll try to remember to update this with a verdict on Lipogaine.
*************************************

I'm going to update this as I go guys.

BACKGROUND: I'm almost 27. I saw a video review of this product on a men's wellness site that I use, and I got paranoid about losing my hair. Pattern baldness runs in the family; my younger brother rapidly lost his hairline from 20-22. The way that my hair's styled, I'd never noticed any recession or thinning, but I was paranoid, so I checked, and bingo! There was a little thinning across my hairline. I ordered this immediately. I use it every morning after cleaning up. I also used the shampoo every other day (UPDATE: After a few months, I stopped using the shampoo and switched to regular shampoo.). At first, there's a strong hairspray smell, but that fades within an hour or two. People are exaggerating how bad it smells. The shampoo smells like peppermint.

First 3 weeks - I noticed that my hairline got noticeably thinner in spots across the top. I wasn't shocked because the Revivogen website says that it's typical and that it's a good sign. Hairs in the resting and transition stage fall out when Revivogen puts your hair back on the normal growth cycle (by reducing DHT), so that shows that it's working.

Weeks 4-6 - I noticed two positive things: 1) ""Mini"" black hairs are growing in the spots where hair fell out in the first weeks. There's even a weird piece of hair coming out of my forehead. 2) I see tiny, white-ish hairs surrounding my hairline where there wasn't hair before. I'm hoping that these are the ""unpigmented"" hairs that I read about on the Revivogen site. So far, so good!

Day 70 - I'm right on track for what the site describes for the 2-3 month mark. Overall, my hairline looks thicker than a month ago. It's a combination of the pre-existing hairs getting longer/thicker and the hairs that fell out during the shed slowly coming back. There's still some thinness though. I see a lot of tiny black hairs and tiny uncolored hairs, but they haven't gotten longer/thicker yet. I'm not surprised because the website says that they start to get darker and longer by 6-8 months. I'm optimistic because there are a lot of those little hairs, and if they grow/darken, my hairline will be perfect. Guys, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and stick to the timeline.

6 months - It's been a few months since the last update, and I've grown my hair out quite a bit, so it's hard to judge in some spots. I'm definitely not seeing as many hairs come out when I wash, but I can say that not much has changed with those tiny, uncolored hairs around my hairline. I've seen a few black hairs pop out and get long (which is hopefully a good sign) but not many. I'm not worried because the directions say that the miniaturized hairs and uncolored hairs start getting darker and longer after 6 to 8 months. I just got to month 6, so hopefully, I'll see some change over the next 2 months. I just started using my 5th bottle two days ago, so this stuff has been lasting well (1.5 months per bottle).

So, far, the stuff that they said would happen has happened on schedule, so I'm going to stick with it for at least another 6 months. I'll post an update in about 2 months.

1 Year - It took a little longer to update this than what I expected, but I just passed the 1 year mark, so I wanted to update this.

To be perfectly honest, I haven't noticed much change over the last few months. I haven't seen those tiny, whitish hairs get darker or grow longer. My hair is a lot longer than it was when I started using this; it was cut close, but now I've got 1 year of length on the top. That probably makes it harder to judge than if it was the same length.

The bottles have lasted for 1.5 - 2 months each.

As a side note, a few months back, I realized that this stuff builds up on your scalp pretty thickly, so you have to make sure that you wash it off well. I didn't visually notice it, but when I scratched that area of my head, I noticed that there was a lot of build-up. I guess that I hadn't been washing it off as well as I should have, so it's possible that my results slowed because new applications couldn't ""soaking in"" due to the build-up. I'm going to use it for another 3-6 months. I'll give another update around and final verdict.

1.5 years -  Hi guys. Again, it took longer for me to update this than I'd planned, but I'm here to give a final verdict and notes on this.

I used Revivogen for approximately 1.5 years. At the end of that time, I didn't notice any improvement in my hairline. In the beginning, I had a slight shed, and that hair grew back, but I didn't notice any additional hair growth. Those tiny, whitish hairs never got darker or longer. For that reason, I moved the rating down to 1 star. It didn't work for me.

On a hopeful note, I've moved on to trying another product called ""Lipogaine."" You can find it on Amazon too. The claimed benefits seem like a combination of Revivogen (DHT blocking) and Rogaine (follicle stimulation from minoxidil). I've been using it for about a month, and I plan to test it for at least 6 months. If I remember, then I'll update this to let you know whether or not the Lipogaine works and post a review on its product page.

Hopefully, this has inspired you to leave more helpful and meaningful reviews. Good luck with your battle against hair loss!",1.0
"I'm onto my third bottle. It is greasy so I have to wash my hair everyday. If it didn't work, I would've been fine as I'm not looking for a miracle cure. However, I lost more hair. Now, I have obvious bald patches. I would definitely not recommend Revivogen Scalp Therapy.",1.0
"I have used it, it is working exactly as stated in the other reviews by the users. if you use it your hair fall will increase and no way to control it. do not buy.",1.0
"This stuff smells SOOOO bad that I only used it once.  Honestly, I can see someone who is single, and lives alone using this, because anyone within 10 feet of you will be able to smell it.  I will never use it again.",1.0
"I have been using it for like 7/8 months and the least I can say is that it didn't keep it's promises, at all.

The only brillant thing about Revivogen is the marketing campaign.
It claims only mild results like slow down shedding, maybe regrowth, if not in 6 months maybe in one year, or not...

So you just go with it, your hair keep falling but you don't know if it's a lil' better or a lil' worse, so you wait and wait, with your hairline slowly receding wondering how worst would it be without reivogen.
It claims no side effects, yet the product smells terrible, it makes your hair looks terrible (very greasy, like you have been drowning in your sweat for days), it facilitates dry, tichy scalp.
Plus you gotta wash it away every morning, which is very damagable for hairs and time consuming.

It was supposed to stop shedding 6 months after I started using it and it didn't, it didn't regrow anything of course.
And when they say ""you give you your money back if your aren't satisfied"" they mean ""we refund you your last order if you manage to ship it to us in time.

Tricky point is you can only buy scalp therapy for 3 months and they want to have 90 days later at the latest !
Plus you gotta keep the empty bottles and stuff ... But since they tell you to use it for at least 5/9 months you will still have 2 packs unrefundable.
So the garantee works only if you are in the middle of your 3rd/4th pack and you manage to send it back to them on time. Yet they still sucked a few hundred dollars out of you you ll never see again.

TL;DR : Congratulations for your marketing/manipulations techniques revivogen. You keep into business selling a useless, pricy product and this is quite impressive nowadays.",1.0
"I did use this product as indicated on the box and like every other young man that is losing his hair I am willing to spend any type of money to keep my hair, but his product is definitely not the solution. It just doesn't do anything for your hair the only result I obtained was less money in my pocket and a very dry scalp. Don't waste your money; you are going to regret it.",1.0
"Let me first say I was skeptical of this product before ordering it. I have been battling hair loss for 5 years and have tried various different things. I should note that I did experience success using brand name Avodart. But due to extremely high cost and sexual side effects I was desperate to seek out a topical alternative. Which lead me to Revivogen. After using for 3 months and doing lots of internet research I have come to the conclusion that this product is useless and bordering on a scam. First off the product DID NOT do anything to slow or regrow hair for me. But more importantly what I found on the net is discouraging. I will list out my reasons for this below...

1. Topical Absorption - Yes, Revivogen does have an impressive ingredient list. Most of these products have been shown in a lab to have some anti-androgen properties. The key thing to understand here is ""in a lab"". There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that these ingredients will lower DHT in a human body, LET ALONE if they are applied topically. There are many things that have systemic effects when taken orally but have no efficacy at all when used topically. This can be seen in many vitamins as well as spirinolactone which is an extremely powerful anti-androgen. However, as many hair loss sufferers have discovered it has no effect used topically. Moving on...

2. Where are the good reviews? - Revivogen has been around for some time and if it is as effective as they claim there should be lots of internet success reviews backing this up. I have scoured the net and at best have come up with people saying they ""think it works"" or it ""should work"" based on it's ingredients. You'd think on sites like Amazon there would be lots of people backing this product. When I did come across positive reviews they appeared to be fake and scripted. Which is something I will address next.

3. Duplicate reviews - In searching the net for reviews on Revivogen I found one website that had an abundance of them. I won't name the site but it sounds very similar to ""Follicle"". This website has 60+ reviews for the product with an average of 3.5 out of 5 stars. I read every one. People either are very enthusiastic about this product and encourage people to keep using it because it takes time, or they hate it and call it a scam. I wasn't sure what to think. Then I noticed that there were 4 duplicate reviews. What I mean by this is there were 4 reviews with identical reviewer names and locations but that each had very different positive reviews. Oops Revivogen, you messed up either by human error or by programming your bot incorrectly. This CLEARLY shows someone is trying to boost the amount of positive reviews Revivogen has on the website by using fake reviews. Who do you think is doing it? I doubt it's a customer who loves their product so much they decided to fake a bunch of positive reviews for them.

4. 2 more things - These next to points are more speculation but are worth noting. It has been said (though I haven't found it) that Revivogen has made claims on their website that their product is endorsed by the talk show host of the Bald Truth. A quick search on the Bald Truth's website finds a response to this by the host saying a very long time ago he thought natural topical DHT inhibitors might have some effect but now he does not believe this at all and that he does not endorse their product and that he is surprised they would say so.

Secondly I located a website which reviewed Revivogen and addressed the issue of topical absorption not likely working. Now when you go to the article it is a greyed out with a note saying the article has been removed because they received pressure to remove it. Who would pressure them to remove it? And why? I think the answer is obvious.

In closing I want to address that some of you will say that if the product doesn't work then they would have gone out of business. Think about it, with all the men everyday for the first time noticing they are losing hair all they need to do is convince you to buy their product once or a few times. After milking you for several hundred dollars before you give up there is a whole new customer base ready to throw out a few hundred in cash. It's an endless cycle.

I wish all of you the best of loss in your hair loss battle. But I hope this review will help you to move on to more effective/proven solutions rather than waste your money and precious time.",1.0

Smells disgusting and made my hair sticky and gross feeling. I've used Rusk for years and this is the first time I've been disappointed. Will be returning this.,1.0
"HORRIBLE!  This used to be the BEST product around....they reformulated it, now it is AWFUL!!!!  RUSK PLEASE bring back the original ASAP!",1.0
"TAKE NOTE: Rusk has recently changed the formula of Radical Creme, it's now a very different product!

I have been using Radical Creme for almost 15 years, it's always been a great product that thickens and holds my hair without any trace of sticky residue or fragrance. My most recent order arrived a couple of weeks ago and I immediately noticed a drastic difference in look, feel and performance.

Not sure why Rusk felt the need to change the formula. The new Radical Creme looks different when you dispense it from the tube, and leaves a thick, sticky residue in your hair as it dries. Also, the performance of how it holds is completely different as well. Disappointed longtime user.....will have to find an alternative.",1.0
Very satisfied.,1.0
"Very stinky! Smells like old perm solution. Doesn't make my hair fuller, just sticky.",1.0
"I really don't like leaving 1 star reviews... but, since this product arrived damaged and oozing into the surrounding plastic, I had to send it back.",1.0
"This product was not meant for my hair - it makes my hair feel like glue was applied. I guess my hair was not fine enough.
I know it worked for others - it didn't work for me.",1.0
THis was NOT 13.5 oz.  it was 6 oz!,1.0
I love this product but when i received it the pump didn't work. Very disappointed,1.0
couldn't tell it helped with volume. Very little,1.0
This doesn't find thing.,1.0
"Did not enjoy this product. The pump dispenser is very hard to use and by the time you find the strength to use it, you get a small burst of product that may not be where  you intended it to go. I am not arthritic and found this bottle mechanism very hard to use. The pumps were tight and sparse. Also, only added a small amount of volume to a specific area. Wasn't able to use as a full head volumizer because of pump, therefore I would not recommend .",1.0
"I have thin fine hair and this is the absolute WORST stuff I have ever used. Not only does the pump not work but it left my hair dry and lifeless. Could not believer how a company can charge so much for garbage and then put it in a bottle that is doesn't spray. The other thing is,if you read the label,the only possible good thing is hydrolyzed  wheat protein,SD alcohol,40-B alcohol, plain old alcohol,propylene glycol (used in anti freeze) benzyl alcohol,. There is nothing here other than the protein that  MIGHT even think about being beneficial,everything else is a chemical as is the scent.
Would have given ZERO stars if that was an option.",1.0
Hard for me to rate the quality of the product.  I tried the pump 2 times (just enough to get it primed) and the pump broke.,1.0
"What I most dislike is the difficulty (impossibility!) of pushing down the plunger! Granted, I have a rotator cuff problem but this doesn't interfere with any other spray-on hair products. I poured some of the Rusk solution into another spray bottle but this was unsatisfactory because it sprays too heavily. In addition, this product doesn't do much for my fine hair. Had high hopes but disappointed -- especially being unable to spray it!",1.0
I use this product all the time!  I was very disappointed because it appeared to be very watered down and not the same as when I buy it at a retail store or from my hairdresser!,1.0
I bought this to have on hand when needed. By the time I tried to use the product the return time was expired. Could never use because the pump on the bottle would not work. Bummer to waste money like that. It might be a good product but I'll never know.,1.0
This left my hair so flat and lifeless I could not leave the house.  My hair is very fine and the best product for me is the fatastic got 2b mouse. Very disappointing.,1.0
The dispenser would spray. I like the product but had to put in a dispenser that would work. Spilled a large portion of it when transferring it.,1.0
Smells pretty awful and I do not think it did anything at all for my hair?? Disappointing.,1.0
I have used this product for 15 years.  I believe a substitute liquid was used as a refill to this bottle.  I had some left in my other bottle that I had purchased locally.  There was a distinct difference in color and odor that what I had purchased from local legitimate store.,1.0
It smells just like VO5 detangler. Seems to have similar ingredients as vo5 but about three times the price. Does ok except it flakes on my scalp.,1.0
"I ordered this with the rusk shampoo, which is great... BUT, this conditioner is horrible!!! Don't buy it...I have fine hair.  This stuff leaves your hair like straw!!!  Trust me..Its the worst hair conditioner I have ever used, considering Rusk is a high quality brand.",1.0
"Face so dry after use, more whiteheads developed, espicially on the nose. Nose so shiny, not what i was expecting, but i'm willing to try other menscience products.",1.0
"The item was not in its original packaging, it was only in a plastic wrap.  I felt like it's a returned item that is being reshipped to other customers.",1.0
"I used this for about a month.  During this time, my face gradually broke out worse than when I was 15 years old and working at a fast food restaurant.  I didn't think it could be this product because it has acne medication (salicylic acid).  But, I quit using it, and sure enough it gradually became better and two weeks later, not a zit in sight.",1.0
"These use the worst delivery service called ONTRAC.  It was out for delivery for 2 days even though my wife was at home to receives the package.  They left zero notes on the door and after several phone calls the said the manger of ONTRAC will deliver the package.  I tracked it online it said delivered and no package, I called again and the said the driver would call me but no call.  So I have to waste my time waiting around for these idiots, I guess the whole organization is full of morons because they management can't even get it right.  Why can't they use a company that knows how to ship like UPS or something.  Do your self a favor and go to the store and buy this product don't was your time with the crap delivery service called ONTRAC.",1.0
I received the men science daily face wash and I have to say my skin is now even worse than it was before the face wash. I would avoid this product and go for something like Neutragena it works much better and is cheaper.,1.0
made my skin break out,1.0
"I had received a free sample of this when I purchased hand lotion, and I loved it so much that I eventually broke down and actually bought a whole tube. Unfortunately, this product does absolutely nothing. I don't know if it's been reformulated, but it certainly is not the same lotion that was in the free sample version. It has no smell, and my skin feels exactly the same after applying it, no matter how short or how long I leave it on. I've tried using more water to rinse it off, no rinsing at all, but it does not seem to do anything.",1.0
"It burns my skin so bad that I cannot stand, makes me afraid that it will leave real burning scars on my face!",1.0
"I'm not sure if I'm allergic to this stuff or what. I wash my face with Cetaphil before I go to bed and apply a small amount on my face, it tends to leave a slight burning sensation and when I wake up, my face itches all day and it feels like I have a rash. I had high expectations but now I'm just suffering.
Ive never had this happen before with any other type of lotion but I can say with confidence that this stuff does not work for me.",1.0
"My boyfriend applied this lotion, and then his face turned to be red and was hurt... Never use it again.",1.0
"This is a very expensive product that is not worth the exorbitant price.  I tried it based on the glowing reviews seen below, but it cleaned no better than other, less expensive options.  Only then did I realize that the reviews contained here may be scams.  The histories of the Florida reviewers below show that they gave five stars to the whole Menscience product line, and little else.  This is very suspicious to say the least.  In my experience, this product did not lather well, did not have a pleasant scent, and only cleaned o.k.  It left no residue, but one would expect that from this clear, liquidy soap.  I would not buy it again.",1.0
"I was very excited about trying this product after reading many reviews. When I first put it on, it was light and not greasy. Approx 2 hours after putting it on I began to have a burning sensation on my face and turned red. My guess is my face does not agree with the Alpha and Beta Hydroxy's in the product. So I am less than satisfied with this expensive purchase that will go to waste in my drawer. Maybe I will give it to one of the ladies at work.
So my final thoughts are that this product could have a place with many people but not with me. Make sure you check to see if this product will be compatible with your skin before you buy, especially since it is so expensive.",1.0
"I just returned this product to Amazon after realizing it contained the chemical triclosan for use as an antibacterial additive. I know, I know triclosan is FDA approved but that hardly should give anyone complete comfort (remember this is the same FDA who just last week finally came around to the conclusion trans fats are actually harmful--wow, shockingly late to that party). Yes, I also know triclosan is listed on the ingredient disclosure online, I just somehow missed it. Please do your own homework into why triclosan is a noxious and toxic chemical you absolutely do not want on your body, in your body or in our waterways.",1.0
"Does not eliminate dark spots as advertised. Was a waste of money--a lot of money considering the small amount
of product in a small jar.",1.0
"This product is a waste of money, it doesn't work. The other reviewers who claim it works are probably ""plants"" from the company. If you like flushing your hard earned money down the toilet, then by all means purchase it.",1.0
"I gave this product a try. It had good reviews and i liked the fact that it has no hydroquinone. Well, used it for a good while now and it is pretty much like me spitting on my hand and rubbing it on my face. Had NO affect at all. I regret purchasing it. Highly disappointing.",1.0
"I have been using this product every night since April and it does not make the age spots or freckles disappear so it is not a repair formula. If anything, it just seems to keep them from getting darker.  I do agree that it is expensive and will not reorder when finished with jar.",1.0
Used the product for well over a month and it does not do as advertised.  I don't see his spots lightening up even a little bit.  Very expensive product; seen no results.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.,1.0
"I think I must have gotten the new formula, as it didn't do anything beneficial to my skin. I bought it because of the great reviews, but after reading the most recent reviews, the description of the new formula matches what I have in the bottle.",1.0
"As mentioned in some recent reviews, this face scrub is no longer what it used to be. The new formula they are using is terrible and no longer does the excellent job it used to. The beads are too small/fine. I have used this scrub for years because it was the absolute best. I will no longer be purchasing it nor can I recommend it.",1.0
"I've been using this face scrub for years now. It was, by far, the best I've ever used and well worth the $30 or so a bottle I spent on it. I'm a guy with pretty rough, but clear skin. I don't know how well it works on acne, but for removing oil, dead skin cells, or any other build up, it was great. It had the consistency of a glue and the micro-scrubbing beads were like grains of sand. I used it while showering so it always rinsed off clean. Rubbing it into your skin for too long would leave your skin slightly reddish and feeling like you had a light sunburn. It felt like having a really clean shave, except all over your face and not just on your chin. It was really a product made for men and the average guy probably wouldn't want to use it every day because of how strong it was.

The last bottle/tube that I bought really surprised me. It seems that Men's Science changed the formula sometime in the last few months. I thought it might have just been a bad mix, so I checked the other recent reviews on Amazon and found that someone else had noticed the same thing. The new formula has the consistency of a lotion and the microbeads are much smaller and weaker. It doesn't ""scrub"" anymore. To put it simply, I can't tell the difference between this new formula and any other $6 face scrub I've bought at the supermarket.

Check the color of yours if you buy it. The old formula was an off-white color with a very slight yellowish tint. The new one is an off-white with a very slight grayish-blue tint. If it was just a bad batch that Men's Science sent out, I'd say this product is great and you should try it. For $30 a bottle, I'd expect better quality control though. Before buying it, check recent reviews to see if other people have noticed the change. Hopefully, it will go back to the way it was. Until then, I can't recommend this product over any other face scrub at one-fifth the price.",1.0
I have been using this face scrub for years now and it was great.  Now it's total garbage.  The new formula is like using lotion on your face.  The scrubbers aren't nearly as good as they were before.  I emailed MenScience and they said that the scrubbers were the same.  Yeah right.  Don't waste your time with this garbage.  They even blocked my review from their website.,1.0
Doesn't help the condition of psuedofolliculitis,1.0
The last time I bought this it was half the price it is now. I thought it was twice the size and it wasn't.,1.0
Returning second bottle...they've changed the formula and the smell is terrible now..moldy odor..so sad..this stuff was great. If you don't mind the stale rosemary smell on your neck it works well for sensitive skin,1.0
First of all you have to be a window licker on the short bus to buy this product or just filthy rich. I tried this at a friend's house and then compared the ingredients to Neutrogena's post shave balm and many of the ingredients were the same. Don't waste your money on this overpriced product when there are cheaper products available that do just as good a job. Neutragena post shave lotion feels just as good if not better and you can find it for under 10 bucks!!,1.0
"Ive been trying to find an after shave that works for me and this doesn't. It does sooth razor burn but it doesn't remove razor bumps or the redness.
Id recommend to try others that are cheaper before you try this.",1.0
"God! this stuff stinks.  I couldn't keep using it because the smell was so terrible, leaving my hair smelling ""dirty.""  What a waste of money and this stuff was very, very expensive!",1.0
Doesnt work for me have been using it for 3 months,1.0
This product did not do anything for me. I still have bumps/ingrown hair/pimples on my scalp. $30 down the drain.,1.0
"Even with the spray made to make the fibers stay in place, they do not.
The fibers do rub off on pillow at night and you wake with them all over your face. The fibers brush easily off the pillow case and brush easily out of your hair. So don't plan to brush your hair while out in public. Also the spray makes your hair as stiff as broom stray. Totally an awful experience.",1.0
"I am thinning at the temples due to postpartum hair loss. So glad I only ordered the smallest size of this, because it doesn't work for me.  I tried sprinkling directly from the container and applying with a makeup brush the effect was the same both ways.  The fibers clung to certain parts of my scalp more than others leaving a patchy effect that looked bad even from a distance.  I will go back to using eyeshadow to conceal my thinned hairline.",1.0
It easily blows off your face . it does not stay on.,1.0
Doesnt work,1.0
What a worthless junk and waste of money. This will look like a soot on your head and your scalp better not sweat otherwise it's gonna be a mess.,1.0
Bottle too small,1.0
I wish you give update on this matter. I wish you tell me if you received it and on the plane to space.. Haha.. Waste of money,1.0
It just was like black baby powder basically..... no fibers... powder,1.0
"This  sprinkles out of the container as a powder and sticks to the scalp.  Does not look anything like natural hair as is not as pictured on the video. Thank goodness I got the small size, which I have thrown in the trash.",1.0
Color said dark blonde.  It is black!!,1.0
"Very bad quality, I always used Miracle Hair Building fibers and this time I tried Toppik I will never ever suggest to buy this prouduct.",1.0
"So, I probably should have realized what .11 oz really meant but honestly you can't imagine how tiny this bottle is.  They absolutely should have a reference to size.  It's about the size of my thumbnail.  Ridiculous.  It's unopened and going back.",1.0
This did not work. It did not look like the videos and it was dropping out of my husband's head as black dust on his white shirt. Thankfully if didn't stain. It also came off on the couch. Very disappointed.,1.0
This product doesn't stick to your scalp. You definitely will need the spray. The instructions don't tell you to buy both products. It's very messy. I would not buy this product again.,1.0
Shaker lid came off and poured everywhere,1.0
Had this product for months Im a black man .... it looks terrible in the sun but if your in a darker lighted room it looks good I just hate that I cant go outside in the sun because its too obvious not natural . Only buy if your not planning on being in the sun youll stand out with black ass pepper looking hair,1.0
"Cheap fake. I bought it as a gift to my mom for Passover, and it was super embarrassing. She has been using Toppik producrs for years and mentioned that the texture is different and the product doesn't resemble the original.
I truly hope that Amazon will kick this seller out of their Marketplace. Deeply disappointed.",1.0
"This product is a scam. When it didn't work as advertised I returned it, following all of their directions, including putting the return auth number outside and inside the package. No refund. It's a scam.",1.0
Expensive and ineffective for me.,1.0
I am pretty sure this is FAKE. Don't waste your money.,1.0
"This product doesn't appear to be hair fibers, it's like dust and it came off on my pillows.",1.0
"Wow!!! This actually made my thin spot look THINNER!!! It thickened the hair around it causing it to stand out more. Plus, this stuff is dull and ashy. You can spot it a mile away. Sort of looks like matte spray paint on the scalp. It also fails everywhere....this stuff does NOT stay in place even with the toppik fiberhold spray or any kind of hair spray. It also made my head and hair look dirty. I ended up looking like a worked in a coal mine all day. lol At lease my boyfriend got a good laugh.",1.0
Not impressed. Didn't really see much of a difference. I think the spray on hair color works much better.,1.0
"Any Toppik side effects?

Yes.

Research from forum comments state that Toppik hair building fiber ingredients contain ammonium chloride, and that this substance has caused side effects in some people.

Like many chemicals, ammonium chloride can be hazardous if a significant amount were to enter your body. So, potentially, repeated exposure over time might lead to ammonia poisoning, with the following possible symptoms:

Muscle spasm.
Irregular breathing.
Irregular or slow heartbeat.
Contact can irritate skin and damage eyes.
Inhalation can irritate the nose, throat and lungs.
There can be an allergic response much like asthma.
Coma!

As you can see, ammonium chloride is not something you really want to keep putting into, or onto, your body in large amounts. Your risk probably depends upon:

How often you use the product.
How much you apply each time.
Individual sensitivity or allergy.
Whether your diet includes any other source of ammonium chloride (e.g., some spirits, fizzy drinks, confectionery, meat, etc.) which can cause the dose you get to accumulate.

Forum posts have also reported: aching muscles, heart palpitations and persistent headaches. And for what it's worth, some users also said they find the smell a bit strong!",1.0
"My hair is very straight and fine, and this stuff was very visible. Nor did it stick. You can't touch your hair once it's in or it falls out and unfortunately onto your face. Don't even think about brushing your hair during the day. the spray they sell to go with the fibers just made my hair wet, but those pesky little fibers still fell off my head.",1.0
Horrible...,1.0
Dang talk about waste if money. Only enough for one use. I'll buy a much bigger one in the future. Great product,1.0
"I think Im tooooo bald for this???  I just feel like tiny rocks are rolling down my head after I sprinkle this on my part.  I try combing it through but it just disappears. I even watched a few youtube videos on how to apply it, but no luck.  Bumble and Bumble tinted dry shampoo is the way to go .... not this.",1.0
Dont waste your money the results in person are completely different from the pictures it just looks like your poured a lot of black powder on your head .,1.0
"I bought some of this stuff as an experiment and honestly I can't believe people use this crap.

This is fake hair powder that looks like fake hair powder and you aren't fooling anyone.

If you're more comfortable walking around with this stuff in your hair than you are being bald you have serious daddy issues.

Shave your head. Grow a beard. Get into shape. Get on with your life.",1.0
Not happy. Too messy,1.0
It didn't work,1.0
"Worst purchase of my life. Thank goodness I ordered the small size as I wanted to check it out. I opened the cap, removed the plastic film and when I started applying the product on my scalp, the bottle opened up completely and ended up mostly on one point of my head and all over the bathroom. Also, you cannot touch your head, hair as this fibers will be removed if not fixed with a spray or something. What a joke!",1.0
What a load of crap !!! Just glumpson your head. I have hair not totally bald at all and mascare works better in my hair.  And for the sake of your eyes don't use this if your are a contact lenses wearer (painful) and I used a shield to protect my eyes. Still got on my contacts. Glad I got the sampler size.,1.0
Not as good as. reported. Can be messy when combing hair.,1.0
"I ordred this product many times, first time I received look like opend before and used! The powder out side the package!
I want to return it.",1.0
"this has to be a fake product. The fibers do not stick to the hair. I've used caboki before and it's 1,000 times much better than this. It does not look natural. It pretty much paints your head instead of fibers sticking to your hairs and making it look natural. D",1.0
The product I received was in a very small size. The picture is very deceiving and it won't allow to return. Definitely will not recommend.,1.0
Just admit it and shave it all pal,1.0
I wish I could rate this item - I never did receive it in my package.,1.0
Doesnt work well,1.0
Thanks a lot for ruining my marriage Toppik!,1.0
I got a different brand no good,1.0
Tiny and was very dark gray. My hair is white gray,1.0
"Does not work like u would think, made my hair look patchy.",1.0
"I Received it today, its a good thing I purchased the smallest one.  I applied it as suggested.  It just looked like dark powder on my head. I lightly patted my head as stated to spread it to needed areas which resulted in the powder coming right off.

I even tried using my shaving brush to lightly tap the product to needed areas but it just took the product right off as before.

I do not recommend this produce, save your money.",1.0
I thought it would be their regular size bottle but it was a tiny sample bottle,1.0
I ordered a red/auburn color but it turned out to be like a dark brown.  Will not work for me at all.  Glad I only got a trial size.,1.0
It's just a fine powder like talcum powder. It's very expensive and it only lasts until you wash your hair. I'm not sure if it anything for me.,1.0
I have a full length beard and I wanted to fill a patch on my side. This didn't help. It looks like powder on your face and easily removable. Its best to keep your beard natural instead of using a powder substance. I was charged 35 total for this product. I wasn't satisfied at all. I usually give great ratings but this product is not hair building fibers.,1.0
Too small,1.0
"This product was beyond terrible. ""Hair building fiber""?!???!!!? Where was that fiber that was said on the label???  that is such a bs inaccurate product description. This didn't do anything my regular eyeshadow  can't do. To put this to test, I applied these ""hair building fibers"" on the left side of my temple area, my eyeshadow on the right side of the  temple area, the end result was better with my eyeshadow. Because with the eyeshadow, you have different color options thus resulting in more REAL and natural look you desire and the eyeshadow is also easier to apply. The eyeshadow trick to cover hairlines or parting area or anywhere you want more ""coverage"" etc does work. I was curious about this product and just wanted to give this a try and this failed miserably.  And the dozen listed  ingredients are not things that is good for u either (side note lol). Whenever i want an even healthier alternative to cover the balding on the temple area,  I just apply very thin layer of lotion and  charcoal!!!!! That also works. I put the product outside for UPS to pick up right away.",1.0
Not a good buy.  We can't seem to make it work for my husband.  Looks like you spray painted his scalp.  2 thumbs down.,1.0
Not quite sure how this product is supposed to work but I didn't do anything for me .  Left my hair staticky.,1.0
"These just really didn't work for me. I have diffuse thinning--not the worst out there, but quite noticeable. Sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump, so it was really obvious there was something unsavory going on on my scalp. If you sweat a little bit or scratch your head, the fibers will really turn into clumps. I'm glad this works for other people, but I don't really want anyone to be able to tell that I'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder.",1.0
It's a regular hair powder. No fibers and it comes off on scalp and clothing. Very send to shake out of container and apply to hair-terrible,1.0

"I could not believe this. A literal micro cylinder with almost a drop of this in it. All for a total of $12. Honestly, I do not think I have ever been ripped off at this level for something so cheaply made and so hyped in my life. I purchased 22 grams of a brand whose hair product was of a better quality than this, which actually stuck to the hair properly (thus stuff just falls off as you place it on the head, and literally rolls off like sand), but this is another level of ripoff. The only reason this brand has any hype is because of a bunch of fake reviews that over the years has gathered a bunch of naive individuals to assume that it must be great. It is garbage. Never again. It is so bad it should be reported as a scam.",1.0

"not recommended, the fibers messed up my clothing and did not improve the areas following the directions.",1.0
"I was very hopeful about this product but was very disappointed and honestly a little suspicious about the good reviews for it. I'm not looking for a cure-all product, just a product that works the way the majority of the reviews and videos show but this doesn't by far especially for the amount of money I spent (getting the holding spray and fiber spayer). For the average Joe, I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe if it was applied by a specialist or barber it would work better but wouldn't help you daily. It's a powdery substance that doesn't spread well and is hard to manage. (Basically black power) This can only, possibly, maybe help in an area that you may want to slightly darken but doesn't work well with receding hairlines at all. I tried it with many different styles of cut but I'm sorry, its just not a product that's ready for the average person looking for simple everyday use. Just being honest in hopes to help the everyday working person. I wasted money.",1.0

"The comment is only for the black version of the fiber.

While the fiber itself seems to be okay, the color is a bit off. The black fiber is not black to match my hair, but rather a bluish ash color. After using the fiber, it looks like it just walk through an ashy attic.
Do not recommend the black version of this.",1.0

"I had high hopes and maybe that is where my problem started; with expectations. What in the holy heck is this stuff? Who is rating it a FIVE?
Whew, ok, I used this for the first time before going out to a social event. I tap tap tapped it on my part (where most of my gray/thinning is) ""generously"" as suggested. It was like I spread rapid tan on my face as the ""fibers"" befell up my forehead, nose, and chin. I looked like a Suburban PTA mom slash coal miner. I suddenly had hysterical black lung hacking until I realized that it wasn't black lung, but rather a near panic attack from my attempts to clean my face from the unexpected falling fibers syndrome. This act of failed facial cleansing had me in a brief perimenopausal hot flash that combined beads of sweat, panic, and whateverthehell these fibers were that were completely obedient to gravity. Ok, so, In summary.... A) No, B) I looked all dirty and stuff, C) I still had muh grays but now they were mixed with fibers (aka DIRT!) and D) I spent the rest of my evening compulsively wiping my forehead even though I was unable to see myself which turned into a secondary mild panic attack that I was somehow spreading DIRT all over my face, and E) No, again. Just no. I am sticking with my $12.95 CVS brand of root touch up that happens to give an illusionary experience of thicker hair. Now, my trust issues are all up and spiky because everyone raved over this stuff and threw all these stars at it. I'll be okay. Thanks. But I WILL be sending this back. Along with all the other crap I am ""going to send back""..... another story there....",1.0

Toooo smalll for 895. Live an learn. Won't  buy again.,1.0
"One of the worst hair building fibers out there. Stay as far away from these as you would from rotten fish! They don't adhere to the hair as the company claims, and the black color is actually not black at all. It is a gray/dusty color that's just horrible. I have used almost all brands of hair thickening fibers and trust me, these are the absolute worst. Don't waste your money, get something else.",1.0

Needs a better application system on this cannister thats already included.,1.0
"The applicator that came with it did not fit, so it would not work.  I returned it well before the deadline and was still charged for it.",1.0
What a tacky little product for the price. Misrepresented to look larger than it is. I'm very disappointed.,1.0
"It clumps up in areas that I am trying to cover up, which is the front part. Entire purpose of this is to cover up areas that you are loosing your hair or thinning! Well it definitely shows up to make it obvious you have something there you're trying to cover. It's not the best fiber product. Very frustrating I purchased a travel pack for our trip. Now I am regretting it! I bought one for my sister too. At least she doesn't have as much to cover like I do. Very disappointed!",1.0
don't waste your money. It looks horrible.,1.0
This is a cheap version and no good. Looked like black powder.,1.0
"Let me be perfectly clear... the product IS very good at what it does. The color matching is also very good... no complaints in that regard.  However, the reason I am giving Toppik the lowest possible rating is because of the outrageous price they are now asking for this product.  Let me state for the record that I paid $80 last year for a 1.94 oz. container.  The same container is now being offered for $115.  Well, guess what?  Toppik just lost me as customer as I will NOT be buying another bottle from them.  Luckily, there are other adequate ""hair fiber"" products on the market that compete directly with Toppik at a much lower price point.",1.0
"So this will work if your hair is longer, i have short hair and its very obivious that the product was in my hair, if your standing in direct light it looks horrible i applied it to my hair and my girlfriend spotted it right away, it just doesnt look natural.",1.0
I thought I ordered dark brown never would have ordered black. But med brown doesn't work either.,1.0

"I will admit a lot of the fault is mine because women are constantly told a lot of their beauty lies in their hair, and when you lose it it is pretty horrifying so, I tend to fall for a lot of the gimmicks that I will help my self-esteem some. This isn't one of them. It looked like I had dirt on my head, and it is dull and wipes right off. It is NOTHING they say it is, and it is NOT cheap. Just another company scamming people out of money based on insecurities and I fell for it.",1.0
It looks horrible!  It's so patchy.  Using eyeshadow is 100 times better,1.0

"This is just powder, not hair fibers! Looks like powder makeup. All this does is darken your scalp and looks ridiculous. This is no different than painting your scalp with color spray. Better off purchasing a wig..",1.0
It's just powder and it doesn't grow into real hair after you apply on your head like you see in some pictures here. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this product.,1.0
Looked like spray paint....not fibers,1.0
This is not authentic. The color is far too red and looks ridiculous.,1.0
Tiny container. I've never seen toppix in this size but ok. Not great size but toppix is great. Hopefully this is the real toppix in this weird container,1.0
I wish there was a way to rate the product separate from the seller..Great product but *way* too expensive here. Buy it directly from Toppik.,1.0
"Not something I would buy again. I have very thin hair that is also thinning, it was very obvious that something was sprinkled on my scalp. It looked like I dipped my head in cinnamon. I am sure this works well for others, but for me this is another strike out in the pursuit of fuller looking hair. Happy I only purchased the sample size.",1.0
"If I could give this zero stars I would. I always tell myself not to read Amazon reviews because I know everybody has a different experience. This is the worst. First of all it comes off super patchy, even with the spray nozzle. The medium brown looks almost like a burgundy. You can totally tell where the product has been applied. Not worth the money.",1.0
"The positive reviews must be paid for!! This stuff is atrocious, and turns to a very funny color on the scalp. It doesn't cover much at all, and the ""fibers"" become clumpy very easily... Im glad I got the smallest container, but still consider it 7$ down the drain. Big thumbs down.",1.0
I think I chose the wrong color so this does not work for me,1.0
These fibers have a weird green tinge to them.,1.0
"Love what it does but unfortunately after a week of using it my scalp is on fire, red, irritated, burning.  I had to medicate my scalp after using.  I stopped immediately.",1.0
For me this product just did not work. My hair is noticeable thinning in the front due to hair loss from medications. When I applied it as directed all it did was make my scalp look filthy dirty. I sent it back for a refund.,1.0

It didn't even stay on for a minute!!! Returning ASAP.,1.0
The concept of the hair fiber was good but this particular brand is very powdery.  It is nothing like hair fiber.  You'll look as if you sprinkled some coloring onto your scalp. Plus it gave me an intense headache.  Had to return right away.  Bought Caboki instead and b/c Caboki is plant based fiber I am not worried about any chemicals entering my body.,1.0
SUCKS,1.0
"This is the second time in a row the bottle/container arrived without a seal. When I opened the cap, about 1/3 of the product had accumulated in the cap and fell all over the ground. Make sure yours has the seal, and be careful opening. Otherwise, given the price tag on Toppik, you're losing 10 bucks right off the top.",1.0
Medium brown is pretty much the same color as Dark brown.,1.0
Terrible!!! Don't buy...burned my scalp and I lost a large amount of hair after first use. I woud give it no stars if I could. Not sure what's in it but I wasted my money on this junk.,1.0

"Caution:  I purchased this product and neglected to get the size.  I received a sample size, as in miniature.  Needless to say, the best I could do was laugh about the 3 grams of product in the container.  Colour is OK in the Auburn.  Needless to say, other similar products are a much better deal for same results.

"I was very unhappy with the product, it did not meet my expectations",1.0
"This ""medium brown"" is dark chocolate brown.  Does not match my hair at all and is nowhere near the color depicted on the bottle.  Very disappointing.",1.0
"I really was a fan at first of all of their products, but I felt like I was still losing hair and it was becoming thinner (I got the shampoo & conditioner as well)....it just now feels like it did an adverse effect, and that maybe they want that to happen so you use more of their other products - aka the hair building fibers and the thickening serum.  I just recently found High Potency Hair Loss Vitamins with Biotin - Clinically Proven to Support Hair Growth and Improve Skin and Nails - I used it a week and found a MUCH bigger difference..my hair is literally already growing back thicker like it used to, and I see WAY less shedding.  I don't know how to feel about TOPPIK now..I feel that the fibers and other products clog your pores and maybe stop hair growth so that you have to keep using it more?  Anyway, not a rep for the Nourish Beaute - just simply came across it from reviews...and I am astonished at the difference it has made. Will definitely stick with them...expensive, but worth it for a full head of hair!",1.0
Not happy with the result,1.0
"Simply does not work, difficult to dispense. Threw it away.",1.0
"I'm not sure how all these positive reviews can be real. It looks like you threw dirt on your scalp. Tinted dry shampoo works much better. I'm sorry, but I just can't believe any positive results after trying the product.",1.0
This stuff was a waste of $$$ it clumps on my edges. When you wipe it by putting gel in your hair it comes off on your hand. This is nothing like I thought it would be.,1.0
"it's too tiny, I thought it was going to be larger than what it was.",1.0
It is poor quality,1.0
allergic reaction be careful and how would you cover hair if you got none left to cover because of that product.,1.0
"Its NOT fibers as i really thought at first. I've never tried any hair product as such before. This product simply blackens your scalp and expect you to feel like hair. It DID NOT work for me. I highly doubt that this concept itself has any relation to hair like effect. This product is 'powder' like material and it goes on your scalp. It might be protein that helps hair health as toppik claims, but this product certainly will not help in anyway to hide bald spots.",1.0
This makes a mess.  And be carefull if u buy the applicator that you are getting the correct size Toppik...mine was mini so now I have an applicator I can't use because I won't be buying this again,1.0

It does cover sparse spots in your hair but it's like putting dust on your head. It doesn't cling as advertised. If you run your hand over your hair it looks like you have dust flying off your hair even when you use the spray that is sold with it.,1.0

I then tried to sprinkle lightly and not pat as directed by a friend. NOPE. I tried with product, without product, with hair spray, without hair spray. NOPE. Not the mention, the fibers went EVERY WHERE, created a huge mess, and if you touch it, it comes right off and since I got dark brown I just looked filthy where it touched. I had to use a damp cloth to wipe it off of my forehead. Ma",1.0

As I wrote in my review of the Toppik Spray Applicator - I might have ordered the wrong color. My hair is auburn and I ordered auburn. It's wayyyyyy too light. I've since ordered the Derm Match System which is much more expensive but they guarantee it for you to be completely satisfied for a year of purchase. My hair is thinning and I think there are better products for this than Toppik.,1.0
The ingredients in Toppik are toxic.  DMDM Hydantoin is a FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER. Why would I want that in my hair let alone my scalp? I won't be using this until there is an all natural product with no harmful ingredients. There is no need for so many harmful ingredients just put the keratin fibers and be done with it.,1.0

Each time I tried to use it, it appeared either to be empty or hardened up., I finally pulled the shaker off, and boy was I surprised. It was filled with colored fiber, about 4 inches deep,  This is pure fraud!!! I want the company to make good on what they promised, 1.7 oz. of powder, not fiber material.

"I got this for a male friend of mine who is thinning on top and  who also had past hair transplants done years ago, In that area he  has some small  hair  growing in. So I got him this  to help fill in those sparse areas remaining around the transplanted hair in the front hair line to help camouflage and fill in. I even put it on for him. because I could  obviously see the top of his head better than he could to try to sprinkle it on lightly and I'm a female and I'm used to messing with various hair products and cosmetics, so this should have been easier for me to do! I can't imagine someone trying to do this themselves....Well, this stuff went on in clumps even when trying to only use a small amount. His front hair line around the circular scars from the transplants this stuff just built up in those areas and made them even more noticeable. Like little dark brown circles..  so It was was thicker there than it was  on his ""regular"" scalp area around those  scars... that made it look terrible .!!  Well then I tried it on the crown of his head where he  has min to Moderate hair thinning, and  he doesn't  have any scars from transplants in that area... well that wasn't much better.
 Again it went on too thick and Looked so fake...To me what it is similar too is taking a course body powder and adding hair coloring to it and  then sprinkling it on your head. (actually I'm sure that concoction would be a lot cheaper, and  would have about the same affect) Basically,  It didn't look good at all.  It may cover if a person has very very little  hair thinning ..to just give the illusion of thicker hair by darkening the scalp area . But, I wouldn't even use it for that, because  the other down side, when he moved his head it just fell off like dandruff would  and came down over the front of his forehead almost to his eye brows.  When he tried to clean it off it just smeared..he had to totally shower to get it off his head and off his shoulders and forehead where it flaked off his head. He looked like he just came out of the coal mines.  geez..this stuff is horrible.
 I don't know if it's returnable or not. But, I only bought the small container first just in case he didn't like it. So it would probably cost more to send it back than it's worth..AVOID THIS PRODUCT...! Is my advice, I would not recommend at all.  It looks fake and I'm sure if a man would move around a lot it would flake off and also if he would sweat or get caught in the rain or go swimming. it would probably run down his face, how embarrassing would that be?? I bought this because it had some good reviews and I'm not sure why some people like it..!!  I think if someone wants to cover the white part of their scalp that is showing through their thinning hair,  it may be best to look for something that stains the skin temporarily..and only washes off with soap and water..I don't know if anyone makes such a product, But that may be a thought for a new product. Or maybe just use a self tanning product to darken the scalp.  May have to have him try that...lol

"If you are reading this, you're going to bald and going to buy this product no matter what I say. Just be sure to save the shipping package and get ready to return.

1)Why I don't like product: After applied it looks like you have just sprinkled dirt on your head. It doesn't stick to hair. I just colors your scalp.
2)How long I've used product: Once. That's all it took to figure out item #1. I don't believe the reviews that claim they've been using it for years.
3)Items that didn't meet my expectations: I realize now why in promo videos they have someone else applying the product. It's impossible to do yourself. How can you feel confident you've covered the bald spot behind your head evenly? Maybe if you have a friend sprinkle this on you every morning and confirm it's been applied correctly you would feel confident. What's worse? The embarrassment of a bald head, or somebody saying you have dirt all over your bald head?

"I ordered the .36 oz in Light Blonde.

I have diffuse thinning on the top of my head and wanted a way to tone down any shiny scalp areas near the side part. My hair is a light to medium neutral blonde shade. Based on some of the information I read, I believe I am exactly the ""target"" customer. Older with some thinning hair.

I watched videos and read instructions while waiting for the Toppik to arrive. I applied it as per the instructions, with the exception that I peeled back the paper seal far enough to open only three rows of shaker holes. I was planning on purchasing the specially designed Toppik applicator as soon as I tested the small bottle.

My first impression was that I could not see where the product clung to the hair shaft. In fact, all I could see in my bathroom mirror with incandescent lighting was a matte, dusty looking scalp that had a distinct greenish tinge. Yes, it looked somewhat greenish to me. Yellow green. Anyone who has experimented with hair color in the ash color range will understand what I was seeing.

The product, as described and shown in literature, appears to cling to hair shafts via static, and it looks somewhat like cross-hatching in their illustration. At least that is what it reminded me of when I saw it. But the powder itself is a fine, fine powder with a slightly gritty feel. It does not look like the elongated fibers in the illustration. However, if you do a Wikipedia search on Ammonium Chloride, one of Toppiks ingredients, it is shown as having the elongated appearance, though this would be microscopic in size. So if you have a microscope, I suppose you could see something that might be fiber-like.

I got a headache after using it and I think it was due to accidentally inhaling some of the fine powder as I tried to brush my hair. I needed to shower and wash my hair, face and neck just to make sure that I removed it all. I tend to have allergies, so I'm not saying everyone would have this reaction. That's just my reaction.

I will never use the product again. I purchased it from Amazon and I am going to request a refund. I normally don't ask for refunds, and in the 12 years that I've been purchasing from Amazon, I can only recall requesting a refund on a physical product one other time, and twice with eBooks. So I don't do this often, even if the product is not useful. Because this product has advertising that I find very misleading, I feel that I don't have a choice.

If you find the product works well for you, congratulations. But please don't tell me I am applying it incorrectly or that I will get better with practice. I will not apply this product to my scalp again.",1.0

"4 months ago, I purchased 2 bottles of TOPPIK hair fiber based on all the good reviews that I read from others. After using it for 2 months I noticed my hair loss getting worsen especially on the hairline area. I immediately suspected it had to do with TOPPIK. Then, I went online did an intensive search and found a few blogs that mentioned this produce can actually cause you loss more hair when using it for some people. I immediately stopped using it and my hair loss slowly back to normal pace not as intense as it was when i was using Toppik. Currently, I am on a laser treatment. It seems to maintain my existing hair. BUYER BE AWARE TOPPIK CAN CAUSE MORE HAIR LOSS FOR SOME PEOPLE WHEN USING IT.",1.0
"""I think where this started was a Bud Westmore Product used in Hollywood for years to give the impression of hair on face or head."" Well it may work for someone on camera for a few minutes but to actually use this stuff for hours upon hours throughout the day or night in public is a total joke! It looks like dirt or heavy dust on your head. And its hard to come off.. then you use the hair spray, its like in my case medium brown glue on your head! Its awfull and I don't understand how many millions including myself overpay for this crap! And this brand is supposed to be the best. My Salon Owner laughed at me for using this so-called quick fix to a small balding spot I have. She told me that is was a ""Scam"" so you did not hear that from me. You can tell a mile away that you use this stuff. And god forbid you use for your hairline and it will start running down your forehead with just the slightest bead os sweat.

"I've used Caboki for months now and I thought I would try this product to compare. Thankfully I only bought the small size.

First of all, Toppik smells somewhat like cat urine... not sure what is in it that would cause that.

Second of all, the blond color is waaaay too light for most shades of blond and looks ridiculous in my ashy blond hair. The lighter the color, the thinner the hair appears.

Third of all, it is a lot dustier and does not stick as well as Caboki.",1.0
"My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product!

Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair.

"First let me explain. My hair has been slowly thinning all around for the past 2 years. It's mainly been thinning in the front.
I've tried Rogain for 2 years and yeah i'm not sure if that's even helping.

Through research and seeing what other people use to cover up balding i found out about toppik. Now the commercial made it look like you sprinkle on REAL HAIR. I'm a skeptic so I was never expecting that so the fact that it didn't look like the commercial didn't disappoint me. Oh yeah I also had to pay $20 bucks for an f'n spray pump thing. Why didn't that just come with the toppik to begin with? It'd be like buying windex without the spray cap and having to spend $20 so you could spray it. Totally reasonable right?

Ok when i first got the Toppik in the mail i sprayed a little on my arm to test it. Of course it doesn't look like real hair but surprisingly it looks really good. It's basically just black makeup but it blends really well and that's all i was expecting. So i applied it to the two balding spots in front of my hairline. And it looked AMAZING!
I was so happy! It really made it look just like i had all my hair back.
You can't comprehend how relieved i felt. I was so happy I figured wow i could just use this till i get ridiculously bald.
It was a dream come true.

What I did was apply the toppik before I went to work and then wash it off before bed.
So great right?
Troubles are over?

No -_-
At about the third day in I washed it out and noticed something weird. My hair was thinner than EVER!
I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me and i REFUSED to believe it.
Could the toppik be making me lose my hair? NO WAY! I researched this thoroughly and everyone said the same thing
toppik does not make you lose more hair.

To put my theory to the test I stopped applying toppik to the left part of my hairline but continued to use it on the right part of my hairline. The balding on the right side got way worse and the balding on the left stood the same.
Yes it's true toppik actually made me lose more hair. I would have been better off stealing some of my sisters makeup.
This product is complete BS and I HATE everyone involved with marketing this scam. I've now lost even more hair and even more depressed about it.

"After my hair transplant the doctor explained me that my hair transplant wouldnt fall off.

Unfortunately, the last few containers I purchased turned out to be not only a total waste of money, but an embarrassment.  I started noticing bare spots in my scalp by the end of the workday.  It looked worse than if I did nothing at all.  The last time I tried it, I could see it actually falling out of my hair onto the tile floor in the work bathroom.  I could have written my name in the mess it made.  How embarrassing that would have been had I been in a meeting.  Not only that, I am noticed my scalp was getting itchy, and I could see the black fibers in my tissues when I blew my nose!

"When I first heard about this shampoo and conditioner 5 years ago, I bought it and gave up shopping for shampoo for 5 years. Kept using it because it was felt like a good shampoo. Used it exclusively for 5 years because it just became a habit. I thought that it was working and that my hair loss was normal. It was not.

I had no idea this shampoo sucked until I tried a new one on Amazon that had good reviews. I also started a DHT blocker and biotin pill I found on Amazon that had good reviews too. The combination of the two worked like a miracle. Hair loss completely stopped. All of this time I had thought that the hair loss I was experiencing was inevitable. All of this time I was tricked by Revivogen.

I now use pura d'or or whatever. Just search for it on Amazon. It has a ton of good reviews. I also use the zen wise pills.  I don't work for either of those companies and I don't have a ""verified purchase"" mark because I always bought the product through Revivogen's site for the 10% off. You can also check my other reviews to see that I'm a regular consumer. I'm just really glad that my widow's peak is filling up so I feel compelled to come here and share.",1.0
NO!,1.0
Bad product didn't do anything for me except for help lose more hair. At first it seems like it stopped the hair loss then shedding starts and never stops. I used it for 14 months with no results.,1.0
"Honestly, I don't think this product is working for me. I bought the shampoo and conditioner. I've used it for about a month. After I applied shampoo and then rinse, I would see a lot of hair on the sink. Its roughly about 30-40 of them (I'm not exaggerating). Compared to my old shampoo (head and shoulders), hair still falls out but not that many.
The good thing about this is it makes my head less itchy. And it does seem like my hair is getting slightly darker. Maybe some of my hair are thickening......or maybe this is a hair dye product.

I will continue to use this to see if I will lose less hair in the long-run. Once I'm done with the bottle, I'll purchase the scalp therapy and give that a try.",1.0
I used this product for almost two months- I have long hair.  The only thing it did was completely dry out my hair.  My stylist commented on how dry it was... bought it off of a website that is obviously subsidized by these products.  Try Rogaine instead.,1.0
Didn't finish the bottle. Shampoo made my hair feel stripped. Conditioner was like applying oil directly to my scalp. Would never recommend.,1.0
"I cannot deny the power the shampoo has to clean the head.  It literally strips your hair and scalp of all of its natural oils and leaves it dry and brittle. To make it better the conditioner, however light, does nothing to bring any strength or softness back. At the end of each shower my head felt clean, and refreshed. My hair deceptively looked thicker despite watching a ton of hair wash away each time I used this product.  At the end of every shower my head looked good, but give or take an hour and it started looking bad or worse as if it accelerated hair loss, I looked more bald than before my shower.

I just read that drying out and stripping all the oils makes your head appear thicker because dry, coarse hair looks thicker but at the cost of weakening your hair and making it more prone to falling out.  On top of that now you have a super dry scalp (now flakes can start to kick in), dry hair (weak, brittle, breakable), and you have a recipe for disaster.  There is a reason no hair stylist, magazine, or this reviewer will ever recommend this product to anyone.  If you really believe the hype on Saw Palmetto (one of the ingredients that suppose to inhibit DHT that causes hair loss), you are fooling yourself to think your head will absorb it.  Just buy some saw palmetto pills and take it daily. It is waay cheaper and at least your working from the inside out.

Do yourself a favor and look for another product.  Since I stopped using this product and went to cheaper products (Now using Creme of Nature with argon oil shampoo and Pantene Pro-V conditioner), my hair is softer, healthier looking throughout the day.  The reality is for us guys growing bald, we need products that contain sulfates-free ingredients (no Sodium Lauryl Sulfate SLS,  Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate ALS, etc...), as this is the main culprit that assist with speeding up the process of our hairs falling out because of its harshness as a cleaning agent.  Try Creme of Nature with argon oil shampoo, it is half the cost of this shampoo and in my opinion 10x better.  If you are looking for cheap shampoos or break your wallet cost shampoos just google sulfate-free shampoo list.",1.0
it made me lose so much hair and i would never go back to using it.. Hate it!! Im a male 20 and i wish i never tried this cause maybe i wouldn't have lost that much hair every time i used it,1.0
"I have used Clearogen (by the same company) in the past and loved it. It got rid of my acne.  So, when I seemed to be losing more hair than usual, I ordered Revivogen.  Within a few weeks after starting it my scalp was itching and burning with pimples.  I emailed them and described the problem, and was told to wash every other day with a tar shampoo, but to be sure to continue to use the Revivogen.  After a few more weeks it was worse and I emailed them again.  They again encouraged me to continue to use the product.  So after 3 months the pain and itchiness was unbearable and I stopped using it.  Six months later, I'm still dealing with it, having gone to a dermatologist and had a biopsy done.  It came back with ""a layer of crust over folliculitis"".  Apparently my scalp was so dry and compromised that follicular infection moved in. WARNING - If your scalp starts to dry out, STOP using the product, regardless of their advice - their goal is just to sell you more product!!  My hair is more sparse than ever, with a very visible wide part.  The product did not even slow down the loss while I was using it - if anything, it increased.  My scalp issues I'm sure have made the shedding worse on top of that.  I've spent a small fortune on everything from mild and natural shampoos to moisturizing shampoos, medicated shampoos, aloe shampoos, aloe gel, prescription lotions, etc. - trying anything that might help to heal it up.  One prescription lotion costs $180 a bottle.  I research this problem incessantly on the web trying to figure out how to just get it to heal up.  Not to mention practically losing my mind trying not to scratch - my scalp itches 24 hours a day.  I also must mention that I had never before had any sort of scalp itching, scalp pimples, or dandruff before using this product.",1.0

I told them they can see the brush is falling apart...they did not seem focused on that at all..they wanted a receipt...as if that would help the condition of the brush. These brushes are supposed to last 20-30 years and this one did not last a month and they are focused on the receipt?

It smelt horrible, like bug spray, and after shaking lots it made no difference. Ordered this on holiday so don't know if I can be bothered to go through the hassle of returning it right now.",1.0

Make sure you will really love this brush before ordering. I would tell people not to buy this brush. It makes your hair extremely static. I tried to return it after only using it twice and Parisa of London would only refund 50% which they never stated when I bought this product. Amazon would not help with this matter either. The brush was 109.00 and I was also expected to pay shipping. Even best but only charges a 20% restocking free not 50%. If you stand behind your product though and customer satisfaction I guess you would be willing to refund.,1.0

"I've been on a search for an acceptable mans hand lotion for several months. My hands dry out to the point of getting splits in my fingers that are very painful. When my favorite brand of lotion changed formulas I began the search.

What I was looking for:
* Fast absorption
* Fragrance free or negligible fragrance
* If fragrance, should not smell like a woman
* Should not leave me feeling like I'm dipped in grease or wax.
* If multiple applications daily are needed, there should not be residue buildup.
* Product should not cost more than $3.00 per ounce.

The Jack Black Industrial Strength Hand Healer fails all these requirements after a very fair exclusive usage test of two weeks in the early part of winter here in Montana.

* This product is very thick and paste like. It does NOT absorb quickly. Use too little and you won't be able to spread it around on your hands. Use too much and you will be left feeling greasy AND waxy - in fact, the lotion will actually flake off and leave whitish residue on clothing and other surfaces.
* The back label of this product specifically says ""...with no parabens, fragrance or colorants."" However, the Euclyptus in the lotion is EXTREAMELY noticeable. In fact, the label also states in part, ""Caution: Avoid eye area."" Could that be because Euclyptus in your eyes will burn like a jalapeno?

Euclyptus may not be a feminine smell, but it's also not very subtle.

I'm afraid the only thing positive I have to say about this product is a compliment to the marketing team. They did a fantastic job of dressing up a bad product into packaging with colors, design, and words that will appeal to men.

I say, MEN - STAY AWAY from this product. It is not a ""hand healer"" nor does it live up to the other claims on the packaging. Oh, and the price is insane.

I have moved on to test Gold Bond Ultimate Hydrating Cream, Men's Essentials Everyday.

"I have been a huge fan of the CND Stickey base coat for years. I was able to keep my polish on for at least a week without any chipping. Even with the cheapest of cheap brands of polish. When I ran out I shopped everywhere for a new bottle but couldn't find it. Not even at the larger cosmetic stores. When I found this, I was really excited! But then, unfortunately,I was greatly disappointed. I've used it several times and my polish always chips within 1-2 days. And sometimes the whole nail will peel off! I tried it with the higher end polish brands and it still chipped. Now, I am stuck with a large bottle of nothing and doing everything I can to get the very last drops out of my old bottles of Stickey.

Deeply saddened,

Mrs. Myer",1.0

The Yves Mattevelvet is a nightmare to take off. It leaves a blue stain on your nails and fingers when you take the polish off. I do love the other colors from my order though,1.0
"when I purchased this product, I thought it was the same as the 1.0 oz. size that is in fact a very sticky base coat.  This product was the consistency of water and was clearly NOT the same.  I could not quite determine what this was and the writing on the bottle was so miniscule and faint, I could not read it.  I contacted the seller and they never responded to my request to return/exchange.  On the website they show this product with the smaller size and I find it misleading as you believe you are getting a bigger version of what you are looking for.",1.0
I thought this would last longer based on reviews but it peels just as fast as a Cover Girl product or something similar. Not impressed.,1.0
Watch when buying color is actually grey,1.0
"I was anticipating the arrival of  this base coat. I was hoping and praying that this was the one, but sadly my polish started chipping the very next day. I did a test finger and filed and dehydrated my nail before applying the base coat but it made no difference. I am at my wits end but will still continue on my quest to find the right base coat! Even if it kills
me!!!!!!",1.0
"I have used this base coat before, so I know what to expect.  The product came very quickly so that was great.  I took the product out of the box and it seemed a little watery. I had a little of the same product left in my previous small bottle and combined it with this bottle and the difference in thickness was evident.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  I decided to try it and within 4 hours, I had 2 chips in my polish. Not sure what's going on with this seller, but its a shame.  I wouldn't recommend buying from this seller.",1.0
"This is one of the worst base coats I've ever used.

Normally I'm not very picky about base coats. When I was in cosmetology school, a friend/classmate of mine bought this and seemed to love it. I was leery (even in professional cosmetology stores, this stuff is still $12-$13) but I needed something for state board practice (which is done on a plastic hand). Afterwards I started using it on myself, and it is awful! Even after thoroughly cleaning your nails, it still peels terribly. My nail polish comes off in almost a solid piece!

I refused to use it on clients. Whether you're in school, in a salon, or just a lover of polish, I highly recommend China Glaze base coat. It stays tacky so that your polish actually sticks to it.",1.0
This is not a textured polish. It's a basic nude glitter polish. Absolutely nothing special about it and doesn't look like the pictures online.,1.0
"I purchased a small bottle a year ago and loved it, so I thought this larger bottle would really fit the bill. What a disappointment!  I've used it twice and both times the polish comes off of my nail almost in its entirety.  This bottle seems to be a watered down version of the small one, it is so thin in texture ... almost like brushing water over your nails.",1.0
"Very unhappy, product was watery and seemed to have been altered. I have all of the other pixies in this line and they are typical Zoya perfection.

This, however, is one of the worst top coats that I have ever used. Its tricky to apply because its so thick and stringy and it tugs on your nail color.  The thing I hate the most is the bubbling.  This thing bubbles like crazy!  It doesn't matter if its a cold day or a hot day this thing bubbles and takes a forever to dry. I have used this with as the 4 step system: the base coat; anchor, nail lacquer, this top coat; Armor and finally topping it off with drying drops.  It still bubbles and ruins your manicure.  4-5 hours later this is not fully cured and still feels a bit mushy.

The worst top coat I've ever used!  My nails were chipping the next day - something that never happens.  I used it with Zoya base coat and Zoya polish.  Tried it again with my second manicure and same results.,1.0
"Every nail polish I own is by Zoya and I love their products. I've legitimately spent so much money on their brand and, overwhelmingly, their products have been great -- but this is really the worst top coat imaginable. It takes longer to dry than the nail polish underneath it. Hours later, it still gets deep dents. I'm surprised someone said that this will level out streaky polishes underneath it, because for me, it definitely doesn't. The time before this I used it, it also left tiny bubbles on the surface of the nail, between the coloured polish and the top of the base coat. It goes on looking deceptively fine and then just creates nail disasters. For me, it didn't cause polish to shrink away from the tip (which is great) and initially provided a fair amount of sheen, but  I'm looking down at the nails I did yesterday and they're absolutely covered in dents. I used the top coat to help prevent the colour getting nail marks and whatnot while I slept. It honestly looks 100 times worse with the top coat than it does when you just apply nail polish, wait a while, and then go to bed. This top coat's truly terrible. I've been looking for a cruelty free top coat and less hazardous alternative to products with toulene and things like that. This one is just a massive fail, though. I love you, Zoya, but I don't know what you were thinking with this one!",1.0

"Highly allergic, I purchased this product online after reading that it lacks all the allergy-inducing chemicals found in most other polishes.  I thought it was pricey, but worth trying.

The product arrived quickly and was well-packed, so thank-you to the online seller.

Not sure if the problem is with the color of this product or its consistency, but it is so streaky when applied that I needed 4 super-careful coats to minimize the effect.  Then using 4 coats ruined the transparency, which is what makes this color beautiful.  Even with base coat, 4 coats of color and top coat, it had an ugly matte finish with all the ridges and imperfections showing.  It did not provide a smooth, glossy finish as expected.

Reading the positive reviews, it makes me wonder how many of them are paid product reviews.  It's that bad.

Thumbs down, Zoya!

Fast forward to this past weekend, I tried using the same polish and this time it was EXTREMELY chunky.  It didn't go on well at all and looked horrible.  I shook it like crazy and tried it on another finger, and it's still awful.

so, I e-mailed Zoya through their ""contact us"" link on the webpage and waited patiently for a response.  Today, they tell me to get rejuvenating drops and try using that, that I obviously didn't put the cover on tight enough (cause clearly I have no idea how to close a nail polish bottle?).  After expressing my disappointment in their awful customer service (and hence giving them yet another chance to make it right with me), the woman forwarded my e-mail to her supervisor who then told me that I'm basically out of luck cause I didn't report a 'flaw' in the first ten days.

"I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!",1.0
"I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!",1.0
"I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.",1.0

"My primary polish is OPI, but I thought I would try something new without chemicals.  This polish is thick, clumpy and does not last or shine like OPI!",1.0
The color is super grey the sparkles look dull and u can barely see them. I would not reccomend this product.,1.0
"I purchased a nail polish from Zoya's website several months ago.  I tested it on just one finger (my thumb nail), it was a tiny bit clumpy, I just figured it needed to be shaken more next time before using it.  I sealed up the bottle and put it with the rest of the polish I have.

Fast forward to this past weekend, I tried using the same polish and this time it was EXTREMELY chunky.  It didn't go on well at all and looked horrible.  I shook it like crazy and tried it on another finger, and it's still awful.

so, I e-mailed Zoya through their ""contact us"" link on the webpage and waited patiently for a response.  Today, they tell me to get rejuvenating drops and try using that, that I obviously didn't put the cover on tight enough (cause clearly I have no idea how to close a nail polish bottle?).  After expressing my disappointment in their awful customer service (and hence giving them yet another chance to make it right with me), the woman forwarded my e-mail to her supervisor who then told me that I'm basically out of luck cause I didn't report a 'flaw' in the first ten days.

Skip this product all together, it's not as great as it's price tag says it should be, I'd rather have formaldehyde on my nails and deal with a company that stands behind their products 100%.",1.0
"This polish, in color Pippa, is the worst I have encountered by Zoya.  It is thick and bubbly.  It won't spread out and looks like Swiss Cheese as it dries.  I have not been able to use it once since I ordered it.  I like the seller just fine, but they do not except returns.  Still, this is something I would have never paid for had I known.  I was really looking forward to wearing beautiful bright yellow polish.  I guess I'll just have to wait a while, as I can't get this kind of polish where I live (I'd try the Butter color next) (on an island) and shipping for one nail polish is ridiculous.",1.0

"I've been using this product for two weeks now and well my hair just feels gross and greasy.  I tried everything, increasing/decreasing the number of pumps I put on my hair.  I think this product is probably a miracle for people with frizzy/curly/thick hair.  My hair is fine and was actually doing great with Pert Plus, I was curious and decided to use Wen.  I have to say I'm extremely disappointed.  I think I have the wrong type of hair for this product.  Thanks Chaz Dean, but I will be sticking to my Pert Plus.",1.0
Don't waste your money on this product. There is a lot of hype about it because it is sold on QVC but I have found many different brands that work better than Chaz Dean products and are much less expensive.,1.0

I also went to two-three different hairstylist for help in getting my hair back to healthy.  It was impossible. Every hairdresser I went to said my hair didn't feel like hair, and wanted to know what I was putting in it.  I was forced to cut it off to approximately one inch, and started all over again.

DO NOT BUY!! THIS IS NOT REAL WEN!! ITS A GROSS IMPOSTER! FEELS THICK AND GREASY LIKE PETROLEUM JELLY AND DEFINITELY HAS ALCOHOL IN IT AND SMELLS LIKE SOME KIND OF CAR AIR FRESHENER! I recommend ONLY buying directly from Wen. Very disappointed.,1.0

"I was hoping to save some money and buy off Amazon. I have purchases the styling creme from both the infomercial and from QVC in the past. This is totally an impostor! It smells like some generic lotion. I think they bought Wen, saved the bottle or used the product up, bought some cheap product and filled empty Wen bottle up, and sold on Amazon. It didn't even come in a box or anything. The pump didn't work. And, the bottle wasn't even 3/4 full. So I used it thinking, and hoping,  maybe I was just imagining things. It DEFINITELY was not Wen. I am so upset. What a waste of money. Amazon should be ashamed and JCG i am reporting you to Amazon ASAP.",1.0

It didn't go over very well for me, first for some reason it left my hair waxy and gross, and made it a challenge to try and run a comb through it. Secondly,i must have been allergic to an ingredient in the product because it severely irritated my scalp and gave me really bad dandruff.",1.0
"Buyer beware1  The one star is because of the vendor rather than the product which is excellent. RIP OFF!  I believed that I was receiving 16 oz of the product rather than 6 oz that I received. I actually paid the price other vendors, including Chaz Dean, offered for 16 ounces.  I certainly won't use this vendor again through Amazon or anywhere else.",1.0
"This is such an interesting product because it worked ok for me but ONLY the first two times.  From the third time on, it felt like I had build up in my hair and made my hair dull looking instead of shiny.  This build up made my hair feel stiffer than normal (not sure if this was because the product dried it out or if it actually stripped my hair of natural moisture, I could not tell the more and more I used it.  I still have some left over, and I use it to shave my legs. I have to say, it works great for THAT!

Maybe it depends on the type of hair you have to start with.  Mine is naturally curly and is color-treated at a salon once a month to cover grays.  The infomercials say this is for ALL HAIR TYPES, so I don't think that is really a true statement. I could see it working  better for people with fine hair that is not damaged in any way.  Another con - for the amount of product you get and the amount of PUMPS you have to use, this stuff is expensive!",1.0
This product made my hair oily and greasy; I would not recommend it to others.,1.0
"Before i brought this Wen hair product i did some research and read some reviews since lots of people said it's a good product, so i brought it.

Then I realized that instead of going 5 or 6 weeks between coloring my hair, my color was fading in 1 or 2 weeks...

"Very disappointed in this product, I guess to tell the difference between the fake and real bottle is by the color of the bottle, matte green is the real stuff, and the glossy bottle is the Amazon/knockoff. This stuff doesn't work well at all, the real stuff which I had bought from a salon years ago, works very well. It is pricy, and does work when you buy the real one, but this fake stuff was awful and I feel ripped off since I could have easily gotten another shampoo (with conditioner) for much less money than this stuff.

"It should be around only 30% boar and it stucks and creates statics. Much worse than my cheap old 60% boar but I could not find it in stores anymore.

"I decided to invest in this brush because of the many positive compliments.  My ranking for styling is ""fine"".  It certainly wasn't the 'end all; be all"" that many claimed int he reviews; it was ""fine"".  The real issue is that within 3 weeks the cork handle snapped.  What you should understand is that I have fine, thin hair so I wasn't putting crazy pressure or it or anything.  It's clearly just a poorly made $50 hairbrush.  I suppose the good news is that it happened within 30 days so I got a full refund.  I recommend buying a different product.  I was hopeful but it doesn't live up to the hype.",1.0
I purchased this brush after reading all the five star reviews.  After two attempts at using this brush I am sending it back.  I simply can't get it to smoothly brush through my thick wavy hair at all.(t literally got stuck!  Makes styling my hair even more difficult than it needs to be.

"This is my first review ever on amazon and I felt like writing it just because this product is probably the worst product I've purchased in my life. I'm a regular user of Loreal Techni Art and I love it! One time when I was out of my regular gel/wax and I thought I should give a new brand a try. So I picked up this piece of **** at a supercuts store. I'll summarize the reasons I hated this product so much:
1) Super greasy.. Not only it won't go out the next day you wash your hair, but you also have to spend 5 minutes washing your hands after you use it. Ain't nobody got time for that (esp when you are running late to the office in the morning).
2) Makes your hair look like you have dandruff. Like a severe case. A couple friends actually went as far as saying ""Looks like you haven't washed your hair in a month.""
3) Expensive. You can get a lot of very good options for this price. I would not have cursed it so much if it was like $3.

2 Cents: Don't buy it ever.",1.0
"I don't know what it's made of, but it seriously does not wash off of anything.

I had to throw my comb away because it wouldn't wash off of it. I washed the comb several times with soap, and I even let it soak in very hot soapy water. No matter what I did, it just wouldn't come off the comb. It created a permanent waxy residue.

It is also nearly impossible to wash this stuff out of your hair in one wash. It took more than several washings to get most of it out of my hair to the point where my hair didn't feel stiff and sticky.

And forget about getting your hands clean after you've styled your hair. Be prepared to have at least some residue stuck to your hands throughout the day.

Save your money. I promise you will use this product one time and then throw it away.",1.0
"Yucky
Not even close to Davines Windet Wax",1.0
"This stuff is awesome until you want it OUT OF YOUR HAIR. I cannot give 5 stars to an excellent product that won't stop working, like a chainsaw that won't ever shut off.

It REALLY holds your hair up in a great way, but so does American Crew Fiber, an equal product that washes out with no problem.

I love the Paul Mitchell haircare line, but OMG, this stuff never washes out and I'm not using Palmolive every night on my hair!",1.0
"I work in fashion so I've used dozens of hair products over the years. Without a doubt, this is the worst product I've ever used. In your hair, it starts off nice- not too shiny and it doesn't look like you have a lot of product. At first. About an hour or so into your day y'all notice that your hair looks like you sprayed it with vegetable oil. If it's warm out, it may also look like the oil has slid down onto your face.

Shortly after that you'll notice that your hair has started to collect dirt and dust. Later that night when you try to wash it out-well, let's just say ""good luck."" Shampoo rinse repeat, shampoo rinse repeat, shampoo rinse repeat...you'll still have product in your hair. Kind of many others have mentioned, even after shampooing three or four times your towel will be covered with product and it won't come off your hands for hours.

Finally, if you have sensitive skin at all, avoid this like the plague. The first ingredient is wax; the next ingredient is mineral oil. Oil picks up dirt and bacteria, slides right into your pores, only to get covered by a layer of wax, where the bacteria can have a party. The result? Breakouts galore.

"The authentic product is 5 star, but the product I bought from amazon market place seller was not. First problem, the printing started washing off the bottle when it got wet in the shower. Never had that happen before. The product I received was much thinner in consistency, had a different aroma and did not lather up the way it's supposed to. I recently purchased a new bottle of the same product from a salon and the difference is night and day. Be careful buying this from a reseller on amazon - Paul Mitchell is very selective about who their retailers are. A very low price is usually an indicator of either counterfeit or stolen merchandise.",1.0
"I thought that since it is Paul Mitchell, it would be good. However, it isn't. The freeze doesn't last long and there's really no shine. My Chi Shine Infusion gives more shine!",1.0
"I have been buying this product for many years. Either they have changed the formula or this is not the real deal.
It smells much more of coconut and the consistency is different, plus it leaves my hair flat and dull.

"My hairstylist uses this on my hair and it does a great job, I am convinced this is not the real deal. It is watered down, not the same fragrance, sprayer is awful and almost streams out and flattens my hair immediately like I dumped water on it. My stylist told me to only buy from Ulta or somewhere legit and that is what I will do next time, total waste of money!",1.0
"I have been usin this product for the past 9 years plus. Normally buying it from my hairdresser, I was drawn to this one by the price.
Right after opening the bottle, I have noticed that the smell and the color of the product is not anywhere near what I usually get.

 I have decided to use it anyways only to find out that the cosistency of the product is different as well and last but not least it does not do anything for your hair ither than makes it look sticky wet for the first hour or so, and then it simply vanishes from your hair all together makin it look fuzzy...... it exactly freeze ans shine there.

Dont get me wrong I got nothin bad to say about felteeze and shine, just NOT THIS ONE.

Weather it's a counterfi product or something extremely old (6 plus years) I do not know, all I know that this is not the same as the freeze and shine from my hair dresser that I have been using for years and years now.

I guess there is a reason why the pruduct is only guaranteed by the manufacturer if purchased from the hair salon...",1.0
My husband ordered. Not the original Freeze and Shine formula. Used to be the best product on earth. Used it for years. It would hold my super fine long hair in place in the worst wind or humidity. Dried instantly and held until you combed it out. Now it's like spraying water on your hair. Not this seller's fault. Paul Mitchell changed it- probably to make more profit. ,1.0

"Absolutely not the real deal! Very little hold. I have been using paul Mitchell 20 years, this isn't true paul Mitchell.",1.0
"This product has definitely had a formula change.  I have short, thick and somewhat course hair and have used this product for many years.  Previously I could spray this in my hair and easily use my fingers to manipulate and place my hair where I wanted it to lay and it would stay there all day.  Now the formula is way too wet and doesn't hold at all.  My hair is heavy and needs something really strong to hold it up all day!  I like a ""little"" height in the top of my of my head to help elongate my face.  I could easily accomplish this with the older formula - not any more.  Stopped on my way home and bought a new product.  Hopefully it will have a strong, firm hold.  We'll see. No more Freeze and Shine for me.  Sad day!",1.0
"I've used this product for 15+ years and I love it; however, I will not purchase it again from this vendor. The bottle I received was already opened and the spray nozzle doesn't work. The hairspray feels watered down and it doesn't smell like true Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray. It also doesn't feel the same in my hair...it leaves a crunchy texture to my hair.",1.0
"I read all the reviews online and here on Amazon, and thought this would be a better alternative than DFI wax. I bought a tube and tried it, but the reviews were very misleading. I tried to sculpt my hair and the wax, no matter how many times I would apply, would NOT STICK AND HOLD, and the hair keeps falling back to its original position. It's absolutely frustrating, knowing that you are very LIMITED on how you can style your hair. Also, customers should be aware that when 'sculpting' with this wax, they should be very careful, because while I was doing so, I lost TONS of hair and had caused irritation on my scalp. Also, to add to my experience, a friend of mine is a hair stylist himself and had worked with hundreds of different kinds of wax; his reception of the wax? very negative and said he doesn't touch the stuff because his customers complained that it failed to hold. Would I recommend the product? No. But would I recommend it to make the hair look wet and shiny? Yes.",1.0
Just ordered this to replace another bottle I got elsewher that I knew wasn't Freeze and Shine spray.  This was not either.  Not close to the right scent and did not provide hold to my hair at all.  Seemed more like the scuplting spray.  Had to dump down the drain.  Is Paul Mitchell changing their formula?,1.0
very grease feel that does not go away until you wash it out. Last time I but it.,1.0
"Horrible. Only after using the product for two weeks did the bottle dispense a homogenous product, rather than a multi-textured goop. Now I get a translucent gel with a wood-glue consistency that, once applied, leaves my hair with a greasy sheen, particularly when applied to dry hair, as the instructions dictate. That this wax is not for applying to wet hair is the third strike. Definitely switching back to a pomade.",1.0
"Older bottle of the product.  Older label.  Product itself was old and watery.  Should've returned it but such a hassle.  They should provide the product as advertised, not an older tube of it.",1.0
"I have been a faithful user of Lanza Urban Elements Finishing Freeze and Lanza Art Elements Total Recall for more years than I can remember.  I started using it back in my 20's and it was by far the best hair spray I have ever used.  So now, I've used up the last of my stash and since it's been discontinued, I'm on the hunt for a hair spray that is comparable.  Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray is definitely NOT it.  My hair is fine in texture yet curly and this Paul Mitchell product has a flimsy hold and makes my hair look dull.  It's as if I've not even used any hair spray at all.  I will just keep looking.",1.0
I agree with the other reviewer that said this was a fake. I too have been using Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine for over 10 yrs...this is definitely NOT.,1.0
I've used Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine for over 20 years. I purchased this large bottle on Amazon to save money. It turne dout to be a big mistake. The liquid in the bottle that was sent to me is not Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine. It is a bootleg product that smells aweful. PM Freezeabd Shine has a pleasant odor to it. I won't be purchasing from this site again.,1.0
"I feel I was ripped off!  I have been using Paul Mitchell Freeze & Shine Super Spray for years and this is the first time I have had a bottle smell like this order did-----it stinks.  The scent is nothing like what I have used before.  Also, the hold is not as strong and it doesn't leave your hair shiny.  I need rock solid evidence this is the real stuff before I will believe another product wasn't poured into a Paul Mitchell bottle.  I will definitely NOT order from this company again!!",1.0
What did they do to this hair spray?? It used to THE best hairspray out there - it had fantastic hold - you could comb your hair after the spray dried and it still had body and hold. NOW - it is so full of alcohol it dries my hair to where it looks and feel like shredded wheat. The fragrance has changed also. I have no idea how I can find anything that is close to the original. WHY do companies do this? Why mess with a hugely popular product?,1.0
Diluted - This is a product that I have been purchasing for at least 10 years and am very familiar with.  I did notice there was one person that mentioned it may be diluted and she was CORRECT!  There is no way this product is full strength Paul Mitchell.  I decided to try to find a supplier online since I do much of my shopping this way and have purchased often from Amazon.  This is the first seller I have encountered that sold something that was not as described and up to this point the seller hasn't even responded to my complaint.,1.0
"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this product was not a strong hold spray.  It does nothing for me at all.  It does not hold as well as my medium hold spray. I don't know how it can be called a Freeze Super Spray, for it is definitely not.  It was a complete waste of money and I would not recommend it to a friend or buy it again. I have short, fine hair that I curl with a curling iron and this was worthless to hold it after just a few minutes and I sprayed it from a distance so just a fine mist fell over my hair as per my hairdresser's instructions so it would not flatten my hair. There don't seem to be any good products out there for my purposes these days so I guess I'll just save my money. The only positive thing about this product is that it did not have a strong, offensive odor and could be used by someone with fragrance sensitivity, which I have, if it worked.  I also didn't notice that it imparted any shine.",1.0
"I have long, fine, straight hair that is not particularly dry or damaged. It does, however, seem to get a bit snarled at the ends sometimes after shampooing and wrapping it up in a towel.  I was hoping for a light-to-medium conditioner that made it easy to comb through my hair. Unfortunately, this so-called detangler didn't seem to make any difference at all.  In fact, regular conditioners like Aussie Moist or Neutrogena left my hair easier to comb out than this stuff.  I also didn't care much for the scent of it, which reminded me a bit of the old Flex conditioners from the 80s.  I ended up not even using all of this product up, so I feel like it was a waste of money.  I've liked other Paul Mitchell products in the past, but this was the worst I've ever tried.",1.0
I first tried the Paul Mitchell Detangler at a Marriot Inn and loved how it made my hair feel really soft and smooth (my hair is very thick and very dry). However the Amazon Detangler is obviously a FAKE. it doesn't smell nice and leaves my hair just as dry as before. Really disappointed in Amazon for selling a fake product. BUY FROM A SALON.,1.0
"I need my money back one way or another . this item is fake. Don't know if you all know that or just didn't care but I'll get my money back somehow. The item is lotion.. straight up smells like it too. Even melts in your hands like lotion does. Someone who works at ulta and sells this product said one kinda does smell like lotion a little..but I've talked to one of the representatives of paul mitchell on facebook (I'm goinf to add a photo when they reply back to me as well) and Also on the bottle it clearly says which I wish I had read before wasting my money 'guaranteed ONLY when purchased within the professional beauty salon industry, NOT from a drugstore, supermarket OR other unauthorized source'. So please reply back to me. Also selling fake products is illegal in itself. So once I get more pictures ill upload them from the brand themself. Please, do NOT buy this product",1.0
"This must be fake, it smells awful and doesn't work well at all, weird glue-like consistency. My hair is still tangled unless I use tons of it.",1.0
I do not believe this product was actually a legitimate Paul Mitchell Detangler. This is the second time I received a bottle of Detangler that looked and smelled 'off'...actually smelled rancid. I noticed that several other people have found the same unpleasant odor issue. The detangler color is different and the bottle is different as well. I asked for a refund and got one.,1.0
"Wanted to give this product a try as I have fine hair that gets really tangled.  I already use ""The Conditioner"" and this product is NOTHING like it.  First, the scent is blah... and nothing like the conditioner.  It reminded me of a really old bottle of conditioner that's lost its scent and gotten really viscous and thick.  It weighed my hair down so much... felt like I had mayo on it.  After the first use... I couldn't stand the texture of my hair, like I had pomade product in it!  I ended up washing my hair immediately afterwards, requiring 2 shampoos just to get it out.  Handed it over to a friend who has THICK, COURSE hair... maybe this would tame it.  Just not for me.",1.0
"This product caused my 10 year old to suffer from terrible hives. He is allergic to it, I guess and will not be using it. We wish to return, but cannot as too expensive to return",1.0
Don't waste your money! My hair was just as tangled if not worse after using this product. Not sure it's really Paul Mitchell.,1.0
Fake. Super dissapointed and can't return,1.0
"This is the absolute last straw for me when it comes to ordering hair care products on Amazon. 5 times out of 10, the products are counterfeit or fake products sold in what appear to be manufacturer's bottles. I knew immediately this was fake conditioner as when I opened the bottle, it smelled like cheap bathroom soap, not like the actual fragrance of REAL Paul Mitchell products. It was also oily and bright yellow, which is a dead giveaway that this isn't the real thing.

I don't know who I'm more annoyed with--myself, for hoping this would be real Paul Mitchell conditioner, or Amazon, for likely being privy to the fact that there are so many counterfeit products from sellers on their website and doing what seems like nothing to combat it. Bad experience.",1.0
I have to wonder if the bottle I got was a knock off. It smelled different that bottles I've bought in the store before and wasn't nearly as thick and creamy.,1.0
Smells terrible!!!! Returning product.,1.0
I've been using this for over a decade does not seem to be Paul Mitchell's detangler. Smells like vasoline intensive care lotion.,1.0
"I was not happy with this product. It does have the familiar yellow color, but that's where the similarities end. I should have know that $10 off the salon price was too good to be true. I used The Detangler recently while at a Marriott... they have the travel sizes. Just a small amount of the travel bottle worked wonders on my hair. My tangles were gone and when I combed my hair out, hardly any hair came out (i have long thick hair and always shed). My hair felt soft and lustrous. Because of this, I decided to buy a big bottle. I should have gone to a salon This is either watered down or just a totally different product. It doesn't even smell good like the real Detangler does. When I complained to the seller, they immediately gave me a refund instead of offering to send me a different bottle and/or trying to stand by their product.",1.0
Its FAKE! Runny and takes 2x as much to coat hair.  If you want watered down conditioner buy this all day long.,1.0
"The product description: ""Paul Mitchell The Conditioner. Leave-in hair moisturizer and conditioner"". The reason I bought it because it says ""Leave-in"" conditioner. Once I received the bottle, the instruction on the bottle is: ""Apply a small amount. Massage. Rinse"". This is misleading.",1.0
This is NOT a Paul Mitchell product - do not buy. This is basically lotion in a bottle. Smells weird too.,1.0
"Not the Original ""The Detangler"". Beware, this Is A Knockoff!!  Horrible/ No results with this product!",1.0
Totally over-rated and over-priced.,1.0
Watery and doesn't deranged any better than regular conditioner.  Smells odd.,1.0
"This isn't a genuine Paul Mitchell product.  It's really chunky and thick, when it should feel more fluid when pouring out of the bottle.  The bottle I received was in its own bag with a different SKU, and the original barcode was covered up in the style of most other black market, counterfeit beauty products.",1.0
Smells terrible .  Not the correct color and bottle seems different.  Does not even work the same. Not sure it is even the real deal. Will stick to buying from a salon.  Lesson learned!,1.0
"The consistency is fairly watery compared to most conditioners I've ever used.  Did not detangle my hair and left it feeling sticky.

Did NOT detangle my hair.,1.0
"The Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner through Amazon burned my eyes and my scalp, smelled like chemicals, and made my hair feel like straw.  I ended up discarding the product.  If I were to try Paul Mitchell again, I would purchase from an authorized Paul Mitchell seller.  I would give this product zero (0) stars if I could.  I absolutely do not recommend this.",1.0
"Content was disgustingly stinky. This was either too old or it is fake stuff in Paul Mitchell bottle. I have used this same product bought from grocery store as well as from hair Salons, so I know what it is supposed to smell like.",1.0
"this was horrible smelling and not only did it not detangle my hair but it didn't even help soften my hair. When I used this product from the salon it was blue and smelled nice, I believe this is a fake unless Paul Mitchell totally changed it. I returned this.",1.0
"It did nothing for my hair.  In the past few months I noticed that my hair was started to get really tangled, and I was getting really bad knots in the back of my hair. It was time to invest in a really good conditioner to prevent the breakage I've been getting from tangles. I found this detangler by Paul Mitchell and it has really great reviews, so I thought this was going to be a smart purchase. The conditioner is quite watery, bland-smelling, and just seems to disappear when I put it on my hair. I generally like a thick conditioner that coats the hair while you leave it in for a few minutes, but this seems to dissolve on my wet hair. After I rinse my hair, it's just as tangled and knotty as ever. Plus, at the end of the day, I'm still getting those dread-like knots toward the nape of my neck. I'll admit that my hair is a bit wavy, but it's not super thick, and it's not really processed anymore, but this conditioner really did nothing for my hair. It's a shame that my search for a good detangling conditioner will have to continue.",1.0
"Even though this is listed as ""the det angler"" I still purchased because the description has it listed as ""the conditioner"" and boy was I dissappointed!!!! The detangler is a rinse out conditioner and I didn't need that. It was quite confusing when ordering since the description lead me to believe I was buying ""the conditioner"" which is blue and a leave in conditioner. I will be returning this product and will now be very skeptical about buying hair products from Amazon..... VERY DISSAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!",1.0
"Unfortunately I was not satisifed with this product.  Based on some of the other reviews I am starting to wonder if I received the product advertised.  The detangler is a pale yellow, smells pretty bad and I can barely get it out of the bottle.  Not sure what to think.  The main point is that it has not helped with the issue of my hair being so tangled after washing!  I have even tried combing in the shower while the conditioner is still in.  My hair is still a big tangled mess.",1.0
It is a fake! I am so pissed. The first time I bought the detangler was genuine. It was the yellow color people talked about and my daughter's long hair was smooth after applying it. But the second order they sent me a fake! The color was white and it doesn't work at all. My daughter's hair would still be like hay after applying it. Can't believe Amazon allows such practice! Now I have switched to Nexxus condition from Costco and it works 100 times better!,1.0

"I stayed at a great hotel and they had tiny bottles of this conditioner.  It made my hair feel AMAZING!! I had to have it! So I immediately went on Amazon, without even reading any of the bad reviews (which I have done now that I bought it) .. it is absolutely not the same conditioner that I had been using.  First off, the bottle I ordered is slightly different than the bottle in the picture.  Second, when I use it, it is way runnier than the hotel version if it.  Same color and everything, but something is just not right.  It makes my hair so gross to touch when it's dry- like it is covered in a layer of wax.  I can hardly pull my fingers through it without ripping tons of hair out.  I wouldn't recommend buying this! I wish I would've read the other bad bad bad reviews first! It is hands down the worst conditioner I've ever used. :-(",1.0

"To those of you looking for a good deal: DO NOT BE FOOLED
The picture here says Paul Mitchell - The Detangler - Original
I assure you that it is NOT.  Upon receiving my bottle I discovered that the label did NOT match the picture.
The picture clearly says ""Original"" on it and the bottle I received had yellow writing with the word ""Condition"".
The smell is more like old lotion than conditioner which matches the texture on wet hair.
The texture once the hair drys feels like a thin layer of wax which is weird because under that layer the hair feels dry and crispy.
I will have to seriously scrub my hair to get the layer off so that I can properly condition it with something else.
The one thing I can say is that Amazon was really great about providing me with a refund since the product I received is clearly not what is advertised here.",1.0

First of all, it does not detangle my hair at all.  My hair actually feels WORSE after using this conditioner.  I've used it twice so far, and both times my hair has come out frizzy, limp, and damaged looking.  When I use other conditioners, my hair turns out really smooth and full of body.

There are several buying options - I purchased the item fulfilled by Amazon - purchase from a different seller!

It smells horrible and it is a different color. The Detangler should be a yellow color.  The one sent from Amazon is white.  The bottle I received even looks different.  It does not look like the bottle pictured on the Amazon page nor does it look like a bottle found at a salon.  Yesterday I went out and bought another bottle from a salon and it is the same wonderful Detangler I have come to know and love. I wouldn't buy it from Amazon again.  If you shop around at the mall, you can find it even cheaper.  I went to three places and found it for $13 (all others were at $21)",1.0

I actually bought mine at a hair salon (so I know it's ""real"") but was so taken aback by how horribly they left my hair I decided to give feedback here.

My hair came out in clumps towards the end which was definitely ""unnatural"" EVEN for natural ""hairloss"".So now I use Dove Shampoos, conditioners and soaps. And Pantene color Expressions is good too. I take multivitamins and Biotin which is good for the hair by mouth daily.",1.0

"Razor burn all day after using this.  Thought it might be razor, but it wasnt.  Had to buy after shave lotion and throw it on my face for first time ever.  Felt instant relief.  Threw this stuff out and went to Aveeno.  No more razor burn, no more after shave lotion needed.",1.0
Will not purchase again.  Doesn't really rate 1 star. Awful scent. Like the original Listerine.,1.0

"First off this doesn't give you a close shave and the reason why is because it's not smooth.
It gives you a nice lather at the beginning and it actually feels fresh when I apply it on my face but it gets dry too fast.  For instance, when I finish shaving one side of my face and go to the other I have to re-apply more because it got dry and the blade won't slide through.
Moreover, after shaving I feel an irritation sensation that lasts the whole day.  I think it's the menthol doing that.
Bottom line. I don't recommend it. Especially if you use a safety razor, slickerness is a must for that and this shaving cream is all the opposite of slicker.
 Spend some more and get a nice shaving soap like the ones that come in a bowl.",1.0
A poor product and a worse shave. I used it twice and threw it away. Bob,1.0

"I'm perplexed by the gushing reviews here.  Although the packaging is very cool and exotic (and it being Italian is a plus to me), it provides virtually no more lubrication than water alone.  I've tried both small and large quantities of it on my face.  Compared with less expensive shaving cream (both tubes bought on Amazon and commodity cans), I find this one the worst.  Am I missing something?",1.0
Hello! I recently purchased and received your screen protector about a week ago and am sorry to inform that the screen protector has cracked somehow and is falling apart on my phone is there any way we can resolve this? Lg v10,1.0
"I cannot recommend this product, even if it lent itself to the closest most comfortable shave I've ever had (which it does not). The smell alone is enough to keep me from reordering this. This product has both eucalyptus and menthol yet smells like neither. I am seriously considering throwing the remainder of the product away and ordering something else. I will not reorder this because of both the smell and the quality of the shave. I have nicked myself more since I received and started using this shaving cream than any other time in the past year. It feels like I have just started wet shaving all over again. I have tried another of their products and was satisfied with it. I guess I will go back to that.",1.0
"I like this product a lot but the last 2 or 3 times I've bought it, about halfway through the cap will break and it becomes impossible to seal the tube.  Therefore the part exposed to air becomes hard and unusable and I end up wasting a lot.  Not sure why the quality of the packaging has gone downhill but I wish they would address it as I would like to continue using it.",1.0
Received used cream. The tube came twisted and unsealed. Very disappointed.,1.0
"The worst shaving cream ever created and a waste of $9. Does not foam or lather, and feels like shaving with slimy, minty toothpaste. The shave was painful and irritable. Also the box it came in was broken. terribly torn/tampered, and barely held together. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. I instantly threw this crap away and i hate being wasteful, but it really did disappoint me.",1.0

"When I saw that Proraso had a new formula, I was hesitant and skeptical; I've been shaving with Proraso for a decade now exclusively and that's not coincidence; I absolutely loved the smell and it was a very nice shaving cream.  So with great trepidation I ordered a tube of the ""new formula"" and, well, I hate to be the one-star giver but really, for me, it has to be done.  I don't come to this lightly.

To be frank, the new formula smells...off.  It smells like a wet towel that's been on the bathroom floor for the better part of a week.  When I first started using it I kept wondering what smelled so strange in my bathroom...well, this is the culprit.  It just doesn't have the same smell like it used to.  I've also noticed that whenever I use this shaving cream, my face turns red and is dry and very uncomfortable for the better part of the day; this never happened with the old formula.  You'd think this wouldn't happen since apparently they removed the SLS as part of the new formula...well, for this n=1 experience, it's made my face irritated so badly I simply can't use it anymore.  I guess this is the point where I start trying Trufit or Taylor of Old Bond Street or another one of those ""fancy"" creams because there's just no other choice.  Proraso used to be great, the price was right, and I loved the eucalyptus and tingle.  Now it smells to me of old, damp towel and it's so irritating to my skin it's just about unusable.  A shame, really.",1.0
"This is a disappointing shave cream to say the least. The many positive reviews make it seem like it's the holy grail of shave creams. Unfortunately it just doesn't live up to the hype. Does a tube last a long time? Yes. If that's what you're after, it definitely lasts a long time. A large pea sized dollop, and a good shave brush will make enough foam to give you a decent shave for some time. Does it offer a thick, lubricating foam? No. This is the rub (literally). It foams up to a consistency similar to Rise Super Foam (FYI you can get Rise for a buck at the Dollar Store). If you like that kind of foam, then save yourself some money and head to the dollar store. If you want a smooth comfortable shave, look elsewhere, Proraso isn't  the answer.",1.0
"Reading through some of these reviews, I just do not see what all the hype is about. This is simply ivory soap with some conditioners mixed in. Smells like it, and acts like it. Accordingly, it gunks up your razor, and is no where near the term ""premium shave cream"". Put it on and it is dry in less than 5 minutes like canned foam is. Try a Van Der Hagen luxury bar for less than half the cost at Walmart and you will see what I mean. There is no comparison.",1.0
"To much fuss, total waste of money. Just save your money and get the hard soap in the green dish. Does not larger like the hard soap does.",1.0
"The Amazon box was in fine shape, but the product box appeared worn and/or used.  In addition, the shaving cream itself was already squeezed in the middle, did not appear like a full tube.  Frankly, it looked like a product that was previously used, returned, and sent to me.",1.0
"The package is shredded and looks old and dirty. I bought the product as gift, and it doesn't look good enough for it now. I'm very disappointed.",1.0
"One of the worst products I have used, causes so much burning sensation to the skin probally the menthol or the eucalyptus in the product after looking further into the ingredients [...] on this site  it says most of the ingredients in this product are harsh for the skin.  I would not use this personally my self again. This product might work for some people but I will stick with AOS unscented for natural ingredients.",1.0
I have to agree with a lot of other comment's. There is nothing pleasant about the smell of this shaving cream unless you like the smell of chemicals. This 1 star review has nothing to do with the seller it has everything to do with the manufacture.,1.0
"I hesitate sometimes to write a negative review, but this product has a 4.5 star rating and my opinion might save people some money. And I get repeated messages from Amazon and the actual seller to offer up a good review.

Yes you can get a close and smooth shave with Proraso Shaving Cream, and if this was the year 1948 I would say it's a very good choice, but it is 2013. The product smells of petroleum, just like most shave creams did in the olden days. Modern shaving cream products are much better than this. They lubricate better, rinse off easier and they don't smell like a cross between the local Texaco and the chemical plant.

In addition, the most popular variety of Proraso is the Eucalyptus and Menthol. While the mild burn that these oils cause is perceived as a cooling sensation by our minds when used as a facial shave cream, these same ingredients, used in more sensitive places cause a definite burning sensation and turn the skin red and purple. Modern men shave more than their beards, and a dab of any menthol and eucalyptus product down there is no fun at all. Proraso is not alone in offering menthol and/or eucalyptus oils in their product range, but it has to be brought to the attention of people who choose not to keep the body hair they naturally get covered in.

The best two things about this product are the low plastic content of the packaging, and how long a tube lasts. But when it is an inferior product, maybe we wish it would not last so long.",1.0
"I used to love the Proraso creme, but then discovered that it has one of the most toxic compositions among shave cremes.
The link below is to a cosmetics safety database, that rates product hazards for cancer, reproductive and immune system.
It's not the exact same combination, but I'm sure it can't be much of an improvement.
It's a shame.
