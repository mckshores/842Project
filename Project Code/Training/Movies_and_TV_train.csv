"A wonderful story that is just very well done. Good acting, Ben Kingsley and the cast are just perfect in each of their roles. Beautiful footage of what the Holy Land must have looked like, no matter Where it was taken. The richness of the period costumes, customs, attitudes and the connection of the people to the land itself and to kin. All the details appeared to be nicely taken care of",5.0

"You'll love every minute of this three hour movie. Filmed in Morocco, this treatment of the rags to riches biblical story explores the political intrigue of Joseph's polygamous family and subsequently the Egyptian court. Joseph has long been regarded as a forerunner of Jesus, and the movie alludes to this similarity several times. In fact, Joseph's story is an Old Testament illustration of Jesus' observation that ""no prophet is accepted in his own country,"" (Luke 4:24). Joseph's talent for interpreting dreams provokes his brothers to sell him into slavery, but the same talent proves enormously profitable for him in Egypt.

Perhaps the most relevant connection between the 1995 movie and the present time is the debate over prosperity theology, which proposes that one can enjoy God's blessings --particularly health and wealth-- on earth. Joseph, as portrayed by the athletic Paul Mercurio, is certainly capable of fighting back against his oppressors, but instead of physical aggression, he chooses to assert himself through faith, talent, honesty, and impressive political courage --attributes which eventually earn him riches in Egypt.

Followers of prosperity theology are seen by some Christians as heretics who love money, but the Joseph movie is an epic struggle for the good life, and it raises larger questions. Don't most Christians work for a better life? Don't they repeat refrains, such as ""God helps those who help themselves"" and ""When opportunity knocks, answer the door""? Is the ascetic life advocated by the Bible practical or even responsible in the postmodern world? Was Joseph as a long suffering slave morally superior to Joseph as a rich governor who saved Egypt and its neighbors from death by famine? Several biblical characters have inspired many an inspirational film, but the Joseph movie strikes at the heart of money's problematic role in Christian life.",5.0
"This is my favorite Paul Mercurio movie.  As Joseph he is a truly unharnessed character whose angst is so deep, visually apparent and so complete that we are free to empathize with him. The multi dimensional emotional conflict from within the character is so palpable that it
develops its own spiritual presence in the hot tub seduction scene.  And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals
himself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so
refreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted / elevated status
that resulted from his brothers' betrayal.  I love using this movie to learn languages.  The layered emotion and richness makes it, for me, a movie classic.  I think Paul Mercurio movies in general are great language learning tools.  They are so interesting that I don't mind watching them many times.  And, watching anything more than once is a rare occurrence for me.  I initially saw this movie on a religious channel so
the hot tub scene was edited out due to its sexy content.  It is a very crucial part of the movie, however.",5.0
I love this movie!  Very true to the biblical account of Joseph.  I'm moved every time I watch it  Especially where Joseph forgives his brothers!,5.0

"I did not purchase this video but rented it. This is absolutely the best movie rendition of a Bible story I have ever watched. It faithfully sticks to the Biblical account of Joseph and his brethren and father. A few scenes were added that are not in the Bible, but these did not detract from the narrative; they added continuity and were plausible scenarios. This film respected both God and the Bible. I have nothing negative to say about it. I highly recommend this film to the believer and the unbeliever. It is both entertaining and factual.",5.0
"I love a good Bible story. Joseph is one of the greatest Old Testament character. Good quality,great price and excellent service. THANK YOU!!",5.0
"Excellent retelling of the Bible story of Joseph. His faith in the Lord God Jehovah is front and center, unlike so many so-called Biblical movies. Ben Kingsley as Potiphar -- Paul Mercurio as Joseph -- and Martin Landau as Jacob -- all just superb.  The actors have British accents and many of them have blue eyes -- but that's ok.  The scene where the brothers have thrown Joseph into the pit rings very true - surely it really was very similar to that. This will be a movie I will watch again and again.",5.0

This accurate representation of Joseph from the book of Genesis is the best biblical film I have ever seen.

"Great movie and good adaptation of the biblical account of the life of Joseph. There are times when Hollywood takes EXTREME licenses with biblical stories, transforming them into something unrecognizable (i.e. Noah).  However, that is not the case with Joseph.  The movie stays very close to the biblical account with some minor addition added to enhance the story and to drive home a point.  It effectively demonstrated how God can take a circumstance that to us can seem evil and use to bring about good.  As for those people who were offended by the ""bath scene"", I say read story from Genesis again.  Potiphar's  wife pressured Joseph DAY AFTER DAY for sex. In order for the movie to drive this home effectively without being pornographic, it showed her attempting to seduce him while he was bathing.  Now the although this can be inappropriate for younger viewers, the reality is that it does not deviate drastically from the biblical account and it does not warrant the movie a bad review.  I'll tell anyone with very small children not to watch this with them until they are of an age where you are ready to talk to them about sexual issues.  The Bible is fill with stories of suffering, lost, pain, and redemption and sometimes these topics are hard to see on film.  But it would be an injustice to the Word of God if they were completely omitted.",5.0
"Joseph is a TV movie that tells the story of Joseph from the Old Testament. It stars Paul Mercurio in the title role.
This is Biblical, well-acted, and the filmmakers are to be praised for the sound Biblical research. Although some of the sexually explicit scenes,it should be screened from the very young. It is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in Joseph. The performances were great. Mercurio does an admirable job. The only flaw I could find in it is that it isn't powerful as other Biblical films and TV movies. But nevertheless, it still tells a good story of a man who never lost faith in the Lord amidst all the trials and sufferings that he experienced before achieving success in life.",5.0

"This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: ""Outstanding Miniseries."" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular ""Bible Collection"" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as ""proof."" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish",5.0
"This is amazing, a true count from the bible.  Joseph was perfect and Ben Kingsley as  Potifar was great.",5.0
"Regarding Biblical movies, this one and the Ten Commandments with Charles Heston are really the closet scripture related movies that I have seen.  This movie is 3 hours long and I have already watched it 2 times and could watch it over and over again.  It it an excellent movie and I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to be seen by anyonr and everyone.  It really shows how God will provide for his people if only they would put him first and worhip no other Gods.  A God can be anything that you put first and foremost before the only One and True Living God who created this earth and everything in it.  If we just follow Him, he will provide and actually go beyond just meeting our needs, but will give us the desires of our hearts.  Our first desire must be to serve, and love our God of Abraham, Jacob and Issac with all our minds, hearts and souls.  No other Gods are allowed to be worshipped as the God I serve is a jealous God.  You cannot serve two masters and expect to spend eternity in Heaven with the Lord our Risen Saviour.  Please get this and watch it and I am sure you will see what I am talking about and agree. An Excellent Movie. I have seen a few other Bible Related movies and they were very good also, but this one is one of my favorites.",5.0

It brought the Bible Story to life.,5.0
"Genesis actually comes to life again in this adaption of the life of ""Joseph"". Being well versed in scripture, I'm usually a tad weary of most anything that Hollywood has to offer when adapting from ""The Holy Book"". What a relief and pleasure it's been to see this film. The story of Joseph is one of my personal favorite accounts told from the Old Testament. What a delight it was to see this wonderful tale done so faithfully and true. And yes, the ending of this film shall bring tears to one's eyes. For any who are not familiar with scripture, then see this film. Any who does read scripture, as I do, then see this film as well. God Bless always.",5.0
"Great mini-series. Really like the story, characters and quality of the acting.",5.0
"This movie has a 5 star rating for a reason!  There are already enough thoughtful, detailed reviews here so I don't feel the need to add another one, but I wanted to throw my hat in the ring with a rating because the movie deserves it.  I own it and have probably watched it a dozen times; I am moved with every viewing and am encouraged in my faith.  It does a magnificent job of bringing the story to life.

Regarding the title of my review... yes, the bath scene went too far for me to condone (no nudity, but extremely suggestive) and it is admittedly a cringe-worthy few minutes for a bible based movie; I won't try to justify it, but since I've overlooked (and fast-forwarded through) plenty of more explicit scenes in secular movies, I'd be a hypocrite to denounce this film because of it.  If you have a very strict, zero tolerance policy for anything sexually suggestive in a movie, then my recommendation would be that you pass on this one.",5.0
"Love this entire series. Joseph is very accurate to the Bible. Easy to watch and follow. Great way to teach the biblical section on Joseph, as it brings the words to life.",5.0

I have seen this movie several times and bought it because I liked it so much.  This version has good acting and goes into more detail about Joseph's brothers and their thoughts and actions than similar movies I've seen.  My favorite part is when Joseph reveals to his brothers who he really is.  I cry every time.  Movie arrived quickly and as promised.,5.0
"I must admit this bibical movie has it all. Passion,Suspense and Temptation. I think this is more for a mature audience. Due to some scenes in this film I wouldnt advise children to view it. But the cast and movie is wonderful. It's truly a movie worth watching!",5.0

Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books, I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.

I loved this movie and had seen it many times years ago and had to have the dvd. The glorious depiction of Joseph and his devout faith and obedience in God despite his tumultuous family life and the false accusation that led to his imprisonment. We have been studying Joseph in our Sunday school class and the movie in addition to the Bible readings just brought it to life. Beautifully done.....I can watch it over and over and over again....,5.0

Ben Kingsley in the movie is just an added bonus..... :)",5.0
"I cannot help but notice that ALL of those who serve God have to suffer for him. Though the churches today teach you don't have to suffer, the Bible says different. I wish I were as strong as Joseph. He sure isn't a ""why me"" type.",5.0
"Probably the most accurate account of the life of Joseph out there along with excellent acting.  The humility of Joseph is portrayed so well and it does not stray from the true account of Joseph's life at all.  The movie spans many years even including the incident about Dinah, Leah's daughter.  Excellent, excellent movie.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this.  *****THIS IS NOTHING LIKE  PAUL, THE APOSTLE--(I believe also put out as part of the bible collection)*** which I literally threw out in the trash!  I hope this helps you.",5.0

"This is my go to movie for when I need to be humble. This telling of Joseph is very, very close to the Bible, and that is what I was looking for. Sometimes when you purchase this movies it is strictly Hollywood version. This time they got it right.",5.0
"All time favorite movie!!!! Based on the Biblical account of Joseph & how his brothers sold him into slavery and how God turned the situation all around!!  Excellent movie.  If you've never read the story or saw the movie - this is a must.  Its' stellar performances by the actors makes it even more enjoyable.  One word of caution, the scene where Potifar's wife tries to seduce Joseph while bathing is extremely steamy & sexual. That's unfortunate because other than that scene and one other scene that's sexual in nature, this would have been an excellent movie to watch with a church group.  But in my opinion, it's too steamy for mixed company and/or church viewing.  Other than that, it's an A+++++ movie!!!  The ending will bring you to tears!",5.0

I used to watch this all the time on TBN and I just had to have it in my collection.  Great story.  Really shows you the heart Joseph has.,5.0
"Acting was very good, the story line was well done and included all the important parts of the tale  without adding too much conjecture in.",5.0
"I love the story of Joseph, it reminds me of my life. I was betrayed and mistreated by all of my family members because they don't like me for different reasons. Joseph remains honest and faithful to Potifer. He was in prison for a false accusation Potifers wife made about him..(Just how I felt imprisoned by the people around me)In the end of all the opression people up in his face with false accusations the Pharaoh gives him authority over his Kingdom because god given him the gift to interpret dreams. Joseph also made a comment in the movie that made me laugh. Clothes are meaningless~ Im still a slave.",5.0
"Very well done.  Great acting for most of it.  towards the end the main character loses me a little bit, but for the most part I like it a lot.",5.0
This is an excellent movie which I have used in Sunday School.  The youth were able to envision the Bible's narrative in Genesis much more clearly because of the fine acting and appreciative telling of the Joseph story.,5.0
"I love the story of Joseph and his brothers.  As the world might say, a tale of Joseph,  Nothing in the Bible is a tale or fabricated as the world might say.  Love the actor also love Ben Kingsley.",5.0
"Great Bible movie, I personally believe after watching quite a few Bible movies like Abraham, David, Samson and Delilah, Jeremiah, the Ten Commandments, and Solomon, that this is the most accurate live-action Bible created. I watched this when I was 5 and I still watch it 15 years later. There is a bit of violence, by that's just how the story is. This isn't bloody, and the Joseph-Potiphar's Wife scenes aren't for kids, but besides that, this is great.",5.0
"Joseph clearly tells how God can use anyone.  Despite his background of brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery, he held on through prison years in Egypt and became the second highest, most powerful leader in Egypt.  When his brothers finally came to the realization that this leader under Pharoah was indeed their very own brother, it was then that Joseph forgave them for what transpired in his youth.  It's a lesson we can all take to heart.",5.0
I have watched this film over and over loaned to all of my friends we all give it a 5 star. This movie is so well done if you like Biblical movies you must see this one.,5.0
"Excellent Choice - A good story line and well communicated. Its a simple, but inspiring interpretation. Recommeded to watch and share",5.0

This was a great DVD. It tells the story of Joseph and his family. Good for the whole family and great for reinforcing your knowledge of the Bible.,5.0
Great movie. Excellent acting and definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent,5.0
"This is the best version of Joseph out there.  Very well written, produced, and directed.  They did a great job of filling in the gaps in the story line and making it a powerful tale of forgiveness and deliverance.",5.0

not get tired of watching it.",5.0
I saw this movie many years ago on T.V. and have been searching for it ever since.  I am so glad I found it.  I want all of my family members to see it.  Follows the Bible closely and the acting is great.,5.0
A+ now I have on dvd we love it!  this is a family favorite and we had on an old VHS but now on dvd,5.0
I showed this movie at a Bible study after we had read the story of Joseph in Genesis and man did it bring a whole new perspective and depth to the Bible study. People were inspired.  At times they wanted to cry. It definitely touched them. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to experience the Joseph story in a whole new and powerful way.,5.0
The actors and actresses in this film are wonderful at their portrayal of the biblical characters involved in Joseph's life.  A definite most have.,5.0
I knew this particular movie would be great. Iv'e seen it when it came out. This movie came out in 1995. A modern classic.,5.0
to see how they take a name from bible (JOSEPH)  and turn it in to a dvd movie to show how it was in the bible days,5.0
I thought both actors did a beautiful job of acting out the roles and it was so closey written according to the account in the bible.  I love it.,5.0
"One of the best-done Bible movies ever, if not the very best.  I'm a pastor.  Great acting; great story telling.  Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness.  The theology in this has nothing objectionable, and I'm a stickler on getting theology right, since that's my job.  Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off.  Great theological themes pervade the movie.  Like someone else said, I could've done without the bath scene.  There's no nudity in it, and something like this might have happened, sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters.  I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up.  Don't let that deter you from buying this, though.  This is in the series done by Ted Turner.  I wish Christians, in making Biblical movies, would be as theologically and Biblically accurate and excellent as this film.  Bravo!  I love this movie.",5.0
"I thought the movie was sufficiently close to the Bible story. The sets were often lacking, but I enjoyed the movie anyway. I had a copy that I bought with the Bible Collection 7 or 8 years ago that I loaned out and never got back. I was happy to get this at around $7.
I recommend the Bible Collection highly.",5.0
Its so hard to find movies that the whole family can watch. This movie projects positive values with an engaging story. The acting was very believeable and top notch.,5.0
This was the most realistic and believable presentation of this beloved story that I've ever seen. Absolutely wonderful and I can't recommend it highly enough!,5.0
"The best movie ever seen and own. Its actually my favorite movie of all time. its worth to have, its so accurate from the bible. very inspiring and educational. Buy It",5.0
"I have watched this version of ""Joseph"" numerous times also on TV and am once again glad to add this one to my collection of Bible DVD's. It's entertainment but for me it's much than that I'm able to receive a better understanding of my Bible it's like a learning process to test me on my Bible knowledge and see how well I know the scriptures, for instance when I'm able to pick something out of the movie that may not be quite true to scripture I go check my Bible and I'm able to learn my scriptures better and my Bible. I believe by watching the DVD over and over and even having different versions you absorb more into your memory and it can be your own individual Bible study. I was really amazed and excited when I saw that you offered many of these DVD's of (The Bible Collection) which are some of my favorites. Hoping to collect them all and other versions plus other Christian DVD's to learn from them for a better understanding of God's true Word.",5.0
This is a fantastic movie or the retelling of the Story of Joseph.  The scenery in the movie is fantastic too.  The actors are great in each of their roles.  I'm glad I ordered this movie.  Saw it many years ago.,5.0

"As with Abraham, starring Richard Harris, I saw this on TV and was  very impressed with how it followed the Bible and the customs of the time. I would feel ""safe' about  doing a Sunday school study showing either one of them. Both movies were correct as to costuming and locations. Again than you for offering these movies, and also to the film makers for these quality films.",5.0
I have periodically viewed this film ever since it first was aired.  Got the DVD to have a more permanent copy. Always will love it !!!,5.0
Just what I ordered. No surprises. I am a pastor and we just  finished studying the book of Genesis and w finished that book by watching this movie.,5.0
"This is my favorite movie of all times. It is so realistic that I cry every time I watch. The characters are extremely good in their acting, and I especially enjoyed the Joseph character, Paul Mercurio. I would definatly  recommend this movie!!",5.0
"So when I misplaced the videos, they were a gift I looked for them everywhere.  I gave up and forgot about this movie for the longest and then I found on Amazon I was so excited.  On VHS it was two tapes because its over 3 hours long but now I only have to worry about one single DVD.",5.0
"As most movies, this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out, it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph, his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences).",5.0
I bought this for my grandmother for  a birthday gift. She loves this movie and is very happy to own it.,5.0
Paul Mercurio is absolutely great in this movie!  Really well made and it puts words into action and make the Bible come to life.,5.0
I used this movie in my prison ministry bible study. It was very well done and followed the bible very closely. Joseph as revealed in the book of Genesis of the scripture is a type of Jesus and the movie brought this out which shows an obvious insight and knowledge do God's word. I would highly recommend this DVD for all family viewing.,5.0
"I loved the movie.  It was exactly what I had hoped for.  I had been wanting DVD that would bring the words of the Bible to life, like the Ten Commandments.  It was great.  Loved the movie.",5.0

"I had these three DVD, this one Joseph and David and Abraham for a long time. I believe it was in the late 1990,s and I got them on VHS and then I donated them to a nursing home because I knew they would really enjoy them. And then I  brought them on DVD. So I have enjoyed this movies for a long time. I also got Abraham on VHS and I gave it away and brought it on DVD. All were excellent.",5.0
I Love Sir Ben Kingsley in this role! It follows the Biblical account well. The BEST Joseph I have ever seen!,5.0

"Good Good movie,  at least to me.  I have given several coppies away in hopes of people gathering the lessons offered within the biblical story line.  but even without that, it's a good movie.  Blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Abraham, Isac and Jacob.  and blessed be HIs only begotten son, our Lord Jesus Christ.",5.0
I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought the relationship between Potifer and his wife and his wife and Joseph really striking.  Several things that I had not thought of before.  Such as: why didn't Potifer have Joseph killed when his wife accused him of rape? and How did his brothers react to him after he became Pharaoh's advisor.,5.0
"I am an avid Bible reader and even though there was a bit of Hollywood in it, the overall theme and content was very close to the written word.  Thumbs up for it.",5.0
Really entertaining.  It keeps you drawn into one of the greatest stories of the bible and does  a good job of following the story as told in scripture.,5.0
My small group bible class was able to follow the bible with this movie. It was very informative and the sound track was great.,5.0
"This movie is very inspirational to me, it helped me through my trails and tribulations during the time I needed it most, this movie relates to me.",5.0
One of the greatest movies ever made; and is the favorite of my 6 year old grandson.  It is worth watching in every possible way.,5.0
This portrayal of Joseph's story is very good.  It is biblically pretty accurate and features good performances by the actors.  I recommend it to individual and family audiences!  It's one of the great stories of the Bible.,5.0
"really great acting in this DVD. Ben Kingsley is one of the best. For those  of you who know the story, it is worth a look at thos version on DVD.",5.0
"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but, if there weren't, the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that, even though this is a family story, there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting, really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing, you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!",5.0
"This is a brilliant epic movie, a tour de force, the best Biblical movie I have seen with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Night-with-the-King/dp/B000JJSJO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Night with the King</a>&nbsp;Starring Paul Mercurio in the title role, he gives an intelligent and passionate performance of a man who was prepared to die, to keep to the word of his G-D.
Ben Kingsley is his usual magnificent self in his role of Potiphar which he plays with panache. Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesman

The movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.

His rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest.
The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive",5.0
"FAST, FRIENDLY AND GREAT SERVICE! I RECEIVED MY MONEY'S WORTH AND NOTHING WAS BROKEN OR TORN. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BUYER AND THEIR SERVICES!",5.0
The Joseph DVD arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was exactly as I had pictured it from it's image and decscription on the web site.,5.0
"This is the closest to the Bible.  I've seen it on TV and really enjoyed it.  I am trying to collect several of the best, and this is one.",5.0
"I recommend this movie, Joseph. It is a great reprentation of  of a truly kind, just, and merciful God and the people He loves. We all need positive and true to life movies that are not only good for the heart, but for the soul.",5.0
"Ah, my favorite Bible story. After watching this and seeing how well produced it was, I can only say that I watch it ast lease twice a month.",5.0
This movie is very thoughtful and insightful in the portrayal of Joseph of Egypt. I would highly recommend this movie to all.,5.0
"I have used this movie several times (VCR version) in prison ministry.  The women respond well to the visuals of the Biblical story of Joseph.  I do warn them & you that certain liberties have been taken in the movie.  I object to the portrayal of Potiphar's wife with Joseph.  If you plan to use this with children, teens, or those unfamiliar with the Biblical record, you should preview and provide advance instruction.  Also the encounter between Tamar & Judah needs Biblical background.  However, I do recommend the video.",5.0
"A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it, but nevertheless, every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story.  This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (""Blessed be His name"")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.",5.0
The DVD came in a timely fashion and was excellent.  As a matter of fact I am still watching this from time to time. This movie is still in excellent condition. I will be using this seller many days to come. Thank you so very much.,5.0
Awesome movie and great story.  Highly recommend this movie and follows closely to biblical accounts.  The message is strong about forgiveness and faithfulness.,5.0
"How wonderful that a story about precognitive dreams has become such a famous and beautiful story.  We are all wise to pay attention to our dreams, but not all of us have a talented and high-minded interpreter like Joseph.  Even Freud in ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" admits that precognitive dreams are not unusual.",5.0
I started watching this movie on TV with my grandson and we did not get to see the last part.  I knew it was an older movie and knew my best chances of finding it would be on Amazon.com.  I was not disappointed!  There it was and I ordered it that night!  The movie came in the mail within the next week and we sat down and watched it right away.  An excellent movie that we will watch again and again.,5.0
This is a wonderful story of the beginning rise of the nation of Israel.  I would almost rate this movie as good as the Ten Commandments.  I found myself in tears at the end of this movie so new watchers beware!,5.0
"This movie is extremely well made. It is so touching when Joseph's brothers throw him into a pit. His crying and pleading with them to be merciful is so moving as is the part when Joseph finally meets his brothers again and tells them who he really is.
Exceptionally well made, I recommend this movie as high as possible.  A true hero in a world of doubt and sorrows it helps to know that human issues of understanding, forgiveness and love are always with us and always have been.",5.0
One of the better bible stories out there.,5.0
This video was wonderful.  It was a very touching movie and kept within the story written in the Bible.  I watched it several times and shared with a friend.,5.0
"This DVD is excellent.  I saw it a few times on TCT and enjoyed it very much.  Realizing I could have my own copy was great news.  It offers hope for those going through unjust persecution.  It helps my faith to realize God will never abandon us, no matter what!  God can make good even out of evil intentions.  Recommended for family viewing.",5.0

My son has been collecting the different books of the bible for a while now.  He is so excited that I am able to order these from Amazon.  He has a few more DVD'S that we need to order to complete his collection.  I'm am very pleased with the DVD and quick shipment.,5.0
"The movie Joseph from The Bible Collection is an extremely worthwhile movie to watch. As a Bible-believing Christian and follower of Christ, the main criteria for me is always the question--Is it true to the biblical text? This movie, combined with the King James language is extremely close to the biblical text and I can almost follow along in scripture with many scenes. It is very enjoyable and portrays the biblical account in a fresh, relevant way.

I highly recommend Joseph to any family and encourage any parent to watch it with their children, teenagers and even young adults that may be out of the home and on their own. Recently, I watched David from this Collection with my 23-year-old son when he came to visit and am awaiting his return to watch Joseph.

The movie is poignant and lively as it retells the story of the brothers' betrayl and sin against Joseph as they sell him into slavery. During these scenes, my heart was gripped, feeling many emotions as the story unfolded.

I believe this movie does an excellent job portraying the story of faith as Joseph rises to prominence within Pharoah's court, suffers in prison because of false accusations, and especially as he forgives his brothers. Joseph's revelation of his identity to his brothers and his reunion with his family is outstanding and emotionally moving.

The acting of Ben Kingsley as Pharoah and the rest of the cast is superb and it is best to watch it when you have 3 hours to set aside or take an intermission in the middle of it. This movie will enhance your biblical knowledge of Joseph while adding a visual dimension to your Bible knowledge.

The movie also provides a wonderful introduction with moral lessons to any child, teenager or young adult. Another movie that I highly recommended from The Bible Collection is David starring Nathaniel Parker and Leonard Nimoy. It is one of my favorites and like Joseph, is very close to the original King James text. Thanks for listening.",5.0
"I found this depiction of Joseph's plight to more accurate than most efforts I have seen. It was full of adventure; ups and down, yet a reflection of unwavering faith. I find myself learning more and more each time I watch this movie; and I have watched it a bunch of times. Great message in a great movie.",5.0
One terrific movie.  I had it years ago in a VHS and saw it multiple times to the point that the VHS was damaged.  Me and my son just love this movie.  Now I have it in DVD.,5.0
"This is one of the very best renditions of the story of Joseph. This is a high quality ""Hollywood"" production. Big names, big set. The thing that impressed me the most about this movie (as well as it's companions, Abraham, and Jacob) was the accuracy. You can almost turn page by page through your Bible and follow along. Highly recommended.",5.0
"There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  ""Joseph"" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  ""Joseph"" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.

This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.

Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.",5.0
Joseph is amazing story to read and watch.  A person with the lord's help goes through trail. goes from a lowely shepard boy to the second highest person in Egypt.,5.0
"I really loved this movie ,it describes the biblical account pretty accurate. it starts w/ Joseph being sold to Egypt and backtracks after Joseph is accused from Potiphars wife, when Joseph defends himself in front of Potiphar through telling him his life story. I was clued to the screen the whole time. Also the actor for Joseph is very likable and also Jacob(Martin Landau) did a great performance.",5.0
This is an incredible telling of the story of Joseph and the roller coaster ride on which he rode.  One of many Biblical Old Testament stories made by Turner Films and this is of very high quality.  Not the wooden-like acting which is not uncommon in Biblical story telling in some past films.  This is first-class and definitely worth 5 stars.,5.0
i buy films mainly for my family memebers as gifts. this is a great depiction of this story from the bible. very well done for the period it was taken from.,5.0
This movie kept as true to the actual bible as any movie I have ever seen. A good example of how God's miracles sometimes take a whole life time.,5.0
This movie brought the Story of Joseph according to the Bible alive.  The bedrooom scene with Potiphar's wife could have been less graphic yet other than that the movie was enjoyable.,5.0
"To say this movie is very good would not do it justice. Ignore the criticism of the, ""Bath scene."" Potipher's wife makes moves on Joseph- that's the way it was. The movie doesn't show nudity, but shows what an evil woman she was. Ben Kingsley, as always, was excellent in this movie. After the movie, you feel like you've had a feast!",5.0
"Joseph is an interesting and thought provoking movie.  I began watching it late one evening with the intent of recording it because it is a three hour movie.  I didn't think I could stay up long enough to see the entire movie.  It was so good, I couldn't turn it off!",5.0
"In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever. Good writting, acting, very good. Not perfect, but close. Probably no one could or will ever do better.",5.0
Really good movie that's entertaining and comes with a good message. I think Hollywood followed the story pretty well of course they have to fill in some things for it to make sense. Definitely would recommend watching if you're in the mood for a biblical movie. Five star all the way!,5.0
"Thank  you for delivering the exact item I ordered, in a Very Timely manner!",5.0

I look forward to viewing the movie ""Joseph"" , perhaps with some friends, becauce I am currently studying the life of Joseph. I recommend the film to anyone who has yet to see it. Many thanks. SHAWN",5.0
"I love the story of Joseph.. it always inspires and humbles.. but I had never seen a movie that did it justice.. and even one that still left you (like the bible) asking questions or wondering.. (like.. what happened re Potiphar's wife after Joseph became the Governor of all Egypt.. and how did Joseph's brother's explain to Jacob that he wasn't dead after all but that they were lyings cowards who now had to come clean?) I loved that they included the story of how Tamar got pregnant by Joshua even if they misrepresented the tale of how the first 2 sons had died because of their wickedness before the Lord.
This movie is not perfect.. not totally accurate scripturally.. ie "" the rains never came but the Nile flooded"" when it only required the Nile to flood.. and the miniscule effort shown re the silos to hold 7 years grain etc etc.. but the story telling was marvellous and the starting from the middle of the tale to tell the story and adding the beginning as an insert.. all marvellous telling of an amazing tale.. the tale of the brothers, and the growth of Joseph and his relation to Jacob was excellent and well played. I have seen Martin Landau in many a movie or programme but he moves me to tears by his portrayal of Jacob and his love for Joseph. I love finding nitpicks in movies and this one has many too.. (ie the Tamar who receives the seal & staff is a different woman  than the beauty who plays her in most of the part) but overall it is an amazing truthful retelling of a biblical classic and if fairly accurate.. even the 'explicit' parts only show the realiry of the situation and any man can be moved to realise how easy it would have been to give in to temptation.. yet Joseph overcame.. Lesley Ann Warren was fabulous as the seductress looking amazing and then quickly becoming the horrid scorned woman.. tremendous.. Ben Kingsley as Potiphar opened my eyes to certain realities of scripture that I hadn't realised before.. and Paul Mercurio as Joseph with his real Joseph and emotive performance.. I found (and still find) the watching a wonderfully emotive and enlightening experience everytime I watch it.. and I watch it regularly.. it is the best of the bunch.. and a classic in it's own right. There are few movies I enjoy as much as this despite some of it's failings.. they did good in this one.. I would heartily recommend it.",5.0
"E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T!!!!!  I love this movie.  The quality of the picture was great!  I recommend this movie highly. Everyone should own a copy.  Everytime I see it, it's like I'm seeing it for the first time.  It makes me cry every time.  Joseph is an ordinary man who loved God.  Joseph was loyal to God.  God rewarded Joseph for his faithfulness later on in his life.  We can all learn from this that if we are faithful to God, God will reward us as well.  Joseph learned that in forgiveness there is great joy and peace.  We can also learn this lesson from Joseph.  What I also learn from this story is that even when it looks like it's darkest in our lives, God can turn it around for our good if we only trust God and are faithful to Him.  This is a great character building movie.  It's a great family movie.  I just absolutely love it.  You will enjoy it too.",5.0
"this movie is about the biblical joseph. it is a movie of sacrifice, courage ,serving , forgiveness,love and the strength of the Lord.",5.0
"This movie is almost like the story of Joseph, thats written in the Bible. Joseph was a remarkable man! If only the leaders of the world today was like Joseph was, a wise man, who listened to God, and kept the Ten Commandments!

 Please read God's story of Joseph, thats in the book of Geneis, in the Holy Bible first, so that you can know Gods true account of Joseph firsthand! This is a awesome, and remarkable true story, of so long ago!

 My favorite part of the movie, is when Joseph meets the Pharoah of Egypt face to face! WOW! This movie was very well done, this movie is one of my favorite versions of Joseph! God blessed Joseph greatly, and had big plans for him all along, for living his life as a godly man! I loved the way Joseph, and his Egyption master(Ben Kingsley), became friends, and earned each others trust and respect, eventhough Joseph was still a slave.

 It always amazed me, how Joseph was able to forgive his brothers, especially after what they did to him! Joseph was a very wise, and brillant man! I highly recommend this movie, it is based on a very true, and awesome story, thats in the HOLY BIBLE! This movie is very good, and I loved it very much! You will end up watching it more than once!",5.0
"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good, the costumes inhanced the film, and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't.",5.0

"This is an accurate and realistic depiction of Scripture. It is nice to watch a Bible story that is not a cartoon and not an overacted, way too serious presentation. Bible heroes on film are often treated as if they walked on earth with a halo constantly hovering over them. This is a story about a man who follows God's heart through thick and thin (mostly thin), but you can relate to him because he is portrayed as an ordinary, albeit tremendously faithful, man.",5.0

"I am always skeptical of hollywood productions of anything true but this is about as good as it could get.  A few variations from the true story, but they were minor.  Their take on the issues surrounding this family demonstrates they listenend to the advice they got from Old Testament experts who actually believe the Bible.  It was not only well written, but the acting was superb!  We have read the biblical story many times, but found ourselves mesmerized by this movie version.  HIGHLY Recommend!",5.0
"I love this movie!!  I found that it is an excellent adaptation of the Biblical story.  It stays true to the Biblical story and provides additional insights on other aspects that weren't mentioned in the Bible.

"It's hard to believe Ted Turner had anything to do with this production. Certainly a credit to him. It's the best ""Joseph"" to date. A must see for the many Christians whose portrayal of God's man has not given credit to the true gospel. God's man was not ""full of himself,"" nor did he ever think himself better than his brothers, although his character was much better than theirs. The Lord God had chosen the right man for the job...",5.0
"This is by far my most favorite of the ""Bible Collection"" movies. It is done very well, and yes there are a few scenes that get a little steamy, the movie should be reviewed by parents before deciding to let the kids view it without being ready to hit the fast forward button.

As far as I can tell it is biblically accurate and really brings to life this great old story.

You will see and understand this story in a whole new light after viewing this masterpiece.

I have seen this film many many times and the ending still gets me wiping away the tears from my eyes.

This is truly a great movie and you will not be disappointed!",5.0
"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph, the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.

Joseph is the favored son of his father, a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.

The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first, it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well.",5.0
"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean, what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!

For fans of this movie, look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses, Abraham, David, Jacob, and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham.",5.0
"I would have to say that this is one of the best ""made-for-TV"" (on TNT) biblical films I've seen. The acting was phenominal, the scenery..EVERYTHING. This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible, which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest, uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world. Even so, I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD! :)",5.0
"As the title says, unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him, which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife, Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through.",5.0
"This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph.  Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.",5.0
"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second, and this movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others, but the effort is exemplary.",5.0
I think it is safe to say that I have seen every movie or TV presentation of the story of Joseph.  It is one of my favorites.  This particular story with Ben Kingsley is by far the best I have have ever seen.  The first time I watched the story I borrowed it from a friend.  I was so impressed that I bought my own copy. To date I have watched the movie a minimum of 10 times.  I never tire of watching this movie.  Thank you for allowing me to share my story.,5.0

"This is probably THE best religious film I have ever seen. Normally I complain about them, and they are usually done very low budget with completely unknown actors who cannot act. Joseph, however was done very well. The sets were historically accurate, and the filmmakers made sure to put detail into everything they did. They also left nothing out. Every little detail from the Joseph story is here, in their greusome details. Ben Kingsley does an excellent job as Potiphar and Potiphars wife is equally good and vile. Joseph himself is everything you would expect Joseph to be, humble, handsome, smart, and spiritual. Wonderfully Done.",5.0
"This is rather a question.

I love this movie since I bought the original VHS version (2 tapes) that is 185 minutes long total (a little over 90 minutes each tape).  I am reading that this DVD version is only 145 minutes.  40 minutes have been cut off?

Today, August 5, many days after I wrote the above question, I can give an answer myself.  I got the DVD.  The run time specified by the manufacturer or distributor is incorrect.  The length of the DVD is 185 minutes exactly, just like the original VHS version.",5.0
"This movie was very well done- one of the best by this company.  Just remember the story and don't watch it with your kids because they were very accurate about what happened with Potiphar's wife and Joseph's garment being left behind as well as the fact that she had been continually tempting him prior to this encounter.  Also, they kept to the historical feautures in that the women wore fine linen that is fairly see-through.  The only scene I remember being unhappy with was the baker beating Joseph in the prison (Not Biblical) and it isn't 3 days till they are brought out, though it may be that long till the events are otherwise fulfilled.  There were a few other minor changes like that but none damaged the historical perspective. Also, I wish they had included Judah's offer of protection to Benjamin and his, therefore, being the one to offer himself in Benjamin's place.  They show one offer but I assumed that was the other brother who made the initial offer and was refused since it was right when they got back to their father, just as the Bible portrays it.",5.0
"""Joseph"" is an epic motion picture; another excellent and inspiring Bible story which was creatively and sensitively produced. It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.

This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.

Although I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.

The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion. However, this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions.

Overall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it.",5.0
"Perhaps the most Biblically acurate presentation of scripture I've ever seen.  An outstanding cast, well directed and even a brilliantly composed musical score.  One of my absolute favorite stories in the Bible really came to life in this presentation.  I would recommend this film for families, Bible studies and Sabbath/Sunday school classes.",5.0
"In my opinion I think Joseph is a great movie, its very well acted, casted, it tells the story very well keeps you very interested till the very end. if fact your almost sorry to see it end! I kinda wanted to hear more! it also teaches you about a story in the bible, it was fab!! loved it as you can tell! my kids love it too!!",5.0
"This movie is a must see.  Oh my gosh, I'm still breathless.  The characters and the depictions were so close to the scripture until it was unbelievable.  I grabbed my bible just to follow along with the movie.  I particularly love the way that the story regarding Judah and his daughter-in-law is placed smack dab in the middle of the entire Joseph story.  Initially from just reading the bible I couldn't quite understand how a portion of the scripture would focus on Joseph, then the focus is taken immediately off him and it's placed upon Judah and Tamar.  Then it goes immediately back to focusing on Joseph.  God's written word is obviously trying to make a point and show a comparison.  The movie grabbed even the smallest details from the scriptures; for example the stranger in the desert that suddenly asks Joseph who he's looking.

I purchased a used movie that was in SUPER, Good, like NEW shape and to boot, the movie was inspiring, educational and so real.

It's a must see .........",5.0
"The series are amazing! Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the  Lord God as foundation.

I was expecting those usual blurry versions, but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy, anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.

"This is the finest Biblical epoch we have ever seen, including Ben Hur and 10 Commandments.  A low budget testament to the power of imagination and good acting.  Remarkably faithful to both to historical and scriptural sources, the script brings life to an  already marvelous tale of alienation, faith and redemption.  The tragic family of Isaac is beautifully portrayed with every character (including all 12 brothers) skillfully defined.",5.0
"This is an incredible mini-series...but it might not be so great if the run time stated (145 minutes) is accurate for the DVD release.  The length of this production (at least on the VHS version) was 185 minutes.  I plan to verify that this was not severely edited before I purchase it.  There is some hope insofar as Warners Home Video has a history of understating (or miscalculating) run times...The miniseries ""North And South"" had a run time misprint that amounted to 183 minutes--over 3 hours!!  The material was not missing or edited...just the info on the box was in error.  Hopefully, that's what's happened here.  Besides, ""Abraham"" is being released the same day fully intact...why not ""Joseph?""

UPDATE:  The run time as stated on the actual packaging IS 187 minutes.  Actually, the film runs 3 hours and 5 minutes as per the DVD player itself.  So, it seems, NOTHING has been edited for the DVD release.  The box also says ""Special Features not rated or closed captioned""...but there are NO special features.  Just some language and subtitle selections.  Now, I can't wait to watch it again.  Thanks, Warners..for not butchering this fantastic production.",5.0
"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet, sorry.",5.0
"Although I have enjoyed most of the movies in the Bible Collection Joseph has been my all time favorite.  It is biblically accurate, events that are not recounted in the Bible are kept beleivalbe for the time period.  The guy who plays Joseph does a wonderful job.  In fact it was this movie that ruined the movie Moses, Ben Kingsley does a wonderful job as Potiphar in Joseph, but is just to old and not right for the part of Moses.

I am so glad that this movie will finally be out on DVD.  They have been available overseas for a long time in DVD format.  I am glad they are begining to release these on DVD, hopefully David will come out soon.",5.0
"This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  ""Hollywoodized"" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one! Originally shown as a 2-part TV mini-series by TNT a few years ago, I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release - uninterrupted by commercials, and including a making-of featurette. Don't let this jewel get by you!",5.0
"When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television, at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries, I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.

This film, though, is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.

This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!",5.0
"Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished, the heart and soul of the story remain intact, and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch. 33:18 through Ch. 46:30.
Much of the acting is marvelous, especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, whose part has thankfully been enlarged, because he is riveting in every scene he is in.
Martin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob, who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son, Joseph.
Australian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio (""Strictly Ballroom"") is good in the lead, and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife, the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah, and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers, notably Michael Attwell (Judah), and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon).
Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively. The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.
Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who ""does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death"" is worth watching again and again.",5.0
I bought this film after seeing most of it on A&E. This film is by far the best way to see Joseph. The settings are beautiful and the entire look of the production are perfect in presenting the story. The casting choices could not have been better! Paul Mercurio is a perfect Joseph. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. This film is the best Joseph movie to date.,5.0
"This is absolutely one of the best produced and acted Bible stories around. It's accuracy, acting and pacing set a new standard for Bible-based productions.

"Having just seen this movie for the first time last night, I have to say that in spite of the very white actors in a culture that would clearly be darker in appearance, this movie in writing, production, and acting overcame that one glaring inconsistency with accuracy and with beauty.
Bible in hand, we marveled to see that this story followed the actual biblical account with astounding accuracy almost never seen in biblical productions.  Entirely enjoyable and a marvelously acted piece, my entire family loved this movie.  We had been expecting another biblical mish mash eliciting merely yawns, but were startled to see such a wonderful movie.
Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.  The supporting cast was excellent.
The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh, creative, yet took no liberties in veering from the original story.  Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies, this movie was more like it ""really"" would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence.
I can not speak highly enough of this movie.  What a pleasant surprise.  We even got a chuckle out of it now and then!",5.0
"My God, i have never seen the story of Joseph in this light. I had no idea how commited, humble and faithful Joseph was in the bible. What watching this movie did for me is to reevalute my life and it caused me togo higher in intergrity at work, school and everywhere in my life and in addition, it made me realise how much everything i did was mediocre and how much i needed to live a life of excellence in everything that i did. It showed me that God is always faithful and that he is a rewarder of those who deligently seek him. Joseph suffered for like 13 years, but he spent the rest of his 70 something years in complete abundance in God. This movie has really been a blessing and i encourage everyone to get a copy of it. Believe me your life will never be the same.",5.0
"""Joseph"" masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit, power, and passion of the Biblical narrative. The acting is of the highest quality, being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar. Despite some Hollywood license, ""Joseph"" remains true to the Biblical narrative, even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating). It is an epic motion picture, lasting over 3 hours, but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor. ""Joseph"" does have its weaknesses, yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation. In fact, it is so good, I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites. It left me inspired, encouraged, and in awe of God's faithfulness. You will not be disappointed!",5.0
"A very moving, realistic portrayal of the story of Joseph. With Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, great casting and dialog, it makes a part of Bible History come alive.

"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well, even Potiphar's wife.
As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but, have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby",5.0
"One of the most oft recounted stories of betrayal and redemption of all time, that of patriarch Joseph at the hands of his envious and spiteful brothers, is retold once again in this film.  The film's greatest contribution to the story is the deep emotion that it conveys.  Viewers will actually feel the loss, the betrayal, the hopelessness, the anger, the love and the joy that these characters experience and convey.  Less overt but still present are the supernatural interventions by Joseph's God, a pivitol element of the story and certainly not lost in this picture.  The production is simple yet effective; neither flashy nor flaunting, it simply tells the story of how God acted in the life of one family whose descendant would one day change the world forever.  Highly recommended and deeply moving.",5.0
"(I am actually Rich's son, Micah) I was first introduced to this video by my Greek/Hebrew professor and have been amazed by its Biblical accuracy. In uncommon fashion, it stays very close to the actual Biblical texts, without adding any sort of propoganda! At the same time, it is filmed very well and is presented in a very appealing fashion. For once, I have found a movie based on Scripture that is accurate! I would recommend it to any viewer, especially a Christian one.",5.0
"This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets! I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review.
This film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch!
Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say!
Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.
Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's ""My God, my God..."" speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.
When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.
As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.
'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.
Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5.0
"This excellent production is without doubt the  best version of the Joseph story that I've ever seen, treating fully and thoughtfully every aspect of this greatest ever ""rags to riches"" tale. It shows very clearly  why Joseph is a truly great hero figure : Firstly, he distinguished himself  by service and respect, to God, to his human master, and to his people (in  that fixed order), putting himself a poor fourth; this contrasts sharply to  many other so-called great men of history who
distinguished themselves  through conquest. Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters.
The production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the ""rape"", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.
The performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his ""body language"" often outdoes his spoken  one.
There are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of ""7 years"",  is not always the most probable one.
But overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach.",5.0
"Considering that I am not an expert on the Old Testiment, I will spare you any in depth analysis of the accuracy of this film. Suffice it to say, I found nothing contradictory to what I learned in Sunday School.
That out  of the way... This is a wonderfully entertaining film. Although I knew  exactly what was going to happen next, I discovered that I was very anxious  to actually see how the events would be played out in the film. I was  especially impressed with the character development of the brothers. Rather  than as a group being presented as a single antagonist, they were presented  as 10 distinct individuals. It was interesting to me to view their  interaction with each other. The actors who portrayed Simeon and Judah  delivered exceptionally strong performances.
Paul Mercurio was perfect as  Joseph, and I must admit, he's rather easy on the eyes (thankfully since he  spent so much of the film dressed in just that teenie tiny little towel)
Ben Kingsley and Martin Landau are both convincnig in their rolls as  Potiphar and Jacob respectively.
With its compelling story, top notch  performances, and  bits seduction, mayhem, and adventure, Joseph is sure to  entertain, if not inspire, even the most skeptical viewers.",5.0
"This movie was one of the most touching movies I have ever seen in my life. I am 39 years old and have seen alot of movies in my life. Joseph really help me understand God's love and forgiveness. Joseph was rejected  by his own family, as Jesus was rejected by his own people and mankind. As  cruel as Joseph's brother's were, Joseph still forgave them and took them  back, and saved them from dying. This kind of love is the love of Jesus has  for us, and how he still forgives us, even after we may of once rejected  him in our lives. Its a must see awesome lesson on love and forgiveness,  which we all need. If we need be saved by his precious love.",5.0

"My 4 year old loves this video. He knew 3 or 4 of the 17 songs on the video, and I was unsure how he'd take to the whole 17 song video...  Many times these videos are not produced well... But my fears were washed away after my son sat through the first viewing happily, and then wanted to watch the video AGAIN right away.  He watched it a second time (30 mins is the perfect legnth) and was content. Good choice on my part, this is a GREAT video.

It's interesting to see the kids in the video, who are all great performers, by the way... while the clothes are clearly from 1995 (i guessed 1994), the production, song choices and approach are 100% timeless. This video does not show its age. It's that good.

I recommend it for older toddlers and preschoolers...Kindergartners would also enjoy it.. ages 2 to 6 would be a perfect target audience. They are all Christian songs that Christian kids will love. Even my wife and I enjoyed the joy in the songs.

"The song selections are pretty good - they seem to stick in your head for better or worse.  Truth be told, I remember most of the songs from Sunday School and bible camp when I was a kid (e.g., This Little Light of Mine, Father Abraham, I'm in the Lord's Army, etc.) In all, it's good ""wholesome"" Christian music sung by colorful, busy kids doing busy kid stuff which captures any toddler/pre-schooler's attention.

"In most of the Jesus movies . . . Jesus seems almost untouchable or too sacred to be approached. This was so refreshing as Jesus was portrayed as the most approachable I've ever seen. Someone who was ""real"" who ""laughed"" ""cried"", got ""angry"", set an example without making others feel inferior. Doing unto others as He would have them do unto Him.

"There are many films about our Lord and Savior out there, and they usually offer something different.

The 1977 ""Jesus of Nazareth"" offers a harmonious composition of the 4 Gospels as well as educated speculation. You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.

Mr. Gibson's ""The Passion"" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)

This is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense ""The Passion.""

This film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the ""Gospel According to Luke.""  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.

Alright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.

I'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read ""Luke,"" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.

The sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in ""The Passion."" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.

Like I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,"" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.

Another thing I should point out is that ""The Passion"" is NOT child friendly. ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of ""The Passion."" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from ""Luke."" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in ""The Passion.""

Another thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written ""Good News Bible.""

I like ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""The Passion."" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.",5.0

"So often, we view Jesus as just that, a product. Rather than let his law define us and how we should live, we take our own limited and broken experience and apply it to Jesus from which we derive expectations of Him. We rail against Him when these expectations are not met, and applaud smugly when they are. What we forget is that Jesus is God, and that He has surpassed anything that we could ever expect. He is greater than our expectations. When I look at my own life, I realize that all the sadness and misery I've experienced has resulted from putting my hopes and expecations in things that are not of God. The Bible tells us that whatever does not come from God is not good, and yet I place my trust in it anyway. In my sin, I desire a quick, selfish satisfaction, and I expect that coming from things I can measure. This much money, or these many relationships, or this much time spent on mindless entertainment. Whatever entertains me for a duration of time, however superficial it may be, I'll devote myself to because it's what I arbitrarily want. But I'm never satisfied completely or without guilt after I seek to please myself and not God. What I forget is that I have a Savior who came to give life and life abundantly. What Jesus has given us goes beyond measure. All we have to do is surrender to Him. Give up our life in idolatry and sin, which only leads to death, and turn to Jesus, the light of the world and source of life abundant. I know why Jesus is Saviour, and in recognition of that, desire him to be Lord of my life. I cannot 'rate' him, because I'm not worthy but hope that he will rate me as one of His own, so that I may one day hear God say to me, ""Well done, my good and faithful servant"".
In Christ,

"The best thing about this film is the fact that it adheres to the Bible as it is written.  Hollywood took no liberties or artistic license.  You hear the Scripture exactly as it is written in the book of Luke.  The places where it was filmed are real, and the costumes and actors look authentic.
It is probably the only Bible film that doesn't take from or add to the Word of God.  Other films, like Jesus Of Nazereth; the Ten Commandments; The Nativity; the Passion of the Christ; etc.  have added to or left things out for the purpose of pushing their own agendas.  There is a strict warning in Scripture itself.

Revelation 22:19  New International Version 1984 (NIV1984)

"This is absolutely one of the very best movies ever made about the life of Christ.  Since it is almost word for word from the Bible, except for a few conversational interactions, such as greetings, etc., you can be sure it is true to God's word.  One thing I love about it is that it shows Him as a strong man (He WAS a carpenter, after all.) rather than a milk toast as He is usually depicted.  The only thing I did not like was that since they wanted to stay true to the book of John, they didn't put a crown of thorns on his head, because although Matthew, Mark, and Luke all do describe the crown, John does not.  Yet, you can't fault their resolve to be absolutely true to that account.  If you saw Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ movie, and felt the crucifiction scenes were a little too much for younger children, then this is the best choice out of all other movies made.",5.0
"Bought this video to use in church. It's an excellent and clear film of the life of Christ. Not all events are shown (ie it's not a composite of the four gospels of the Bible - only Luke). Starting to look a little dated, but it really doesn't matter. Millions have seen this film in dozen's of languages and many have decided to follow Christ because of it. highly recommended.",5.0
"Beautiful story about Jesus Christ, the best I've watched. All of the actors look so natural, the music is superb and the text is so clear. Very interesting documentary about Jesus' public life but this is a film of about only 1,5 hours. I remember that the whole TV series was about 8 hours. It would be much better to have the whole series in a box set.",5.0
"This is my favorite film on the life of Jesus.  It is based on the Gospel of Luke.  Not every event in the film is in Luke's gospel or vice versa.  But I enjoy this film nonetheless.

It is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land.  The acting is excellent.  I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that ""they are for the children"" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks ""who acted as this man's neighbor?"" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.

In the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, ""only a mite?"" ""can't she give more?"" ""it's very little.""  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent.",5.0

"This film is not Hollywood's version - it is a historically researched and biblically based film on 3 and a half years of Jesus life and ministry as found in the book of Luke.  This DVD has been updated to include 8 language tracks including Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, English, Korean, Japanese, and Portugese.  It is also updated to include Digital Dolby Surround Sound!  The DVD also includes the making of the Jesus Film in a ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary.  This is the DVD you want to watch if you want an accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus.",5.0
"The Jesus Film is truly a phenomenon and great tool for reaching many people to understand the Jesus that is described in the Gospel of Luke.  The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.

The Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.

Brian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.

Many of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).

What is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.

There are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:

Besides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.

There is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.

Even though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text. An added plus at the end of the film is a complete and clear presentation of the Gospel message.

I bought several copies of this DVD for my friends and church members and they have found it very useful.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  I highly recommend this film, along with ""The Gospel of John.""",5.0
"Though not the most current film, it's the closest to the biblical account of what transpired.",5.0
"Of course, the story of Christ is as ageless as God Himself.  This film was so well put together and released back in 1979, that it needs no update.  The movie was filmed mostly on-location for authenticity.

This DVD fits appropriately in any Christian's collection, and serves well in ministry projects as well.",5.0
"This is a good movie to share with your friends and family.  My favorite is still the Gospel of John.  With that said, this is still a good movie to get.",5.0
"If there is any Jesus movie that touches the hearts of men, this one does.  I bought three of these and play them so much, I want to make sure I have it a long time. The fact that the words are taken entirely from the Bible, and portraying the life of Jesus simply and accurately without added ""Hollywood"" glamor, tinsel and big-name movie stars distracting the meaningful intentions of this story: that of our Lord and Savior here in the flesh over 2,000 years ago.",5.0
"Awesome movie about our LORD JESUS CHRIST.

I also recommend, The Gospel of John, this too is an awesome movie, a must for your Christian movie collection.

I thank the Almighty GOD for JESUS in our life's.",5.0
"This is a great movie, I love it because I was saved about a year after recieving this movie as a gift, it helped open my eyes so that I left the LDS church, leaving the competetive race to earn my way to heaven, to find the loving father that I always wanted, and never want to leave even if I could become a ""god"" I would chose to stay with the king that died for me.",5.0
"I like this film because it is a sound scriptural based movie about the Lord Jesus.( I love all Jesus films!)  Once again the story is narrated well and the acting is a good enough to keep the viewer's attention.  This film shown in several languages actually is an outstanding learning tool for better understanding the message and mission of Jesus - and to understand His Truth can surely shape the course of your life!

amen!",5.0
"""Jesus, His Life, Mystery and Message"" is a marvelous film on the life and times of Jesus, and though in its 10 chapters it skips around a bit, and there is an occasional slip in the script, those familiar with Scripture will appreciate this ambitious project, and the content that is biblically based, as well as the visual presentation. An Italian production by the Paulines, with writer/director Alberto Castellani and cinematographer/director Giancarlo Cappellano, it takes us through the significant sites in the Holy Land, and also blends in exquisite works of art, from masters like Duccio and his contemporaries, and iconic treasures of Greek and Russian origin.

It delves into the archeological evidence of the Bible, including the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the many miracles of Jesus, His life as an observant Jew, historical perspectives, and much more. The mixture of music used is also good, and ranges from dramatic melodies to beautiful cantorial singing. This is a 2-sided DVD, with 5 chapters on each side, and is playable in either English or Spanish, and the Spanish narration overall has a better audio quality. It must be noted that the film does not have a Hollywood multi-million $ look, as the color reproduction in the art work is a little off at times, and it is slightly grainy, but not bothersome at all, as the content overrides its flaws. Informative, wonderfully photographed, and occasionally quite moving, this is an excellent addition to anyone's library of Christian films, and will be of interest to those of any faith who wish to learn more about Jesus, and the historical roots of Christianity. I give it 5 stars for making the most of a low budget production. Total running time is 160 minutes.",5.0
"I they were selling this movie at my church when a special guest came one Sunday. I bought this movie and I have to agree that this is the best movie I have ever seen on the life, death and resurrection of my Lord Jesus Christ. I haven't seen ""the Passion"" yet, I plan to very soon and I have high hopes for the film, but this one is equally as good.

Very well done film that was done with great care, excellent movie I recommmend everyone see",5.0
"Taking five years to research and produce, this 1979 film is meticulous in its recreation of the time of Jesus. It uses over 200 locations in the Holy Land, many actors from the region, and is based on portions of the Gospel of Luke.
This is the film used by over 1,500 denominations and missions to evangelize, and it has been translated into 877 languages and shown to over five billion people in 228 countries, and is an excellent ""tool"" for this purpose, because it is simple and at the same time very powerful and moving.

British actor Brian Deacon is a wonderful Jesus, with a soft but manly voice and perfect enunciation, making the words of Jesus come to life in a very special way.
Others of note are Niko Nitai as Simon Peter, Rivka Neuman as Mary, Talia Shapira as Mary Magdalene, and the part of John the Baptist (played by Eli Cohen) is short, but physically the closest I have seen on film to what I imagine the real John looked like.
Richard Kiley narrates as Luke, and also listed as narrator is Alexander Scourby.
Directed by John Kirsh and Peter Sykes, it has some terrific passages; one of my favorites is the storm at sea (Luke 8:22-25), which is very effective, and the cinematography by Mike Reed, and the locations, a pleasure to watch.

The film ends with an invitation to salvation, and with it the promise of ""a full, abundant life, filled with purpose and meaning"", and with a quote from Revelation 3:20: ""Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him"".
Total running time is 83 minutes.",5.0
"To claim that Jesus Christ did not even exist is mere ignorance. Such preposterous claims belie a desire for some illusion of moral or intellectual superiority. The argument is nothing but a straw man easily knocked down. There is plenty of historical and archaeological evidence to support the FACT that Jesus Christ did in fact exist. The Jesus movie is a good introduction to his life and teachings but by no means comprehensive (for that you need the Bible).
If you're sincere in your search for the Truth, I highly recommend reading Josh McDowell's book, More Than a Carpenter, as an easy first read. Available at Amazon.com, of course.
It's reasonable to question Jesus' deity if you've only heard the name and never seriously investigated His life. Those who have, including the hard-nosed skeptics who set out to debunk this thing called Christianity, often become Christians themselves. Those who don't generally do so out of mere pride -- an unwillingness to sacrifice their old, comfortable beliefs that allow them to live an ungodly lifestyle. But you reject Jesus at your own peril. It's the very height of folly.
As for my opinion of the Jesus the movie? Why not judge for yourself! You can watch the entire movie streamed online at jesusfilm.org in any of 62 languages (of the 858 it's been translated into)! Then you can decide whether or not to purchase the DVD.
I do recommend this film. I also recommend, highly, 2003's The Gospel of John. It is extremely faithful to the New Testament book of John and really brings life and a better understanding to the life, times, and teachings of Jesus Christ, God in the flesh.
I wish you well and pray that God may draw you to Him (that you may be receptive to His call). Perhaps I'll see you in heaven someday. If you have honest seeking questions, you're welcome to e-mail me at robvh at wellness5.com.",5.0
"Filmed entirely on location in Israel with a largely Jewish cast, the film achieves authenticity that will be difficult for future filmmakers to duplicate. 25 years from now ""Jesus"" will still be a standard by which other films about the carpenter turned rabbi must be judged.
While films like ""The Passion of the Christ"" present more emotion and Hollywood glitz, ""Jesus"" is painstaking in its accuracy. The complete life story is presented based on the biography compiled 2,000 years ago by a doctor named Luke. The film is a plain and simple docudrama that many families make a tradition of viewing every Christmas and Easter. The fact that the film is available in the local language of over 90% of the earth's population says a lot about the film's lasting appeal and prominent place in cinematic history.",5.0
"It is impossible to overestimate the important of this 1979 film, for it has made an impact in even the most primitive regions of the earth, places where men and women are only now hearing about Jesus for the first time.  This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.
The movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.
The suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.  Even non-Christians will be impressed by the commitment, scrupulous attention to detail, and cinematic mastery that went into the making of this film.",5.0
"This movie has been around since 1979, but still is the best movie made on the life of Christ.  It has been translated to more languages than any other movie in history and has changed thousands of lifes through the powerfull message it delivers. I recommed it to everyone, any age, any background. Three thumbs up!",5.0
"This is an evangilistic movie shown around the world (the DVD has a choice of about 8 languages) of the highlights of the ministry of Jesus, according to the gospel of Luke.  It is a very well produced and acted documentary, bringing dramatic visual imagery to biblical scripture.  Intended to introduce people of all nations to Jesus, is should also appeal to those Christians who appreciate adding another dimension to their biblical experience.  This is a 2 DVD set, with the second DVD geared for children.",5.0
"This is the best and most true movie of anything Biblical that I have seen. And this too is a great fact that attests to the power of the movie: ""No other film has been seen by more than one billion people, translated into more than 425 languages and shown in more than 225 countries.  It is one of the best movies I have ever seen and wonderfully created and acted. If God wasn't in the center of the making of this movie then I don't know who was!",5.0

"As a child, I couldn't get enough of this classic.  I've always loved the ""stop motion"" Christmas videos, with ""The Little Drummer Boy"" and ""Rudolph"" coming in at 2nd and 3rd place.  Yes,  it's very dated, complete with far-out animated flowers flying around as  ""Miss Jessica"" sings her song--but I loved every minute of it as  a young girl.  And Fred Astaire--my favorite all-around performer.  In a  world of saturated ugliness, I prefer innocence and naivete, which can only  be found in and of one's childhood, even if it's only make-believe.

"""Santa Claus is Coming to Town""  is a 1970 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions. The film stars Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.

This special is a classic.  Some images have now been cut because of various stupid reasons.

This is still a cartoon that everyone will enjoy.  If you have not seen it in years you should.

"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better, more authentic, and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials, which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway, everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a ""prequel"" of sorts, telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle, the dungeon, and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.

I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today.",5.0
"Wow, this Christmas classic answers all of the little ones' inevitable questions about the origin of Santa, the use of stockings, the use of a chimney, how reindeer fly, etc. In the middle of the main story is a villain, the Warlock, who is transformed from an evil figure to a good one as a result of Santa giving him a toy. Meanwhile, the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys, much to the chagrin of Jessica, who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always, the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case, it's good defeating evil, goodwill and love over hate and persecution. The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, who does a fine job. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town stands as one of the true classics, and belongs in everyone's animated Chrustmas collection.",5.0
"I bought this for my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter. She's just beginning to understand Santa, a little, so I thought this movie would help her and she loves movies. I bought this on VHS for my daughter when she was little and also bought her the DVD when it cam out. She's 25, I'm 57 and we both love this movie. Its a Christmas tradition.",5.0
"The film has it's own value, but some people underestimate the work by the team that made all of these films, todays CGI animation is great but the quality of such recent CGI hits in theatres wouldn't be there if this team never existed. The blazed the trail the same way Lewis and Clark blazed the trail across the united states and the work in all these films proves it because of how the stand the test of time. Besides, the cast of these films in beyond stellar they are legendary. Not ""THE CHAIRMAN OF TTHE BOARD"" was in one along with other ledgends and if it's good for ""THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD"" it perfect for my household.",5.0

"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall, despite,some silly moments & plot holes,it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10.",5.0

"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town came to ABC first in 1970, when Rankin/Bass was firing on all cylinders. The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation ""on two's and three's"" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.

When I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, ""Be Prepared to Pay"" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).

Santa Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.

In this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says ""It's not even safe here,"" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.

Okay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray. For more about Rankin/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.

NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.",5.0

"Whats good about alot of these Christmas DVD's that have come out in the last few years is that they present the specials in their original form. One hour TV specials from the sixties and seventies have gone through some edits over the years, most notably the Rankin Bass specials, such as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and this: Santa Claus is Comin To Town.

I watched this one on TV the other night with my kid. He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.

But there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.

It is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.

But thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials. I'm a kid of the eighties. I have no real recollection of what the sixties/seventies were all about but I like the style. For you peeps out there that do remember, you should appreciate the uncut renditions of these specials found on DVD. It is the only way to ensure that your kids, and your kids kids, never forget just how flipping strange you people were in the seventies. Thank you. Much love and Merry Christmas. Now put that foot in front of the other and get this thing...",5.0
"Once you get past the usual Christmas movie-viewing to-dos...Frosty...Grinch...Rudolph...Charlie Brown...you MUST check out this movie!  Classic cast!  Fred Astaire!  Mickey Rooney!  Keenan Wynn!

For years the name Burgermeister Meisterburger has rolled off my lips, and this year I finally bought the movie to show to my kids, which they loved.

Add this to your collection, you won't regret it!",5.0
"Sometimes you get sentimental and it always seems to be around Christmas time in my case. I hadn't seen Santa Claus is coming to Town for over twenty years so I checked it out the other day. Amazingly it still holds up which is mostly due to the gravitas voices of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney. What's kind of funny is that all the songs came back to me while I was watching them. The melodies have gone through my head from time to time and I had forgotten where I first heard them. This cartoon special explains the Kris Kringle legend in great detail, but the purity of the characters is what makes it so endearing. Yeah, ""changing from bad to good is as easy as putting one foot in front of the other"" is kind of silly but suspend your disbelief and enjoy this feel good hour of old school television. A film like this would never be made in the contemporary USA as you're not aloud to refer to Christmas as ""the holiest night of the year"" on a television network.",5.0

"I understand and relate to the people who complain about the Mariah Carey ""extra"" with this video. Yes, it stinks, and they should release these old shows as they were intended to be seen WITHOUT the modern ""extras"". But, in my version it is a separate disk, and I just tossed the thing in the trash. As far as I can tell, otherwise, this is the original version I saw as a child. Of course, by the late 70s, I'm sure my version was chopped up for commercial television. Anyway, I think the video is fine, and you don't HAVE to watch the disk with Mariah Carey's song. Use it as a coaster, or toss it in the trash, or let your 2-year-old write on it with permanent marker. Its a good show for this time of year, and I'm glad I bought it.",5.0
"With such big names as Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire donnating their vocal talents, this 1970 stop-animation Rankin-Bass special attempted to explain how Santa Claus came into being.  It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.

Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.

Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!

Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.

Whether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed. This remains one of the more original holiday specials.",5.0
"THE STORY: Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. ""Where did Santa's suit come from?"", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.

BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion ""Animagic"" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.

This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as ""One Foot in Front of the Other"". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.

There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend.",5.0

Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.

BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion ""Animagic"" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.

This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as ""One Foot in Front of the Other"". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.

There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend.",5.0
"THE STORY:  Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. ""Where did Santa's suit come from?"", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys.  Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers.

"It is rather ironic to think that the elfin Mickey Rooney would provide one of the best voices for Santa Claus ever in this 1970 stop-motion animated Christmas classic, but that is exactly what we have here. ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" tells the story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus. It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.

Produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic ""Santa Claus is Comin' To Town."" These include ""First Toymaker To the King,"" ""Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),"" ""Put One Foot in Front of the Other,"" ""My World is Beginning Today,"" and ""What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol)."" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.

The story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin). The Island of Misfit Toys makes the other one the more beloved Holiday classic, but this one is a close second, and Jessica is the cutest future Mrs. Claus of all-time.",5.0
Excellent film for those that love classic Christmas stories. Buy it now. That's an order.,5.0
"They just don't make Christmas special like these anymore.  There was a whole group of ones like this by ""Rankin & Bass""..If you see these names, you know you have found a gem of a Christmas animated special.  They also don't air these on t.v. like they used to.  This showed up on ABC Family network on Satellite t.v. the other night, and I got the chance to see it for the first time in ages.
It is based on the questions the children ask about how Santa came to be.  The music is rather catchy, I still remember the words to ""Put one foot in front of the other"".  This isn't as good as ""The Year without a Santa Claus"" but it comes in for a close second.  It is worth buying if you like this kind of animation.  (Stop motion, claymation mixed)..sort of like Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. but older looking. You'll have fun watching this one, and will watch it alot..",5.0
"....like a hot cocoa with a shot of peppermint schnapps!
This is my favorite of all the Rankin/Bass specials (and they are all excellent). Many people get all the ""Animagic"" cartoons confused...so I'll try to pinpoint this one. This is not the one with Rudolph (""...the Red-Nosed Reindeer"") and not the one with the Heat Miser and Snow Miser (""Year Without A Santa Claus""). This is the one with the toy-hating Burgermeister Meisterburger and.....the Winter Warlock!!
We get to see Santa Claus go from an orphaned baby raised by elves to a groovy, hip young adult who's outlawed for delivering toys to finally becoming the toy making/giving king of Christmas! We also get to see Mrs Claus as a groovilicious babe in her own right and she finally gets a name, Jessica.
Some charmingly dated scenes only add to the warm innocence of this show: like when Jessica realizes ""her own town has turned against her"" and begins singing of her love for and desire to be with Kris Kringle....transcending into a cornucopia of hippy-trippy flowers, swirls and polka-dots and finally catching a glimpse of her paper cutout reflection in the water fountain in the center of town. Remarkable!!
But, the show's main message is one of love and the courage to follow your heart and do what you know is right regardless of the obstacles that come in your way - so take that!....Burgermeister and Winter Warlock! Some touching moments, like when Kris and Jessica are married in the forest because no town would have them and one of the final scenes where we are shown the contrast of those who have no holiday spirit to Santa Claus, who gives of himself each year, are real tear-jerkers.
A wonderful Christmas special that no holiday season is complete without.",5.0
"I will be 33 in January 2002. I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.
SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.
This was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.
I suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while. Even though I now own the vhs of SCICTT and soon will purchase the DVD I make myself and my kids wait until Christmas season to watch it. It's not quite the same as when I was a kid but anticipation still increases the viewing pleasure once we do watch it.",5.0
"First, let's clear up one fact, this is NOT Claymation. It is STOP MOTION animation. Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.
This fact aside, ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.
All the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.
The songs are excellent, from the familiar ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town"" to the lovely ""My World Is Beginning Today"" sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)
The script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.
This has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show. So, do I recommend it, the answer is a resounding YES!!!!!",5.0
"Even though this one isn't as popular as Frosty, Rudolph, and the Grinch, it's just as magical. I did not know it even exsisted until I was 9 years old, and I LOVED IT! I was introduced to this one fairly late in my child  hood, but it still holds a special place in my heart right next to Frosty  and Rudolph. This is the one with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger, who  ""HATES TOYS!"". I love this character MORE THAN the Grinch! This  one also includes the Winter Warlock and Special Delivery Klugger, as well  as a not so cocky (for a change) Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle. This film  is a true Holiday classic that keep Christ in Christmas. There are MANY  religious undertones in this film (just look at the Winter Warlock  Character and watch his development from bad to good.) This is yet another  materpiece by Romeo Muller, the GREATEST author who EVER lived! The man  REALLY understood children. Some people say that this film is a bit dated,  but I would have to disagree. I was born in 1980, and missed the 70's and  it never seemed like it was out of place to me (It was 1989 when I first  saw it.) It will fit right in with all of the other Holiday films your  children watch. No Holiday video collection is complete without this Gem.  The songs are GREAT, the plot is EXCELLENT, and the characters are  OUTSTANDING! You can't go wrong with this one! Your children will enjoy it  and you will too, garenteed!",5.0
"Those of us born in the 60s grew up on these clay animations. Technically, they don't hold a candle to the computer-animated wizardry of the 90s, but who cares.

"This is an exceptional series.  Kudos to Zondervan and Matt Williams.

We selected this series for our new small group.  My wife and I have been involved in multiple small groups for the past thirty years.  I have often found small group material shallow and unchallenging.  Everyone in our group finds this series exceptional on multiple levels.  First, the quality of the material is superb because each lesson is taught by seminary professor who is speaking in his area of expertise.  Second, the format of splitting each video lesson into three parts is very effective.  I was weary of this before we started, wondering how it would logistically work in the group, and how the whole thing would flow.  However, we have found that it works very well, allowing you to discuss the points of each sub-teaching before going on to the next section that builds upon the prior one: Historical context, deeper dive into the meaning, and application.  You just have to be disciplined to keep on schedule.  Third, the personal application (focus of the third video section) and the attending questions are focused, deep, and easily personalized.  Fourth, I have found powerful little nuggets of truth in text boxes inserted in the study guide of each lesson.

We relocated to South Carolina in May 2012 and we're new to the church we're attending.  I have to say, this new small group is the deepest, most mature small group we have ever been a part of as a couple.  Although our group is very mature, I don't at all think this material is only suitable for more mature, deeply committed followers of Jesus.  Its value is not that it is intellectually deep and challenging, but rather that its deep insights are so well developed, well presented, and easily understood.  I think this material will be equally beneficial to anyone willing to sit and participate - from questioning seekers to mature followers of Jesus.

To A.I. who tossed out the entire series based on dislike for the directors decision to have the speakers not look into the camera as they presented: an epic tossing of the baby with the bath water.

Our group has decided to continue with the Deeper Connection series after this one.",5.0
"I haven't watched this DVD but have been checking them out for potential purchase.

Also, I cant find in any of the reviews the length of time in minutes of the videos; the Zondervan website says: three hours of teaching per DVD by Bible professors who know how to communicate the world of the biblical text to today's world. I hope this helps someone.",5.0

"I purchased the whole ""Deeper Connection"" series DVD and supporting books for a small non-denominational church's bible-study.  We have only one bible study for all ages.  We viewed the DVD lessons and then I used the book to facilitate discussions.  I found many of the insights presented in the series deepening my faith and I could see it benefiting the others in this group.  This is excellent in the way it presents information, the quality of the information, and for the most part it does not contradict any particular denomination's faith.  It stays with the fundamental truths that are the Christian truths.

I highly recommend all the DVDs in this series for group and even individual study.  I would buy more if Matt Williams would continue to make more in this series.",5.0

"The three-volume Deeper Connections series produced by Zondervan is unique. Unlike any other Bible study available, this visually stunning DVD series is taught and written by biblical experts - six professors with specialized areas of knowledge. The three volumes in this study series are :

1.  The Parables of Jesus
2.  The Prayers of Jesus
3.  Miracles of Jesus

The Teachers featured on the series are : Dr. Gary Burge, Wheaton College; Dr. David Garland, Truett Theological Seminary; Dr. Mark Strauss, Bethel Seminary; Dr. Michael Wilkins, Talbot School of Theology; Dr. Matt Williams, Biola University; Dr. Ben Witherington III, Asbury Theological Seminary.

Hosted by Jarrett Stevens and filmed in locations as diverse as Gloucester harbor, the Holy Land, Boston's Old North Church, and Chicago's lakefront, each volume consists of six fascinating sessions. Each session is taught by a different instructor and consists of three components:

1. Historical and cultural background
2. An engaging, close look at the biblical text and its meaning
3. Accurate, encouraging, and challenging applications of the Bible's message to life today

Each volume is accompanied by a Participant Guide which is available separately allowing participants to make deeper connections with a knowledge of historical background of the Bible, biblical text, and real life applications.

'The Parables of Jesus: Six In-depth Studies Connecting the Bible to Life' is one of the volumes of the Deeper Connections series focusing on parables of Jesus. Jesus communicated deep spiritual truths through simple, vivid, and engaging stories. Woven from the stuff of everyday life, the parables of Jesus made the kingdom of God understandable and accessible to his listeners. The study helps you gain new insights into his parables and their meanings that will help you to appreciate more fully their relevance for your own life.

Six Sessions included on this DVD are:

The Coming of the Kingdom
The Grace of the Kingdom
The God of the Kingdom
The Demand of the Kingdom
The Mission of the Kingdom
The Fulfillment of the Kingdom

Highly recommended for all students of the bible!",5.0
"I am glad I happened to come across IA's review shortly after it was posted.  IA's review is not only unacceptable but incomplete.  If you're looking for one opinion about the dvd format and production, he/she may be of help.  However, he/she even states ""I am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it"" which implies that the review has nothing to do with the (outstanding) teaching but his/her opinions of camera angles and eye contact.  Allow me to briefly introduce you to the actual content - the main reason why people buy Bible studies like Deeper Connections.

Unlike IA's experience, my small group and I thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from this Bible study.  The guide (or presenter) is actually over in Israel as he introduces each teaching, thus helping bring the text and teachings to life.  Simply getting a glimpse of where Jesus walked, taught, etc. helped me to connect to the text in new ways.  Moreover, his presentations were not cheesy, but informative and natural.

IA may not like the lack of eye contact, but we personally thought it was insightful (plus, why give a 1/5 stars for something like that?). It felt more like the teacher was part of the small group instead of having someone talk 'at' me.  The difference with eye contact was noticeable at first, but my small group quickly and easily adjusted and it never became a problem.  Please do not write-off this Bible study series based on a poor review.  You will be missing out on quality teaching from these six professors who have a pastoral heart and a gift to communicate God's Word to His people.  Zondervan has done an excellent job (also, the Participant Guide is excellent as well).",5.0

"I (along with my entire family) am a huge Drive Thru History fan. When I heard that the first two volumes in the new Holy Land Series were released on DVD, I immediately knew I had to go shopping! :)

Dave Stotts, the host of Drive Thru History again brings viewers into the world of fascinating history in Volume 1: Egypt to Qumran - Covenants, Kings, and the Promised Land; and in Volume 2: Jericho to Megiddo - Conquest, Canaanites, and the Holy City. Each volume contains three episodes for a total of 85-90 minutes.

Typical of Dave Stotts, he brings history to life with his intriguing historical facts and well-done visual effects. And let's not forget his quirky humor! This time he drives through Israel in a Fiat, traveling the roads to the places of Jerusalem, Masada, Samaria, Shiloh, and Beersheeba, just to name a few.

As I watched these movies, I had several ""ah hah"" moments, as I connected the words of the Bible with the places Dave visited. I was able to put a visual with the accounts in the Bible, including the place where David slayed Goliath and the place where Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well. The archeological evidence is astounding! My favorite part was seeing the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and then finding out a bit about the men who discovered the amazing scrolls while herding sheep.

Perfect for families, homeschoolers, youth groups, and anyone who loves history, especially Biblical and ancient history, these newest volumes of Drive Thru History are a must have for any DVD library. There is nothing objectionable in either volume, although young children may not yet be interested. Also, the brief information about David slaying Goliath may scare very young viewers if they are not familiar with the account.

I highly recommend these latest volumes in the Drive Thru History saga and have added it to my listing of mom-approved movies for families on my wordpress blog.

"John Ortberg is one of my ""go to"" guys. I buy his books as soon as they are published, and am seldom disappointed by what they have to say. I had no idea this book would be wrapped around John's relationship with Dallas Willard, another great Christian thinker and writer. I am about half way through this exploration of the Soul, and I have to say that in a world full of Christian bestsellers filled with shallow ideas and superficial teaching, this is a drink of cold water for my own soul. I am so grateful for someone who defines Christian faith and ministry less in terms of bigger and wider, and more in terms of deeper. This is a book much needed in our wold today",5.0
"This is John Ortberg's tribute to his friend and mentor Dallas Willard.  As usual, contemporary anecdotes and scholars paired with the wisdom of past saints.  Best understood by the study facilitator in conjunction with the book.  Ortberg communicates with a rare mix of wisdom and humor.  You will laugh out loud, and also be touched deeply.  I bought the DVD alone before the curriculum kit was available and bought the book and study guide on Kindle.  The study guide is also good.  I have since purchased a hard cover book to keep and several to give as gifts.  All the Willard/Ortberg material is enlightening and moving, but to see John Ortberg describe the mentoring role Dallas Willard played in his life at critical times of despair and questioning will be an encouragement to anyone.  This is being presented in a Sunday School class with a 45 minute window of time.  It can be done, but it begs for more of an opportunity for discussions.

Excellent DVD to help with personal study after reading the book,5.0
This DVD was perfect. It really does a wonderful job getting to the why's of not allowing ugly things into our spirit. We are fragile and complex at the same time. We should allow only good and positive thoughts in our minds. I am going to purchase many more of these for gifts. This DVD helps to learn how to practice protecting innocence.,5.0

I don't know what it is about this movie but my kids love it so much. We had to buy the dvd for our minivan. It came quick and does the job I need (keeping kids quiet for a short time).,5.0
"According to my kid, this is the greatest Christmas movie of all time. She hasn't actually said that, but she's watched this on Amazon Prime enough that I think they finally removed it as she was using too much network bandwidth. I've never made it all the way through the movie, but I have one of the songs from it forever embedded in my brain. Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina. Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina. Tina - the Talking Tabby! Please make it stop.

Joking aside. The a main theme of the story is discussing the Christmas traditions of various cultures. While normally these story lines attempt to ruin any sort of holiday magic you might be into, all were covered in a very kid-friendly way that won't ruin things for your child.",5.0
Great movie!,5.0
"I watched this movie growing up, so it is almost like a classic to me. It arrived in perfect condition!",5.0
"I used to watch this movie on the tv when I was a child (I am 24 now) and I still watch it. It's by far the best show I saw as a child. It would come on every Christmas at 7 am when I was a child on pbs.  It's doesn't come on now or for the last decade or so. And it's been such a bummer. I used to never received any gifts for Christmas because my parents could never afford anything. I didn't realized this as a child, but I know now.  And what made it better was this coming on and watching it Christmas, year after year of no gifts, this movie that came on at 7 am would be the only thing consistent that would be around on Christmas. So I just though I was a bad kids growing up, but watching this movie made me feel better. It's was literally my childhood and when it stop coming on, it broke my heart. Now that I am older, I can afford things for my family, nieces, and nephews. And I saw today that it was on prime. I literally cried while I put it on for them. This movie makes my heart melt.",5.0

"Fun movie.  I'm not a very PC type of person but I do like how it explains some of the different holidays like Chanukah and Kwanzaa. They definitely acknowledge Christmas as well. People that have issues with this movie and give it low ratings are way too sensitive and need to lighten up a bit. There's some great humor in it. A good family watch. I added it to my massive Christmas DVD collection and is on my""must watch"" list during the season.",5.0

Christmas surprise for my older kids who watched the original on PBS all those years ago . . . And it was a hit now just as it was then.

"This is one of my favorite holiday shows. I had only seen it before during a PBS telethon, so it was interrupted a lot. The DVD was lovely with no interruptions. The picture quality and audio is great. The story shows the people of Elwood City all celebrating the holidays in different ways, and how all of them are important. For Arthur fans, there's D.W. hi-jinks, funny friend interactions, and cute musical numbers. But I think even people who aren't familiar with the characters would enjoy it. It's for everyone to enjoy, be they aardvark, rabbit, or human.",5.0

"Watched this with my 7 year old and 3 year old. It had moments that were specially made for all different ages, so my husband and I enjoyed it just as much as my 7 year old and my 3 year old.

The length is just right.",5.0

My daughters grew up on Arthur the PBS TV show. Arthur's Perfect Christmas is one of their favorite Christmas movies. This was the first Christmas my daughters could not find it playing on TV. It became obvious that it was time to purchase a copy so they will never spend a Christmas without it. I purchased a copy for each of them so they can enjoy it forever or as long as DVDs still exist.,5.0
"My 18 month old loves to watch Arthur on PBS, so this was a lot of fun for herand me!",5.0

"A more wonderful Christmas experience can't be had.  Arthur touches the heart as few ever do, and this is one of those shows that is enjoyable for children of all ages.  This is, I believe, the original Arthur cast, and this is voice-acted and drawn beautifully.  Arthur's Perfect Christmas is perfect Christmas family viewing...",5.0
Loved this movie to show children that not everyone celebrates Christmas. There are other celebrations all around the world and in our own neighborhoods.,5.0
""" ARTHUR'S PERFECT CHRISTMAS"" is worth 5 stars for anyone young or old that loves the antics of the Read family. DW is just a character and what 5 year old isn't. And of course Arthuir as a BIG brother is no different than real life. What older sibling wants their younger sibling following them around, in their room, or just plain bugging them.. This DVD was great fun for Grandma and the Grand kids. Grandma watched it more than once!",5.0
This is always a family favorite for us. We love watching Arthur's Christmas each holiday season. I recommend it for any age!,5.0
"Arthur's Perfect Christmas has become our favorite holiday movie.  The movie is warm and endearing.  It blends various themes of giving, caring, family, friendship and belief with humor and innocence. Adults will enjoy the movie as much as younger children.  It carefully handles the issue of whether Santa is real - DW is convinced that Santa is real and asks Arthur to write a letter to Santa for her, while her mother struggles to find Tina the Talking Tabbie - the gift she has asked Santa to bring.",5.0
"I absolutely love this movie. As a kid, I watched Arthur, but I still watch this multiple times every year. I've always loved it because not only is it very fun, it teaches kids tolerance and helps them understand other faiths and situations. It goes beneath the commercialized coating of Christmas these days and shows that the holidays are about family, in whichever way you celebrate them. Even if I have to keep an archaic dvd player, I want to keep this and watch it with my kids. Even though they can't pronounce lutefisk correctly, I can't stress enough how wonderful, happy, and classic this shows is for me.",5.0
Love this movie.  We watched it for the first time on PBS years ago when my teenage daughter was little!  So happy I found it on DVD!,5.0

My 5 year old loved this book. She thought it was funny and entertaining. She says that she can read it all the time.,5.0
"This annual movie on PBS is a favorite of mine, and now my daughters have taken a shine to it as well. Arthur and some of his friends are struggling to meet the cultural ideal of a ""perfect Christmas."" In the process, they learn that the best holidays are personal, and meaningful precisely because of those heartfelt aspects that cannot be purchased in a store or gleaned from advertisements. This is also the rare holiday movie that acknowledges those people who may not celebrate Christmas. It's a heartwarming experience for any viewer, and makes this father's eyes misty every year.",5.0
"I've always liked the Arthur episodes on PBS and watched them with all the kids. So, to have a movie with Arthur and the gang was a pleasure! Christmas is a time for family, joy and sometimes a helping hand to makes things even better. This movie is one of those. Great for kids of all ages.",5.0
It is a good example of how children can get along. Cleverly written and emphasizing the right things. Good for ages 2 and up. We listen to the CD of the music around Christmas when we get tired of elevator Christmas music.,5.0
"My son loves Arthur, and can't get enough of this Christmas episode! It is a nice one to watch together as a family, and it is a shorter film, so my son maintains interest.",5.0
My five year old grandson absolutely loved it. He actually watched it 3 times and then still wants to watch it again.,5.0
My kids still watch it over and over again even though it is not winter anymore.... fun for all ages,5.0

"My sister couldn't have been happier to receive it.  We watch it every year on Christmas Eve.  Absolutely no problems with the tape itself and the box was in great shape too.  I was worried it wouldn't get to me in time, but it came very quickly.  Great seller, I'm very thankful",5.0
"I've grown up watching the show Arthur and have always loved the show. And I have always loved this Christmas movie. I searched and searched last year for this DVD but couldn't find a good deal on it. I am so happy they finally put it on DVD! I'm 22 years old and I STILL love watching this movie every Christmas. If you grew up watching Arthur, you'll like Arthur's Perfect Christmas :)",5.0
"Timeless classic. Superb Arthur video, perfect for everyone.  We all love it and know the songs.  Wouldn't be a merry Christmas without it.",5.0
"My family and I love this Holiday special.  In fact, we think it is one of the best we have ever seen.  We look forward to seeing it every year on PBS and decided that we should have our own copy. Why do we love Arthur's Perfect Christmas?  Well, it is family friendly, entertaining AND educational.  They discuss Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, St. Lucia Day and a non-religious celebration all wrapped up with an interesting story (and a lesson or two) about friendship, family and the true spirit of the holiday season-regardless of your religion. Definitely a classic in the making-a must see!",5.0
Arthur's Perfect Christmas is a great movie that my little sister and I started watching when we where 10 and 12 and now we are 22 and 24 we still watch it every Christmas morning right when we get up! Its a great movie and its fun to watch!,5.0
"This is such a great family movie.  Reminds me of when my sons where very young.  And now, even though they  are entering their teen years, they were still enthralled.  There's just something comforting about an old family favorite.",5.0
"Our family watches this every year at Christmastime.  It's a great little story...Arthur has to rethink what it means to have A PERFECT CHRISTMAS when things don't go as planned.  Helps kids understand that it's good to be resilient.  Also, it reveals what truly is most important.  I like the Arthur series, because the characters are all so believable...they all have their struggles and strengths.  Just like us!",5.0
"By far this is my kids' favorite Christmas movie. At first when they were really young I worried about the obvious dilemna the mother had about not finding the Hot Toy that year, giving away the secret to Christmas ""magic"".  But they never made the connection.  Every year since, they have asked to watch this movie on the way back from Grandma and Grandpa's house in the car on Christmas Eve. This year, we can't find the DVD in our Christmas bins! I'm so relieved to find it here on Amazon because it's pretty old (not sure why to says it was released this year, it's at least 10 years old). My kids are now 11 and 13 and still say it's their favorite. I'm buying another one. It's a very sweet movie.",5.0
My 7 year old and 3 year old enjoyed the movie. Both were engaged in watching the show. They liked the songs.,5.0

"Arthur's Perfect Christmas is a tradition in our family.  It used to be shown on PBS Kids every year and so we got the CD so we could sing the songs in the car.  Then they stopped showing it and it wasn't available on Netflix so I bought the DVD.  My 16 year old son who grew up with Arthur was so happy to share the movie with his 8 year old sister who hasn't seen it since she was very little.  Francine sings a Hanukkah song and The Brain a Kwanzaa song and there is just so much holiday fun - this will very quickly become a favorite in your house, as well!!",5.0
"I already knew what I was getting when I ordered this; I've seen the televised special about a dozen times.  Our local PBS station has not been broadcasting it recently, so when I saw it was coming to DVD (and at a great price)I just grabbed it.  This disc is pretty bare-bones, but I wasn't getting it for behind-the-scenes information or a lofty commentary.  I just wanted to see Arthur and his friends.  This does the trick.

The special is an hour instead of the series' usual half-hour.  The extra time is nicely used to show the different ways that Arthur's friends celebrate the holidays.  We learn that the Brain and his family celebrate Kwanzaa, that Francine and the rest of the Frenskys go to the movies on Christmas, and that Muffy is too oblivious to realize that her insistence on Christmas parties and trappings is offensive to her friend Francine.  We see Buster and his mother, and a sweet, sweet depiction of how Binky Barnes spends his Christmas.  DW and her lust for this year's Christmas ""it"" and Arthur's wish to give his mother the perfect present are the components of the A story.

Sweet, gentle, appealing to both children and adults, ""Arthur's Perfect Christmas"" is a treasured addition to our holiday movie/special stash.",5.0
This is one of the best children's videos to introduce other holidays and traditions in addition to Christmas. So glad I bought it.,5.0
My family loves this movie.  We've watched it ever since it came out.  My 4 boys are now ages 13-20 and on Christmas eve we all watched it together...and sang along to all the songs. I love how all the different holidays and traditions are represented and there are no apologies made for any of them. I think it will be our new family tradition!,5.0

"I personally like this show because it shows a brief glimpse of the Swedish holiday St. Lucia Day celebrated by George's family.  (Oddly enough St. Lucia's story originates in Italy, but is not celebrated there.  Even swedes have no idea why we celebrate it  . . . I guess because it is so dark in the winter there.)  Also, the Brain's family celebrates Kwanza, an african american holiday created in the 1960's, I believe.",5.0
"this is a complex but fun look at the holidays- ALL the holidays, in the modern spirit, while holding to tradition. there is silliness and education. there is much for kids to learn in this movie, and much to ponder.
there is patronage paid to all the celebrations, without being just PC about it.
There is the christian sacred and historical element at the same time.

there are disappointments and expectations.

and there is rain.

there is growing up to be done at christmas.

and perfection is found in the imperfect.
(which sounds like true christmas to me!)

ps: this is also like an hour long, so there is LOTS of info and songs and junk in it! this is a treat for any Arthur episode, which are usually only 12 min.",5.0

"My 4-year-old daughter LOVES this DVD. It is a perfect movie for the holidays. A nice message, catchy tunes - WE LOVE IT!",5.0
"If you're familiar with the Arthur program airing on PBS, you already know just how clever this show can be. Created by Marc Brown and based on his books, Arthur Read is an aardvark who shares adventures (and misadventures!) with friends like Buster Baxter (a rabbit), Francine Frensky (a monkey), Binky Barnes (a bulldog), Muffy Crosswire (a very RICH monkey), and others. Arthur is often at odds with his little sister D.W. (Dora Winifred) which makes for much of the shows comedic moments.

In Arthur's Perfect Christmas, the scene begins with Arthur sitting at the piano, softly playing Pachebel's Canon. This movie, like the TV show, uses day-dream sequences--and Arthur plunges into a snazzy song called ""Perfect Christmas"". You see, this holiday, Aruthur wants it to be absolutely PERFECT...but things go wrong in the town of Elwood City, for both Arthur AND his friends!

For example, Muffy expects Francine to attend her big Christmas party, but Francine has told Muffy REPEATEDLY that her family is having a Hannukah gathering the same night. What happens when Francine doesn't show up for the party to receive her present?

Buster Baxter worries about his Mom who seems to obsess over having a perfect Christmas for her son, especially since the divorce. Buster comes up with ""Baxter Day"" which takes the pressure of his Mom and displays the true meaning of the holidays--love and kindness.

Arthur searches the mall for presents for his parents, D.W. is desperate for a Tina the Talking Tabby (whose theme song haunts Arthur everywhere he goes!), Uncle Fred makes an unexpected visit on his way to a Floridian Christmas, and Arthur's Dad insists on making an ""authentic"" dinner that was likely served in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago.

Holidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah are also highlighted making this a fun and informative DVD.

I bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day. It's filled with fun songs (24 of them!), witty banter, and clever wordplay. Not only that, there's a great message that expectations often disappoint and that a wonderful experience can arise out of mishaps and situations not going as planned.

This 60 minute DVD doesn't have any extras (except for previews of other Arthur DVD's), but this excellent movie is well worth the price in my opinion. My husband and I get a kick out of the cleverness shown in Arthur TV series and this movie is no exception. And as I said, it's my son's favorite holiday movie.

Highly recommended for kids and parents alike!",5.0
"I can't believe this only got 4 stars. I have a 9-year old and a 3-year old. They love the movie so much they watch it year round. Arthur has a perfect Christmas because of his family and friends and there is no mention of what he got for Christmas: I find that refreshing. There is a very respectful treatment of everyone else's holiday traditions, whether they celebrate Hanukah, Kwannza or nothing at all.",5.0
"""What a wonderful kind of day when we can learn to work & play & get along with each other!""

Arthur is a rare kind of cartoon that is made for everyone; it is about a community of very different characters that live together peacefully and are accepting of one another.  No matter how different they are from each other, they ""get together and make things better by working together,"" with open eyes, ears, and minds, knowing that ""every day when you're walking down the street, everybody that you meet has an original point of view.""  The Arthur Christmas special does exactly what is expected of it: it applies the cartoon's main theme to the holiday season & places it in a story told from the point of view of a little boy who always tries to understand others' points of view.  It may not be everyone's perfect Christmas, but it is ""ARTHUR'S Perfect Christmas.""

On this page we have another case of people reviewing their religion instead of the DVD.  Don't be turned off by the reviews that say Arthur is anti-Christian; all of my family and friends, both Christian and non-Christian, love watching the Arthur special with their kids every year.  (Contrary to the popular misunderstanding, the holiday now known as Christmas was not invented as a Christian holiday; it was only adopted by Christians in the 1800s, so there is no reason that all Christmas specials have to be Christian Christmas specials.)  Also, consider the source of a critique before letting it affect your decision to see the movie.  For example, puremorals4ever over-criticized Arthur in his review in the name of his religion, though he gave 5 stars to SpongeBob SquarePants, which had a Christmas special that was very much less catering to the reviewer's fundamentalist Christianity than the Arthur special was.

After reading all of the reviews, I STILL don't know if it this DVD is good enough in quality to replace my old VHS copy.  Reviewers, tell me about the special features; tell me about the sound and picture quality; tell me if it doesn't work in some DVD players.  Each shopper has a different idea of what a ""puremoral"" is; shoppers don't care if the storywriters' values are different from those of one individual buyer.  What shoppers want to know about is the quality of the DVD, not whether or not you agree with the Arthur writers' message that a community works best when each person works together and realizes that others have views that are different from their own.",5.0
We have watched this Arthur movie countless times. We celebrate Chanukah and enjoy watching Francine celebrate with her family...it is always a beautiful moment when the menorah is lit for everyone to see. You can be of any religious faith to enjoy this movie...the kids and I love it(and I'm 40!) We highly recommend it.,5.0

"This is a great product! I appreciate how well each exercise is described and shown visually so it's easy to follow along without feeling like you need a translator to understand them.

"If your doctor has recommended pelvic floor physical therapy this a good alternative to scheduling times at a clinic.  Within three weeks of beginning the program, three times per week, I had significant improvement.  That was just using the first 3 workouts on the dvd.  I haven't attempted the fourth workout yet.  Not that it looks too hard, I just want to get a pilates ball if I'm going to do it. These exercises work more than just the pelvic floor.  There are several muscles that work in conjunction as is explained on the dvd.  It also shows patients of all ages and fitness levels performing the exercises so don't be put off if you're out of shape - they aren't that hard to do. I planned to go on to a clinic if this wasn't helping me but that won't be necessary now.  Saved me time and money. Well worth the $29 to see if it will work for you.",5.0

"I bought after I had a vaginal wall prolapse after having my first child  due coughing super hard from bronchitis.  I was pregnant with my second child, and did not want to that happen again.  Even with only using this 1-2 times per week, I noticed a big difference.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with vaginal wall prolapse, or anyone with stress urinary incontinence.  The video is boring, but it works!",5.0
I have not tried yet but am excited to try. The cost of this is A LOT cheaper than a physical therapy appointment. After  having a severely complicated hysterectomy/bladder mesh surgery this gives me hope. Will update after using for a few weeks. I also urge anyone considering surgery....PLEASE CONSIDER PHYSICAL THERAPY BEFORE GOING UNDER THE KNIFE!! Surgery complications CANNOT BE UNDONE!,5.0

"Excellent teaching and exercises for pelvic organ prolaspe. DVD is excellent! I  am glad I found out about this DVD.  I am going to a physical therapist  and this was just a reinforcement and some extra info the PT did not cover. Need to learn as much as possible to recover and live a life again.  I am 60 and have a mild prolaspe of bladder, rectum , uterus,  and cervix. I could not function without a tremendous amount of pelvic pressure before starting physical therapy, now after 2 1/2 months, I was able to hike up to 12 miles again, bike, and garden. Doctor had suggested surgery or pessary, but so far I have just been faithful in the exercises given and have seen great results!",5.0
Life changing! I was so depressed after I got a pelvic prolapse after working out too hard after having my 3rd baby! Now I feel back to normal and my abs are amazing! I did this video only 5x a week for 6 weeks and didn't lift anything heavier than my baby! Can't wait to try the advanced video!,5.0
"I am 61 and recently had trouble with leakage when running or doing high-intensity cardio exercise.  I'm in my second week of Pelvic Floor DVD, still on exercise group 1, but can now do high jumps, 18 at a time without a problem and jumping jacks.  I also notice the feeling to urinate all the time is disappearing. I kept doing the full workout with the explanation as I was not certain I was doing it correct but I have now moved on to the express workout. Will work on No. 2 next and continue.

I like the fact that Tasha works the surrounding muscles to help support the pelvic muscles.  I also like her manner and presentation; it is straight forward aid direct.

I also like the fact I did not receive any e-mails begging for reviews as is common from other vendors.",5.0

"This is an amazing PT workout.  After being diagnosed with slight prolapse after the birth of my first child I started to do these workouts.  She explains each exercise thoroughly.  After a few weeks, my prolapse felt almost gone.  Then I got the stomach flu so didn't do these exercises for a week and the prolapse got noticeably worse again.  Anyways I  am now back to doing these exercises again.  I am sold on these and would recommend them to anyone postpartum, even somebody who doesn't have a diagnosed prolapse.  An extra bonus is that my husband absolutely loves how I hold myself using the posture this video not only explains but also strengthens the right muscles to enable you to hold during the day.  I have also tried a couple workout videos from Whole Woman and met with a WW representative, but in my opinion the workouts on this PT video are far superior.  This really is a good buy to have several PT workouts for less than the price of one PT appointment.",5.0

After a few weeks my symptoms had almost entirely disappeared, and I was back to my favorite exercise of walking hills, now with a much more informed and capable ""basket.""

"As I've become peri-menopausal I've experienced stress incontinence. This DVD reduced the symptoms after 4 weeks and has continued to be helpful to the point where I am not experiencing stress incontinence at all. An unexpected bonus-- my posture has improved a great deal as a result of this DVD because it exercises core muscles in addition to the pelvic floor. In general I've found the exercises good, although I am unable to do the squats in the workouts because of an ankle stability problem. (I've substituted wall squats instead.) I will continue with these exercises and am adding core exercises because they are very helpful in daily living.",5.0
"Been using every day for 2 years. Love this product. Although doesn't make the prolapse better, great for strengthening your core.  Lots less pain at night when I do my exercises.",5.0
Very organized exercise program to address pelvic floor issues.  The use for women is emphasized. I wonder if men can benefit from the exercises. Exercises are fairly brief (under a half hour) and totally doable by and almost 70-year-old. Thank you for a holistic approach.,5.0
It helped with my moderate uterine prolapse.,5.0
I found myself dealing with a prolapse 6 weeks postpartum with my fifth child. As a very active person I did not feel like this should be a controlling factor in my life and immediately began looking for some solutions. I quickly ruled out surgery as anything but a last resort since it seemed to have lots of risk and little return. So I decided to check into rehabilitation. That is when I cam across this DVD and promptly ordered it figuring it was way cheaper than doing PT in an office somewhere. I have now been doing these workouts for over 2 months and they have made a HUGE difference! I am now hopeful that by the time my baby is weaned I will be back to full speed. I have noticed Tasha has an advanced workout now out and I am hoping to get it at some point and maybe I will be able to return to running again!,5.0
Well produced and helpful exercises. Found I saw results within just a few weeks.,5.0
I've been doing the workout for about a month and I'm already noticing results and I'm only on workout one. The education given on anatomy and how you need more than just kegels to strengthen your pelvic floor and get improved continence is really helpful. I'm very happy with the program.,5.0
"I bought the digital download ($13) from the hab-it website.  (I did not receive any discounts or promotions.) I have three children and was having some pretty severe issues after the third birth.  Wow, I wish I had known about it before!  Would totally buy again; cheaper than one PT session! Great, progressive PT exercises.  After 2 months of doing them about 5 times a week it has made a huge difference with my 'undercarriage' problems, which were getting pretty bad and which are now about 90% better.  It also helped the small amount of abdominal separation I had from the pregnancy!

Definitely watch the intros at least once; they help make the exercises more effective.  I find that a small portion of my bedroom floor (or even the bed) and an inexpensive child's ball are sufficient for most exercises.  It does take about 29 minutes to go through each routine, but it's worth it.",5.0
This is a well done CD and I recommend it.,5.0
"This is a fantastic program! I injured my low back several years ago ruptured two discs and ended up with nerve roots contacted on both sides of my spine. As a result I have dealt with terrible sciatica down both legs and pelvic floor dysfunction as a result of the lack of movement in my pelvic region. Having worked with professional physical therapists with little success, I had almost given up hope of ever regaining function in my low back and pelvic floor. From the first time I pressed play and went through the workout I could feel a huge difference. The functional approach to the entire pelvic floor and supporting muscles was exactly what I needed. For the first time in years I have hope that my condition has and will continue to improve and consequently grant me better functionality and pain relief. If you aren't sure about this purchase I can tell you there's nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying this program. Your body will thank you and your work will reward you with a better quality of life.",5.0
"I started seeing results from this program after the second workout. It's easy to follow, doesn't take a big time commitment, and does exactly what it says. I recommend it to anyone struggling with pelvic floor issues. Great program!",5.0

"Excellent instruction and explanation. I did have a little difficulty with the DVD sticking but cleaned it twice and so far so good. Most Physical Therapist I have worked with start on the ""core"", which is good but I have found that for me this is the place to start. It seems to be at the very root of the problem. I am very appreciative of Tasha's excellent demonstrations and counting out loud reminders as to when  to squeeze so you don't have to try and watch the exercise while you are doing it once you are familiar with the process.  It is also broken up into workouts which is good so you learn one work out and when you are ready move on.",5.0

This has been in my opinion one of the most clear and sensible exercise videos for prolapse.

After being diagnosed I was depressed and didn't know what to do but then I got over it and did my homework and came across this.

My biggest problem is my own. Taking time.  When I am regular in my exercise I feel better and stronger and notice I pay attention to my posture and doing kegels on my own.

Tasha is very clear and caring. I highly recommend this dvd!",5.0
"I am fairly young (22) and after having my son 3.5 years ago I had a slight uterine prolapse. It was uncomfortable and I was worried it would get worse. Doctor told me my only real option was having the mesh put in or a hysterectomy when I was older, as I was still too young. I want more kids in the future, so that really was not an option.

This DVD starts slow, and you think these workouts really do nothing, but after just a week of use I could tell the difference! I have never been more grateful for a purchase than this one. I went from not being able to workout without discomfort, to not even remembering I had the issue. My gynecologist was actually surprised to realize things were holding up better without surgery.",5.0

"This is a great video. Using this along with the IntiFit kegel exercise kit has given me total relieve. I'm very grateful that I found this video. I had stage 2 bladder prolapse, doctors told me just have more sex, at 65 I'd rather do laundry, and  besides you'd have to it everyday. They just make you feel that your old and useless. Which I'm not, I'm active, live on a hobby farm and I'm in great shape. Now I can do even more since I don't have to go to the bathroom all the time.",5.0
"Well worth the money and more. I currently go to physical therapy as referred by my OB due to pelvic organ prolapse (after having my second child). My PT only tells me to do kegels, but I told her about Han-it and she says that I should keep doing the Hab-it videos if I have them. Strengthening the core is known to help strengthen the pelvic floor (many articles and women's magazines recommend similar exercises that Tasha Mulligan includes in her DVD).  I have been doing this DVD for 6 weeks (haven't skipped one day) and I feel a lot better. She says you can do every other day, but I had time due to maternity leave so I wanted to do as much as possible to improve faster. Just don't overdo the kegel portion.

Tips:
Go to her website Hab-it.com.
1. She has the videos in downloadable format to put in your phone. I didn't see this till later. Alternatively you can download a program like handbrake for your computer to convert DVD to QuickTime video to put on your phone, which I did. This gave me no excuses. I also screenshotted the exercises and saved them on my phone so by the time I did these exercises for weeks I only needed to see the screenshot and not open the video to prompt me to do the exercises.
2. She has a 7-day advanced workout so if these 4 workouts are getting too easy or you plateaued, buy the advanced workout! It's more variety, longer, and really kicks your butt. I bought this after I was doing all 4 exercises everyday and it was getting boring and long.

A nice side effect of these exercises is I'm more toned and lost some weight too! I still have some prolapse but my PT says it feels a lot less and my kegels are stronger too. This is an amazing program.",5.0
"Great dvd for those of us with bladder problems.  I'm 72 and started having problems while sneezing, coughing.
Exercises are very easy to perform and really do help.  My doctor says she wishes more women would turn to the
kegel exercises before the situation gets any more serious.",5.0

"Fred's wife here...  So 4 weeks after having a beautiful 8.5lb baby boy, it was very apparent that I had a prolapsed bladder :(  I had 2 weeks to go before my first postnatal Dr's appointment but I didn't need him to tell me what was already obvious. So I started to do some research and came across the Hab It DVD. Ladies, it is well worth the $20 or $30. I started  doing the Hab It video at 5 weeks postpartum 5x per week and within 3 weeks I could tell it was already improving.  I couldn't get a pelvic floor physical therapy appointment ( which my OB/GYN prescribed) until 2 months after my 6 week appointment and I'm so happy I had this dvd.  It goes beyond just kegel exercises and will help your core in general  get stronger.  My baby is 5 months old now and my bladder prolapse is still there but soooo much better. I'm pretty confident by the time he's a year old I will rarely think about it. If you any sort of pelvic floor issues don't ignore them! You must work to make them get better.

It comes with four different workouts and also time efficient workouts that skips the detailed instructions once you know how to do the exercises. I would recommend this to anyone for before, during and after pregnancy.",5.0
Better than exercises my Doctor gave me.,5.0
"excellent step by step workout, difference felt after 2 weeks and getting better by the day",5.0
"amazing! you have to get it even if you don't suffer from the embarrassing symptoms of prolapse. after two days doing this, my problems disappeared. I was very skeptical of it since I'm  very active and other product didn't worked.",5.0
"This was a lifesaver for me. After the birth of my second child I felt great and was very excited to get back to running after about 4 weeks because I had stayed fit/run throughout pregnancy and was itching to get back into my old routine. I went for a short run and felt something 'shift'. I ended up with a uterine prolapse, 2nd/3rd degree. Upon searching the internet and talking to my OB I was completely devastated. I was a D1 college track and cross country athlete and running is a defining part of my life...I was told from all angles that I was never going to run again and the only resolution was going to be surgery after being done having kids. I went through a couple of months very depressed, mean and just overall miserable. After a fellow mom mentioned this DVD I decided to give it a try. After a month of doing the DVD every other day I added in some weight training and really focused on building my core, hip flexor and and lower back muscles. In late January I started to run again, starting with a qtr of a mile at a time and raised the distance by a qtr of a mile each week. I just ran a half marathon a week ago at 8 months postpartum and am back to running like my old self.  I highly encourage anybody dealing with prolapse or any other pelvic floor issues to try this DVD before agreeing to any surgery...mine is completely gone and for that I am so grateful.",5.0
I have been doing the exercises and am seeing results. Thanks.,5.0

Excellent. The instructor is very knowledgable and easy to follow.,5.0
Totally awesome and on the mark amazing!,5.0
Received on time.  Have been using for about three weeks and so far am very happy with the disc.  It will take time to know if it actually helps with the problem.,5.0
"These simple exercises are excellent.  Not only do they help with prolapse, but they give you back your waist, flatten your stomach, and firm your behind, whether you are recovering from pregnancy or out of shape or a senior you will be very pleased with the results.  I would love to have an overall work out program from Tasha!  Never have I seen such results from exercise.",5.0
"I am amazed at the results I saw the first two weeks of just doing workout 1.  This is so life changing!  Working on my fourth week, starting workout 2 today.  I wish I had found this DVD years ago!  I have a bad back, so will alternate workout 1 and 2 this week.  Working on this 6 days a week has made such an impact on my quality of life, I am so thankful!",5.0
Love this! Has helped my strength & pelvic floor,5.0

"Easy to follow comprehensive exercise for pelvic floor exercise and posture, this DVD has become part of my regular routine, well done Tasha Mulligan.",5.0
"This dvd is a must have for every woman with any kind of prolapse. I have a bladder prolapse after the birth of my son. He is now two years old. Kegel excercises are very well explained. I would just add one good advice with this workout- go for jogging. Get your body in a corect posture where you won't be feeling your prolapse and start jogging. Trust me, you will feel great and your abdominal muscles will start fixing your pelvic floor. As well, your weight will be better, thats what bothers your lower muscles. Great dvd, fast shipping to Greece. Good luck everyone, head up, loose weight and try to find one hour for yourself per day.",5.0
great dvd,5.0
"i have to admit i have not watched/used it yet.  but i have been in physical therapy for 3 months now (for my pelvic floor) and it is working great.  i bought this and let my pt watch it - she said it is a great video to use.  but a warning from me - going to a pt gives you specific feedback on what you need to fix vs. a video that can't tell you what your real issues are.  there were many things that i thought were fine with my body that weren't and vice versa.  THIS CAN'T REPLACE A REAL PT. i am going to use this after i am discharged to keep up my exercises.  My advice it to see a PT first, then use this to reinforce your treatment.",5.0

"I intended to purchase a pelvic floor  DVD by Julie Wiebe after attending a course of hers for physical therapy professionals when I discovered this DVD by Tasha Mulligan. The reviews on this DVD inspired me to purchase it. It is great! I work as a physical therapist assistant and I have incorporated several of the exercises from this DVD into my treatment plans. I do the exercises myself and I recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone regardless of whether you are experiencing pelvic floor dysfunction or not. All women can benefit from the information and exercises presented in this DVD. Thanks for sharing your knowledge, Tasha Mulligan.",5.0

"I had a hysterectomy a year ago at age 60. I have always been an active woman, taking vitamins, exercising and eating a healthy diet. Three months ago I noticed that I was not paying as much attention to my pelvic floor or core muscles,as I should have been all these years. I ordered this DVD and started using it right away. The results have been wonderful,my pelvic floor has gotten stronger,I noticed a difference in the first week. I plan to continue these exercises. Tasha Mulligan's instruction is top notch,she explains all the reasons why we need a strong pelvic floor and core,she also gives good instruction on how we can tell if we are in the proper posture stance. I wish I had started these exercises at a younger age,but better late than never. I would highly suggest that all women get this DVD,it's that good. Thank you,Tasha!",5.0
I've been doing this video for three weeks and I've noticed results that have made life easier for me.  I feel much more control and less pain which I wasn't expecting it to help at all.  It's really easy to learn the exercises too.  I'm extremely happy I bought this DVD and will continue to use and reap the benefits!,5.0
Actually works and so much less expensive than the 200 dollar physical therapy sessions that my doctor referred me for. And the exercises are either the same or very similar to what my therapist had me doing.  I'd love to see another dvd with more exercise options.,5.0
"AMAZING.  If you suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction, this woman and her videos should be your new best friends.  You have to remain diligent, but it is worth it.  I cried through my first two workouts due to embarrassment and sadness at needing these workouts.  However, I quickly got over it and I quickly saw results in pain reduction and lessening of urgency.  These workouts are easy to follow, demonstrated perfectly, and you are encouraged throughout in a soft-spoken, encouraging voice.  Training your pelvic floor is tricky and awkward, but it is worth remaining true to!!  Interstitial Cystitis or PFD sufferers--this must be a staple in your recovery.  I can't wait to purchase the 6-pack workout video Mulligan recommends!!  The only gripe I have with the video is that I am potentially barren and the narrator mentions a ""bundle of joy"" or ""your little one"" as encouragement or reward for finishing a workout (or even for having PFD, which I'm sure a lot of you moms out there feel that way--but I may never be one).  Some of us have PFD without the joys (or results) of motherhood, and these comments made me feel even more isolated.  Whatever, I got over it, this workout is amazing and I obviously thought those few comments were worth ignoring.  Buy the tape.",5.0
This dvd is great for strengthening the core muscles! I've been using it for a few weeks and can notice a difference already. I would highly recommend this to any lady of any age. It is geared to getting those muscles in shape regardless of age or circumstance.,5.0
I noticed a benefit from exercises after a week. Also exercises are not difficult to do.  I can even do them throughout the day,5.0
It Really works!!!  After one week I could tell the difference.,5.0
Holy cow! I just found out I've been sitting wrong all my life. I feel a difference after the first workout which was hardly a workout. Amazing. I will follow up with more after a few weeks.,5.0
"I'm not even 30, but have had stress incontinence since a young age.  I had heard you pee your pants when jumping after bearing children, so why was that happening to me at age 16?  I always heard, 'do your kegels' but never felt I understood how.  Like how often and in what position and how many.  I didn't feel I knew if I was doing them correctly or even remembered to do them.  12 years and 2 kids later, I'm having a lot of pelvic pain and can't even use tampons because they just don't fit right anymore.
I have researched a bit into vaginal weights, but always get overwhelmed and then stop shopping.  One day when talking to a friend, I finally decided I had to buckle down and order something.  I about cried when someone said in a review for weights that they didn't work with a prolapse.  It describes the symptoms I had with tampons and said a doctor may not mention a minor prolapse.  I had thought things just weren't quite right in there.  But what to do now?  I kept seeing this stupid dvd for sale and thought, ""no! I need equipment"".  When I finally read reviews, I felt hopeful and knew I needed to try it.
I've not been perfect about using it, but have been pretty decent.  And even if I haven't made it through an entire workout, once in bed, I actually remember to do kegels and feel like I can actually do them.  I apparently needed to be walked through it the way this lady does it.  And the visuals really help.  Yes it gets annoying to listen to.  But I just listen to something else and watch for cues.
I feel that things are changing and I haven't had the pelvic pain!  I'm hopeful that things will continue to improve as I continue with the program.  Yes, it just may be worth your money to buy a stupid dvd.  Think if it as physical therapy, because it is.  For someone with less problems than I have, other options may be best,  but if you have very little pelvic floor strength,  this is a great place to start!",5.0
This video saved me!!! After having a 9lb baby 4th degree lacerations I was having a hard road to recovery!! I recommend this video to anyone especially postpartum moms,5.0

"Easy work out, shipped fast!",5.0
I am amazed by the results! After 6 weeks of using this DVD my incontinence has improved dramatically. For the cost of less than one co-pay for physical therapy I have been able to do a complete physical therapy program in my own home. Kegels didn't work for me but this did. An added bonus is that my lower back is feeling better too! I highly recommend this DVD.,5.0

"Please try this BEFORE agreeing to any surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) or stress urinary incontinence (SUI). At age 40, after having four children, I was very active walking, running, biking, rollerblading. But all of that exercise apparently didn't do much for my pelvic floor. I had a level 3 bladder prolapse, was talked into surgery using a transvaginal mesh bladder sling (Yep, the kind you see on the lawyer commercials on tv). Long story short, that was 4 years ago. I was one of the 15% of women who have severe complications from mesh surgeries. The mesh eroded through my vagina, urethra, caused severe nerve and muscle damage, and ultimately had to be removed surgically. After 7 surgeries to try to deal with all the problems this mesh caused, I am now disabled, living in chronic severe vaginal/pelvic pain, unable to sit at all, and unable to work anymore. And guess what? I still leak when I cough & sneeze after all of that! So please, please try this before you consider surgery. I'm using this DVD now to try to get some strength back in my pelvic floor, but it is too late for me - the damage is done. I don't want any more women to suffer.",5.0
"Easy to follow program, only 15 minutes, well explained strengthening exercises led by a physical therapist.",5.0
Excellent. Had improvement after the first workout. Great to have a resource that really works and you can do in your own home.,5.0
Great DVD. I highly recommend it. I can really feel a difference. The exercises and her directions are great. Thanks Tasha.,5.0
Excellent exercises that have made a huge difference!,5.0
This video is life changing for me.  I do not have prolapse but bought to improve pelvic floor health.  I feel it has changed my life in the first viewing.  The information on posture alone was worth more than the cost of the video.  It sounds cliche but I only wish I had found/bought it sooner.,5.0
"This DVD has been great.  After having three kids, I had to get my body back into running shape.  My issue was not incontinence but pressure/organ prolapse when I would run and do high impact exercises.  I went to a pelvic floor physical therapist but this video is what I needed to get me to actually perform the exercises at home,  I do them 3-4 times a week and I credit Hab-it for helping me return to running after having kids.",5.0
"I like the different levels from beginner to advanced.

This is like having your physical therapy session in the privacy of your home.  Excellent instruction.  Beneficial to almost every woman.,5.0
This is a miracle cure and has changed my life!!  I had stress incontinence and was feeling miserable about it.  Kegals weren't doing the trick so I bought this DVD.  I haven't had a leak since starting the first routine!  I followed the first workout until I knew the instructions and am now doing the quick version of the first workout.  I love how I can do it when I wake up in the morning and am tired because it isn't strenuous.  Mostly I love how it works!!  I will keep doing this workout at least 3 times a week forever!,5.0
"This is awesome for working all the deep pelvic and abdominal muscles, plus all connecting/supporting muscles. Hoping Dr. Mulligan will make another updated version with more exercises!",5.0
So far I have only did the 1st exercise. The exercise have helped I will continue to do them and move to the next. The instructor is very long and drawn out but I understand she wants to educate and make sure the exercise is done correctly.,5.0
This is a great instructional way to use exercises for the kegal muscle. I recommend to anyone who needs to do this.,5.0
This is one of the best instructional videos i've seen in a long time. the instructor is really clear and just gets down to business. It's easy to use and very helpful. Highly recommend.,5.0
"I have used this now for a few months and have found it helpful.  I already knew that I was having problems with a nervous bladder, but when I experienced a prolapse, I was frightened.  After doing some research, I found that prior to any surgery or other medical things, a round of physical therapy would be ordered. I decided I'd rather do this in the privacy and comfort of my own home. Tasha Mulligan is a PT and specialized in this area. The anatomy and explanations are well done and well presented for visualization. This was important - and helpful - to me. Also helpful, is the quiet, matter of fact voice, the pace of the workouts, and her counting. I can't count, concentrate and exercise at the same time - I need someone else counting!  It took a full month of using this on the FIRST set of workouts, before I could slightly feel the muscles move.  It was in the second month that I began noticing the improvement of bladder issues, with the other nice side effect of seeing a slightly thinner waist and stomach muscles. The third month, the prolapse was not bothering me.  I have followed up with my OBGYN who let me know I was doing the right thing and encouraged me to keep it up.  I'm still only doing the first and part of the second sets of workouts.  I am well-pleased with the results and grateful that Tasha Mulligan put it out.",5.0
"Better than any mechanical device your ob-gyn might prescribe.  It gets to the cause of the problem and corrects it.  You do need to do the exercises regularly, but better than yucky devices or surgery.",5.0
"I recently had surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. I wanted to be sure that I am doing whatever I can to prevent further problems. I purchased the DVD during the period of physical therapy for PF. The PT asked if she could review it before I started so that she could be sure that things were done properly and would not hurt my repairs.

When she returned the DVD the following week, she gave it a thumbs up! She said that it contains so many of the PF exercises that she does with her patients and recommended that I use it 3 times a week.",5.0
"I didn't really realize/acknowledge I was having pelvic floor issues until after I started these workouts.  Before completing the workouts the 2nd time I was no longer experiencing any urinary incontinence, which, while minor enough to ignore in the first place, is sure nice to be without!

An even larger benefit was when I realized the hip strengthening exercises virtually cured a decade old IT-band injury.  I'm running a reasonable number of miles again for the first time since college!

The workouts are competed quickly and Tasha's cuing is timely and keeps the exercises efficient and effective.  I recommend this to all my mommy friends!",5.0
"After 4 weeks of doing the exercises every other day, I am already noticing huge core tone differences.  I am no longer afraid to sneeze.",5.0
Love the video !  The instructor is very knowledgeable about the Prolapse Pelvic Floor. This exercise is gives you a safe and effective workout.,5.0
"My husband ordered this for me and I began Kegal's while waiting on shipment. One and a half weeks ago I began Hab it, doing the exercises daily. I am virtually pain free at this time. The pain before was ruining my life. The burning was horrific. I am amazed and Incredibly grateful. I can cough, sneeze, and laugh and stay dry already, even after years of being this way! It was the pain however that drove me to action. The reviews speak for themselves. I can't imagine living the way it was! Praise God it is over!!!!!",5.0
"My doctor sent me to PT and I didn't find it very helpful, but I found this great...exercises were easy to follow.  The instructor has a mildly annoying accent that comes through at times but I'll take it for the otherwise good instruction and easy to follow work outs....and it seems to be helping a lot!",5.0
"This video series is fantastic for those of us who have to do exercises.  The guidelines are easy to use.  I saw results within a week of doing the 15 minute exercise routine daily.  And then of course, there are added benefits, sexual benefits...but I'll keep it PG clean here.  :)  Definitely worth it.",5.0

"Recently I noticed that my mild pelvic prolapse had been getting worse and had progressed to moderate to severe. I am middle aged, and menopausal. After researching I found that pelvic floor exercises can sometimes help keep the problem from getting any worse. I was skeptical to say the least but wanted to keep surgery as a last resort option only. I purchased the dvd and went to work. I was surprised how I felt some soreness in some of the muscles the next day, the exercises seemed so simple! It was obvious that I had not been using those muscles much in my everyday life. I have been doing the exercises for about 6 weeks now and I am currently on the 3rd set of workouts. All I can say is wow! I can really feel a difference. It has not cured the prolapse but the symptoms are really and truly, honest to God better! I can actually feel the difference and am much more comfortable. For you ladies who suffer from prolapse you will understand what I mean when I say things are ""riding higher""  in there. I am so glad I did not let my skepticism keep me from trying this. It has made such a big difference in how I feel. A huge Thank-you to Tasha for putting this work out together.",5.0
"I have seen amazing results already in just a few short weeks and I don't even do it as often as I should.  I used to work in an ob/gyn office with 9 physicians and I can tell you this surpasses anything I have ever seen recommended.  Have seen patients have some major complications from surgery.  Please give this a try , you won't be disappointed.",5.0
Excellent.  If you have prolapse this is a very good DVD.  I have much better pelvic floor strength after only 3 weeks.,5.0
"I haven't done this video as consistently as I should or would like, but I notice when I do it, I definitely feel a lot stronger ""down there"". There is a huge difference when I don't do it. Definitely recommend!",5.0
"The author is right, this information is not talked about enough. Yet all women could benefit from doing these exercises.  Tasha makes it very easy for anyone to follow along and stay engaged.  There are different length sessions too so it's easy to fit into your schedule whenever you have a few moments to yourself.

I am only on the second day of this program but feel it is already helping me isolate otherwise ignored muscles of the pelvic floor.  I plan to continue this for the duration and will post again afterwards.

Best wishes to anyone reading this review.  If you feel like you could benefit, you probably can.",5.0
"I haven't been using the program very long, but even after the first viewing and test run I could feel a difference in my muscles.  I actually woke up sore the next day even after just doing a simple run-through once or twice without being meticulous about body form or posture.  I'm sure that after using this program as recommended, for the time recommended, it would get results.  I mostly purchased the program to flatten my stomach.  I read that a flatter stomach cannot really be obtained without toning the core abdominal area.  The program description led me to believe that the exercises on this DVD would obtain that goal.",5.0
"The instructions and descriptions of the exercises are very clear and informative. I just could not stand the thought of having surgery to correct my prolapse and decided to give some serious exercise a try first. I have used the program for about 2 months and have noticed a great improvement. I could tell I was making progress with in the first 2-3 weeks. When I saw my OBGYN a few weeks ago, my prolapse was down graded to a stage one! I will continue to use these exercises and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this video to anyone looking to rehab their pelvic floor. It was definitely worth it for myself.",5.0
"I had no idea before this video that inner thigh muscles had both a front and a back portion, and that they had anything to do with the pelvic basket.  ""Do your kegels and you'll be fine!"" I was always told.  Well, this DVD explains why i have super strong vaginal muscles and yet my bladder is prolapsing.  It isn't just something that happens to your body because you have kids.  Butt muscles, inner thigh, abs, and more.  You have a lot a muscles that hold up your insides.  Who knew?  Well, this person did.
I also bought vaginal weights, and I have to say I'm getting a lot more out of this dvd than the vaginal weights.",5.0
I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!,5.0

"After four natural deliveries in as many years my pelvic floor was in need of rehabilitation. I purchased this DVD and faithfully completed the workouts. I can honestly say that after one month, my pelvic floor is in better shape than before I had children. The DVD is informative, easy to follow, and extremely effective. I highly reccomend it, and only wish I knew about it following my first delivery!",5.0
The explanations of the exercises are good.  I have noticed improvement after 6 weeks of doing the routines regularly.  They are about 17-25 minutes long.  Once you have the hang of it you can do a shortened one that doesn't take you thru the instructions again.,5.0
I like everything about this except one thing...what's the large rubber band for?  Is this too hold up your abdomen while doing the exercises?,5.0
"Excellent program. Very detailed and logical. Also, good blogs if one has questions after the DVD.
I just began the program but find it should be a great help.",5.0
"I am writing this review for any postpartum women who are crying as they are scouring the internet for solutions to their prolapse.  My pregnancy and labor did a number on my pelvic floor- very active lifting and exercising all through pregnancy, induced at 42 weeks, in labor for 30 hours, pushed for 3 hours, was being prepped for c-section when finally forceps were used at the very last second and my 9 lb 13 oz baby was born sunny side up with a very large head and his hand pressed to his forehead. I didn't stand a chance at walking away without some trauma.  I cried every night over how things looked and felt and was saving up for surgery.  6 months later my gynecologist shrugged her shoulders and said prolapse like I had to live with it.  I tried a women's health physical therapist which helped a little but not enough.

I got this DVD and wasn't sure if it was really doing anything until after doing it diligently for 4 weeks, life got in the way and I skipped the workouts for a couple weeks and all of a sudden I could feel that things were slipping back.  This truly works for me and has given me hope that things can get back in place, or at least closer to where they should be.  And I am no longer fearful of having a second pregnancy and delivery.

This is much cheaper than physical therapy, very informative, it works, and has given me hope.  I am so thankful that this product exists.",5.0
"This is an excellent easy to follow dvd, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their pelvic floor. This really should be seen by any woman who has just come out of hospital from giving birth.",5.0
"This DVD is well organized and offers educational content about the value of maintaining a strong pelvic floor, part of the core section that is so important to women's health.

"I was traveling 25 miles each way to meet with a physical therapist and while she was wonderful, this is oh so convenient.  Tasha Mulligan explains the anatomy and physiology of a woman's body and really takes the time to explain each exercise.  It is wonderful to have a fast tract too once one is sure of the proper technique of each exercise.  For me, it is nice to see that my physical therapist and Tasha Mulligan's teaching align.  So nice to be able to do in the privacy of my own home.",5.0

"This DVD is very well done and includes 4 rehab ""workouts"". She is a very good teacher and her cueing and instructions are excellent.",5.0
"What a wonderful DVD! I was so thankful to the instructor Tasha for her encouragement and expertise. I was recommended to have surgery, but in only 1 month I have seen a tremendous improvement. The $30 has been worth every penny considering I won't be missing work for surgery or dealing with all the issues involved with weak pelvic muscles. She is so thorough in her directions and has a time efficient work out for those of us that are time crunched! I feel so fortunate to have stumbled onto this DVD! I can't recommend it enough! The muscles can be tricky to locate and she even uses graphics to help you isolate muscles that most of us are not familiar with.",5.0
"I was diagnosed with a prolapsed bladder before I ordered this DVD. It's a lifesaver. There are three exercises, each lasting about 20 minutes, and then the advanced exercises that last only 8 minutes. I try to do one of the three, plus the advanced, every day, totaling only half an hour. I believe it will prevent me from having to have the surgery. Get the DVD.  It's a lifesaver.",5.0
This is a private way to treat pelvic floor problems. I would recommend it to any woman with incontinence problems,5.0
"Very easy to follow, well explained.  So much better to do other exercises than just the kegel.  I highly recommend it to women of all ages.",5.0
"Don't expect it to work overnight but stick with it and you will see improvement.  If you want to try a noninvasive solution, I think this is it.",5.0
"I like this but didn't buy for myself.  it has several 20 minute long exercises that are very simple and easy to do.  these are the right duration compared to actual physical therapy sessions we've gone to.  so, for the motivated, determined person this can be a tremendous help and a tremendous savings of money or insurance.  and, since these can be done at home, the convenience is pretty great too.",5.0
Very good DVD with Tasha giving very clear instructions on how to do the exercises. I purchased it because of the good reviews and would recommend it to anyone who has prolapse problems.,5.0
Good dvd.  Easy to follow and the instructor has a great knowledge base.  I liked that there are 4 short workouts to follow.,5.0
"I've actually only used this program a dozen or so times, and it was enough.  It is amazing in fact, and completely reversed the symptoms I was having in a very short amount of time.  If I even remotely feel them returning, I'll be right back doing this wonderful program.  It's very informative as well and really helps you understand what's going on with your body and how to correct it!  Fantastic!!",5.0
Works great. Just like going to get physical therapy for a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended. etc etc etc,5.0
"This is the best exercise video i have ever bought. If you go to Tashas website you can talk to her yourself if you have any questions, She is more than happy to talk to all customers.",5.0
"This DVD is a GREAT resource! It offers women the opportunity to really DO something for their pelvic floor! As both a midwife and a woman with a pelvic floor injury, I highly recommend this DVD.",5.0
"I have lived with my mild, yet annoying prolapse for several years,however suddenly it made a dramatic and HUGE descent, causing recurrent bladder infections, difficulty in walking, irritation and then BLOOD!. That sent me to the emergency room at my local clinic (doctor's office closed that day) where the attending physician recommended immediate surgery. He suceeded in pushing it back in and when I got home,I improvised a temporary ""sling"" and would periodically gently push ""it"" back in myself. When I got the DVD, I was absolutely amazed because after the very first work-out, there was definite improvement. Each day gets better and better. My biggest problem has been figuring out how to advance the DVD to the next segment - am sure that is my fault as I am not very skilled at dealing with my  electronic gadgets. I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HAB IT:PELVIC FLOOR  and not only endorse it, but BEG  those who are dealing with prolapse to order it immediately before you consent to not-always-successful surgery.",5.0
"I developed prolapse after moving lots of boxes three months right after my son's natural birth. The feeling of my bottom is falling down stopped me from living a normal life. I thought I will have to live with it forever and was very depressed. Then I did a lot of reading, researching about remedies and also went to a few physical therapist sessions.  I would say that this is the most helpful exercise among all. From other reviewers' comments, it seems that I will have to constantly follow this exercise; otherwise the prolapse comes back. I very much prefer doing this to  the feeling of prolapse.",5.0
I have been very pleased with the results I have gotten after only 3 weeks of using the exercises in this DVD.  I have been very faithful in doing them at least 5 days a week but have already found the benefits amazing and I am a 66 year old woman.  Only wish I had had this 20 years earlier.  The workouts are easy to perform and the instructions are easy to understand and follow. Tasha does an excellant job of walking you through each exercise.  I would highly recommend this DVD and feel it is well worth the price.,5.0
"GREAT video. Has great exercises that really helped me post-partum. If you really devote yourself to this and perform it daily, it can absolutely do wonders for you. The video is very easy to understand and follow. She does a great job in explaining each exercise so theres no question in how to perform them.  And it doesn't take much time at all to perform.  Great to do while the baby is napping!  Or can do with your baby lying right there with you.  Love it! Absolutely recommend!!!",5.0
"This is a fantastic DVD!
Every new mother needs a copy of this!
Don't wait until you develop incontinence.
Tasha's sessions are exactly what you'd get if you made the effort to go to a physical therapist.  This way you get the lessons in the privacy of you own home.",5.0
I'm four weeks into the program and have seen great results. Highly recommend this DVD. It puts power into a woman's hands to change a condition that can be life limiting.,5.0
"I've been using the DVD for 3-4 weeks, and I've already seen improvement.  The instructions/demonstrations on the DVD are clear and easy to follow.  Her attitude is very encouraging.

I didn't notice this on any product descriptions before I bought the DVD, but she does recommend using an exercise ball and a smaller ball for some of the exercises.  I have a small ball and have used a chair in place of the exercise ball.  (She says you can substitute a pillow for the small ball, and a chair for the exercise ball.) This has worked quite well, except that there is one exercise in the final workout that I could not on a chair.  You may have better luck, but I'm avoiding that workout, which is still too advanced for me anyway, until I get an exercise ball.",5.0
"After the somewhat traumatic (for me) birth of my son, I had a severe prolapsed uterus.  After two years it had not improved, but had progressed to a stage three.  My OB/GYN recommended surgery.  I almost scheduled but I decided to give this a try first.  My goodness.  In four weeks I've gone back to nearly where I was before pregnancy.  I was always been ""shallow"" and I still have a couple of inches before everything is perfect, but my cervix is now at least four inches higher.  They should hand these out at the hospital.  I even had a midwife.  How could we not know about this before? I'm serious when I say this video saved me 20 grand and major surgery.",5.0
"Not only does this workout strengthen the pelvic floor, but it is also strengthening my thighs & legs.  As a result, I'm becoming a better runner!  Very nice surprise!",5.0
"The DVD is excellent in quality and content. I am recommending it to all the gals that I am training with for the half-marathon we're running this fall. At sixty, I have enough to worry about without the constant discomfort that goes along with a weak pelvic floor. It had gotten to the point that I was not sure I could continue to train without surgery. After doing the first set of exercises I am thrilled. They are easy to do with gradual steps between each of the levels, clear instructions, and excellent graphics. Thank you so much, Tasha!",5.0
"After a rough delivery, at about 3 weeks I diagnosed my own rectocele. I had a natural delivery, and felt betrayed that my body was so traumatized, and found the symptoms very uncomfortable. In a fit of despair, I ordered this dvd, and was elated to find that after 2 weeks of regular use, my body started to feel normal again. Incidentally, I slacked for a week,thinking I was fixed, and my prolapse symptoms started to return. These exercises work, and also provide some gentle toning postpartum. Prolapse is something women should talk about more, and prepare each other for the possibility postpartum. I highly recommend!",5.0
This DVD is set up in real world format.  The workouts are labeled and timed.  So you can choose the workout you have time for.  Plus has  progressive steps to help you learn the routines!,5.0
"I have been using this a couple of weeks & I must say its a great product, really focus on working on muscle groups and areas you wouldn't normally and glad I purchased it :)",5.0
"This is a great DVD that brings the physical therapy into your home. I am a mom of two toddler boys and have little to no time to myself. The workouts are short and once you do them a few times you can retain the exercises and do them throughout your hectic day as time permits.

The Education about the anatomy is a must for every women. I feel this video would be helpful for any woman, teaching us all from the start how to care for our pelvic floor.

The price is great, delivery is fast, there is nothing to loose. You have a life time of PT in your own home for the price of a co-pay!",5.0
I have almost lost hope to ever getting my life back after my third child. I prolapsed and it freaked me out. Praise Yahweh! I was lead to this program and it is affordable and straight to the point. I recommend this to women of all ages. Say yes to this and no to surgery! This works surgery costs a lot with failure at the end.,5.0
"My DVD came just yesterday, but already I am very excited about this DVD.  It is very well done, and the instructor is very clear and pleasant.  I look forward to being successful in ""fixing"" my prolapse, and I also plan to pass on the information to my daughters for their future needs.  Thank you for such a well-done product!",5.0
I had many problems after the birth of my fourth child. I have noticed a difference after my second workout. I was told by a doctor that nothing could be done for my prolapse. I can actually FEEL the difference in my pelvic area.  I can't wait till the sixth week results. Thank you for this dvd,5.0
"While my wife still not 100% (she has an extreme case which has many layers to it), I will say that this dvd has been one of the only things that she does that she and I both feel is helping her.  She loves that there is a lot of guidance and explanation to begin but then, once you understand and don't want or need to take all that time to complete your workout, there is the time efficiency section.  She also likes seeing the graphic visual alongside the model performing the exercises. She likes that it is not a trendy workout so someone could have used these techniques and exercises 100 years ago or 100 years from now.  I am grateful that this dvd is out there for woman who suffer because it is a little talked about issue and it has been extremely hard to find any help for my wife.  I highly recommend it to anyone displaying any pelvic difficulties.",5.0
"I was experiencing urinary frequency/urgency after the birth of my last baby, and doing Kegels alone didn't take care of the problem. After doing these videos for just a week and a half it is no longer a problem! I can't believe how quickly it was resolved! I'd recommend it to anyone experiencing any type of pelvic or incontinence issues!",5.0
"I learned about this CD on the forum at prolapsehealth.com and started using it at 4 weeks postpartum and its just fantastic.  It is appropriate for both beginners and seasoned exercisers.  The length of each workout is perfect for busy moms.  The instructions are clear, easy to understand and follow, and anatomically correct.  The accompanying blog is very good.  The workouts are flexible and can be done alone or combined.  Most importantly, it works.  At 8 weeks postpartum I no longer have any irritating symptoms and as a delightful bonus my whole lower body muscle tone is improved.  My only regret is that I didn't know about this 4 babies ago.  Highly, highly recommend!",5.0
"I'm very grateful to Mrs Mullingan's Pelvic floor work-out : it's very easy to do,and after one month you can both feel and see the difference! Pelvic Floor is really ""healthier"" and it's very pleasant too, you will see your stomach is really more tough and flat. I have four children... and now I feel much more healthier and self confident. And when you begin to see results, it gives you motivation and energy, even after a rough day, to do one of the three different work-out.",5.0
"I love this DVD so far.
There are 4 workouts.  I have been doing workout 1 and 2.  3 and 4 are more difficult.  I'm working my way up.  I'm not sure how long to stick with one workout before moving up.  AFter you learn a workout you can switch to the time efficient workout.
These exercises seem to help.  I just started a couple of weeks ago so I don't know what the long term outcome will be.",5.0
"This is an excellent dvd for those who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness. I found this video to be very informative,explaining in an easy to understand manner the function of the pelvic floor muscles and the importance in regaining their strength after surgery,childbirth or simply the effects of aging. After a detailed explanation there are 3 separate segments of specific exercise routines to regain tone of the pelvic floor. I was very impressed with this video and wish I had known about it before I spent hundreds of dollars in a local physical therapy office where I felt extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed and therefore,did not obtain the positive results I had hoped for. This dvd has enabled me to practice these specific exercises in the privacy of my home without fear of embarrassment that sufferers of pelvic floor muscle problems sometimes feel. I would recommend this video to all who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness.",5.0
"I purchased this DVD after being prescribed physical therapy by my Urogynecologist.  I have been plagued with muscle spasms after a hysterectomy, bladder sling and correction of a rectocele and cystocele over a year ago.  Even though I am only 42, I have been unable to sit for any length of time and unable to resume jogging and exercise.

I'm so grateful to have found this DVD on Amazon.  After only two sessions of exercises, I am already feeling fitter.

I am also very impressed that the PT responded to my feedback email and gave me some tips that have helped even more.",5.0
"This is truly a wonderful product.  I had a cystocele (bladder prolapse) after the birth of my second child and was utterly devastated at how restricted I felt because of the bothersome symptoms.  I just want to share that after only 4 weeks of doing these exercises I have had HUGE improvements.

This DVD is made by and actual physical therapist who specializes in Pelvic Floor rehab and had a grade III cystocele herself after each one of her 3 kids.  It is clear,concise and packed full of helpful info.  The exercises are not too difficult and I actually find them somewhat relaxing. It only takes six weeks (doing one of the workouts 3 times/week) to fully rehab your pelvic floor and then just maintenance Kegels after that.  It is a wonderful product for only $30!!!  I HIGHLY recommend it to ANY new mom with or without prolapse.  It can not only help current prolapse issues but also help prevent them in the future!!",5.0
"Having had a background in anatomy and physiology as a outcome-based massage therapist, I am quite familiar with how the body works. I have been athletic all my life until I recently had two pregnancies back to back. Both, natural births at home, took quite a toll on my pelvic floor. My midwife had a few resources which I reviewed but knew they were missing a lot of information and/or had a lot of other information I didn't care for like healing the ""spiritual"" aspect of the pelvic floor. Hab-it Pelvic Floor is like going to a high quality physical therapist in your own living room! The price is minimal for the benefits you receive. I can't sing their praises enough. Very detailed, very clear and concise, exactly what was needed for me to be guided into healing and getting things back where they belong. Already seeing a difference and it's only been a few weeks in. Note: video includes excellent information segment and then exercise segment which is divided into four different workouts. You just have to do one of the workouts each time, three times a week. So one of the four, three times a week, any of the four. The fourth being the most difficult. Once you get used to how they go, there is even a section of time efficient workouts so you can save time. Love this DVD! Recommended it to my midwife and she is thrilled about it too - giving it to her clients in the future. May consider giving this as a gift to new moms!",5.0
"After my 2nd baby I had a prolapsed bladder...was told by the midwife that I'll eventually need surgery & that's all I could do (surgery that doesn't even fix the problem)...

I heard about this from another Mama & so glad I got it...

After 2 times I couldn't feel the prolaspe @ all.  At the end of the 6 weeks (which is all it takes) it's completely GONE!

At first, I thought ""$30 whoa!""  But this is by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST who had prolapse herself, so if I were to go to a physical therapist, it would cost a LOT MORE AND I would have to go to an appt. a few times a week...this is awesome b/c I can stay @ home w/ my baby & newborn & do it!

I CAN'T THANK THE WOMAN WHO CREATED THIS DVD ENOUGH!!!",5.0
This was everything I wanted to give my son for his birthday.  He loved it!,5.0
"We ordered Aha Chinese for our 6 year old twins.  The video animation & teaching methods are surprisingly good. Our kids were were very focused - and actually sat still - throughout the entire video. (A first!)  The instruction was easy to follow and totally engaged  the kids.
Aha Chinese really sparked their interest in Chinese culture and now our daughter takes Mandarin lessons in her after-school program.",5.0
"This product is definitely one of the best out there right now for learning Mandarin chinese.  My 2 girls (age 4 & 6) love watching the video and actually interact with the characters out loud.  They also ask to watch it over and over because the story is amusing and they enjoy singing the very catchy songs.  The story introduces just the right number of new Mandarin words/phrases and my kids have picked up on them very quickly.  Thankfully, the book and the flashcards have the pinyin pronunciation written for the adults to be able to review the words that were introduced in the video.  We have also been playing memory game with the flashcards that are included to introduce the written Chinese language as well.  If you really want your child(-ren) to learn some Mandarin, while having fun, then this video/flashcard/book kit is for you.",5.0
"After using so many different Mandarin educational products from here and China, I must say that Aha! Chinese is the best product on the market today.  The DVD and book really engage my 2 young children and it's easy to follow along. For the beginning student, it introduces phrases and words in a gradual and very logical way.  There is no question that Mandarin will be an increasingly important language to know in our global economy.  In addition, children need to begin learning it at a very young age in order to correctly pronounce the tones.  It's interactive, colorful, and fun while imparting key phrases and concepts in a step-by-step manner. I bought several as gifts for other friends and family who have young children learning Chinese.  Their parents could not thank me enough for finding such a great product.  You will not be disappointed. It's simply the best!",5.0
"I bought Guang the Chinese Dragon set for my nephew who just turned 3.  He loves it!  He watched the entire DVD as soon as his Mom put it in the DVD player!  My nephew has quite a vocabulary and is very interested when his aunt and uncle teach him Chinese.  I've looked at many learning materials to give him - books, CDs, DVDs, etc - for children for more than a year, including when I was overseas.  Many of the other learning materials out there are either poorly produced, not very interactive or engaging for children, or they are too difficult for children and their parents to follow, especially the materials developed for native speakers.  Let's Go Guang! is very different - it is engaging, with lively characters - including Guang the Dragon - to capture kids' interest, and uses effective teaching methods like songs, integrating Chinese in everyday activities like cooking with Grandma, and has a variety of ways for children to learn - the DVD story, a book that can be ready anywhere, and flash cards that let children learn at their own pace.  I highly recommend Let's Go Guang! for teaching the children in your life Mandarin Chinese with fun and creativity!",5.0
"As a mother about to adopt a little girl from Taiwan, I found this priceless to not only teach our son currently in our home but also for our daughter we are about to adopt to keep up with her native language. I love the characters, the video runs at a really nice pace and it is an adorable story! I have also found the flash cards included in the kit to be very helpful for our entire family including myself and my husband. We have been testing each other with them, and it has been a very fun game for all of us. I have found in the adoption world very few products that actually help like this with language skills - it has been such a blessing to have!!",5.0
I learned about this language program from one of my pre-K students who was speaking Mandarin extremely well and couldn't stop talking about Guang the dragon.  I was delighted with the complete boxed set.  I show the kids sections of the DVD at a time and show the mini-lessons repeatedly since they love the songs.  My students naturally repeat the Chinese as it's presented in the DVD.  The flashcards are really popular with the kids since we play the Memory Game with them.  I've also recommended `Let's Go Guang! Chinese for Children' to the parents of my students as a fun way to supplement our lessons at home.,5.0
"This is a fabulous new product! My 5- and 3-year-old LOVE the video and always ask to watch it again once it's finished. They both repeat the Mandarin Chinese phrases as they hear them, and the repetition and use of music in the video really helps them retain the information. Likewise, the CD goes with us everywhere now, and my 5-year-old is able to read some of the flash cards also. The book and parent/educator guide are most helpful in that they provide everything you see in the video in written form. Even if learning Mandarin Chinese is not essential for you, this is a great way to introduce the language to your kids and, at the same time, learn some of the key words and phrases yourself!",5.0
"As a mother of 3 young children, I was thrilled to see this new product available. My children love the DVD and always choose to listen to the CD in the car. The variety of multimedia; flashcards, book, DVD, and CD reinforce their learning. After only watching a few times they are already singing the songs and using their Chinese! It's surprising to see how quickly they learn with such a comprehensive collection of materials to teach them Mandarin Chinese.

"This is a beautifully presented Mandarin Chinese program for kids. It includes a fun to watch animated DVD, which got my kids repeating Chinese phrases after just one viewing! It also includes a CD of the songs in the video, a book, and flash cards that can be used for review or games! My kids loved watching the video and singing the songs. My 6 year old daughter picked up the flash cards and started reading them on her own after watching the video! They now love watching the video over and over.

I highly recommend it!",5.0
"After years of searching for a good product to help my children learn Mandarin, I've finally found the perfect product in ""Let's Go Guang!"". Aha! Chinese's new multimedia system, which includes a colorful book, fun DVD video, CD and flashcards, is fantastic! Unlike other Mandarin products for children, which focus on only teaching a few nouns per video, this product introduces and integrates useful phrases within an English context so ideas and concepts are mastered in a natural way.  Each lessons also builds on phrases learned in prior lessons.  Using both animation and live video, the DVD holds the interest of young children with songs, games, colorful animation, and cultural lessons.  The flashcards also have Chinese, pinyin and English.  As a parent, I highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to share the gift of language with their children. My kids love learning with Guang, Ling and Kai!",5.0
"I purchased a several of these kits after my friends (with many grandchildren) told me about this gift set for teaching Chinese. It has Book, DVD, CD, and flash cards. I gave Let's Go Guang to my grandchildren (ranging 2- 9 yo) and I've kept one set at my own home for them to use. I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised at how much the kids enjoy the set and quickly picked up mandarin phrases. I highly recommend this set for young children who don't speak Chinese as their primary language at home.",5.0
I have been sharing Let's Go Guang with the 4 and 5 year olds at my school. The kit is very clear and age appropriate (perfect for 3 -6 year olds). It is very kid friendly and the children definitely like the silly dragon mascot. Good vocabulary and really useful repetition makes this a great introduction to Mandarin for young children. The cooking and cultural aspects also help to make it interesting and well rounded and inspired us to make dumplings in school! I would definitively recommend this kit and am looking forward to the next level.,5.0
This product is absolutely fantastic. My family and I bought this product for my cousins. They love it! They find it so engaging with the different characters and have learned so much! This product is great for children learning Chinese. Highly recommend it!,5.0
"As a mother of two children aged 5 and 2, and with limited Mandarin skills myself, I have searched extensively for a good way to ease them into learning Mandarin. For many years I wanted to find a way they could learn some basics in a fun and non-intimidating way that would give them the confidence and desire to pursue Mandarin as a second language.  When I found Let's Go Guang I was thrilled, and my kids love it.  They are extremely engaged by the DVD and ask to read the book all the time.  I even found that after only watching the DVD once and reading the book a couple of times, with a little reinforcement from me, my 5 year old was volunteering phrases he had learned from the kit in completely random situations. The kit really makes learning so much fun and the kids love the characters and story line.  I can't wait for the next kit to come out!",5.0
"I think learning other languages is a gift parents can give to those children who are interested. So, I have the Little Pim French CDs and my son watches those with much much interest. I decided to get something different (perhaps more interesting to me???) to expose him to Chinese.

My initial impressions were vey positive. The package that arrived was very professionally presented, with a DVD, a book and some flash cards. However, I am not really interested in the flash cards and the book at the moment as the idea is just to expose my 1-year old to the sounds of another language.

To this end, I think that ""Let's Go Guang"" fails in that ambition. There are so few Chinese words used. Having said that, if this was the first in a series of CDs, where new words are introduced and words from previous CDs are re-introduced, then this might be a wonderful series. Unfortunately, so far ""Let's Go Guang vol 1"" has no follow-up volume II.

I like the singing, I loved the extra footage where you see the chinese dumplings being made. Unfortunately, there was no actual recipe given for the dumplings. I guess that's what the internet's for!

I actually was a bit surprised at how short the DVD was.

This wasn't a cheap DVD but it wasn't excessively expensive for what you get (book, flash cards, DVD). Although I have criticised the small number of chinese words being used, I am not going to return this purchase. I like it, just don't love it. My little boy (and I) will just learn these key Chinese words very well whilst we wait for the next instalment....and we may buy another (cheaper) series in the meantime.

***************
UPDATE: My son is now 18 months old and has really started begging for the Little Pim French DVDs. I have just started giving him Let's Go Guang too. I am very glad that I am not teaching him two languages using the same DVDs. Although he loves Little Pim I think it would be confusing to have the French and the Chinese Little Pim DVDs.

My son seems to like Let's Go Guang quite a lot and I find myself learning quite a lot of stuff passively too. I am very glad that I didn't return this DVD and in fact I have just jumped on to the Aha Chinese website to see if there is a volume 11 yet. Unfortunately no.

He is still too young for the flash cards but I am now looking at the CD of the Let's Go Guang story and thinking he might be old enough for this in the car. Wonder if he'll like it?

This idea of exposing him to other languages is sort of an experiment. So far I am really really surprised at how interested he is in the DVDs I am showing him.

***UPDATE****
My son is now 19 months and now asks for this DVD. He likes the CD in the car too. I also noticed that the other day I had passively learned heaps of the Chinese and could recall it well. Now, I really can't wait for the next instalment. Their website says it's due Fall 2011.",5.0
My son is 2 years old and absolutely loves Guang the dragon. He's already using many of the phrases in Chinese and I repeat them to emphasize learning. i didn't think I would remember the phrases but it comes naturally now. We're ready for more chinese and it's been 6 months since we've had the DVD. Great learning tool.,5.0
I am very impressed with this item.  Both my 3 yr old and 5 yr old love this...and of course they watch it over and over again.  They sing the songs all the time and are using the language in their everyday conversation.  I am waiting for the next volumes to be released.  Would highly recommend. We are Chinese but speak mostly English at home.,5.0
"This DVD is the best I've found for helping my kids learn Mandarin.  (And we've bought almost everyone amazon offers.) My 5 year old wants to watch it every day and he loves listening to the audio CD as well.  His mandarin vocabulary has improved a lot, and what I love even more, he now peppers his speech with chinese phrases.  We hear a lot of ""wo yao"" and ""wo bu yao"" naturally popping up in our conversations.  We are eagerly awaiting the next in the series.",5.0
"I completely disagree with the reviewer from ""USA"".  I bought the Let's Go Guang set for my kids to learn Chinese.  They love it!  My daughter asks to watch Guang all the time and she uses the phrases she's learned esp the phrase ""Wo Yao..."" or ""I want..""  Let me say, we are very committed to teaching our kids Chinese and this set has been the perfect way for them to learn about 50 useful everyday words and phrases (not just 40 words!). The pace has been just right for my daughter and fun too!  We read the book together at night, listen to the CD in the car, and I let her watch the DVD on her own.  If a child really learned all of the vocabulary taught in one sitting as ""USA"" suggested, Lets Go Guang! Must be a really effective set for kids to learn mandarin!",5.0
"I bought Let's Go Guang for my sister who is a mom to two girls adopted from China.  Although we are not Chinese, my sister has an academic background in Asian American studies and is very conscientious about integrating Chinese culture and language into her childrens' upbringing.  My nieces are now 4 and 7, and they are enjoying the adorable animation featured in LGG while learning their first words and essential phrases in Chinese.  I was impressed with the quality of the animation, the cute story lines which integrate Chinese themes (from gong fu to making potstickers), the catchy songs, and the beautiful packaging of the learning kit.  Would definitely recommend this product.",5.0
"My 3-yr old daughter just loves this program and has been having a lot of fun learning Mandarin!  It's amazing how easily it is all absorbed through songs, the entertaining DVD and, our favorite, listening to the recorded book.  The kit is beautifully designed and thoughtfully produced.  It provides a memorable introduction both the language and the culture that is just a pleasure to absorb as a child and a parent.  Can't wait for the next episode!",5.0
I purchased this program for my 2 year old grandson and he loves the video and I love watching him watch it because he is so responsive and interacting with it.  He seems to learn so easily from the video.  I am amazed how it keeps his interest and to hear him repeat the words he has learned from it.  I can see him using this program for a long time. So many things I buy for him don't live up to expectations but this program goes well beyond  what I expected.,5.0
"I have a 2 year old son, whose attention cannot be contained by much. He absolutely LOVED Guang! He became so interactive and responsive. He danced, and sang along even after watching it 5 times in one day! He's a little young for the flash cards, yet, but we fully intend on using this program for a long time.",5.0

This is just an awesome documentary. I loved every minute of it. I am really interested in health and well being. I am sharing my DVD with so many people that I need another one for myself. I want to watch it again. It is great.,5.0
"The Adventists film does a fantastic job of showing the cutting edge health care system and health message of one of the longest living people groups on earth. I was challenged and inspired, both to live more healthfully, and to be a more excellent nurse. I highly recommend this film to anyone even remotely interested in religion or in health. It beautifully portrays God's desire for each one of us to prosper and to be in good health.",5.0
Martin Doblmeier did a great job with this documentary. He covers a brief history of the Adventist Church and ties this to a healthy lifestyle as taught and practiced by the church members. He highlights the present cutting edge medical work and facilities that are working to help people reach a healthy life.  There is more to the Adventist church than a healthy lifestyle but this film does a nice job covering that area. I was given a copy of this dvd to review but had already seen it and was planning on getting my own copy anyway.,5.0
"This documentary is a great overview of the Adventist Church's health mission, history, and facilities. Doblmeier is a wonderful filmmaker who has really captured the essence of Adventism in an unbiased manner.

This is a must-see for anyone who is either looking to further understand Seventh-day Adventists, or for Adventists who want to see how others (non Adventists) view the Church.

Kudos!",5.0
"I AM AN ADVENTIST, SO PERHAPS I AM SLIGHTLY BIASED, BUT I FOUND THIS DVD TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE  OF THE ADVENTIST PEOPLE.  IT DID NOT TELL MUCH ABOUT THE DOCTRINES THEMSELVES, BUT THAT IS OK, BECAUSE THIS DVD WAS MEANT TO BE ABOUT HEALTH AND WHY THE ADVENTISTS LIVE APPROXIMATELY 10 YEARS LONGER THAN MOST OTHER PEOPLE.  AT A LENGTH OF ABOUT ONE HOUR AND 15 MINUTES, IT IS FILLED FULL OF HELPFUL INFORMATION AND DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO BE BORING.  THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THE TITLE; IT LEADS ONE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FILM IS STRICTLY ABOUT THE ADVENTIST RELIGION, NOT THEIR HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED ""HEALTHY HABITS OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS"".",5.0
"Martin Doblmeier was the person to film and make this documentary about an obscure religion. I enjoyed the film. I did not give a full five stars because it only focused on diet and exercise. Mr. Doblmeier did very well with this, aspect. I would like to have seen more of the reasons behind for food and exercise and the spiritual part of this religion.

I recommend this film for anybody wanting to know more of Seventh-day Adventists;  but also pick up some of the recommended books and web sites for more information. I also have purchased more Adventist information, they have a wonderful health wise message.",5.0

"Martin Doblemeir did a great job again.  This one tells about how the medical
work has spread around the world.  He only touched the tip of this ohe but couldnt
possibly get a grip on it it is so mamouth.  When you travel anywhere in the world,
look for the nearest health care place and most of the time, you will find one of the
Adventist ones.",5.0
"I really wish I was one of the actors to proclaim the gospel of Christ Though I don't really know how many  Theater  courses that I would have to finished or whether I was supposed to be a film major for one them or not. But I enjoyed Adventism so much and its steadfast message that I always desire what they offer, despite individual folks in the church who might take God the wrong way who says salvation is personal.
  I hope to help the movement reach Holy Hollywood, in Jesus name Amen! I did pray a lot for Adventist film you know thank God For ""Good Good"" and goodies in The Adventist sectors. Oh! Ouch the Adventist Hospitals are so good so does the vegan and vegeterian well prepared food.
Jesus loves for giving us good and steady Adventist film in this day and age. Thank God for Chef Boyardventist

"The Adventists 2 was an amazing insight into the motivation behind Adventist Health Care Missions.  As a veterinarian and a life-long Adventist, I have had clients who sought me out because of their experience with Adventist physicians.  This documentary offered an in-depth view of the state of Adventist Healthcare and especially the philosophy and vision which the Adventist Church brings to it.  I found myself watching with pride as physicians were interviewed who were truly motivated not by economic gain, but by the opportunity to serve - to serve their God and to serve their fellow men and women.  Some of those physicians were people with whom I had gone to college.  This film makes me proud that my son is currently in medical school at Loma Linda University, where he is exposed to this amazing service-oriented philosophy and mission-minded provision of health care.  Thanks for this insight into the world of Adventist healthcare.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to gain the same insights or those who doubt that a church organization can achieve unselfish service.",5.0

"If I had to describe this film with one word, it would be 'inspirational!'  It demonstrates effectively how the Adventists are putting God's word in action by 'doing for the least of these.'  The film made me stop and take stock of my own life!",5.0

"I may be considered a little biased as my family spent 3 1/2 years as medical missionaries in Brazil working with the Seventh-day Adventists. Before becoming an Adventist myself about 15 years ago, I had never even heard of Seventh-day Adventists. Even today, many other denominations are still confused about who Adventists are, even though the Kelloggs cereal company was started by Adventists as part of their medical/health evangelism. Don't take others people's word for it, check them out for yourselves, Adventists are in more parts of the world, have more schools, more hospitals, than any other Protestant denomination. Are some of their doctrines unique? Yes, but most assuredly they are Biblical. I personally had read the Bible through many times and wondered where the churches were that preached the Bible as written before I became an Adventist. Adventists are not ""New Testament"" Christians they are ""Bible"" Christians. The video does a great job of bringing out the medical-missionary work.",5.0

"Doblmeier has done it again. After watching this excellent film on the medical and altruistic ministry of the Seventh-day Adventists, I felt very uplifted to know that there are people that put their effort into tangible and practical ways for the common good. Martin Doblmeier has done the Christian community a service telling us about different Christian stories of 'faith being alive' (see his commentary in the special feature of the ""director's Comments"" on the DVD) in people's lives. His work on Dietrich Bonheoffer and the Power of Forgiveness of the small community of the Amish people were second to none. And with this second serving of the Seventh-day Adventist Medical and Philanthropic Mission to the far corners of the world, he continues to tell a story of the faith that is active and that makes a difference. I highly recommend this film and anticipate many great documentaries from Doblmeier's creative filmaking and intentional and energetic filmosophy.",5.0
"Adventists 2 is a great documentary. It tells the stories of people helping other people in all parts of the world. The cinematography is professionally done with beautiful views of exotic locations. The stories flow nicely along and kept me interested during the entire film. Overall, I place this movie at the top of my list of favorite documentaries. It is on par with any other docs I've seen.",5.0
"The Adventists 2 moved me.  It portrayed the Adventists' ability and determination to make a difference in the far corners of the world.  These people would have dedicated their lives with no desire for recognition nor do they care whether or not anyone even knows what they were giving....and in most cases, these people have dedicated their entire lives to helping people medically.  Thank Goodness there are people like this director, Doblmeier, who are willing to follow them LITERALLY to the ""far and dangerous corners of the world"" to tell us their heart-warming stories.  Totally enjoyable learning experience for anyone and everyone!  I TOTALLY recommend.",5.0
"I watched both ADVENTISTS and ADVENTISTS 2, and highly recommend both movies. They have made me think how health is the most important thing for each person - young or old, rich or poor. Unfortunately, so many people around the world don't have the access to quality healthcare. The ADVENTISTS 2 tells stories of doctors and nurses who travel to most remote places in the world and try to improve health of the local population.

Excellent movie!",5.0
"Adventists 2 was shown at SON Screen. I liked it even better than the first film. Afterwards the young camera man, a graduate from Southern Adventist University who Doblmeier hired, talked about his experiences making the film. There are several surgery scenes and he described trying to get good shots while still staying out of the way of the doctors. The film also tells the story of a group from Kettering that regularly does short term mission trips. As usual, Doblmeier has done an excellent job.",5.0
I really enjoyed seeing some of the world's healthiest people who also live longer.  I just wish the documentary was longer....and contained more information about how they live their everyday lives.  I don't know how difficult this life style would be to copy in my life.  I would like to know more.  Longevity really is a big interest and avoiding illness really interests me.,5.0

"George Lucas said it himself when he reviewed it, ""this movie is the life story I wish i had."" With it's references to all 3 of the star wars movies and the great acting, George Lucas in love is possibly one of  the greatest short films ever made. I'm not the only one who thinks so.  Apparently the people at the Texas Film Festival, the U.S. Comedy Arts  Festival, and the Tahoe International Film Festival, who gave such awards  the 2000 Audience Choice Award and the  2000 Best Short Film think's it's  pretty funny too.",5.0

"1967 film student George Lucas has writer's block trying to finish his ""Space Wheat"" script, until a beautiful fellow student with a familiar hairstyle teaches him that the best stories are in plain sight.
Full of cleverly subtle (and some not-so-subtle) references to  ""Star Wars"" and George Lucas's other films, this film has taken  its place on the list of great ""Star Wars"" spoofs. A short film  that gets better with each viewing.",5.0
"An ultra-funny parody of the college life of George Lucas and how he was inspired to write the ""Star Wars"" trilogy.",5.0
"The plot of this short film revolves around the young George Lucas in his senior year of film school. He's trying to write a great agricultural space epic, but can't seem to put anything together until he meets a beautiful girl with big hair in the student theatre. She encourages him to write what he knows and from there it's movie history.
The DVD version of this short film includes a short commentary by the film's creators, an enhanced version of the film (basically a pop-up video trivia veiwing), a short ""making of"" documentary, chapter search, and a ""special"" secret feature (the code number is 1138). For being a short film, a lot of these features seem redundant. However, they fit in with the spirit of the film and make the DVD that much more entertaining.
Also included on the DVD are three other shorts. EVIL HILL is a parody of the Austin Powers films and the movie NOTTING HILL. A young Mr. Evil (he's not a doctor yet) is treated like a monster by the people in his small town in Bavaria. However, one day Marilyn Monroe wanders into his children's book store and his life is changed forever.
FILM CLUB is a parody of the movie FIGHT CLUB. If you haven't seen the movie, this short parody will make no sense whatsoever. The final short is SWING BLADE, a parody of SLING BLADE and SWINGERS. That short is filmed as a coming attraction and shows what would happen if Karl from SLING BLADE moves to L.A. and hooks up with the gang from SWINGERS.
Overall, a highly entertaining DVD that fans of STAR WARS and/or film buffs will enjoy.",5.0
"I've been a Star Wars fan for all of my 20 years and was very impressed by this short film.  I had heard of this fan-fiction short film on the internet but never bothered to download it.  Recently I saw it at a local media store for (a low price) previously viewed on DVD and promplty grabbed it (just got a DVD player and the only other movie I had was Spaceballs).  This short movie was absolutely amazing.  I assure you the only way it could be any better - a full length movie instead of a short film.  My DVD wasn't macrovision encoded so you get awesome video quality - much better than you'd get downloading the film from the web.  Plus a great musical score, scene selection (really necessary on a short film?) and 3 other short films that are also worth watching, especially Evil Hill... Be sure to see Mediatrip.com for the code to unlock the secret bonus section, its worth your time!",5.0
"I haven't seen either ""Swing Blade"" (although I love the concept) or ""Evil Hill"", but I've seen (and laughed myself almost into a hernia) both ""Lucas in Love"" and ""Film Club.""
One reviewer complained about how ""Film Club"" is only funny to people with noses in the air.  Quite the opposite, although only film geeks will get it.  A deserving mocking of both David Fincher's pretentious feature and the rules of Dogme 95 (which has produced some breathtakingly stupid, boring, and cliched movies), this is a stone riot.
""Lucas In Love"" anyone will get, probably as much a tribute to Star Wars' pop cultural presence as anything.  It's not mean-spirited or ironic in any way (well, okay, maybe Lucas' ""source"" for the Force cuts a little closer to the bone than the rest of the gags if you know some Warsies), it's light, simple fun.
Definitely this is worth fifteen bucks.  If nothing else, it's a great party disc!",5.0
"This was a very good short.  I love the way it shows how George Lucas got all of his ideas about how he wrote starwars.  The cast was very good also, who ever played Yoda I think did a fantastic job, I thought that was the best part of the movie.
  Oh and no, I am not a Starwars fan at all, even if you've only seen bits and pieces of starwars this movie is hilairious.  I don't think I ever sat through the whole starwars movie before and I thought this was great.
  If you are a big fan of Austin Powers you should get this one too.  Evil Hill was a good one too.  Swing Blade was even better.  But I did not like Film Club, I thought it was kind of stupid but there was some funny stuff in there.",5.0
"George Lucas in Love may very well be the ""Form"" of a short film - what the perfect short film should be, in a higher realm of understanding.  A low-budget, well-shot, beautifully scored, and endlessly engaging piece of work, Joe Nussbaum's clever little feature never falls into film-school pretentiousness or short-film stupidity.  Although it is a one-joke premise, the directing and editing manage to keep things moving fast enough that it doesn't get old.
The 8-minute short opens with George Lucas, in his last semester at film school, unable to finish his final project, Space Wheat, which begins ""Not Long Ago in a Nearby Galaxy.""  His teacher (a stubby guy who talks like a certain Jedi Master) is no real help, and it isn't until he meets a girl with hair wrapped tightly in donut-buns (a stunning Lisa Jakob, of Independence Day fame) that he finds a muse who encourages the young Lucas to ""write what he knows.""  What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history.
As much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail.  A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - ""Evil Hill"" (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air.  Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of ""didja get it?  didja?  aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet).
The DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a ""making of"" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.
Is it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.  Besides, it's great to roll out for your friends and show them without boring them.",5.0

"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities, we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love, I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan, you might also want to try Hardware Wars.",5.0
"As a Star Wars fan, I wasn't sure what to expect from this short film. Buying it more on a whim than for any other reason, I popped it in the VCR and promptly laughed so hard that I nearly fell out of my chair! The worst thing about the film is that it is so short, the best thing is that it is short enough that you can go back and watch it over and over in order to catch the lines and nuances you'll miss while laughing so hard. This film imaginatively captures the genesis of every Star Wars character and does a wonderful job of showing a ""plausible"" reason for George Lucas to have created his masterpiece. Star Wars fanatics and casual fans alike will enjoy this extremely well done short film. In my opinion, it would make a great addition to any video collection.",5.0
"Wow! During the 9 minute span of this short film, these folks were able to throw in every Star Wars/Lucas joke possible (even the low-blow ""Howard the Duck"" joke before the credits). ""George Lucas In Love"" is some wildly funny and entertaining stuff! The character swaps keep the humor moving, yet the nice production gives the film a professional gloss.
For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD, the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well! ""Evil Hill"" and ""Swingers"" are slightly less affective than the feature, but very funny nonetheless. ""Film Club"" was just. . . silly! The tons of extras included also add to the viewer's entertainment factor.",5.0
"The sentiment of ""why buy it when you can download it for free?"" isn't even close to being valid here. It's just not possible to appreciate the excellent production and effort that went into this short on a jumpy computer screeen.  This is a real film, worthy of a full-size theater. Lacking that, your TV is the next best thing. Even if you already have the VHS, you won't regret buying the DVD. It's not just the lovely print and sound of the title short, but the copious extras which make this DVD a real bargain. The background and commentary on George Lucas in Love is great, though much of the information is repeated in various forms. Still, it's fun to know how this short came about, and to realize it was truly a professional production all the way around. The additional short films are great to have as well, though you can tell their budgets are far smaller than that of GLIL! Swing Blade is laugh-out-loud funny, but the Film Club short is not to be overlooked. It's a spot-on parody of the Fight Club trailer--the detail is perfect, right down to Brad Pitt's gestures and Edward Norton's expressions. Any fan of Fight Club (and if you have a DVD player you MUST have a copy of Fight Club, right?) will get a big kick out of it. The Evil Hill parody--despite a terrific Dr. Evil impression by Timothy Dowling--is slow and uninspired. This is the guy who thought a live-action Rugrats movie would be a good idea. Mr. Dowling is clearly talented, but judging from this work he needs to stay friends with people who can tell him when his ideas stink. Come to think of it, George Lucas could use a bit of that kind of help as well.",5.0
"This parody on ""Shakespeare in Love"" mixed with ""Star Wars"" is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time, he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately, the script for ""Star Wars"" is all about him, he only needs to open his eyes and see it.
The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.
The DVD is well done, but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching.",5.0
"After reading the customer reviews of this fantastic short film, I find it amazing that the ones who violently depise it fail to realize one simple fact:
This is NOT A STAR WARS PARODY!  It is a SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE parody!  Okay?!?!  All the Star Wars fans who dissed this film for making ""hackneyed Star Wars references"" for no reason at all do not realize that the references are not STAR WARS references, they are references to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  It doesn't surprise me at all that a healthy chunk of Star Wars fans haven't seen or even know what SHAKESPEARE is about.  I guess if a movie doesn't have action figures made from it or can't be found at one of those insipid sci-fi conventions, then it must not be worth watching, huh?  Let's also keep in mind these are liekly the same morons who gave good reviews to PHANTOM MENACE.
Yikes.",5.0
"I've seen other Star Wars parodies, and this one is up there with the best of them, not only parodying Star Wars, but 1999 Best Picture Shakespeare in Love.

"I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out, with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs, with its jabs, too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love, I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!
What's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen, that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!",5.0
"I saw this when I was scanning for another movie on Amazon. I read the reviews. Then I saw that it was only 9 minutes. I did some more shopping a  month later and I remembered this film. I was still intrigued. I loved all  of the behind the scenes stuff about Star Wars, and George Lucas is such an  incredible visionary. So I said, ""What the heck"" and bought the  movie. The most deciding factor was actually all the rave reviews that  people left.  Well I got the film and I was impressed. In such a short  film, go get so much out of it, and feeling like I just stepped out of a  Star Wars movie when I got done - just that overpowering feeling that  simply is awe...

I'd highly recommend this for any Star  Wars fans - it's definitely good for a laugh.",5.0
"This is by far the greatest short film of the year. Being a spoof is one thing but being a good spoof on a great concept is what makes this video outstanding. Everything from the Vader-esque neighbor to the beard on  ""Lucas'"" chin is relevent in either the fabled  ""Trilogy"" or real life. This director knew what he was doing and  did it with passion. To reiterate: This is the a truly wonderful comedy  about an absolutley amazing man. It gets my thumb way up.",5.0
"This is truly one of the funnier Star Wars things I have ever seen. There seems to always be a Mad magazine spoof, or references to the Trilogy + 1 in a Kevin Smith film, and while these kinds of pop culture type references  are amusing, I have to say this short blows anything else away. And the  thing with this is you get the references, they are right there in the  open, no thinking involved and you laugh everytime. For Amazon's asking  price.... and if you are hoplessly devoted to the Saga..... then buy this  film.",5.0
"Reading many of these reviews after having seen the movie myself, I've come to the conclusion MANY seem to agree with: This was an amazing film, and those who criticize it are upset that they didn't think of the idea  first! It was a 9-minute independent film, and yet wove through Star Wars,  George Lucas, and Shakespeare in Love so slyly, that you must applaud Mr.  Nussbaum, Mr. Dowling, and Mr. Levy for an amazing piece of cinema.
To  those who criticize, go ahead and nag! The people, however, have spoken,  making it the most downloaded movie ever on the Internet, and I understand  that Mr. Nussbaum is the talk of Hollywood as the next big director out of  USC. Don't take my word for it - Read the Wall Street Journal, People  Magazine, and the New York Times! If the biggest complaint is that 'Lucas'  isn't long enough, it's a testament to the genius and skill of those  involved. Bravo!",5.0
George Lucas In Love is an excellent example of what a student film should be:  It gives us a taste of the director's style.  The fact that he was able to add so many elements to a nine minute film is truly outstanding!

"GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE is a parody of ""Shakespeare in Love"" featuring the life of a 1967 George Lucas in USC film school.  This film is less than 10 minutes long, but manages to cram joke after joke in, alluding  to many of the characters George Lucas has created for his films (not  limited to the STAR WARS films).
The filming, acting, and score is  superb.  My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough.  I also  feel like the script could have used a little more polish.  However, this  short film is a fun and diverting fantasy, adding another dimension of  folklore to the layered theories surrounding the STAR WARS series and its  much-revered creator.",5.0
"I loved this movie!  It's too bad it's so short!  My wife didn't get it -- she thought it was about the making of Star Wars, even though she made me watch Shakespeare in Love.  I have to watch Shakespeare in Love again just  to see how George Lucas in Love parodies it.  I can't believe it is a  student production because it is so sophisticated.",5.0
THIS JUST IN: THE NOODLE HAS WON THE RACE!,5.0
"For fans of Star Wars, this is an absolute must see!  Fans of Shakespeare in Love will roll when they see this movie, for the simple fact that they will pick up many of the subtleties of humor that us ""just plain""  Star Wars fans would probably miss.
For my own part, after reading the  reviews of this movie when in first came out, I went to the website and  watched the movie online before I bought it.  The blatant Star Wars  allusions -- from the asthmatic rival, to the not-so-subtle background  action -- are absolutely hysterical, but I knew that I was missing  something.  That night, I went to the video store and rented SIL just so I  could understand what it had to do with the parody.  I can now say with  absolute assurance that if you're a fan of both films, George Lucas in Love  will probably be the best parody you will ever see!
Oh... one more thing  -- if you watched this movie on the Web and thought it was hilarious, I  would still encourage you to buy it.  There is a surprise ending on the  video (not shown on the Internet version) that is, in my opinion, the best  moment in the whole film.  What is it, you ask?  Now now, you'll have to  buy it, and see for yourself!",5.0
"Several reviewers around here really seem to want a lot from a 9 minute film.
'George Lucas In Love' was a very fun short. From Lucas' roommate Benji talking about an 'all powerful force' to his friends Hal & Chuck  working on Hal's 'fastest thing on campus' to a professor whose speech  patterns resembled a well known Jedi Master, this film has a heck of a lot  crammed into it's 9 minutes.  If anything, the filmmakers should have done  a 15-20 minute film! The film was very clever and enjoyable. Maybe just a  tad bit funnier than 'Hardware Wars'.
The music, cinematography, and  acting are all very good, indeed.  Anyone who didn't enjoy this at least a  little really needs to get a sense of humor.  Of course, it's a bit cheesy,  but it's meant to be that way.  It's presented in the slightly corny,  overblown way that 'Hardware Wars' or the 'Naked Gun' films were. The same  people who didn't understand those films probably won't understand 'George  Lucas In Love'.  It's not a 'great' film, but who cares?  It's a fun little  short by a guy who really loves 'Star Wars'.  Some have condemned the  filmmakers doing this just for the money. I seriously doubt that Mr.  Nussbaum will make a huge fortune from this film and if he does, big deal.  Nothing wrong with making money from doing what you love or making money at  all. Surely, none of the people who reviewed this film would go and work at  their jobs for free and live in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere!  Anyway, GLIL is great fun and a great to watch before your next screening  of 'Phantom Menace' or the original trilogy.",5.0
Very Clever! Well Acted! A downright good time. Good god I sound like a jerk. But it was good.,5.0
"You don't have to be a genius to understand the magic behind this video. You get to see in a, parotical sense, the experiances that inspired the work of George Lucas. Believe it or not, it's hilarious. Calling this movie a waste of money just tells us how dense you are. This Video Rocks!  END",5.0
"Great short film!  Well worth it...funny movie.  If you're a true Star Wars fan, then you shouldn't be without this in your collection!  A++",5.0
"A really good, short film full of excellent observations. Worth adding to any order. I hope this film maker can maintain the same humor-density in his further work.",5.0
"Fans of the Star Wars movies will find a lot to laugh about (particularly if they are observant) during this short but extremely funny movie. For me, much of the humor came as the young George Lucas interacted with characters  and events in college that were strangely familiar....
Someone who isn't  a fan of the Star Wars universe (is there such a person?) won't get most of  the inside jokes and references to the movies, and some things will fly  over their heads entirely. But they should still find something to laugh  about.
The sound, visuals, and storyline are all extremely professional,  and it's refreshing to see something so witty and well-written come out of  a low-budget environment. The people that made this have a lot of talent.",5.0
"I've been hoping I would see this in a hardback book version as well! Full of humor and information on THE MAN George Lucas, himself, his films, and his life.
Great for fans of all his works or just the Star Wars saga  fans!",5.0
"As far as comic shorts go, this one is a gem.  For those of you who find fault with story developement, originality, etc. (see other reviews here), I have this to say: it's a short film, not a feature film, and so by  defition it's not gonna give you what you can get in 120 minutes of screen  time.  But what Joe Nussbaum does in eight minutes puts to shame most of  the slop churned out in Hollywood.  It's probably harder to do something  good and funny in eight minutes than it is in a feature length film, and  this homage/spoof delivers the goods.  The details are dead on, the writing  is crisp and funny, the acting perfectly in tune with the spirit of the  project.  So everyone just relax and enjoy Lucas in Love for what it is.",5.0
"Being a long time Star Wars fan, this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.
This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.
This is not a spoof of Star Wars, but rather a spoof of  ""Shakespeare in Love"", with a Star Wars theme to it.
I give  this one two thumbs up.",5.0
"...the result is hilarious!
An asthmatically sinister neighbor who sounds surprisingly similar to Darth Vader; a hairy friend who groans like Chewbacca; a college student who beeps and bleeps like R2D2 with his tall  friend who answers him like C-3PO; a girl with very interesting hair buns  on either side of her head, who is leading a rebellion; a teacher who talks  backwards, and just when he almost starts to make sense, he says, ""Too  much have I already said.""  They manage to cram all that and so much  more into 9 minutes of hilarious movie.  I especially like the twist at the  end (and you'll have to watch the movie to find out what it is). :-)
This  is the story of George Lucas' inspiration for writing ""Star Wars""  a la Shakespeare in Love.
This video is great!  It's also nice to watch  it on video, since in the past (before I got the video) I watched it  online, and every time, I ran into net congestion.  No net congestion with  a video. :-)",5.0
"I saw this when it was originally distributed as quasi-samizdat, and it's great. The acting is quite fine with it being played totally straight. It's worth visualizing Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars briefly before watching  if only to help catch all the little jokes. Great casting.",5.0
"This inspired parody is a classic, whether or not you are a SW fan.  The references are outstanding, including the one non SW reference that very few people seem to get.  The casting was phenomenal, the screen wipes an  expert touch and the cinematography very well done.  At 8 minutes long, it  is a perfect length for a short so as to grab your attention and let you  know that these young prodigies are capable of anything in the world.  Well  done, to all involved!",5.0
"Belle parodie,de la part de ces tudiants, de ce film culte qu'est STAR WARS.On peut tout particulirement fliciter l'interprte du futur  Chewbacca qui mriterait aussi bien l'Oscar pour ce film que Gwyneth  Paltrow pour SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.",5.0
"What most people don't see at first is how well Nussbaum captured the opening sequence from SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and meddled it seemlessly with more STAR WARS riffs than a Pepsi commercial.
I've seen enough BAD  shorts in my time to know when someone really, truly puts in the effort to  make something special. Well executed and well directed, I'm sure Joe will  have fun with any movie endeavor he takes on in the future.",5.0
"This is one of the most original and creative spoofs I have ever seen.  Who would have thought that Lucas was inspired in such wacky ways?  All true Star Wars fans should own their own copy of this film.  All true  Shakespeare in Love fans should own one too, for that matter.  I am looking  forward to seeing more from these guys!",5.0
"Independent Short films are not supposed to be this good, but an artistic and talented director can take a non-studio group of actors and a superb crew (editing, producing, and scoring in particular) and create something  truly incredible. The story-weaving is amazing, and feels like a true  post-modernist film rather than your basic satire. If I were a movie exec,  I'd be after Mr. Nussbaum in a second for a feature project! I look forward  to his studio directing debut. (Maybe Lucas will let him direct the next  Star Wars movie - Nussbaum would probably do a better job!)",5.0

Ms. Stevens not only tells you how to reduce your advertising costs on this medium, she presents it in the DVD format, which most of us find easier to comprehend than written book material. This is particularly true when she demonstrates actual examples of how to impliment the secrets she teaches us.

"My girlfriend, who became interested in Korean food, caught some of Kimchi Chronicles on Public TV.  Suffice it to say, she had to have the series. What we received was not merely a foodie's delight, but an interesting melange of Korean history, personal journey, travel documentary, comedy, and, quite unexpectedly, hang out sessions with Hugh Jackman who serves, at times, as narrator as well as companion discovering Korean food. Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who happens to be the host's husband, helps with some of the cooking. I found it particularly fascinating seeing him make observations about how Korean food  breaks the fundamental rules of his traditional French cuisine and somehow comes together in ways ways that his culinary training can't account for. You'll see Marja cooking with for her family and friends after visits to a variety of sites in Korea.",5.0

"I don't know why people like The gospel of John better.  I never had.  Matthew is so much better.  I saw an edited version of Matthew on tbn in '94 and thought it was great. and bought the 4 tape vhs in '96.  and got the dvd in 2000. Matthew portrayel of Jesus was unlike any portrayel I ever saw before.  from his tender compassion to jolly sense of humor to his serious side.  Bruce does a great job of acting.  A must see.

but when John came out in '03, it wasn't anything like Matthew.  I was highly disappointed.  He wasn't half as jolly as Bruce.  I guess I was expecting something like Matthew.",5.0
"This approach to Matthews's Gospel was superbly done.  The original text is used unexpurgated, but with the entire story acted out in full colour.  Anyone thinking of starting to take an interest in the Bible would be very well advised to buy this DVD.  And if you are sufficiently enthralled, there is a similar one based on the book of Acts.",5.0
We are using this for our small group study and the visual interpretation along with the word for word translation make this an exceptional learning tool.,5.0
"I thorougly enjoyed the Book of Matthew not only because it followed the NIV transalation word for word but the portrayal of Jesus was superb!  I've never seen a more human example of Jesus Christ.  He was playful, full of joy, and compassionate.  This is a MUST SEE!  The Falling Fire movie was also good but more of a dramatic portrayal than a word for word account.",5.0
"Outstanding Performance by Bruce Marchiano& Richard Kiley. Jesus is Incredibly Loving and kind. One is drawn to Him(Jesus) by His love and compassion. The healing scenes are very moving. I do believe that Jesus was just as Excited as those who were healed because He loved meeting the needs of people and showing His love. His non-verbal communication of Joy shouted His Love to People. His message is Love. How can we help but love Him and Give Him our all. Yes Bruce Marchiano captured the Love of Christ to us, manifest by ""The Joy of the Lord"". Richard Kiley is also marvelous in his role as narrator and Tax Collector Matthew. Outstanding Film ...It will touch your heart with the love and Joy of the Lord!",5.0
"Having not seen the dvd before buying it (a friend recommended it) all I can say is WOW. An incredible portrayal of someone who would have attracted the crowds that the actual Jesus did. It was a pleasure to witness a Jesus that was not somber, depressing or scary as in so many other movies about Jesus. As a preacher of the Gospel, I will show this again and again to whomever will give me the time to do so. You can follow along in your bible as it gives the verse reference for every word in the bottom right of the screen. Five stars is not enough for this movie. I cant wait to receive the Acts dvd that I just ordered.",5.0
"Using the NIV text as the basis, these DVD's are a film recording of the gospel of Matthew.  All the dialog, narration, everything is directly from the Bible.
The wonder of these videos, however, is the fact that they are able to make you think.  While sticking so closely to the Bible and with well researched visuals, the producers, directors, and actors give their own interpretation of the story, which allows you to open your eyes to something new.  The best example of this is Bruce Marchiano's portrayal of Jesus.  Instead of the solemn, serious person you usually picture, here we see a person who enjoyed life, laughed, and had some fun in between dealing with the serious issues of life.  When I first watched these videos, it made me look at my preconceived ideas of God very differently.
While expensive, these DVD's are worth checking out for a different perspective on a familiar tale.",5.0

"I was so excited to see this new Bible Study from Lysa TerKeurst. I LOVED Made to Crave and was thrilled to see not only a new book by Lysa, but also an Interactive Workbook and a 6 part DVD series called ""What Happens When Women Say Yes to God""!

I received the the DVD series and the workbook in the mail to review from Harvest House Publishers.

This is a wonderful series speaking exactly to where women are today. We do need to be willing to say Yes to God!

One of my favorite phrases from this study is, ""When the Messiah touches our mess, it becomes our message to the world.""

We all have a story, a mess that God has or can touch and He wants us to say YES, to allow Him to use those things in our lives for His glory.

Such a powerful word from Lysa!

The description of the workbook says, ""Excellent for individuals or groups, this workbook companion to the DVD helps women discover and delight in God's joy and purpose for their lives."" It does that through personal questions, activities and discussions. There are a few lessons in the workbook to go with each session which allows you to dig deeper into what Lysa taught during the week's DVD session.

I am excited to use this material in my women's Sunday School class and give them the opportunity to go through this study again with me!",5.0

  Oddly enough, I really believe that this movie was a large contributing factor to my choice of archaeology as a career. This movie is a classic. It encourages real world participation and is still able to make me laugh. As soon as I have children, this will be the first video that they ever watch.",5.0
"I first saw this film back in 1983. I must have been about seven. I remember when it first premiered on PBS (Channel 11 in Chicago, where I grew up). My sister and I were allowed to stay up late on a Sunday night just to watch it. Then I didn't see it again for many years until I found it for sale on Amazon.

It's such a cute video. The adults of Sesame Street take Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and some of the kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Just as the museum is about to close, Big Bird says that Snuffy was supposed to meet him. Of course this draws a lot of moans and groans from the adults, as Snuffy wouldn't make his debut for two more years. Big Bird sneaks away to find Snuffy just as the museum is closing! It becomes a game of cat and mouse as the night guard is sure that something weird is going on and the gang just slips by him. But the biggest story is that Snuffy and Big Bird meet an ancient Egyptian prince named Sahou. Sahou has been trying to get into Heaven for 3,000 years but he can't because he can't answer a riddle. Big Bird and Snuffy come to the rescue to come up with the answer.

There are also some cute little songs in here, like ""Mothers and Children,"" sung by Olivia, ""Don't eat the Pictures,"" done by Cookie Monster and the Girls, and ""You'll get Home Soon,"" by Big Bird and Sahou. I liked this video and I plan to share it with my own children someday because it opens up the world of art appreciation to them. Very well done. And no Elmo!",5.0
"Loved it then and still loving it now!  Only wish it was on dvd and that

the songs would become available on cd!",5.0
"As a kid, I used to watch Sesame Street, a show that was by then a classic. My parents bought this film from the library and my sister and I watched it constantly. My dad still remembers songs from the film and my sister and I reminisce about it.

The plot of the story is that the kids and the puppets get locked into a museum overnight. They get to tour the area without being bothered by others. Oscar the Grouch sings a song about wonderful trash, referring to the broken statues all around him. Cookie Monster sings the title song when he gets hungry from looking at still life paintings all night. Big Bird and Snuffy find an Egyptian Prince and attempt to help him become a star in the sky like his parents. Everything that happens is entertaining and educational.

Not only does this film address a side of schooling that isn't always addressed in schools, art, it is a great way for parents to spend time with their children and help them to grow.",5.0
"I've been looking for this movie on DVD for quite some time.  This is one of my absolute favorite muppet movies, let alone Sesame Street. What I love about Sesame Street, the Sesame Street I grew up with anyways, is that little kids love it and it is educational, but there are enough jokes that parents can laugh and enjoy it as well.  This movie is no exception. I'm 20, and first saw it when I was 4 or 5.  It still holds up and is just as great as I remember.",5.0
"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this movie. I believe that every child should see this movie. Not only did it foster my love for all things Ancient Egyptian, it introduced art to me in such a wonderful way. My parents always remember how they took me to the Met and i shouted ""SAHU"" into every corridor searching for the little prince. If you are a parent PLEASE buy this for your child, they will thank you for years to come!!!",5.0
"This is my favorite Seame Street Video.  I have always like the way Big Bird ans Snuffy helped Prince Sau.  It is a great way to show kids about ancient Egypt.  It is out of print because it has David who is not on the show anymore.  I wis they would put it on DVD because I know kids today would enjoy it reguardless.

It is funny whe Cookie Monster sings the Don't eat the pictures song after wanting to eat all of the food pictures after being stuck in the museum all night.

This is a great way for kids to learu about Museums.

"We bought this video in 1996 for our first child and we are now using it for our third.  This is a wonderful video, probably the best in our collection.  It is calming and sweet but also entertaining.  It works too...it always calms them down and puts the baby to sleep.  Our oldest, now nine, still enjoys watching it, and the two younger ones (1 and 4) share a room and both really enjoy it.  The songs are nice and the skits are fun but calming.  My favorite part is the moon and sky story, but I also like the rest of the video as well.  It is calming to hear in the background, because I know soon they will be asleep!",5.0
"This movie is fantastic.  It is the first appearance of Snuffleupagus, which is great, because as a little kid, I kept on insisting that I could see him too and my mom was starting to worry!

I strongly urge anyone to find this movie anyway they can.  Adults and kids alike will enjoy it for years to come.",5.0
"My almost-4-year-old really gets a big kick out of this tape, as does her little 1 1/2 year old sister. It's amusing for them because it features some really silly short films and cartoons. It's amusing for me because of the Siskel and Ebert-style format with Oscar and Telly. It's one tape I don't mind playing for them frequently because It appeals to me as well.",5.0
"You cannot go wrong with this bundle. I grew up in the 70's and 80's watching Sesame Street. My son has been watching Sesame Street since he was 11 months old and has learnt so much from the shows. We are fortunate in Australia the show is aired weekdays, the only down side is we only have a few of the dvd's available to purchase. So I didn't hestitate in purchasing them from ""AMAZON"". You won't be disappointed, this is children's viewing at it's best, and you too will enjoy watching Elmo and friends on Sesame Street.",5.0
"My daughter loves Sesame Street, so we picked up this video on a whim.  Great purchase!  At 20 months old, she says her alphabet and counts to 15.  It's not just number recognition, either -- she counts items on pages of books and groups of toys.  She loves Ernie and Baby Bear, and loves to sing along and dance to the songs.  We're very pleased!",5.0
"Sesame Street specials are always wonderful, but this hour long movie, filmed when Sesame Street was in its prime, is just spectacular.  It remains one of my favorite ways to cheer myself up (I'm 27).  When Big Bird wanders off near closing time to meet Snuffleupagus, and the rest of the Sesame Street monsters and humans try frantically to find him, they all get locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  The rest of the video, which amounts to the bulk of the story, revolves around three main storylines:  1.)  everyone trying to find Big Bird while avoiding the suspicious but clueless mustachio-ed museum security guard, 2.)  everyone discovering and enjoying the museum in the process, and 3.) Big Bird and Snuffleupagus helping a little Egyptian boy named Sahu prove his inner worth in a yearly ""test"", so that the god Osiris will let him join his parents as stars in the sky.  There is enough of a storyline to ensnare even those with the shortest of attention spans, children and adults alike, and quite a bit of comic relief to lighten the way.  Watching straight-arrow Bob as he runs around trying to keep Cookie Monster from scarfing down the Still Lives, while a group of dancing Monster-ettes sings the doo-wop title tune: ""Don't eat the pictures, no, no, no!"", is particularly amusing;  as are the scenes where Sahu's invisible cat, who still meows audibly, befuddles that poor hapless security guard.  The many many shots of the Museum interior are gorgeous, and a magical exposure/introduction to art and museums, in particular the paintings, sculpture, and medieval artifacts of the Met.  The video of course has a happy ending, but one that will bring tears to your eyes.  I watched this tape for the first time when I was 7 years old, and I must say that when as an adult I had my first opportunity to go to the Met in person, it was a truly awesome visit.  Another friend who had watched the movie as a child led me on what we called the Don't Eat the Pictures Tour, and she showed me every piece of art showcased in the movie.  Her tour ended at the Temple of Dendur itself, and as it was near closing time, it was dark outside with stars in the sky--just like the penultimate scene of DETP.  A memorable day, and a memorable movie.  It's a true gift from the Sesame Street gang to us, the viewing public.  You and your kids will love it.",5.0
"(Althought the titles differ, I believe this is the same as Sleepy Time Songs and Stories.)
We watch this about once a week (too often and we all get bored, no?) and every time it calms my 2 year-old who then goes to sleep quickly and soundly.  The songs are lovely and there is a delightful story about how the sun and the moon came to live in the sky which is narrated by Ozzie Davis.  The last song is a drift-y, dreamy sequence with balloons - a nice ending.
This does not have the usual frenetic Sesame Street pace/quality but is rather sweet and very relaxing.  Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster, Big Bird, etc.  (no Elmo).  Excellent!
We mix this goodnight video up with Kipper, Little People, Goodnight Moon and Maisy.  Sweet dreams!",5.0
"Parents,
In this rare Sesame Street video they go to the Metropolitan Museum Of Art. My 8 year old boy loves Coookie Monster so I tried to find a tape that included him. Big Bird goes gets Suffy to leave the museum but when he comes back to all his friend they were stuck in the museum. Cookie Monster sees a picture but Cookie Monster sings a song to don't eat the pictures.",5.0
I purchased Do The Alphabet for my boy/girl twins when they were 6 months old and they've been mesmerized by it since.  They are now 20 months old and are beginning to say the words of the alphabet song along with Big Bird and Baby Bear.  I think that this video and some of our other Sesame Street videos (like The Alphabet Jungle Game) have helped them begin to recognize and be able to say the letters sooner.  They are particularly fascinated with Baby Bear.  I would highly recommend this one!,5.0
My son who is 8 months old has watched this ABC video since he was 2 months old.  He still loves it and he now swings his arms and kicks his legs while watching it in his toddler chair.  I have the words memorized and if I sing him the ABC's his face lights up immediately!  Hopefully he's learning the alphabet!,5.0
"My daughter is two years olds. She loves these vidoes , escpecially the ernie 123. She can now count to 20 just from watching the video. The ABC vidoe has also helped her learn the ABC song. She has been watching and loving these vidoes since she was 14 months old. I don't like the way baby bear speaks in the abc vidoe, its confusing for little kids. The text and the adventure is simple enough for toddlers to enjoy, and not too annoying for parents to watch along.",5.0
"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney, this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.
Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift, but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl, and keep hoping that it will be released.
One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age, you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.
That is what indicates real staying power, not how many toys one can invent, market and make profit from.",5.0
"My 20 month old son absolutely loves this video. There are 5 or 6 songs in the hour long video, which he has fun dancing to.

This show is a hit in our house and I am sure it will be in yours too.",5.0
"This Sesame DVD has to be my favourite! And believe me, we have them ALL. I love the songs, which will have you singing long after the dvd is over. Very cute skits and characters, Grover is very lovable. The underlying message is eating healthy but kids will enjoy the music and skits so much they won't notice there is a great message as well! We liked this so much that we bought it for my now 7 year old twins years ago and have now bought it again for my 2 year old.",5.0
"We love this video!
We watch it over and over again. My son has always been a picky eater and this video has truly helped him to venture into trying new foods.",5.0
"I enjoyed this video more than I thought I would.  I don't know what my daughter will think of it (she's too young to watch it now), but I really bought it for myself.  I grew up on Sesame Street and although this is not like the traditional Sesame Street, the same loveable characters are there.  I've always had an interest in food and especially love seeing talking, singing animated/puppet food -- this did not disappoint!  Grover tries to stress the importance of trying new foods and Cookie Monster has a rap song about vegetables (because he wants to be clear that one should not just eat cookies).  I liked it so much that I want to watch it again!",5.0
"My daughter is only 9 months old, but on both occasions that we have watched it she immediately begins butt bouncing in excitement. The tunes are catchy (I LOVE CEREAL Girl!) and Its a throw back to classic sesame street for me.",5.0
As they say in espanol  ESTUPENDO.  Great songs fabulous presentation and it works. Couldn't rate it highly enough. Lo Mejor  The other titles I have purchased were also of a high standard and most enjoyable.,5.0
"As a mom, this is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and my two-year-old also loves it. Grover is my favorite character and I bought the video because Grover is featured on the cover. I love Grover's interactions with the ""blue man"" ...they are so funny. Along with Grover and the ""blue man"", there are great songs and videos of children eating and playing. Some of our favorites are... ""blueberry mouths"" and ""cereal girl"" . Excellent video!!",5.0
"I originally started with the Baby Bach and Mozart tapes for my baby boy, who is now 11 months (at about 4 months)but I could see he was getting bored with the Baby Einstein set.  I noticed he liked Sesame Street, so I purchased the ""123 Count with Me"", video - Well he is addicted!  He laughs along with Ernie and friends.  He also get's a real big kick out of the bellhop-rat!  It was by no choice of our own that my husband and I now know all the songs and can occasionally be found singing them at work and in other embarrassing public places.  I really think a child couldn't help to memorize 1-20 just by knowing the opening and closing songs.  I would just like to WARN you... no more ""News at 6"" or ""HBO"" once this video becomes a favorite!",5.0
"When Ernie drops by ""The Furry Arms"" hotel to return a missing key he found, he ends up giving everyone a lesson in counting, and also ends up getting hired as hotel manager! Ernie soon discovers that when he ""Dings The Dinger"", Benny The Bunny (Kevin Clash-who also does Elmo) will bring him something different everytime, depending on the number of times he dings. For example, when Ernie dings 3 times, Benny brings 3 pillows. Ernie however, does not need the pillows, and tells Benny he's glad he now knows what happens when he dings 3 times. This running gag goes during the entire video, and it gets quite funny. Most of the segments in this video are well chosen, such as a neat segment with singing crows, and the fantastic ""Honk Around The Clock""! I also find the new songs very catchy, and have found myself sing them quite often! This not only gets five stars becalse it's much better then ""The Great Numbers Game"", but also becalse it's extremely funny! In recent years, The Furry Arms seems to have been deleted from the show. Why? It was such a great place, and I liked Natasha's parents having a job! Oh, well. At least we have this video!",5.0
"My 21 month old son has watched this video countless times. It is hands down one of his favorites. This tape spotlights Ernie (one of his favorite Sesame Street characters) and includes Elmo in several segments - always a  plus.  The best part is he's already learned to count to ten. And although  he's watched this many times , I'm not at all sick of it.  The songs are  fun and catchy and in typical Sesame Street fashion, the muppets are clever  and entertaining, even for adults.  I highly recommend this video.",5.0

My 20 month old loves this film!!! He watches it and even tries to count with them. He knows the names of the characters too. It is a very colorful newer production as opposed to some of the films that have a bright cover but are really films from the early 90s. It does have a few throwback scenes in it which are all good. I would recommend this movie!!!,5.0

"I got this for my daughter to watch as an educational show rather than letting her watch what I consider more ""junk"" shows.  I don't like her watching too much TV but Grandma will let her watch plenty so it's easier to buy things like this and 'redirect' what she let's my daughter watch.  This is very engaging and educational.  My daughter loves all the sesame street characters.",5.0

"These DVD are just as pleasurable for the parents as for the tots! My little guy loves this video. The songs are catchy, the Muppets/puppets have great characters - yes even the surly rat bellhop.

Above and beyond the obvious counting lessons to be learned here, there are many many great tactics taught to little ones. They learn how to make work easier by using skills available, how to deal with not so nice people and how to do research!

One thing I didn't know was that Sesame Street is completely non-profit. All proceeds go to help children around the world enjoy the wonderful and proven learning techniques these programs has to offer.

So, now I can buy a DVD that my son loves and get the pleasure of knowing I'm doing good for someone else.",5.0
I bought this for our 2 year old who is learning to count.  He loves it!  It really adds to our Sesame Street collection.,5.0
"I was at walmart a few months ago and I found this dvd in the $5 bin. Up until then my son had been watching your baby can read. His vocabulary improved from your baby can read however they didn't include a segment on numbers in the first 3 dvd's. I picked this up hoping it would help us introduce him to numbers. I must say I didn't expect him to like it as much as he does. He was only about 15 or 16 months at the time, but he started asking to watch the movie everyday. So, we made it a routine every morning he watches it after breakfast and sometimes before bed. By 18 or 19 months my son was recognizing numbers and pointing them out whenever he saw them. My son is now 22months and he can count to 10 with no problem. I also let my god-daughter watch it, and after a few times she was counting and singing the songs as well. Her parents were desperate for a copy of their own, but couldn't find it at walmart. Amazon has it so I'm going to order a copy for her. I recommend this to any parent who wants to help their child learn their numbers. It really is a great tool and the songs are so catchy that you'll be singing along with your child.",5.0
Bought this for my daughter to go with the flash cards/book and she loves it. If you have a child that loves Seasame Street this is for you. It is educational and keeps my 18 month old daughter interested. You can't go wrong with seasame street. This is a win in my books.,5.0
"This movie is that perfect combination of educational, fun, and a real story. My kids love it, and it's enjoyable enough that I can sit through it as well, and even find myself humming the songs.

I bought this video for my 2 year-old son to help him learn his numbers. He absolutely loves singing the numbers and can count to 20 on his own. This is probably great for kids who love Muppets and love to sing.,5.0
"My daughter was 22 months old when we purchased this DVD and we alternated playing it daily for her, after naptime, with the Do the Alphabet DVD. Within 2-3 weeks she could count to 15 and one day surprised me by counting backwards using a number book we had. She is now 26 months old and is ready to count to 30 which we are working on. We incorporate counting and saying our alphabet letters throughout the day daily. Yesterday I parked in spot #21 which was very clearly labeled and she keeped saying ""12, 12, 12..."" I realized that we needed to advance her to learning more numbers b/c to her it looked like a 12 since she could only count to 15. There are some things you purchase that do not work with your child, and this one was like striking gold- it is the best purchase I've made, right up there with her BabyBjorn soft bib.",5.0
"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.
We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.
I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math.",5.0
"I bought this for my daughter a month ago.  She is now 10 months.  She loves puppets so I though this would be a good fit.  She watches this video intently and loves it.  I find it entertaining.  I've seen it at least 2 dozen times.  I like Benny, the surly, angry rabbit who is the bellhop.  He keeps it entertaining for adults with his sarcastic quips.  Highly recommended if your kids like puppets.  It will keep them entertained while learning about numbers.",5.0
i got this video several moths ago from a local store and my daughter (2 1/2) loves it!  it has helped her with her numbers and she even sings along with all the songs now.  it's really cute!  my 7 month old seems to enjoy it too :),5.0

"My 22 month old granddaughter love this video. She loves to it's jazzy music and even sings with Elmo, etc. She know the number 5 now and no doubt the rest of the numbers in no time. She gets a lot of repetition from us, too.",5.0
"The dvd arrived last week,for my 8 month old granddaughter. I decided on this dvd after reading the 5 star reveiws. I'm happy with the choice. It's educational,fun and entertaining. My granddaughter stops to look and listen when she hears several songs,rock around the clock,elmo singing #5 song and the crows singing. I'm sure as she gets older this be one of her favorite dvds. I usually play it twice back to back because I enjoy her smiles when she reacts to the songs. I HIGH RECOMMEND THIS DVD. I'm going to purchase another one so she will have one at her home.",5.0
"My 19 month old son loves this video! It is about 30 minutes long- just enough time to clean up the kitchen and get a few other things done around the house. All the favorite characters are there as well as a few new ones I did not know about including ""Benny the Bunny"" who is really funny..Elmo does a rap for the number 5 that thrills my son. Good quality both sound and sight.",5.0
"We first borrowed this from a friend and I am now ordering a copy for ourselves. My 4-yr old son love it! This is the best tool yet to improve his number skills. It is fun yet simple, and he never gets bored watching it. Even my 6-yr old son enjoys it.

I highly recommend this DVD. It is worth every cent!",5.0
They should be using these old Sesame Street video's in public school. It is probably the fastest and easiest way to teach.,5.0
My 1 year old can count to 14!  The songs are funny and the both my kids love to watch it.,5.0
"This funny & entertaining video helps teach young kids to count.  Each number has a catchy little song; the whole family enjoys it.  My husband confessed to whistling these tunes while at work!  This DVD has helped all my kids learn to count.  Also, try Sesame Street's ""Learning About Letters"" for the alphabet.",5.0
"THIS IS MY FAVORITE KID'S VIDEO.  We originally borrowed this from the library.  We liked it so much, and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again, that we decided to buy it.  The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time.  I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months, but it still holds their interest.  The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers.  We all sing along and, quite frankly, I can't get the songs for the numbers 3, 5, and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD.",5.0
"This DVD really helped my 2.5 year old daughter progress quickly with learning her numbers, and the different songs are great and catchy for singing in the car.  The only thing I don't understand is that in the opening number Ernie counts to 20, which is great, but as they go through each individual number they stop at 15?  That's still OK since most of the others only go to 10.  Overall a great educational DVD.",5.0
"my 4 yr old absolutely loves it and even though i am not fond of television, i don't mind 30 minutes of silly educational songs.",5.0

123 Count With Me really helped familiarize my then 2-3 year old daughter with not just the recognition of numbers and the concept of 'how many' but also the concepts of 'sequence' and why we 'count' things. Excellent production with a light sprinkling of humor moms and dads can appreciate while sitting on the couch with the little one. My favorite? The 'Counting Crows'!  Check it out!,5.0
"We have watched this DVD, oh, about 40 times since I got it 2 weeks ago.  My 2yo twins start saying ""Bo Ernie, Bo Ernie"" as soon as we get in the car (the place where they get to watch tv). I know if the boys could vote they would give it 5 stars hands down!",5.0
"I wish CTV would consider reissuing ""Sesame Street"" as a chronological series, starting with ""Season One,"" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway, that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay, Ernie!",5.0
"This video is fantastic. My kids are 1 and 2, and both absolutely love it. It's easy to understand what Ernie and the rest of the characters are saying (which is what I find annoying about Elmo and Zoe), and the songs are great (with inclusion of one or two songs from the 70's that I know and love!).",5.0
"This is the first Sesame Street video we've purchased for our two-year-old.  We've been extremely happy with it for a number of reasons:

* The song segments, many of which are based on adult songs ranging from ""One"" (A Chorus Line) to ""Rock Around the Clock,"" are well-produced and very funny.

* There's a plot, but it's mainly a device to tie the song segments together and to throw in as many sight gags as possible along the way.  Perfect for the attention span of a very young child.

* Plenty of yuks for the adults in true Sesame Street style.  The hotel owner is Ms. Sherry Netherland...the Furry Arms has a half-star restaurant featuring Peanut Butter Goulash as the daily special...if you watch carefully, there are a few subplots involving only characters that appear in the background.  Sesame Street assumes that people of all ages will be watching; it's a rare producer for young viewers that does this.

Our daughter has watched this video for only a few weeks and already counts aloud more easily than she did before ""Count with Me.""  It's the only video we own that we'll gladly sit down and watch with her.  Thumbs up!",5.0
"I have nothing but praise for the 1, 2, 3 Count With Me video (hosted by Ernie, not Elmo). For the sake of comparison, I do not hold Sesame Street's Do the Alphabet video (hosted by Big Bird) in high regard. In 1, 2, 3 Count With Me the story cleverly centers around work at the Furry Arms Hotel and with great comic relief shows children practical applications for using numbers. I bought the video when my son was two years old. My children, currently ages 4 1/2 and 2, learned number recognition and numeric order reliably thanks to the catchy theme song and clips highlighting specific numbers. Now that my oldest child is successfully learning addition, I see in a new light the importance of reinforcing numerical order (adults take it for granted). Educational value aside, this video makes them laugh out loud too.",5.0
This is a great DVD - my daughter is 19 months and enjoys to watch it.  It is classic Sesame Street - catchy songs and great characters.,5.0

"My daughter, now 15 months absolutely loves this DVD and has since she was about 4 months old.  At first it was mostly the music she liked, but now she really watches the DVD and enjoys the characters (even Benny.)  There are tons of songs, and she loves to dance.  Also, if your kiddo doesn't like sitting through the entire DVD, you can just watch the songs and sing together without going through the whole bit.  I would absolutely recommend this one.",5.0
"My son loves this DVD. He is 11 months old and can't get enough of this program.  Even my 2 year old nephew can't get enough of it.  It's all Ernie so if you child doesn't care for Ernie, they may not sit and watch it.  It such a cute program with Benny the Bunny.  What a jokester! I think any kid would love it but again, it's all Ernie.",5.0
This one is funny and entertaining.  Very cute and educational at the same time.  You'll find yourself singing along!,5.0
"My 2 year old daughter loves Ernie, and hence she loves this DVD. However, I think I love it more. After watching many children's tapes, DVDs, programs, etc, I think I have a well informed appreciation of puppetry and it comes no finer than in this story. The subtle (or not so subtle at times) body language of Benny the Bunny is remarkable and he truly steals the show. Ernie is also excellent and the whole story flows along at an interesting pace. Look out for the penguins! My wife and I now have a running joke every time we order fish in a restaurant!!",5.0
"My 8 month old daughter has been watching this video for over a month now, and she loves it!  The story is fun, and the songs are very catchy.  I find myself humming them at work sometimes.  I highly recomend this DVD.",5.0

I don't mind watching it, either.  The tunes are pretty catchy and I end up singing them at work (an unfortunate side effect).",5.0
"I have several Sesame Street videos but this is by far the most entertaining and engaging for my 10-month old daughter, as well as for me! The songs are catchy, and the storyline is very funny.

"I LOVE THIS DVD.  My daughter, Leah is 2 years old and after only 2 weeks of watching this video.  She learned to count to 10.  It is a must have for every child's dvd collection!!!",5.0
This is the best educational video in the sesame street collection for teaching numbers.  I'm even going to purchase it for my sister in -law who is having a baby.  It has catchy tunes and upbeat music to go along with counting so little ones can't help but want to try to count along...thus teaching them to count!,5.0
"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do, too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs, all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie, his friends, and Elmo, as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!
The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy, and I highly recommend it!",5.0
"This video is so much fun.  My 15-month-old starts dancing as soon as it comes on.  The ""Counting Crows"" segment along with a little ""Bob Dylan"" make this just as entertaining for moms and dads. As usual, Sesame Workshop scores a winner!",5.0
"I bought this for my seven month old on a whim as my wife and I were looking for some DVDs from the Baby Einstein video series.  But after watching this, we are glad we made this purchase. The characters are great and, in typical Sesame Street fashion, are goofy as heck!  Benny has to be our favorite character and I'm sorry one reviewer didn't take more kindly to him - he definetly brings more humor to this already funny video.  Think of him as a funnier Oscar.  The songs are extremely catchy - I find myself humming them on my way to work (shh, don't tell anyone!).  This has quickly become the most watched DVD in our home!
...and oh yeah, my kid really likes it too!",5.0
My son 2 years old really like it even me . the song is great. easy to listen and remember. my son tell me to play it again and again. you got to have this one.,5.0
Lots and lots of Ernie!,5.0
"Sure, it teaches them to be naughty and tease like Ernie teases poor lazy Benny, but it has a nice story line, and really teaches the numbers -- my son just starts dancing when he hears the title song sung by Ernie.  Lots of the songs are pretty good, and definitely stick in your head.  The great thing(imo) is that Elmo has only a small bit, and this video has firmly lodged Ernie as his absolute favorite Sesame Street Character!!!  He talks about tubby time and bath(not on this DVD though), and has learned some numbers (I think :-)) We have a laugh at Benny every time we watch, which is a few times a week -- would be 24 x 7 if it was my son's choice.",5.0
"My 1.5 yr old loves this and she can actually count now!  Filled with songs and old standbys, you cant go too wrong with this one.  For maximum ""babysitting time"", try 25th anniversary DVD - it is an hour long!  this one is half that.",5.0
"I have created a monster!!! My kid only watches two movies out of his 26 cartoon videos, so the rest are useless now. I have to play these movies all day along. The first is, Sesame Street - 123 Count With Me. He started babbling 123 at the age of 18!!! The second is, ""Sesame Street - Do the Alphabets"". Both of these videos are must own videos. Best of all, they are educational.",5.0
I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much!

"I've worn out this video over the years cause I got it on VHS,now its on DVD! My few comments on Paul Gilbert is that through his playing,he show's alot of discipline and passion on the way he play's. but most of all, he's passionate about music thats why he got to the level of where he's at. I've meet him couple of times at a NAMM show and it was like talking to the next door neighbor. no rocks star attitude just plain Paul Gilbert DOWN TO EARTH...If your like me who's alway's practicing to get better all the time and to learn more, GET THIS DVD and apply the skills you learn from Paul in a band situation when its called for. I happen to be fortunate that growin up in the 80's doing this stuff called shred playing was the NORM back then, so I caught up to this GIT style real quick and for the most part,this was the ticket to be in a band back then.
if you've never done this kinda stuff then be prepared for some seriouse learning curve adjustments. Dont give up keep up on practicing and discipline,some things don't come easy but when you get there, its personaly an awesome accomplishment,convidence builder. but most of all one's you can master 2 or 3 of Paul's licks it comes easier cause it builds on top of each other. happy picking and have some good laughter on Paul's humor...",5.0
"This was produced going on 20 years ago, (the 1st half anyway) but is still relevant today.  After the post-grunge backlash of the early to mid 90's it is good to see this style of playing coming back.  Paul is an unassuming character whose delivery & instruction of his style & technique is very helpful & down to earth.  The 1st half of the DVD was done in his early Racer X days & really reflects the licks from that era, as the 2nd half naturally exposes the Mr. Big pop oriented offerings.  This DVD will either inspire you to attempt to reach his level of technique, or really discourage you.  But again, I believe his good nature will inspire most.  I was able to meet Mr. Gilbert at a clinic shortly after ""To be with you"" was a hit for Mr. Big years ago & he was still really down to Earth.  A whole new generation have the opportunity to learn from him & really should make this DVD part of their library.  Just do your best to ignore the 80's-90's ""production"" :)  Also the addition of the .PDF files for Vol. 2 is a nice touch!",5.0
"Paul Gilbert got my attention in a tiny article from Guitar World, maybe Guitar Player, back in I'd say 87? maybe even earlier. he had just won a guitar gun slinger contest in the LA area and was heaed to GIT.  ayway, I kept an eye out for him along the way, and sho nuff, he is a technical monster. he may not send quite the emotional chills of say, I don't know, Eddie Van Halen (78-84 that is)? but the cat definitely sings some soul with his axe too, don't get me wrong.  I'd say, get his chops down, maybe some DiMeola master's level stuff too if you are into fast, clean, alternate picking as I try to be, then fuse your own soul with it--put some Clapton, SRV, Jimi, and Eddie in there--don't forget to bend it and shake it! you may come out with some really fresh, really good stylistic new frontiers--At least, that's what I'm after. just don't forget to make it YOUR OWN! balance in all things.  this video is all you need to get started on the Gilbert part of this equation.  its full, complete, and well done. His work with Mr Big is seriously good too, if a litte poppy, particularly their first two (I never got to hear too much of the later work.  enjoy, work the technque down to perfection, cleanly and slowly, then rip it up full speed when you're ready.  keep this vital part of intense rock alive and then, lift your goblets of rock!",5.0
"I just got this dvd a few weeks back and I can already feel a noticable improvement in my technique.  In the first section, he goes over picking, 3-note per string scales, chromatic and harmonic minor licks, hammer - ons and pull - offs and different arpeggio techniques, including sweep picking and string skipping.  In the second section, he gives more practical applications of the techniques and offers insight on how to improve phrasing and how to practice soloing.  Paul is a great teacher and he will keep you interested both with his playing and his sense of humor.",5.0
"I own every Paul Gilbert video that I am aware of.  These two volumes have dramatically improved my technique, speed, phrasing, picking, etc.  Paul is an amazing teacher.  He explains everything in depth so that even the novice guitarist will understand most everything covered.  I own many other videos including Yngwie, Vinnie Moore, Richie Kotzen etc.  None of the other videos can compete with the Paul Gilbert videos. I often watch Intense rock 1 and 2 as refresher courses or just for plain entertainment.  If shred is your game, then look no further.  Learn from the best!",5.0
"This is the best purchase anyone can make if you want to shred being that finding a good teacher that can teach this skill is not easy. Paul besides being an incredible player covers all bases of Alternate Picking and String Skipping like he was in front of you. This is worth every singe penny. Now you have both instructionals on one DVD for the price of one!!!!

I own a vast array of instructionals, and if you only had 17 dollars to spend on a dvd, this is the best money you'll ever spent. Paul teaches shred like he was in front of you and believe me, no one posseses that skill. I also recommend his other instructionals after you are ready to move forward from this one Terryfying Guitar Trip, Get Out Of My Yard and his latest, Silence Followed By a Deafening Roar.

Paul goes into great detail on scales arpeggios and everything you need to sound like a pro!!  I would highly recommend!!,5.0
"If your leads only consist of Box 1 of the minor pentatonic scale, this DVD will leave you in the dust quickly. This is only for guitar hero-shredder types that have real chops. You need to be fluent in music theory, you must have absolute command of the entire fretboard, and you need to be fast in all the scale modes to keep up with the material. The video is very entertaining and packed with info that will help any guitarist no matter your skill set; the problem is, you won't be able to play the examples up to speed. Watching a virtuoso like Mr Gilbert run up and down the fretboard at the speed of light is worth the price of the DVD. An amazing guitarist!",5.0

"Within a month I have already notice some serious improvements in my playing.  Particularly my picking is much cleaner.  Also, it's nice to add some more licks to my library...I was getting pretty bored with my playing for a while, but this video has revived my playing once again!",5.0
"This video guitar lesson is for those who want to get a bit more technical into their repertoire. Intense Rock 1 has old school Paul (good old Racer X days) teaching us the basics of soloing, scaling and just good guitar playing overall. I like how he also incorporates funny skits in between sessions which is great cos learning guitar is meant to be a fun experience too (in his case anyways). Intense Rock 2 kinda builds on the first, introducing a few more patterns and sequences. Paul continues his humorous presentation keeping the audience awake and laughing. I play with a whammy bar so it's a bit of a shame PG doesn't like it too much but that's his playing style I guess.

Overall PG is a cool and fun down-too-Earth guitar teacher you won't be disappointed. Oh and did I mention he's the world's 4th fastest guitar player?",5.0
"I'd already seen a few of the lessons online and there was no doubt on what I was in for.

A detailed shred of shredding. And Paul Gilbert is a fantastic teacher. And a great artist. He really rips apart his own technique and shows you the light... the rest is up to you. Whether you have the motivation to DO and practice consistently and accurately.

If playing fast is the real thing on your mind. Just pick up this DVD and hear your self transform in a matter of months.

I used to have this fear of speed. Thanks Paul for dispelling completely. And making it accessible for mere mortals. While I still am not sure I can ever get to the clarity levels that he has on his fast ones... I am definitely not scared anymore to attempt to play fast...

Thank you very much Paul Gilbert.",5.0
"There'd be a lot more amazing guitarists in the world.  Intense Rock I is mainly directed at improving technique providing a lot of different 3-note-per-string, string skipping and sweep arpeggios sequences.  Paul does a great job at breaking these things down while giving us a taste of his goofy sense of humor, but for my money Intense Rock II is king.  Among other things Paul covers dynamics and control, and the last segment on practicing alone is worth the money.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up, your guitar will thank you.",5.0
"Paul Gilbert is one of the best guitarists in the world. Lucky for us, he's also a really down to earth guy and is a great teacher. While all of Paul's DVDs are great, Intense Rock helps you lay the groundwork to play shred metal.
From the first simple exercise to the last terror lick, Intense Rock is an exercise in the development of shred technique. Paul is a great teacher who actually slows down the licks and explains how he plays them. He certainly isn't too haughty to forget what it was once like to be a student. Pair this up with Troy Stetina's shred masterpiece, ""Speed Mechanics for the Lead Guitar,"" spend most of your free time practicing, and you'll be able to shred. (There's no great secret to technique! It takes time, drive, patience, and belief in one self.)

John Petrucci's Rock Discipline is highly recommended as well, since Petrucci, while less wacky and attention-grabbing than Gilbert, is a great teacher as well. Although, I would say it's better for those who've already bettered there technique, and have, thus, seen some concrete rewards for their playing. The Intense Rock ( and Speed Mechanics, for that matter) exercises are very musical, and are therefore easier for the beginning shredder to practice for an extended period of time, than Rock Discipline which has a lot of (valuable) atonal exercises.",5.0
"Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion, and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years, and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar, you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II), so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks, Paul!",5.0
Anyone interested in improving their picking and articulation would be well advised to check out this DVD. There's enough here to keep a player occupied for quite a while. Volume two of this title really drives home the point of making those tasty shred licks musical. This DVD is a fantastic deal.,5.0

"Paul's ability to teach is amazing.  VERY relevant and ALWAYS fun!  For 20 years now he has been and continues to keep things easily understood that are essential in taking your technique to a new level.  As a player whom has been playing for 30 years now myself, Paul's breakdown of left and right-hand technique finally got me over the ""hump"" I had not been able to overcome most of my guitar playing days as I finally overcame a plateau and quickly saw noticable improvment in speed and accuracy as I finally got the metronome setting to click higher than ever and still growing.",5.0
"I have been playing guitar for more almost 20 years and I wish I had this DVD back when I was trying to develop my shred guitar technique. Couple this DVD with a book like Speed Mechanics by Stetina and you have all you need to start shredding. Paul is such a virtuoso shred player, he will blow you away with licks played at the speed of light!! He however slows  all these licks down and even shows every small detail in achieving these licks from alternate picking, sweeping, sequences, sweep-tap, legato and more!!You will also need a metronome and LOTS of practice time to learn these techniques. When you master them you won't regret it since you will playing with terrifying technique. If you want to play like Paul Gilbert and other master shredders out there, this is the DVD to start with. And for this price you can't go wrong.",5.0
"I actually bought this video (vol 1) when I was 11 or 12 when it first came out with my allowance that I saved up. As a guitar teacher and someone with 20 plus years playing experience, I can say that this is the best video on shred guitar technique. Volume 1 alone is well worth the price. My only issue(a VERY minor one) is that he doesn't talk about the metronome and its usage. But any good teacher can explane that in about 2 minutes.
 Volume 2 while not quite as shred heavy is still a great dvd to have(and just as important content). It concetrates more on phrasing, dynamics, rythmic ways of building phrases, etc. Don't worry, there is still plenty of shredding as well.
 These volumes are the best investments I ever made as a guitar player,teacher and student. Anyone who wants to learn how to shred, get this dvd package, and a book on music theory(or instruction by a teacher) and a good chord book and you'll have everything you ever need.
 Keep in mind, no matter what, you still have to practice(alot!!!!). No book, Dvd, or anything is going to MAKE you play well. If you are a beginner(or even advanced), you still have to work hard. However, this is a big help.",5.0

A couple are relatives of mine, it was fun getting to know them, through this DVD. I've always appreciated history, but never in my 60 plus years of life, enjoyed learning it, until the Drive Thru History Programs. I stumbled across his program, when he first started on TV. His narrative made learning history fun for me, as well as connected history together, which may be the biggest difference. History text books did much to dry up my interest in History, where the DTH series woke up my desire for learning & understanding history. Great Job Dave & your fantastic team! Thanks for also providing a school program that will stimulate children (and adults) to understand our world's past. We have ALL the DTH DVDs and have purchased many as gifts.

"My wife found all of Tonya Larson to be very helpful in getting back to shape with a newborn.  The routine was challenging but nothing she couldn't manage after a few weeks postpartum.  My favorite part is the spiritual warmups.  I watched them and was super impressed.  As a pastor I see all kinds of spiritual nonsense but her message was refreshing and accurate.  For the right person, it could even be life changing.",5.0
"Thanks Tonya for a lovely stretching and toning routine. It is a very relaxing workout and the music is lovely. Yes, it is a Christian-centered workout with soft Christian vocals and instrumental music. I am a Christian, so I was very familiar with the lyrics and tunes. They were very modern versions and had a nice ambiant feel to them. I love all of Tonya's workouts and appreciate her Spiritual Warm-Ups and everything about her routines. This was a yoga-based routine, but she used no yoga terminalogy in describing the moves. It was very professional. I do, however enjoy a lot of yoga routines that do use the authentic yoga/sanskrit names and words. I love Raviana workouts too. Tonya is very professional, and soft-spoken and the set,music and the mats and their outfits were nice and modern. I really like this one and you can use it in segments or do the whole thing!",5.0

Tonya was honoring her core values & produce an excellent & worthy of 5 stars exercise video!  Where is the respect for Tonya Larson's Christian beliefs?  Reviewing on exercise alone is 5 stars!  Kudos Tonya Larson.  I will check out to see if you have others.  May God bless you & expand your territory!,5.0
"I really like this video! Even though it says it's great for a postpartum workout, it's perfect for me. I'm in my 50s and have some minor back problems. I needed something to get me stretching and working my muscles, and these stretches have really helped. I like that it's divided into several different stretch sequences, so if I don't have time to do the entire video I can pick which one or two sequences I want to do. When I first started , I could barely bend because of my back and the condition my muscles were in at the time. I'm doing so much better now and am able to do a lot of the stretches I couldn't even think of doing in the beginning. This has been a wonderful addition to my life and has really helped me physically.",5.0

I can see why someone of a non-religious background would dislike both this and more spiritual yoga programs, but I think it is really excellent for Christians who seek an alternative to yoga that is more focused on their own values. Highly recommend. It is a deeply prayerful way to do effective exercise.",5.0

"This is basically yoga mixed with some calisthenics, which is what I was hoping for when I clicked this. And when I say yoga I mean the whole shebang, like the meditation, the spiritual music, etc. But there's a twist: It's Christianized. Granted, after the first 5 minutes there aren't really any references to Christianity except what I think is Christian music in the background (but the lyrics weren't clear enough for me to find it interruptive). I loved the workout, I skipped the meditation and prayer at the beginning. I am a religious person, but I didn't click the video for worship, so I skipped that part.",5.0
"I've never written a review before but I just finished this stretch/strengthen video. I completely understand the dissatisfaction of non-Christian viewers with this video. I'm new to the yoga scene and the Buddha/zen religious elements of many practices are a real turn-off to me. In fact I almost turned this one off when the first heading came up with ""spiritual"" in the title. Invariably in the yoga world that means I have to listen to someone become one with the universe or some such thing. I was pleasantly surprised when Tonya began quoting from Isaiah and then Matthew. If you are a Christian looking for a good stretch or to start incorporating yoga into your routine, this is a workout that not only won't offend your faith but actually enriches it. Thank you Tonya!",5.0

"This book plus the dvd is a must to the beginning double bassist. I haven't found much on the subjet and when I came across this book and dvd I was totally mesmerized. Excersizes r great the way its set up is really cool. A very inspiring methode. Rufus Reid is very clear in what he says and teaches.

If you think its expensive well its worth the investment.",5.0
"I came to bass playing in my late 30s after a lifetime of playing mainly guitar, banjo and mandolin, and I went through a lot of books looking for a clear and solid foundation for upright jazz playing.
Of all the methods out there, Reid's is the one that has really stood the test of time, and for good reason. He starts the reader off with basic scales and simple patterns for playing over changes. From there it's on through more complex scales and  patterns and finally, soloing, illustrated with a number of transcribed classics.
Combine this book with the Simandl book for basic technique (and a good library of jazz albums), and you have just about everything needed to guide the beginning bass player through the intermediate stage. For a player who already had a basic classical technique, this book alone is just about all that's needed to learn to play jazz.",5.0
"""The Evolving Bassist"" has come to be the standard bass method book in the world of jazz.  In it, Rufus Reid explains his ""concept"" of playing bass, moving beyond merely playing quarter notes to progressive and thoughtful bass lines.
As the title of the book indicates, this is a process.  The book is designed for players of any level to develop a well-rounded approach to the bass.
The main portion of the method includes etudes, scales, and standard patterns for Latin bass lines, Rock bass lines, etc.  Also included are many practical hints, answers to frequently asked questions, discography, and transcriptions of a number of Mr. Reid's compositions.
""The Evolving Bassist"" is all around an excellent aid for the growing jazz bass player.",5.0
"Mr. Reid covers everything!!!  Gear, instruments, amps, cables... then how to play the thing!  Electric or Double bass.  Amazing photos of Rufus demonstrating how to get your bass on a plane... How to position hands/fingers on Double Bass, Electric and the Bass VI.  The only book I know of that addresses the Fender Bass VI and explores its potential as a means to expanding soloing possibilities for any bassist with Bass VI specific excercises.",5.0

"I love this DVD! Rufus not only breaks it down, but shows it in the trio setting how it works. If you're a beginner, this really isn't for you, but still you can learn the theory side from. For the beginner, I recommend Todd Phillips DVD 1 & 2, and workout. Get those along with this DVD, you'll be working for days.",5.0

"I recommend you get a handful of lessons and some background before you get into this book. There are some questions you might have that could be tough to answer without the benefit of a teacher.

Having said that, this is a great book. It really starts with complete beginner basics, and builds from there. You're playing will grow with each section. You'll get out of it what you put into it with this book - which can be a ton.

Whether you apsire to play jazz or not, this book can open you up as a bassist and give you many tools to use.",5.0
"When I was in high school in the 1980s, I studied bass. Not that I could play it. I have Cerebral Palsy. For our purposes, my mind could do the walking. My fingers could not.

But The Evolving Bassist was one of the main texts my teacher used. Buy this, and it will keep you busy for a very long time, whether you study double or electric bass.

Rufus Reid is a jazz bass player, and this book teaches you through jazz. It goes from the most basic whole, half, quataer, eighth and sixteenth note exercises, and slowly shows you how to build walking lines. These increase in complication, and if you hit the end of this book, no easy task, you will be at least a good jazz player, ready to play whatever type of music you want.

I never did get there- I and my spastic little ten appendages  went to university and learned two more instruments--a typewriter and, later, a computer. You judge the results.

I did, however, get to both see and meet Reid: he taught at what was then William Paterson College-now university, and used to play there on Sunday afternoons. Twenty minutes from where I grew up.  He also has at least one good album out,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rufus-Reid-Trio-Perpetual-Stroll-LP-Vinyl/dp/B0019BI5OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rufus Reid Trio: Perpetual Stroll [ LP Vinyl </a>]",5.0
The product arrived within a few days after ordering. It was in perfect condition. Very happy with using Amazon.,5.0
"Learning to improve my jazz playing (being a mainly classical player) is made easier by this book, Reed was a brilliant bass methodologist and there is a lot to learn in this book.",5.0
"This is a great book for any jazz instrumentalist who plays in concert pitch.  Because of the many etudes written in quarter notes, it'd probably even be a good way to practice transposing on the fly.  It's ideal for understanding bass lines, reading in bass clef, and absorbing underlying jazz solo ideas and structures.  According to my practice diary, I started studying from it about ten months ago.  My playing has improved and changed since using this book, and I don't even play the bass (I've been playing jazz guitar for 20+ years).  It's helped me outline chords better, think in a lower register, and think about function while playing--like use of passing tones in jazz, etc.  Reid's encouraging remarks, scattered throughout the book, are a warm, personal touch, which I think would be very good for a young musician to read.  I admire Rufus Reid as a player, and think he did a real service to jazz musicians when he wrote this book.  THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY JAZZ MUSICIAN!",5.0
"Rufus Reid has an easy going, but very knowledgeable way of getting across music concepts. He doesn't rush things and he is very systematic in his explanations.  I enjoy listening to what he has to say about music and  ""stand up"" bass playing in particular.  I am a teacher (but not a music teacher), and I am also a learner. This guy knows his stuff! Rufus Rules!",5.0
"Rufus Reid's revised edition of the classic ""Evolving Bassist"" is a literal tour de force and a must have for all bass players regardless of what level of proficiency they play at.  The companion DVD (available separately and highly recommended) is a gem in which Rufus jams with two of the finest contemporary musicians illustrating various aspects of the text.  The DVD is worth the price just as a performance video.

While loosely defined as a method, the ""Evolving Bassist"" is really more of a well thought out approach to playing the instrument.  The skills taught follow several threads of theory and practice, but it's not a beginner tutorial even though very early players will benefit from the material...and continue to benefit throughout their playing career.  If one is desirous of a more basic text in the jazz genre then you must get ""The Michael Moore Bass Method"", probably the best tutorial currently available; the classical  ""Simandl"" material notwithstanding.  The two books and the ""Evolving..."" DVD really are complimentary and easily stand at the forefront of a limited field.  Highly recommended.",5.0
"I first bought this book in 1979 and have been using a version of it since then with my bass students. This new edition is very good and the DVD isa great asset. Rufus is an understanding teacher and if you get a chance to attend one of his master classes, don't pass them up.",5.0
"I've had this tape for a little over a year, and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently, this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!",5.0

My favorite movie of all time in a widescreen format!! Looks great! Great condition! Mailed promptly!,5.0
the problem with this film is theres no clear cut case of the villians are there really any villians in this film none that i could figure out. oliver reed s charcter krokov cant really be considered a villian primarily because theres no motive to any of what he does. from what i got out of him hes just a top russian agent with no real motive. films just a excuse to have great stunts and  a crazy plot that goes nowhere. see what you can salvage out of this one theres likeable stuff just no plot motivation.,5.0

"I just got the Region 2 Disney UK DVD of Condorman in the mail today and instantly put it in the player.

I am fairly certain that I saw this in the theater and then a million times on the Disney Channel, but have not seen it since the mid 80's when I was very young.

When I started to watch, I noticed how it was similar in concept to Gotcha! (1985), with an American civilian mixed up in international intrigue. And as much as I still like Gotcha!, Condorman is the superior movie. Gotcha! is all nerdy hormones and awkwardness, while Condorman just rolls out fantastic comic book surprises one after the next.

For an actor whose career apparently peaked with this movie, Michael Crawford does a great job and is very likeable. James Hampton is a guy with not a ton of name recognition, but has a ton of face recognition, and is great in this movie. Barbara Carrera went on to be a Bond girl opposite Sean Connery 2 years later, and is very much a Bond girl here and Oliver Reed plays a menacing villain.

Even though The Cat From Outer Space (1978) has more than 6 actors with speaking lines, and a cast filled with recognizable stars from TV and Disney movies, Condorman is just as much fun.

The Region 2 Disney UK DVD comes with no special features. Audio options are English, French and German. With Subtitles options being English, French and German as well. The credits all come at the beginning of the movie, which was how credits were done until George Lucas changed the industry with Star Wars, so the lack of end credits seems a bit jarring. When I played this on my computer with the VLC player, there was black bars both below and on the side of the image. But in my multiregion Blu Ray player, the image wiled my widescreen TV.

Several UK sellers on Amazon are selling this for under $10 plus shipping and at that price, you can't go wrong with this DVD, if you have the ability to play other region DVDs.",5.0

"I watched Condorman with my family (kids were grade school age) while stationed in Japan with the Navy a long time ago. Loved it then and was so happy to see it come out in DVD. Such a wonderful, family oriented show. Full of laughs but done with values that are clearly defined without being pushy. Disney does a great job with that.

We watched the DVD a couple weeks ago during our Christmas holiday. This was the first time we watched since so long ago. My sons are in the corporate world now but we still had a fantastic time; laughing and joking throughout. It brought such warm memories. Amazing how all of us were able to anticipate the scenes throughout the movie; even some of the dialogue. I wish Disney had done a Condorman 2, but such is life.",5.0

"Condarman is one of Disney's more brilliant films in the last few decades. The story has the taste of Peter Sellers classic ""Pink Panther"" movies and that special ""80's"" movie magic that hollywood hasn't been able to replicant since.

Superhero films are big in Hollywood right now, though I doubt they'd make a reboot of this movie a part of me is glad they won't. This classic can hold it's own without the need for any blockbuster A-lister or CGI effects.

My brother and I couldn't get enough of it. The effects are cheesy, but pretty cool for their time. It is clearly a ridiculous, unbelievable, unlikely premise, which makes it a fantastic adventure. What child/comicbook fan doesn't fantasize about being the superhero? What inner child (especially guys) don't wish for an inexhaustible bank account to create the weapons and toys that the superheroes without special powers get to use in their fight for truth and justice?

The video is very true to the book, for instance, lines directly from Dicken's text are used throughout the movie, and it's all very well put together. Overall it's a great movie too...",5.0
"The entire production of ""Great Expectations"" is superb, with an outstanding cast, but the heart and soul of this movie is the actor, Ioan Gruffudd. He is heartbreakingly wonderful as this essentially good but  misguided young man.  I think his acting is some of the best I have ever  seen, particularly the prison scene with Joe, as well as his desperate  pleading to Estella as she leaves to wed another.  This is a beautifully  done work of art.",5.0
Dickens has rarely been adapted better. The final scenes of Pip reconciled to his fate reciting Greek to the dying Magwitch is pure cinematic poetry. Beautifully acted and shot this is a must see. Forget frumpy Jane Austen  costume dramas. This is a timeless piece of work. See it.,5.0
"For some reason it seems fashionable to criticize this production, mainly because it carries old footage from Masterpiece Theatre, hosted by Russell Baker.  Further, this film was sponsored by Mobil Oil Co. and produced by the BBC.  In addition, some reviewers may see it competing with the classic starring John Mills and Alec Guinness from 1947.  Moreover, since this 1999 film was made, weve had the 2011 production starring Gillian Anderson and other versions, as well.  But viewers who fail to see this 3-hour epic from 1999 are really missing the best rendition of what may be Charles Dickens best novel.  The story is timeless and inspiring; the romance, touching and well-portrayed.  TV simply cant be better than this.

Casting is almost perfect with a young Ioan Gruffudd playing the grown up Pip and Gabriel Thomson the young Pip.  They look so much alike youd swear they're related in real life.  Beyond this, Charlotte Rampling seems an ideal choice for the quirky Miss Havisham, as does Justine Waddell playing the wounded Estella.  Other cast members, like those playing Magwich, Jaggers, Herbert Pocket, Joe, Wemmick, Molly, et al are equally well-chosen.

The ending of this story is not really a happy one.  Abel Magwich meets a grisly end, Miss Havisham is burned alive, and the romance between Pip and Estella seems to be in limbo.  One has to be reminded that Charles Dickens wrote the story and did two versions of the ending.  This is the happier of the two.

I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they find fault with how dark and grim this production seems.  Im sure its exactly what Dickens would have wanted and exactly right for 1999.  No, I wouldnt object if the video were re-mastered into true HD-widescreen but I felt Id waited long enough to see this flim again.  No sign of a re-generation was found from BBC so I purchased it at a decent price on the secondary market.  If and when a re-mastered version of this classic appears I will want to buy it.

Summing up, those who haven't seen this version of Great Expectations shouldnt wait any longer.  Go and buy a copy from one of the Amazon re-sellers like I did.  This is the best version you will find and its production values are fine for now.  When a re-mastered version is released, Ill buy it.",5.0
"I love this novel and I know all its versions, even the ultra-rare Classics
comic, and this is by far the best adaptation. First of all, it's the closest
to the book, character by character, and it's also beautifully directed and
acted. It's true Personenregie: you really feel the relationships among the
people--the protagonist and his brother-in-law, his sister, Estella, Herbert
Pocket (here, Daniel Evans, looking really cute in the role Alec Guiness played
for David Lean in the famous film), Miss Havisham, and of course Abel Magwitch,
the convict who sets the story in motion. Dickens lovers: seek no more. This is
the one.",5.0

"Thank you, need to leave more words, well this is an adaptation from Dickens book, if your an Ioan Gruffudd fan it is not his best role, as it is rather limited.  But the production quality is lovely",5.0
"This was the first movie where I had noticed Ioan Gruffudd. Once you see him you will never forget. I like this interpretations of Charles Dickens. One of the most beloved BBC TV film like Pride and Prejudice, The Aristocrats, Tom Jones.",5.0
"I have loved this version ever since it was aired on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre. The production values are very high here, as the sets, costuming, and cinematography are top-notch. The acting is first-rate here as well. In my humble opinion, Charlotte Rampling IS MIss Havisham. She embodies the complicated, subtle malice of a woman gone mad and Hell-bent on wreaking slow vengeance on the world, and the male sex in particular. And while this doesn't have a ""happy ending"", per se, Dickens' felt it appropriate to leave us with an ambiguous ending (albeit after changing the original ending), and I think it suits the film after the rest of it is very dark and sad. It would have seemed foolish for a happy ending to pop up out of nowhere. This version comes HIGHLY recommended! Now let's hope that a Blu-ray version is in the future to address the picture quality of the DVD!",5.0
"One of the cruelest stories I know. Dickens is so cruel we cannot imagine he is a man, what's more a humane human being.

A poor orphan, Pip, is raised by a poor blacksmith. A life of rough and tough luck. Take it or leave it, but there is no way out, except the radical one. And he dreams of being a gentleman one day. An aberration of course, morally wrong and bad taste.

He is selected and invited by Miss Havisham, a deranged rich woman who is mourning in total decay and sorrow after the failure of her wedding when the bridegroom did not come, twenty years before. Her objective is to provide a male companion and eventually husband to her adopted daughter, Estella.

But one night on the moor Pip is ""accosted"" by an prison escapee of some kind who asks for food and the boy of six or seven, maybe eight provides in the night, including a file for him to get rid of his manacles. He will turn up as his benefactor.

Luck, luck and luck. But then systematically Dickens shatters every single opportunity and hope on the side of the boy, Pip, who ends up in prison for unpaid debts, on the side of his benefactor, Abel, who will die in prison holding Pip's hand after his final arrest, on the side of Miss Havisham who will achieve none of her plans, on the side of Estella who will marry the rich and noble young man, will be brutalized and will end up alone in Miss Havisham's house, on the side of Biddy who will marry Joe the Blacksmith when Pip finally realizes she had been his closest ever friend, and even on the side of Estella who will refuse to requite Pip's love, though she will accept to make him her platonic companion in Miss Havisham's.redecorated house.

That cruelty is so extreme that we just wonder if Dickens then is not going through a phase of complete social rejection, rejection of the upper classes, rejection of the lower classes, rejection of justice, rejection of any discourse about the possible improvement of individuals and society. Absolute resignation and pessimistic submission to a totally inhumane world that only has some small pockets of satisfaction, but never for yourself, always for some rare others. He did not even salvage the exiled criminal who became Pip's benefactor, as Victor Hugo did in Les Misrables, and makes him die a solitary, nearly solitary death in prison with the sole company of the young man he tried and failed to help, and unaware of his daughter's fate, which does not seem to be particularly brilliant anyway, since she is Estella, daughter of a female assassin and a male exiled criminal condemned to absolute reclusion for life.

I just wonder if here Dickens does not reach Zola's pessimism who considered that anyone born in a criminal circle could only be that and drag everyone around him down into that criminal circle. No salvation for those who are badly born. The belief in an elected people turned into a savage and wild social Darwinism: some have been elected to be crushed and powdered by life as slowly as possible for them to regret ever being born but absolutely unable to shorten the ordeal.

Sad and sad and sad.

A slow and boring movie that has no equivalent in France than the Samurai of JP Melville. Because yes! behind this slow and strange rhythm that is all oriented towards the final action lies a complex screenplay with a strong message extremely provocative !

So according to Mr Schrader it's like if Travis had more or less missed his real target by attacking the pimps. We could go further and say outright that real prostitutes are not the ones we think and the woman of the world ...

De Niro's eyes in the rearview mirror at the end of the film give us the strange feeling that the killer still doesn't understand the gravity of his action but he would even be ready to start again in devilishly gigantic proportions.

"If you're like me, and I'm sure I'm not alone, and you can't get on Scorsese's wavelength, you're probably not going to like Taxi Driver either.  I wasn't hopeful but I decided to give Scorsese one last chance.  Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Taking out the Dead, all left me cold, bored and a little angry.  Taxi Driver was just as bad.  I've tried to understand why.  So many people absolutely love Scorscese movies that there must be something there.  In this case I'm blaming the score.  It calls attention to itself relentlessly.  It does not disappear behind the images and contribute to creating the mood and tone.  It stands between me and the images and seems to want to take me in a different direction, like it's incongruous with the film.  My ears were in a lounge listening to experimental jazz while my mind was watching an excellent character study with something to say about the nature of life.  I wonder if I could enjoy this movie with a different score, and I wonder if maybe that was my problem with the other movies as well?",1.0

"The three minute gun fight at the end was interesting and had pretty good special effects but other than that the whole movie was just boring. I really expected I'd like this since it had such great reviews and Deniro and Scorsese usually don't disappoint but that was not the case this time. It's just an hour and forty-five minutes of nothing. Is pointing out that New York has alot of bad areas and bad people suppose to be some kind of stroke of genius? And so what if a New York Cab Driver starts to slowly lose his mind.

There just wasn't anything interesting or dramatic about any scene, aside from the gun fight. And the music was god awful.",1.0
"Three friends get together for petty burglary jobs. They are pretty inept. One of them, Anthony (Owen Wilson), just got out of an mental institution but seems much more sane than the manic Dignan (Luke Wilson). Anthony falls in love with a motel maid, Inez.

"I've wanted to see this movie for years, so I finally bought it. It was awful. The acting is great, but the plot line meanders all over the place. Jodie Foster is saved from a life of prostitution by a whack cab driver in an all too bloody shootout. I have nothing against sex and violence when it serves the storyline, but everything here was gratuitous, and the storyline seemed to wander all over the place. There were endless of DeNiro driving his cab, as if we needed to be reminded he was a cab driver. In the end, Jody goes back to her conservative family, and the wacko is hailed as a hero. Better she should have stayed on the street. The world doesn't need more yuppies. I was really disappointed with this story. If you thought Pulp Fiction was art, you might like it. I prefer a plot line that wasn't thrown together on the run.",1.0
"A man applies for a job as a taxi driver because he can't sleep nights. [Remember `Checker' cabs?] He comments on the people who come out at night. Travis visits a theater and eats junk food. He can't sleep. We see a campaign office at work. [Does the film drag here?] The cab drivers gossip. The conversation drags, and so does the film. [Is this a parody of campaign workers?] Do they have anything in common? ""You need to clean up this city."" ""It's not going to be easy."" A young woman meets his cab. Travis and Betsy go to a movie. Does it have a plot? [Is this meant as a joke?] Another strange bearded passenger talks to Travis. Is he sick? [Is this Martin Scorsese?] Does Travis make sense? The film drags on.

There is a near accident. Travis meets a salesman who makes house calls to display his wares. Are the prices reasonable? [Is this a parody?] Is Travis stalking somebody? Was that ZIP code correct? Is Travis going insane because of a lack of sleep? Does anyone notice? There is an attempted robbery of a small store. [Believable?] The film drags on. ""No rough stuff."" There is a failure to communicate. Is this a parody? Iris has a new friend. Is the conversation pointless? And the film drags on. There is a political rally at Columbus Circle. Does somebody stand out like an odd haircut? Travis runs off to do what he has to do. There is a violent shoot-out that should wake up those who dozed off.

"Bad acting, lame story and very poor execution. It could have been good if carried out right but it moves too slowly. The dialogue doesn't make much sense and it's like Martin was just killing film time by having the actors talk slowly so they had less to write. Nothing brilliant about this film, 1/5",1.0
"With mostly positive reviews you would assume that Bottle Rocket was an absolute winner. Yet I can't help but agree with one review which I have seen here which rates it at only a single star and that everything else here is either misguided or overly-generous.
I came to this film via Rushmore which was a sublime and enjoyable film. Unfortunately Bottle Rocket is nothing more than a rehearsal for Rushmore where Anderson got hold of a decent story and some wonderful actors (it's telling that the much of the incidental music in Rushmore is lifted from this film).
Here the story is stilted, the dialogue lacks any of the zip needed for a comedy, while the acting is unremarkable at best and cringe worthy at worst. I spent a long time trying to nail down what this film is about but I suspect it is really about nothing, and that it was simply an exercise in getting a movie made that would help secure the necessary funding for Rushmore. If it did that, then at least it deserves the single star.
If Bottle Rocket had stayed as a short film I would have had no qualms with it but it really has no legs as a feature-length film. Sadly this is the only movie I have ever bought that I actually threw out - and it cost me a fair bit to order it from the States! Bought as a present for my Rushmore-loving sister she was bemused at first and then immensely disappointed.
I think the mundane but true fact is that almost every film-maker with a few movies under their belt will direct a stinker - this has got to be Anderson's - but he's already proved that he can make a quirky film that is engaging and entertaining. This isn't it.",1.0
"I was pretty excited to watch Bottle Rocket when I rented it. I read some good reviews and really enjoyed Rushmore. But Ive got to say that this movie was really... well bad. It was boring, and most of the time it didn't seem to be going anywhere. I expected to laugh alot after reading most of the reviews here. Now, I know a good comedy when I see one, and honestly I don't think I laughed at all. When a comedy runs pretty much only on dialouge I understand it can be hard to keep people interested. With all the horrible comedys out there, there really isn't many to enjoy. Look at the Big Lebowski, the funniest movie ever made, in my opinion. I am looking foward to seeing The Royal Tennanbaums this winter, and hopefully Wes Anderson keeps getting better. Overall I think Bottle Roccket was not very funny, but I will give credit to Luke & Owen Wilson for their performances.
And also Esquire Magazine did a poll to vote which Director would be the next Martin Scorsese - Wes Anderson, last I checked was winning, and also got a vote from Scorsese himself, but I think anyone who knows any better knows who the greatest director is right now and he shares the same last name as Wes - PTA.",1.0
"My friend recommended this movie to me and said it was the funniest movie ever.  Boy was she wrong!  This movie has no plot and is in no way funny.  The only feelings I had for this movie after I was finished watching it was sympathy for actors because it might ruin their careers.  I can't recommend this movie to anyone.  You can, if you really hate that person.",1.0
"I ADORED ""Rushmore""!  But this one is really not what you call a great film.  It's almost insignificant compares to Rushmore, and nothing in comparison to other great films in the 90's or any decade in history.  The humour is so fragile and the plot becomes less and less interesting as the  film progresses.  Sure, it does have a kinda neat quality about it, but if  without the success of ""Rushmore,"" who would care about this  film? The DVD is fine but with nothing extra.",1.0
"I rented this movie with high expectations after reading the reviews posted on this site. And with a very funny opening scene, and a great soundtrack, I was still encouraged. But after that, this film goes nowhere.  It's one of those heavy dialog movies like Swingers, but the dialog just  isn't very funny. You don't realize just how flat and amaturish the acting  is until James Caan's two minutes in the film blow everyone else on the  screen away. The final heist scene is hilarious, and there are some nice  moments in between, but not enough to make it worth ninety minutes. Try Go  or Swingers instead.",1.0
"Scorsese grew up amidst violence and bloodshed.  That he is able to reproduce murder and mayhem so realistically is an achievement that deserves one star.  The rest of the film, with its hookers, pimps, and contrived direction is really not worth mentioning.  A perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression.  ""Taxi Driver"" is, quite simply, not nearly as good as ""enlightened"" cinephiles make it out to be.",1.0
"If I could I will not giving any star, it's an horrible movie.  Robert Deniro is terrible in it, he gets on my nerves, Cybil Shepard is annoying, only Jodie Foster seem fresh and interesting but we don't saw her much.  To much violence for nothing and awful cheezy music.  It was soooo boring.",1.0
"I must have missed something. With all the lovely words of the previous reviewers of this film, you would think that this is the film of the century. Sorry, but no, it's not. It's not even in the top 1,000. There was nothing about this film that should appeal to anyone looking for entertainment. The greatest emotion you'll realize while watching this film is shear boredom.
""Taxi Driver"" changes gears so many times you really don't know where this film is heading. It makes so little sense and De Niro's performance is so uneven, you don't know if he's doing it on purpose or he's just a bad actor.
A good date film? No, it will kill the mood. A comedy? You may laugh once but probably unintentionally. An adventure? Only if you consider watching the trials and tribulations of a wacked out taxi driver adventurous. This film is all over the place and it never lets you get a grip on what the director is trying to tell you. Oh sure, now, they tell you that it's a genius of a film but while you're watching it you'll swear that the writer and director were using illicit substances while making this nonsense.
Anyone that can't write a screenplay at least as good as this in one day, simply isn't trying very hard. This movie is a tragic waste of time and your wife or girlfriend will leave the room while you sit there hoping it's going to get better. Well, guess what. It won't get better and you shouldn't even spend one second giving any thought to renting or buying this over-hyped, over-acted lobotomy of a film.",1.0

"I find it hard to believe that so many people are able to enjoy this movie.  Though not particularly long, it seems to drag by, and Scorsese doesn't help by leaving so much dead time, it turns into a graveyard, literally and metaphorically.  The theme is poorly conveyed, the plot is vapid and nonsensical, and the acting is fairly sub-par.  The characters are barley there, and their lack of development and history really adds to the convoluted plot.  In the end, it turns into an average testosterone driven shoot-out, leaving you angry and confused.  This, next to ""Runaway Bride"" and ""Home Alone"" is the worst movie I've ever seen.",1.0
"Apparently a film classic about a Vietnam veteran who becomes a taxi driver and then lets himself be broken down by the misery and the meaninglessness of modern society.

Seen with Year 2000 eyes, Taxi Driver does not have a great deal of appeal. It has purely historical value.

The best things you can say about this film is the very beautiful filming, plus that it is interesting to watch very young Robert DeNiro's and even younger Jodie Foster's already then great talents. You also get glimpses of Harvey Keitel.

"I enjoy almost anything Melanie Griffith is in, but this one was too silly and unbelievable.  Her character is supposed to be a smart, tough lawyer but she does everything that would either get a real lawyer disbarred, laughed out of court -- or killed.  Beautifully shot, great sets and locations, but everybody is wasted in this dopey script.  Nina Foch is a GREAT witchy woman, but I missed John Ritter completely (fooled by the beard)and had to rewind to catch his scene in the very beginning.",1.0
"Let's see, where to start.  Melanie Griffith is supposed to be one of the best, toughest, smartest defense attorneys in the city, but acts more like a former stripper playing at being a recent law school grad. I guess  seductive whispers, a slinky walk, and tepid one-line comebacks are all it  takes to free rapist/killers.  Realism is non-existent as she voluntarily  gives away key information/evidence to the DA and her powerful adversaries  before the trial even starts.  Her crack investigative team manages to  stumble across valuable clues at the drop of a hat without even a trace of  intelligent, logical, deductive reasoning or sleuthing.  The dialog is  absolutely inane, including an awful scene where this supposedly  hard-boiled attorney (Griffith) who has successfully defended the scum of  the earth, suddenly realizes a full five minutes into the interrogation of  her client (a major slimeball) that she believes his story--that he was  just having kinky sex, slapping his date around, and didn't really kill the  girl--and starts crying at this realization.  Supposed to be touching I'm  sure, but instead it was so out of place and baffling, I cringed while  laughing. In addition there's this weird, pointless side story about a  former client whom she got acquitted, then slept with, only to find out he  was actually guilty of rape all along.  Throughout the movie he repeatedly  calls her and taunts her through her answering machine causing her to  listen for several minutes before unplugging it, or turning it off, or  throwing it against the wall, but never doing anything that makes sense,  like changing her phone number.  Even this elicits no real emotion from  her, she basically sleepwalks through the movie.  But, worst of all, this  movie is boring--no suspense, no thrills, and I didn't care one bit about  the fortunes of any of the characters.  I have really liked Griffith in  several recent movies and do not understand this one at all, except that  she's just horribly miscast--as is everyone in this film.  In fact, why I  even devoted this much time in reviewing this escapes me--except maybe I'll  save someone a few bucks and a couple of wasted hours.",1.0
"If I could best describe this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, ""SLC Punk,"" is just plain stupid. This was one of the highly anticipated films that was released at ""The Sundance Film Festival"" in Park City, UT, a couple years back. Alas, there's virtually no plot, and no good dialouge. The incessant use of the ""F-word"" in SLC Punk - gets really old after a while - it made me want to cringe! Why couldn't the director of the movie go by the adage that ""less is more."" There's a lot of meaningless subtext, and a bunch of cavorting teenagers, who like to ""go-against-the-grain."" It authentically portrays the SLC Punk scene: you know, the spiked hair, mohawks, plenty of black leather and body piercings. It's about a bunch of young aspiring punk-rockers (anarchists/mallrats) - who at times - border on suicidal tendencies; where there's lots of drug-use; and the main characters making total jackasses out of themselves. Being from the SLC area, I was expecting a scintillating perfomance from these guys. (I wish they could've behaved themselves, in a dignified manner.) IT WAS FILMED IN UTAH, OF ALL PLACES! I THOUGHT IT WAS SO AWESOME! I saw some familiar scenes in SLC Punk: the [Mormon] Temple, the University of Utah Campus, and West High School. SLC Punk, wasn't what I was expected. I was so stoked about this movie from the beginning - and then all of a sudden - my excitment died down. I love punk music, through and through. It's just that, this movie came up way short. I didn't, however, get to see SLC Punk at the film festival, which is why I picked it up at the video store. This movie was so disappointing.

"Horrible movie.  This movie's representation of 80's punk rock is really a film about jocks-in-punks clothing masquerading as the real thing.  This totally [disappoints] in my punk-since-1980 opinion - but I'm sure all the empty-headed trendy ""punks"" of today that shop at Hot Topic will adore this movie - it feeds the punk stereotype for stupidity and violence that sadly ruined the early punk rock scene in the first place.",1.0
"When I've read and have heard all these positive reviews for this gigantic turkey I just can't believe my eyes or ears! I mean has anybody even read any of the comic books?! Well I have and FYI they were a lot more clever than this trash. I just don't see that this movie took any cues from the comic nor is it even as well written!! The cheesey attempts at humor were completely embarrassing as jokes/humor(if You call it that) felt like it was written by a 12 year old!! The comics that I read for Fright Night didn't meddle in worthless jokes and in general made them poignant. It wasn't just about dumb laughs for no real reason such as this turd of a movie possessed. I found William Ragsdale's performance as Charlie Brewster to be dorky! And needless to say he was alot better on Herman's Head. Chris Sarandon was not only very inconsistant in his laughable performance as vampire Jerry Dandridge but he was neither funny nor clever! To say nothing of that scene where one moment he's telling Charlie Brewster that he would give him a chance to forget all about him and what he knows then the next he's strangling him while trying to push him out the window. My gosh are they sure this is a comedy? 'Cause that was a crude moment. Anyway I liked Chris alot better in Child's Play a few years later. Amanda Bearse in a Pre-Married With Children role as Charlie's love interest was a forgivable enough performance despite her not giving it her all! Whoever that really annoying dork was that played Ed/Evil Ed he was just too unbearable and not very funny. The only thing he did that would even remotely pass as funny was his poor attempt to try and fly out a window appearing to fall. I'm sorry but there just isn't any excusing this bucket of vomit at all! Needless to say Roddy McDowell should just stick with Planet of the Apes! He just tried too hard in his half-a**ed performance as Peter Vincent. Anyhoo if you want to see a real vampire comedy I recommend you try Vampire in Brooklyn,Once Bitten, or even My Best Friend's a Vampire and stay away from this eye cancer on celluloid all together!",1.0
"SLC Punk is a complete waste of time and talent.  Matthew Lillard gives a  really good performance as an anarchist going through some major life  changes, but the rest of this film is a waste.  Way too much hokey  philosophy and hackneyed visual shots by a third rate cinematographer.  The  soundtrack is great--Sex Pistols, Fugazi, Specials, even a little Rush at  the end.  But Heroin Bob played by Goorjian is completely overacted and  ridiculous, he ruins every scene he is in with his inadequacies.  One other  thing, will someone please get the acid trip right.  The director of this  film has chosen to go the traditional Easy Rider acid trip route which is a  total wreck.  I'd love to see just once an accurate portrayal of LSD  consumption on the big screen (check out Fear and Loathing).  This movie is  for posers, I caught it on HBO at 2:00 in the morning so luckily I didn't  waste any cash on it.  But if your into a mindless story with an aimless  plot that leads nowhere then check out SLC Punk.",1.0
"This is a bad movie, straight up boring.  ""SLC Poser"" would be a more appropriate title, since the real crux of the film (which is explicit in the bumbling script) is protagonist Steve-O's realization that he has no  investment in any of the values he claims to hold so dear.  Neither does  the film, of course, and this movie is the cinematic equivalent of your  parents telling you you'll grow out of it.  If you're anything like the  punks in the movie, you will.  The version of punk shown here is like a  hissy fit being thrown by a spoilt child.
Perhaps worst of all this  film's crimes is the totally inappropriate production value.  MTV-style  quick cutting and super glossy film stock give this movie the atmosphere of  a Saturday morning cartoon, albeit one where ""f you"" is the tag  line that all the talking action figures say.  Steve-O's obnoxious mugging  and his sidekick Bob's lame ""dude""-isms only make this worse.  Even at its most superficial, punk is always gritty and unrefined, these  production techniques are more suited to ""hackers""-esque  technopop flicks.
I usually enjoy punxploitation film, but even the  soundtrack here feels tacked-on and jumbled.  Good punk films like  ""Suburbia"" make the punk elements feel organic, and have at least  a hint of empathy.  I never felt a thing in SLC Punk, even at the hackneyed  tragic ending, because who cares what happens to a bunch of rich frat boys  with mohawks?  Besides, every punk in this movie has perfect skin, so you  know it's just Hollywood exploitation.",1.0

"I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game series and zombie movies. Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.

Every problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.

Despite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.",1.0

"Wow, the first Resident Evil movie was nothing amazing or original but it was a decent, competently made little sci-fi/action/horror flick but this sequel manages to be worse in just about every possible way. Visually the movie looks terrible and shockingly it had a bigger budget than the first movie, never would've guessed that looking at the movie, many times when the zombies appear on screen the picture gets all distorted and the framerate becomes almost like a slideshow, if this was a really low budget movie I would say it was a technical issue but seeing as how it wasn't this was clearly deliberate and why any director would go out of their way to make their movie look as awful as possible is just beyond any logic or coherence. Aside from the that it's also filled with lots of extreme quick cutting, cheap post production looking slow mo, and the action scenes filmed mainly in close ups with quick cutting and shakiness make em utterly unwatchable.

Music wise it's very bland forgettable techno-ish stuff that lacks the memorable factor of Manson's music from the first movie. For an R rated zombie movie there's not really any blood or gore at all, aside from some F bombs and a few boob shots it feels much more like a PG-13. Aside from Oded Fehr none of the acting is particularily good, even Jovovich is off but I blame the director more than her. Also the big giant monster in the movie suddenly turns good and almost cries, yeah really lame. Easily the worst of the Resident Evil movies and one of the worst mainstream movies of the past decade, it's honestly right up or should I say below there with the average Uwe Boll movie.",1.0

"Rape by deception is not really funny at all. I felt gross watching this with my tween.
She was mortified that someone tricked Daryl Hannah into a sexual relationship and I was just as mortified that it wasn't rated accordingly.  This should have a warning on it.  It should read: This movie is almost all about Rape, but it isn't called rape in this movie. BEWARE, RAPE, FEMALE OBJECTIFICATION, LACK OF CONSENT... on and on really.  The movie could have been a great family comedy if they left out all the rape and storyline accepting rape culture.

Maybe I'm sensitive to rape because I've worked at the Rape Crisis Center so I acknowledge this. However, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men have been or will be sexually assaulted (tricking someone into sex is legally a sexual assault FYI). Sexual assault is one of the most under reported crimes: at least 54% of rapes are never reported; 3% of cases see any type of conviction (DOJ, 2006) -> so films like these that make it seem okay to sexually assault somone aids in the rape culture that preaches acceptance and makes women (especially women) less likely to report sexual assault.

I mean why would you report to the police something you just saw Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah acting out on the big screen (or your flat screen since its miles old now).  My point is, please someone at least label older films like these that rape is part of the story line.

"Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express. Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect. [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision]. Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans. Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained. Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada). To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').

Instead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts. It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie. Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice. The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil. They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied. There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture. Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen. Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film. The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone. The raping warden, with his piggish obese kids, is a metaphor for the appetite and stern lack of fidelity/tolerance that Stone seems to want to broadcast about Islam to the viewer. Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.  The viewer can't help but feel relief at the death of the warden, and then carries away from the movie farmer Stone's seed of predjudice against Islam.

The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a ""true story"" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims. Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: ""The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs."" and, ""I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'""",1.0

"Don't you love that studio deceit where they say something is ""based on"" a true story -- which they then think means they can distort and falsify virtually every single detail?  But after they've already changed and twisted every significant event in it anyway, why didn't they just say it took place in the mythical country of Xenophobia, instead of going ahead and viciously maligning an entire nation of the kindest, friendliest, most hospitable people on Earth?

The one TRUE fact is that Billy Hayes was a convicted drug smuggler who got caught red-handed. (Apparently the film-makers think that Hayes being a well-heeled American should entitle him to special exemptions from the law.)  Everything else is a lie.  The girlfriend?  Didn't exist!  The climactic (and inexcusable) ""nation of pigs"" speech?  Never happened!  Our macho ""hero"" firmly rejecting the advances of the blond guy?  Read the book -- Billy Hayes himself says that sometimes they made love.  Even the biting off tongue and escaping scene at the end is nothing like what really happened.  Virtually every detail of it was false, even the location.

Billy Hayes was never raped in the Turkish prison -- but if the real Billy took those blond curls of his into an AMERICAN prison, I'll bet he sure would have been.  He'd never be able to walk again.

I find it utterly contemptible that the film-makers rounded up a cast of ARMENIANS and GREEKS to play Turks as being a bunch of hideously sadistic goons.  Were they really that ignorant of history?  Not to mention that the worst and most brutal one was played by the very American Paul Smith.  There wasn't a real Turk in the pack.

Oliver Stone apologized to the Turkish people when he finally visited Turkey, and he was kindly forgiven -- but I sure wouldn't have let him off so easily.  His self-serving ""apology"" was far too little, and far too late.",1.0

Here is a quick way to figure out if you should watch this movie-

Do so at your own risk though, because I guarantee you will feel the urge to shoot someone within the first ten minutes. Good thing the Constitution lets us Americans own guns!

Midnight Express has quite a reputation for being a harrowing experience but I find the film quite contrived and lightweight.  If you want to check out some disturbing prison flicks I recommend Scum and Scrubbers.  The film starts of well and tense but then loses all pace and feels as real as a TVM.  Billy Hayes was a drug smuggler simple as that.  I'm sure his time in prison was quite uneventful as the tongue biting scene was totally out of character but one of the rare highlights in this throughly dull movie.  We got his long drawn out build up to the escape and when it happened everything was over in 10 minutes. I also did not see any caucasian Turkish prison guards with 5 days growth and long straggy hair but he managed to fool the twenty guards he walked past. I think the director had reached breaking point as well. Talk about a cheap ending various photographs of family members meeting him at the airport they must have run out of money.

"I've seen this movie many years ago, and I watched it last night again. I've still got the same feeling, THIS IS NOT TURKEY. There are hardly any Turkish actors in the movie. Most of the movie wasn't even shot in Turkey. The reviews here made me very upset, more than the movie itself. People have the tendency to judge a country and its entire people based on a movie, which was shot in 1978. Midnight Express is not just a movie. Turkey has been fighting with this image for the whole time.

It is a true story, all right. There are a lot of movies based on true stories in which the moral is all wrong. If you've seen this movie and you think this country is a terrible place, I'd say think again.

1. Criminals are not welcome in any country in the world. If you are a drug dealer, do it in your country.

2. Time is passing and things change. For countries like Turkey, things get better and better every single day. In this movie, you are looking at a 30-year-old misrepresented image of a country. A lot of things have changed in the last thirty years, the judgemental system and the police have changed all over. Turkey had a huge incentive to change, the EU. And hopefully it will be a member soon.

3. TURKEY IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. Believe it or not, it is!!! Turkey's biggest revenue is tourism. If it was that scary, tens of millions of people wouldn't go to Turkey every year. Turkish people are known with their hospitality. They are not some kind of uncivilized monsters, like some critics here and the movie itself have implied.

There sure is an audience for it in America!
Not Without My Daughter was filmed in Israel, with actor mostly from Israel, Midnight Express was filmed mostly with Greek actors. Obviously certain governments funded these movies, they are obviously propoganda.

"This is one of the worst movies I've seen ever. This is a story about a man, nammed Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who tries to smuggle hessise(turkish drug) across the boader to America. But there is one small problem he gets caught. He is sentecenced to serve four years in a turkish prison. Billy leaves a worried girlfriend, father, mother, brother, and sister behind. In the prison he meets durgies and a whole new kind of people he never thought would exsist. The guards beat and tourcher not only him but everybody in that prison and other prisons in that part of the world were just the same. In Turkey who don't have the right to free speech like in America so when he went to court he had a hard time trying to defend himself. Billy is then sentenced to 30 years in the prison which I might add does not really qualify as a prison at all in my opinon. Billy and Rand quaid and one other person try to escape for every day for a whole week but then they are caught by a inmatte who gives randy qaid away. Randy is beaten so bad that he is in a hospital for months with a hernia. Billy gets so mad he kills ruski the immate who gives them away and basically goes insane witth rage and then immeditly after he is sent to a turkish mental institution with pyscos. His girlfriend talks to him and he has a new light os getting out. He bribes then kills a guard puts on his uniform and leaves. Three months later he crosses the boarder into Greece and gets on a plane and goes back to America to reunite with his family.
This is emmotional true story. I don't like this movie for many reasons one is almost have the movie is spoken in the turkish natoinal language. This has too many graphic seens that I don't care for and many people won't like.

"April 23, 2000
As you know, Alan Parker is a director and Midnight Express, won two Academy Awards in 1978, was directed by him.  He said that this movie was his most effective movie.  Midnight Express was showed as  based on true story belonging to Billy Hayes and its lead player was Brad  Davis.  Sure, it directed by Alan Parker and written by Oliver Stone.  Shortly, the movie begins with Brad Davis' caught while he is smuggling  drugs out of T&uuml;rkiye.  Then he was sent to prison and he faced lots of  events out of humanity.  The most effective parts of the movie are these  torture scenes thought as horrible by the viewers.  We can see that  Midnight Express, caused many arguments about T&uuml;rkiye and Turks because of  these terrible scenes blame them.  In my opinion, these scenes were  exaggerated and especially included racism, so it does not depend on the  art principles that are to be international and uniting the nations.  Therefore, I can say that if I were Alan Parker with his knowledge and  experiments, I would make a better job for art and humanity than this  movie.
____If I were Alan Parker, firstly I would start to change this  wrong thesis of the movie that 'This movie was adapted from a real story'  (?) because Billy Hayes, has the true story, said that this movie had been  changed a lot and exaggerated very much to make more effective.  So I ask  you that if I had not done that, how could I have been realistic and having  common sense director or human?  Secondly, I would continue to change the  general atmosphere that all of the people in the movie apart from main  character are sadist because this opinion causes to many prejudices about a  nation, Turks and this is not realistic.  So I would show the prison as  extremely instead of showing everything any parts of T&uuml;rkiye.  As you know,  every country can have these unexpected events but certain they are not  general because there is no systems whose aims are to hurt humans.  So I  would have caught a good point for discussing some prisons in T&uuml;rkiye.  Perhaps many actors and actress would have helped me to make the movie and  I could have used the real Turks on the movie instead of their fakes.  In  my opinion, that would have been more effective, more realistic and more  useful.  Thirdly, I would have used some of good character in Turks and  emphasize again that all Turks are not bad people, they have some problems  like all nations.  So I would have behaved universally and not do injustice  to lots of people live and lived friendly and fraternally in Anatolia.  Fourthly, perhaps the most important thing, I would have been sorry for  making mistakes because I could not have done all of them and turn my  movie, full of the prejudices and racism, to more objective and humanistic  way.
____In my opinion, all of the people whose goals are to be universal  and uniting of whole humanity like art's would make better if they were  Alan Parker.  They never hurt any other nations in the world, Turks and  whose unique leader, Atat&uuml;rk who says 'Peace at home, peace in the world'  and presented April 23, written date of this essay, to all children in the  world as a symbol of peace and friendship.",1.0

The actors used in the film as Turkish authority are not Turkish which is the  worst part of the movie. If you are going to make film based on a true  story , you must do it properly first! This film could not have achieved  its goal , no , it shows Turkey as Iran which is not. I accept that there  were many things which were wrong in Turkey 20-30 years ago but the film is  especiialy puts Turkey like an Arabian country , all in dust and every  thing.

"I think we all agree that this 1987 classic romantic comedy is absolutely wonderful, entertaining, magic, funny and hylarious. The best romantic comedy for some, one of the best comedies of the 80's for others. Great story, incredible performance of steve martin , great production and artistic direction by Fred Schepisi. We can argue with that of course, but one thing beyond discussion, is that this Sony Pictures 2002 DVD edition for this masterpiece is so awful, that it manages to destroy the experience.

I had to put up with a VHS edition for 15 years, for what! This? I can say without any doubt, that this is one of the worst DVD editions i own, behind my Asian bootleg martial arts copies. Absolutely awful, this edition manages to restrain the impact of the movie with all the worst features of the fullscreen edition: Extreme close-ups, alternate or moving angles from the same take, chopped off characters from the scenes, people talking to shoulders and corners, people talking from outside the picture, missing scenarios and landscapes, blurry video quality... my god! Not even the 5.1 english soundtrack could emerge, not even the movie could! Extras? The movie trailer...In widescreen! It was torture.

By far, the worst 7 dollars i have ever spent, and a disapointment i'm never gonna forget.

My recomendation for fans looking for this wonderful movie in DVD: Go outside the store and get the widescreen edition, online or on local stores. I'm desperatly seeking for other better editions, i'm even willing to download it, or even buy a bootleg.

Whatever you do: Please, please, don't buy this awful Sony 2002 fullscreen edition.

And Sony pictures: Widescreen versions fit the screen too!",1.0
"Like other reviewers, I am apalled that this wonderful movie is available only in pan & scan format, chopping off close to half the picture. This is just inexplicable--even when this was released a few years ago, it was quite unusual for high profile anamorphic films like this to be released only in a P&S version.

Steve Martin may think he's being clever, but really he isn't.  I absolutely hated his charcter, who, despite his big nose, was awfully cocky.  Now, I wasn't a huge fan of the real Cyrano de Bergerac, so that MAY be part of the problem.  Nevertheless, the plot made me roll my eyes and every bit of the movie bored me to tears.

Forget what all of you are saying about 'It's another silly zombie movie' or 'It's from a game so I suppose it was always going to be bad'.

The reality is, the games are extremely well executed, as are George A Romero films (G.A.R being the original guy who was to direct this.)

A great story is in the telling, this story was not told well. It could not have been told worse. This guy, quite obviously, has no idea of how to tell a story or direct a film. I trusted him due to Mortal Kombat and Event Horizon, but after Resident Evil and the appauling AVP, it would appear that those first two films are only as good as they are due to good producers and scripts.

"After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel. Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job.

RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.

I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses.

In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year. Somebody would literally have to pay me to see it!",1.0
"To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didn't even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.

When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didn't even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series.",1.0

"Following the moderate success of the first ""eh, good enough"" film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse continues the story of Alice, one of the few survivors of the T-Virus outbreak that turned the Hive facility's employees into flesh-eating zombies. The Umbrella Corporation has reopened the Hive and the T-Virus has escaped into the Raccoon City above it. Now, Alice - who is now superpowered thanks to Umbrella tinkering with her DNA - must once again escape hordes of zombies, hellhounds, and Umbrella-created mutations before the whole city is nuked off the map.

With her this time are characters that are actually from the games the movie is based on - sexy cop Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr). Since the Alice character was inspired by the Jill character, they are almost exactly the same atttude-wise, and do we really need two of the same character in the same movie? Sorry, we don't. The movie is supposed to take place during the Resident Evil 3 game which Jill is the star of, but whenever Jill gets in trouble in this film, Alice swoops in like Supergirl and saves her ass. They totally waste the Jill character just to keep the awful Alice story going, and it's sad to see the character that stars in the game get upstaged left and right by a character that was never in the games. Booooo! Maybe they should have just left the game's characters out of this film so they could keep the film and game separate.

This brings up the problems with the story. Since Alice wasn't in any of the games and this film is supposed to be about the third Resident Evil game, this puts the film in the ""it's kind like but kinda not like the game"" category, so you don't even know where it exists in the canon of the games' storyline. Second, some of the plot points are incredibly stupid from the start. After all, why would a corporation design a research facility with a special security system designed to seal the place off should something disasterous happen and then try to reopen the facility not once but TWICE once something so bad happens that the place needs to be sealed off? Couldn't they take the hint the first time they reopened the place and lost an entire Special Ops team inside? And wasn't the guy that escaped that was infected with their T-Virus enough of a hint that there had been a T-Virus outbreak? The logic that sets this film in motion is so annoyingly flawed. You'd think a major coporation like Umbrella was smarter than this. They could have at least tried to explain it off that the Hive was reopened with the purpose of letting the T-Virus escape to see how effective their bio-weapon was in a major city? That's one of the explanations they give in the game, but they don't even do that in the film.

Second, why are they giving Alice more and more powers? How are we supposed to relate to her? Part of the appeal of zombie films - or most films in general - is that you can relate to the characters. You can mentally put yourself in their position, and you worry about their well-being. But what happens when the character you're supposed to relate to becomes so powerful they can do somersaults, know tons of martial arts out of the blue, and can kill people with telepathy? Alice becomes so powerful and superhuman, you never fear she won't survive. It's called the Superman Syndrome - a character becomes so powerful, that you don't care what happens to them because you already know.

Now there's the Nemesis. They turn a badass killing machine into a good guy in the end! Part of what makes some villains so fun is that they're so bad - they're so bad, they're good. That was part of the appeal of Nemesis. But instead, they turn him into a kinder, gentler Nemesis who saves the day in the end.

The Resident Evil movies are supposed to be zombie movies, but they're made into action/sci-fi bullcrap. Sure, zombie films have some action in them, but it's more realistic action. Sadly, these films use stylized action that look like they were taken from the Matrix Bargain Bin with its slow motion bullets, wire-fu, and choppy editing to try making the film look ""cool"". And they fail miserably. Zombie films make the action secondary, but this is an action film and the zombies are secondary.

The first film spent half its running time zombie-free, as they tried to set up suspense and that's pretty understandable. This time around, there should be zombies galore, right? But the plotting is so damn slow, you almost forget there are zombies in the film! And even when the zombies are on-screen, they use this filming style that looks like choppy stop-motion animation! Who thought this was a good idea in post-production? Whoever has this film editor hired now on ANY film, fire them immediately.

UPDATE - This visual characteristic is called ""dropping frames,"" and it usually occurs accicentally during editing when transferring footage from film to digital editing software. When the software is having trouble converting one of the frames the footage for whatever reason, that frame is ""dropped"". The blur yousee is the footage skipping over the missing frame. It happens rarely, and when it does happen, it's either barely noticeable to the audience , or it requires the editor to make adjustments or find a different method to convert the footage. But in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it appears that the editor is intentionally dropping frames to create this visual effect. Why? Is there something wrong with the zombies that they have to obscure the audience's view of them? Do they think (erroneously) that it makes the zombies scarier? Or are the zombies too visually disturbing that they have to be blurred in order to make an R rating?  Whatever the reason, this is a TERRIBLE visual characteristic, and whoever masterminded this decision needs to go back to college and take a few film classes.

I'm sorry, the LJ character is so blatantly offensive. Do we really need the loud-mouthed black comic relief these days? The only way this would have been more offensive and cliched is if they had some Vaudeville-esque performer in blackface tap-dancing and eating watermelon throughout the film.

And I'm certain that the only reason they made it possible to kill the zombies by snapping their necks was to tone down the gore and get it past the MPAA with an R rating, not to mention that video games still have the ""just kid's stuff"" reputation, and thus movies based on video games suffer a similar stigma so they have to be toned down for ""the kids."" But this is supposed to be a ZOMBIE FILM, it's supposed to be gory! The games, which are supposedly ""just kid's stuff,"" actually have MORE gore than the movies made about them. So as far as zombie films go, the Resident Evil films are pretty tame. Hell, they could have gone with more gore, taken it out so the film could get an R, then put it back in for an Unrated Version on DVD. That would have been more acceptable than these zombie film abominations.

And am I the only one who is so tired of the blue tint they see in every action/sci-fi film since The Matrix? I haven't been to a single city where the lighting is blue EVERYWHERE at night. Enough with the blue lighting, damn it.

It's almost like the filmakers were constantly trying to outdo themselves. Granted, the costumes are very well done, the characters look like the characters, but there are just too many ridiculous searching scenes and dull lines like ' try to shoot em in the head' and the classic ' who the f are you?'

When the dumbest looking monster I have ever seen shows up on screen bound to a rocket launcher I was embarassed to be watching this movie. The acting is so poor it makes Paul Walker's thespian skills comprable to Sir Ben Kingsley's. There are so many explosions the action scenes lose meanings.

"Resident Evil is an onion of stupidity. It's just layer after layer after layer of the most retarded plot points, character dialogue and CG that I have ever been forced to sit through.

The story goes that under the streets of Racoon City there is a secret facility (The Hive) controlled by Umbrella (a massive pharmacutical company) which is designed for creating vast viral weaponry.
An outbreak occurs turing all the staff into flesh hungry zombies.

Now to get to the aspects of the film that made it so god-awful.
I'm pretty much going to ruin the ending for anyone reading further than here so if you haven't seen the film and actually care about the end don't read any further. Repeat MAJOR SPOILERS!

The outbreak occurs when Spencer shatters a vial of T-virus against a lab table on his way out of the Hive. The icicle virus melts, the water evaporates and carries viral particles through the air vents, infecting the entire staff.

Do you have any idea how unrealistic and stupid it is to have a facility where it's cubicles share the same air as laboratories working with Level 4 biohazards?!?

Next, the security team successfully infiltrates the Hive in order to stop Red Queen (the main computer) who has killed all the inhabitants in order to contain the outbreak.
Does Red Queen greet the Umbrella personnel and explain her actions to them? Does she reveal ANY helpful information to these people who in all respects she should view as her masters?? NO!
First she slaughters half the team in a laser grid based trap, and says ""You're all going to die down here."" The laser trap was stupid because there is an area of about 3 feet by the entrance to Red Queen's chamber where the laser grids can't reach. The leader of the security group is safe for a bit and actually backs up so he can get cut to pieces like the rest of his team.

Then after all the zombies have been released, you see these shambling corpses with bite marks, and half eaten faces. This makes no sense as everyone was killed by Red Queen at the same time. So they all should have become zombies at the same time, which would give them no reason to feed on one another.

The whole Alice in Wonderland fixation is a waste as well.
Elevator behind the mirror (looking glass), main character's name (Alice), going underground/down the rabbit hole), Red Queen. This doesn't help to forward or support the storyline in any way. It was all fun and cryptic in The Matrix, but it's pretty obvious the story writers just ripped it off.

"I could not believe how bad this movie was!  Paul Anderson made AvP a bad movie, but I didn't know he could possibly write something this bad.  He even goes as far as stealing the ""We are assets, expendable assets"" line from Predator and ""Newt, I like that"" line from Aliens (although it's ""Angie, I like that"").  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the characters as there is only one returning from the original movie and the rest are just thrown in for thrills.  Jill Valentine's inclusion is absurd and pointless as the first movie had nothing to do with the characters from the games, so why include them in the sequel?  Alice from the first movie is equally two-dimensional as she has suffered a complete pointless personality change.  She protested killing people after they were bitten in the first movie, but the first thing she does when that happens to someone in this is point a gun at them and prepare to fire.  Yeah, I know it's terrible.  This is the most illogical movie of all time.  Why would Alice drive her motorcycle through the stain-glass window of a church instead of walking through the door, and how did she even know how to get in there?  Why didn't Alice simply kick the villain's butt when he said ""Fight him"" and she said ""no"".  Moments earlier she had killed several guards with relative ease, but now she couldn't do it?  I don't think so.  I cannot believe that this story was bought and actually green-lit to be made into a feature film.  That's the most ridiculous thing of all time and after Ghosts of Mars and this movie Screen Gems' credibility has just fallen to rock bottom.  No wonder Paul Anderson didn't direct this, he must have known that it was one of the worst films of 2004 before it was even made.",1.0

"THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!

 I have never seen anything so insultingly lame! How can people actually LIKE this garbage?! If any proof is needed that our education system has went into the toilet, the popularity of this stupid crap is it. This is not a movie, it's a movie trailer with no story to advertise. If I could give it negative stars, I definitely would.

 If you like wrestling and have more than two little Nascar numbers adhered to your car, you'll probably like this inbred junk, otherwise avoid it at all costs. Even that ""Alien vs. Predator"" crap was not this bad, and it reeked as well. The reason they make crappy movies like this is because morons keep paying to see and own them. You people are ruining the world for the rest of us.

 If you want to see an actual HORROR movie, pick up The Exorcist, The Shining, Dawn of the Dead (the original, not that stupid remake piece of filth), or Session 9. Those films had a few advantages over this one. For starters, they had DIRECTORS, not Hollywood, pony-knub sporting cel-phone addicts whose parents bought them a career. Secondly, they had STORIES. Actual CHARACTERS with THOUGHTS, say it with me, THOUGHTS...that's right. Their brains were involved in what was happening in the film, they weren't merely posing with guns and puckering their lips at the camera.

 This movie is for fans. Do you know what a fan is? It's a person who has already decided that they like something before they have even seen it. that is a form of prejudice. Fans are not flattering to a true Artist, because they aren't evaluating the Artists performance objectively, they are merely ""yes-men"". Cheerleaders. The true Artist doesn't want cheers for bad work. And the hack actor secretly laughs at the fans when they accept garbage as quality.

 I'm not trying to be spiteful, but we are being had. There is an elephant in the living room, and someone has to say it.

 If you can't see that ALL movies like this are nothing but commercial garbage to feed the great American cattle drive, then you are either hopelessly ignorant, or borderline retarded. There are lots of great movies to see and own, you are wasting your life watching this crap when you could be seeing movies that keep you thinking about them and their characters for days, weeks, months even. Sometimes YEARS. Life is too short for this level of stupidity.

 If you DO like it and buy it and even (gag) watch it AGAIN, remember that every time some moron is driving like an idiot and holding you up in traffic, it is because the entertainment industry is dumbing down the country, and they get away with it because people like you are helping them. Movies should involve your brain. They should not use flashy camera moves to try and hide the inadequacies of the writer and director. Stop helping Hollywood make people stupid for money, after all, they aren't giving you any of the money they make.

 Or consider this. The people who make movies in hollywood are the same people who nominate and award Oscars. They don't EVER, EVER nominate or award this kind of movie. That is because even THEY DON'T LIKE THEIR OWN FILMS!!! They pretend to in interviews and in commentary tracks, but obviously they aren't going to say ""Well, actually, me and Herbert Bumble-dong only wrote, directed, and produced this film because of all the money we can make off of bovine America"". They won't say that into the camera. They say that to their peers, though. otherwise, their peers would think they were fools. Because only a fool would like a movie this bad.",1.0

"This is one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen in my life, and that includes the original Night of the Living Dead.

Apocalypse shows me a crew of people who are supposed to be converting a
video game to a movie, and instead decide to screw logic, reason, and sanity, and just make a movie that will catter to devout, die hard fans of the series. Why does the story have to make sense?? Just slap Resident Evil on the cover and people will pay.

The story begins where the first RE left off. Alice is awakening in an Umbrella hospital and realizes the world is not what she knew. Things are...well they're sh*t Most people are either dead or undead, and the police are trying to create an effective resistance against the zombies. Hotshot, loss cannon S.T.A.R.S cop Jill Valentine takes leave of her suspension and walks into the RPD just in time to cap a few zombies. She then reminds everyone in a tone that is up to par with porn star acting ""They're infected, you have to shoot them  in the head.""

Oh but it get's even better when Jill, her partner, and a reporter are trapped inside a church with two lickers. Alice bursts in on a motorcycle to save the day and the first question I have is, ""How did she know they were there?""

Then they all get to battle hand to hand with a bunch of rotting graveyard zombies which is funny because A. How did the T-virus infect the already-dead-6ft-burried corpses? and B. why did they choose THAT moment to unearth themselves?
The choreagraphy looks good, but then again it's hard to not look like a bad ass when your opponent makes no attempt to defend himself.

Later after making a deal with the lead scientist for a ticket out of this nightmare, they go to a school to retrieve his daughter as their part of the arrangement.
Low on people and ammo in a school full of zombie kids, they do the smart thing and split up which means; yep you guessed it someone is going to die.

Jill asks, ""What Yield""
Alice, ""50 Megatons""
Jill, ""!@$! me""
Now, how does a police officer know the difference between nuclear yields..and WHY does it matter! It's a nuke! I don't think Umbrella intends on destroying half the city.

Watching Nemesis was just sad. Why is he after S.T.A.R.S members? In the video game it was because they were out to expose Umbrella's dirty secret. In the movie its....""because they're the best."" stupid stupid...

Resident Evil is how a zombie movie should never be done.
Horrible acting, a storyline full of holes and inconsistencies, and the feeling that the creators of this ""movie"" cared more about counting the money it would make rather than making somthing decent give this movie the 1 star is most certainly deserves.
Rent it if you want a good laugh, and if you want to watch a decent zombie flick try the new Dawn of the Dead.",1.0

"There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.

The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.

For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.

Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.

The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.",1.0
"I watched it till the middle and wanted to throw it away. I't's an insult to the game. The acting was terrible. The story line was obvious and uninteresting. It was generally meant for those who had played the game.but I can promise you that if you have played resident evil three, you will find nothing to intrest you here. The game has more drama, more suspense more interesting and intelligent twists that the movie appalingly lacked. In my oppinion the movie itself was a good introduction, I hope the next movie will take up from there and give us something worth watching!!!!",1.0
"This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Firts off I love the Resident Evil video games. This movie did not have one character from the video game. Second off George A. Romero was going to write and direct this movie and was replaced by Paul Anderson(probably becasuse the mainstream movie audiences are flippin' idiots and don't know what a good horror film is). I read Romero's script and it had everything in the Resident Evil game. I hated that the zombies had CG faces. I hated the CG in this movie period. The plot was HORRIBLE. The acting was HORRIBLE. I left the theatre in disgust. Oh yeah, the last thing they had to kill in the movie was a ""Licker"". In Resident Evil 2 game you can kill a ""Licker"" with two shotguns blasts. In the movie they had the hardest time killing the ""Licker"". Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I guess that's what you can expect with Paul Anderson. I refuse to watch Resident Evil 2. Long live Romero. Can't wait for Land of the Dead.",1.0
"This is terrible!

One of the worst films ever made.

I am a fan of Biohazard(Resident Evil) videogame, and compared to it, this film sucks. Although Anderson is calling himself a ""fan"" of this game, he is not a fan OF THIS game. A TRUE FAN would have never crated something like this.

These are the differences between a videogame and a film:

1 - In film: Nemesis is controlled by a computer(cyborg).

  In game: Nemesis is just smart, and he is not controlled by a computer.

2 - In film: Nemesis is created from the T-Virus(Matt was sliced by licker and infected with the T-Virus)

  In game: Nemesis was created using ""Nemesis Parasite"" and Nemesis Parasite was created in France. Besides most hosts possesed by Nemesis Parasite would die; and the hole process is unstable.....

3 - In film: T-Virus samples are stored in funky capsules made after DNA model.

  In game: T-Virus samples are stored in normal capsules, without any ""cool"" crap.

4 - In film: T-Virus is created by Dr. Ashford to save his dying child.

  In game: T-virus has a very long and twisted story; it was created by Dr. James Marcus by combining leech DNA and progenitor virus (Mother virus) to be used as a weapon.

5 - In film: In the end of the movie Alice can use a power of her mind to kill.(It sucks!)

  In game: There is no Alice; and there is no super crap mind powers.

6 - In film: The whole Raccoon City incident happens because the stupid named ""Hive"" lab was reopened.(Shouldn't the computer tell Umbrella HQ that the T-Virus was leaked?)

  In game: It happens because Dr. William Birkin was asassinated by Umbrella....(Rats were the carriers)

7 - In film: Raccoon City was bombed by Umbrella.(By doing so they tell US goverment that THEY ARE the ones responsible for this incident.)

  In game: It was bombed by US goverment.

There are many other stupidities in the film; and it sure is NOT connected to the game(unlike Anderson said). It's for you to decide if this film is good or not, but a true fan would never buy it.",1.0

"Let me first take a second just to say that i have never written a movie review in the past, but i am a person that when extremely pleased or highly dissatisfied often feels the need to say something, so here it is: This movie is without a doubt one of the most worst action/horror/scifi/whatever the hell peice of crap kinda movie you want to call it. What bothered me most outside of the huge plot holes was that this movie was a horrid rip of of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (which i will add was a much better movie by far than this piece of tripe). What the producers of this movie relied on was the fact that the audience they were going after (young males 16-25) probably have never seen or heard of the movie ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK thus wouldnt know that there wasn't one single fresh or original idea in the whole movie. Yes it was nice seeing Alice and Valentie (pretty faces and nice bodies to attract the boys) kick some butt, ill admit, but when you actualy go to the lengths of stealing another persons movie idea you'd think they could at least make the plot work (i.e. to reanimate dead bodies they MUST be infected with the T-Virus, yet when the wayward team are running through a grave yard, corpes come up from the ground. Can someone please tell me how they, 1) got out of ther coffins from 6 feet down, and then tell me how they were infected with the T-virus?)I won't bore you with more details of the dreadfulness of this rip off, my only point was to warn any of you Resident Evil 1 fans that were thinking of picking this up (by the way i did like part one)If you really want to see a better version (AND NOT A RIPPED OF PIECE OF GARBAGE) of what was meant in APOCALYSE, rent or buy ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK with Kurt Russell, i think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1.0

I've never had problems with Amazon's On Demand services before, so I tested other videos that I had purchased or rented in the past -- no problems there, so it was definitely the quality of ""The Prince of Tides.""

"i've never gotten dizzy in a movie before but this movie almost gave me a headache. the camera angles were so bad that even paul anderson himself admitted that there were some 'issues'. half the time, i couldn't even tell who was hitting who. so people can't say that resident evil apocalypse was directed well. i'm sorry, but if anderson himself said that, and he wrote the thing, then c'mon...at least give me that. so yea, setting aside the fact that i'm a huge fan of the games, i can honestly say that people weren't liking the film when i saw it in the theatre. i could hear people complaining in the theatre 'while' i was watching it...and trust me, they were just regular movie-goers, not fans. and what was the deal with the part where jill was trying to light the gas? could alice just kinda read her mind or something? i mean, where did she come from? did you ever even NOTICE that? *blinks* explain that if you wish...but you're just reaching if you can. not to mention, how many times was alice going to explain that she worked for the umbrella corporation? alright, we got it already, we saw the first movie...and even if we didn't, you STILL explained Alice's history more than once in this movie! it felt like it was made for tv or something... and i admit, the previews made it look promising, but that's maybe because i thought that alice had a real purpose for running down the side of a building...perhaps because it was blowing up? but no...she just wanted to kick someone in the head. *eye roll* look, jill was way too gun-ho for my taste. and i don't even see why she had to be...i never thought that any of the characters were ever in any 'real' danger...it wasn't good for horror...it wasn't good for action...it just wasn't good. the creator of the series, shinji mikami, was quoted as saying that the movies were just ""interesting"". he didn't say much else... hmm...could it be that it didn't really matter what he thought because the rights had already been sold? look, without shinji...the games wouldn't exist...and we wouldn't have resident evil...'period'. anderson, along with many others, really butchered mikami's hard work. they changed it...and that's really insulting to him, i'm sure. at least make a decent movie if you have a 40-50 million dollar budget. i really hope that they don't make a third...they just seem to waste money and milk that 'resident evil' name for all it's worth. there's no way these movies would have gotten as much money as they did, without that name... and as a movie itself, setting aside the fact that it's based on something, it really just isn't fun. i just think some people are afraid to admit that it's bad...just because it's called 'resident evil'. and btw, i know that by movie standards, they didn't have much of a budget, but i'd really appreciate it if people would just start asking themselves...""could i have done a better job if i had 40 million dollars?""",1.0
"Ok, ok, the scenery is beautiful, Nick Nolte is a great actor, but I still can't understand why this movie was so highly acclaimed.  I thought it was a pain to watch.  Plus, the ""moral"" of the story seems to be ""Have an illicit affair...it's good for you, and it's good for your marriage.""
  My other gripe about this film is that much of it seems centered around the glorification of Streisand and of the character she plays.  The film seems to be singing out, ""Look at me. I'm hot. I'm brilliant. I'm irresistable...and I heal people.""  Yep, this character's only flaw seems to be that she didn't pick a husband as perfect as herself. I take that back--she can heal people, but not her son.

In 1991, I was appalled by Ms. Streisand's miniskirts and in particular her pink sweater cut SO low in the back. The wardrobe wasn't appropriate for one Dr. Lowenstein. The wardrobe was clearly a vehicle for one reluctantly aging pop star.
Also, the music was so loud, so epic at times that I literally had to cover my ears. In one scene Blythe Danner left the room, but you could still see her reflection in a picture on a wall, waiting for her cue.
I loved the first half of the book, hated the second. The movie was like fingernails scraping down a chalk board from the time I entered the theater.",1.0

"This movie was so bad it made me angry. Angry because it should be scary. But this director doesn't even try for horror. He goes for action and he fails at that too. The problem is, this is a director who simply doesn't know how to make a movie. What's the movie about? I'll tell you. There's this super woman, this group of people, a mad scientist and a monster guy and they all run around shooting stuff. There, you don't need to see it now. My favorite scene is when this super sexed up cop enters a room with a little girl and there are zombies in the room and the girl is scared but the cop says not to worry because the zombies are slow and they can just run right around them. HAHAHAHA! That takes any kind of threat out of zombies right there. End the movie now. But no. It drags on through this plot that makes absolutely no sense. Somebody explain to me what the point is of scientists making two monster people and making them battle each other. There's no suspense in this movie, no drama, horrible acting, so-so special effects and no story what so ever.

And the zombies...oh my God this amateur director uses slow motion and some cheesy blur effect to make them ""scary""!!! Terrible. My advice is rent Shaun of the Dead or the brilliant Dawn of the Dead remake if you want to see a fun zombie movie.

This movie is NOTHING like the game OR the books.

"This film is a complete misrepresentation of the book ""Prince of Tides."" After reaching  of the film I couldn't stomach it any longer, I turned it off. The Prince of Tides is NOT just about the love story between Tom and Susan, it is also about growing up in the South and living amongst a dysfunctional family of abuse and social problems. There was absolutely nothing about Luke in the movie. Which by the way is the REAL Prince of Tides. Tom Wingo (Nolte) is NOT the Prince of Tides as stated in the movie. In fact the poem written by Savannah titled ""Prince of Tides"" was already written by the time Tom shows up in NY.

"i have little good to say about this movie.  as a therapist myself, i feel the therapist in this movie was repugnant...totally unethical in sleeping with her patient...obviously an emotionally disturbed woman.  to analyze it just a bit, i can't help but think that it was the writer's fantasy that their therapist have sex with them...any good therapist would tell you that what barbra streisand's character did would ultimately prove very destructive to the patient.
yet this movie stated that it was okay for her to have sex with him...because he ""wasn't really her patient.""  well, for starters, it's equally BAD THERAPY for her to have sex with...a patient's brother...but the fact is, she was treating him LIKE a patient, giving him real sessions and asking him personal questions about himself.  in short, he WAS her patient, and there's no excuse for what she did...it violates all boundaries:  professional, personal and emotional.
and i say this movie is immature because clearly the people who made this movie and acted in it had no idea of the real emotional effect such a relationship would have on a character such as nick nolte's.
i've worked with patients who have had sex with past therapists, and let me tell you...in the best of cases it proves very disturbing to them in the long run.  it's not a subject to be treated lightly, because it's not, despite what it might look like, a romance.  in fact, it's much closer to incest.
sick, sick movie.  and scary (but perhaps not surprising) that it became so popular in america.
and by the way, even if it is a fantasy (a normal one) for people to want to seduce their therapists, it doesn't mean for ONE SECOND that it would be healthy IF THEIR THERAPISTS GIVE IN TO THEIR PATIENTS' WISHES!  the whole point of therapy is that the therapist understands this...and keeps their boundaries, modeling healthy boundaries and limits.",1.0
"I'm not a videogame nut, so I guess I missed this film's 'good' points.  The only redeeming qualities ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts.  Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.

"This is the sequel to 2002 first Resident Evil, which is based on the popular video game series. The movie starts right where the first one left off and you don't have to worry about them messing up any of the plot points because there is no plot to either movie. Instead of plot, you have Jovovich and a few other people running around shooting, stabbing, punching, exploding and basically killing every kind of zombie that happens to cross their path. It is nothing but non-stop action and explosions the perfect thing to watch if you are trying to fall asleep. The zombies spread their plague by biting their victims which makes you wonder why Jovovich and the other women in the movie run around in shorts and tank tops. You could ask, but remember there is no plot so just let it go. Unlike King Arthur, where I was told no one wants to watch a movie with ugly people in it, Resident Evil is filled with ugly people. Really ugly people. It tanked at the box office so therefore, the ugly people rule must be right.

"What I mean by ""fart in the wind"" is that once it's out in the open, it goes away fast, but while it's in the vicinity it's seriously rank. I couldn't get over the fact that the first one was fairly good, and this one just let me down. The story can't decide whether it's going to follow the games' story lines or if it's going to go on it's own. It takes some characters from the games like Jill, Carlos, Sherry, and Nicolei, and makes every single one pointless. Even Alice, who was likable to a certain degree in the first one (at least you want her character to live) but in this one she is just a [jerk]. You really didn't care what characters lived or died in this tradgedy that calls itself a film. Even Jovovich who is a decent actress did a poor job, and don't even get me started on the other actors. Especially the chick who played Jill. Just watch the way she holds her guns. She obviously had no training whatsoever. And Nemesis just look like a pile of poo rapped in armor. He looked so fake! And if you haven't played the games or read the books, you will have no idea whats going on. It never even explained what the S.T.A.R.S were, and therefor leaves all the non-gamers totally clueless.

If you actually liked this movie I recomend: House of the Dead, its a HORRIBLE zombie flick. The worst I have ever seen, actually worse than this one. And if you liked both movies, you have bad taste.

What I learned from Resident Evil: Apocalypse: Nothing, this is a no-brainer.",1.0

Take everything you love about zombies and throw it away...this movie has none of it, the gore is minimal as are the zombies themselves. As a fan of Zombie movies i got up at the end with a sick feeling in my gut...""is this what zombie movies have become? A lack of gore, story, and number of zombies""....i said to my friends as we left the theater. This movie is not a zombie movie, its an action movie rip off that just so happens to contain a side note of zombies.

"Coming off the turkey that was ""Alien Vs. Predator"", Paul W.S. Anderson swings and misses again with another script full of awful dialouge and cardboard characters. Anderson hands over the directing honors to Alexander Witt on this one but it doesn't make too much of a difference. Witt soaks the film in stylized violence and over-produced CGI but unfortunately, such items as ""substance"" and ""content"" were thrown on the back-burner, this time around.

Starting where the original ""Resident"" left off, ""Apocalypse"" has Milla Jovovich's Alice trapped in a zombie plague that has engulfed the fictional Racoon City. Along the way she meets up with female rogue cop Jill Valentine, her partner, and a news reporter. Of course, a representitive of the evil Umbrella Corp. is behind it all. To make matters worse, he throws a genetically-enchanced creature called ""Nemesis"" into the mix. If the cartoonish super-villian subplot about a corporate honcho who fiendishly sacrifices innocent people for the sake of a major advancement in weaponry has ever see more played out and cheesy than it is here, I have yet to see it.

While ""Apocalypse"" plays out like a mix of ""Charlie's Angels"" and the ""Dawn Of The Dead"" remake, it certainly doesn't stop there. It kindly borrows its plot twists and even lifts dialouge from other films as well. While the original film was a promising video game adaption, this sequel is a series of pretty pictures wrapped up in a meaningless story. For all of its influences, you'd think at the very least that ""Apocalypse"" would make for a decent homage. Sadly, that isn't the case. The treatment of the zombie mytholgy is flimsy and the story feels like it would be better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon series adaption of the movie then a sequel. For all of its faults, if you're looking for a big mindless celebration of action and violence with cheesy dialouge and little of anything else, this could be your cup of tea.",1.0

He had a script ready to go, and then Anderson walked in and offered to do it for less money, and that was that. The same thing can be said about Aliens vs. Preditor. Dream projects like AVP and RE will never be safe so long as Paul Anderson is making movies.

If you want the real Resident Evil expirience, I suggest you play the remake of the first game on Gamecube. If you desire a non-interactive adaptation of the games, read the books. If you must see just how badly Anderson botched up the RE mythology, then by all means see the movies. But be forwarned, they suck.

"ouch.

i really love zombie movies, and was a huge fan of the first resident evil.  this one, i had such high hopes for.  the zombies are loose, the city is going to hell, and it should be a lot of fun and exciting and gory, right?

nope.

i won't give away a lot of details, but let's just say it felt completely thrown together, the editing was incredibly sloppy, the zombies were hardly scary and they spent too much time featuring the big monsters.

and can we talk about the use of the ""crappy strobe-y videocamera effect""?  seriously, i'm wondering if the person that invented that filter had stock in this film, as they used it ALL OVER THE PLACE, and it made the zombies look cheesier than the freaking THRILLER video.

The story i thought was even better than the first resident evil. And the ending blew me away. I cant wait for the next one.

"Where to begin, where to begin.  First, Jeanette had three older brothers and a little sister.  Jeanette's sister, Catherine, died giving birth to a child, not as depicted in this film.

Jeanette repeatedly tried to save English lives.

The story of Jeanette (""Little Joan""), a 5'2"" teenager who led the armies of France inspired by Voices and was burned at the stake would make a marvelous movie or musical.  Whether she was a saint or delusional, the movie could balance the depiction and let the viewer decide.

But what this movie does not capture and what needs to be captured is the pathos of this small, teenage girl abandoned by her country, surrounded by enemies, fighting for her life.

"Oh man, I don't even know where to start with this review.
First of, I should say, that Resident Evil is another botched attempt by a movie company (Screen Gems) to bring
another game title to the bring screen.
All movies based on game titles have sucked :Final Fantasy,
Mortal Kombat are just 2 examples.  In fact, the same idiotic director who made those terrible  Mortal Kombat movies directed this piece of junk!!!
Once I knew that, I knew the movie was going to suck.
I just didn't how much it would suck, until I saw it.
After seeing it, I have to say that Capcom did  probably the most stupidest thing they could have done, by giving the rights for this movie to be made.
Furthermore, Capcom, obviously didn't care,  how the director was going to follow the game, because if they had, they would have seen that the film does  horrible injustice to the game.
It does not follow up the story and plot to the games.
In fact, none of the characters from the game:  Chris Redfield, Claire Redfill, Jill, or Leon, the policeman are in the film.
To understand why Resident Evil is a pitiful attempt
to bring the game to the screen, you have to know the
story in Resident Evil games.
An evil corporation called Umbrella, has unwilligenly
or willingly (depending on who you ask) has unleashed
a virus called the ""T virus"".  The T virus has the effect, of killing people and then  making them zombies.
Even more scary is the fact, that the Umbrella knows
about the situation but is covering it up. Only a  handful of corrupt politicians and Umbrella  personnel know about the virus.  In the first RE game, a team of special police  officers, trace the roots of the virus to a mansion,  harboring all sorts of monsters.  In fact, ""the scene of the mansion"" is in the movie,  but that's one of a few similiarities  between the game and the movie.  Eventually the last survivors of the mansion Chris  Redfield, Jill Valentine escape only to be separated . (...)
Birkin is himself infected, by a more powerful virus,
and is mutated to another horrible beast.  Eventually all the survivors escape, and thus  stop the Umbrella corporation from doing more damage  to Racoon City.
That's basically the Re games.  Sounds cool,doesn't it?
The Crappy, Sucky Movie version of Resident Evil
The movie starts out in the Umbrella Corporation.
Everthing is calm and cool, until an employee drops a
chemical container containing the T virus into the
floor.  Then all hell breaks loose, because it seems that
Umbrella's computer known as the Red Queen, has isolated and
captured all of Umbrella's employees and plans to kill them.
In fact, some of the death scene in Re are actually
pretty good, but most of them are not.  So eventually most of the people in Umbrella die, due  to this supercomputer. LOL.
This is garbage that is made up. In the Re games,
there is no ""Red Queen"" that is causing the killing in
Racoon City, and in Umbrella. The killing is brought
upon by the heads of Umbrella, and corrupt politicians, who have knowingly released the virus and are trying to cover
it up.  Instead, we get Milla Jolladovich, playing some drugged out,security officer named Alice Prospero.
Then comes the ridiculous plot of the movie, which is that
most of the damage inflicted on the personnel of Umbrella,
is by a computer called ""The Red Queen"" which
unleashes a set of death traps, to anyone infected with
the ""T virus"".
Practically the only part of the game that the movie
stays true to is in fact that Umbrella has created a virus called the ""T virus"" which it plans to use for germ warfare.
However, that's how close you'll come to similiarities once again between the game and the movie.
Eventually Ms. Prospero is rescued, (technically she
is put in the custody) of a group of special police cops ,
to infiltrate Umbrella and find out what the hell is going on.
Adding more confusion (and laughter) to the situation
is that Ms. Prospero has amnesia and doesn't  understand her connection to Umbrella.  Well it's revealed that Ms. Prospero was working with someone in Umbrella, to expose to the media the virus  that Umbrella was creating.
However, that person died, along with the evidence that
Umbrella is responsible for the chaos in Racoon City and
Umbrella.
Eventually these bumbling cops eventually meet a holographic
image of the Red Queen who says ""I've been a very bad girl"".
LOL. Yeah and I would have added ""I've been a bad actress
to be in this film too"".
Eventually the remaining cops become aware of the zombies and other monsters and try to escape from Umbrella headquarters....
Besides the terrible acting, script and story in Resident Evil, there is also a lack of creatures from the games.
The zombies , zombie dogs, and lickers are in R.E. but
here is a whole of creatures and monsters not in the movie:

"I was looking forward to getting the chance to watch this movie, after the success of the Resident Evil Video game. But unfortunately, this movie is nothing like the game. The characters aren't the same, and the actual story is different. Sure, it is good to have a different story, you don't want to copy everything from the game, but i think the overall idea of the movie, should be based around the game, because thats what everyone is familiar with. But no, it is completely different, and thats its biggest downfall.
 The characters of the movie aren't properly introduced. There is no background to them, so you don't care if they live or die. It seems that they were more focussed on getting to the gore instead of building up the movie.
 The zombies were my biggest problem. They didn't look scary at all. Half of them didn't even look dead. Looked more human then some of the people i see around in the streets these days.
  Overall a missed opportunity. I give the movie 1 star because Milla Jovovich has a nice body :P",1.0
"Where to start, where to start. I know... the game. Resi Evil the game was, and still is, one of the greats. It had everything you could've hoped for. Zombies, action, scaryness, and a conspiracy/mystery. The sequels continued the story, and once again great. They where like movies themselves. Now, lets look at the movie on its own before we compare it to the original game (resident Evil 1 - psone). The casting of Milla Jovovich, although she can't act, wasn't bad. It was the others who where terrible. Michelle Rodriguez... OH MY GOD, when she tried to act tough, i squirmed. The Story... oh yeah, there is no story. The zombies... people with a bit of grey make up and contacts (although the dogs where good). Action... Yawn. Scary level 1-10 (10 highest) -4. Sory to sound sarcastic, but it stunk. Now the comparison. With the game, you had a great story with real suprising twists. You had real terror, and great music to go with it. Even the characters where top (although the voice acting is the only bad point on this game). It was gritty, it never had mad sci fi gizmos... it was a true horror game with true horror survival game play and could've been easily converted in to a film. But no, Paul Anderson (One of the worst directors ever) some how gets the job to turn this great game in to a film. Instead of keeping to the story, he throws out all the work done by the guys at Capcom and uses the name to tell his own so-called story. he throws out the characters of resi evil and brings his own in. Who ever says this is a kick ass movie deserves to have there ass's kicked. I've heard this be called a prequel. If its a prequel, where's Albert Wesker. Bye this film at your own preil. Regarding the sequel, Apocalypse, i've seen stills of Milla and the new character, Jill Valentine (thats right) and four words come to mind, looks cheap and tacky. Don't let the trailer fool you. Kick ass film... yeah right... idiots. If the review sounds rough, sorry. Very angry man. Paul Anderson has destroyed any chance of a proper Game Adaptation with Resi Evil, With Chris Redfield the main guy, and Albert Wesker the arch nemeisis and the betrayer. I Hope the studios see sense and don't make a 3rd resi film, and leave it a few years for a proper director to come in and revive the franchise in the proper way.",1.0
"I really don't like writing negative reviews.  I like to write about things I enjoy, it makes the process of writing reviews much more enjoyable.  But every now and again something so rotten comes along that I've gotta say something.  This is the case with Resident Evil.  Hollywood seems to be getting into a zombie phase these days.  This is scary coz Hollywood knows about as much about making a good zombie flick as I know about nuclear fusion.  History has shown us that all great zombie flicks have been made outside the system.  There are many reasons I hate this film, but here's the top two:  1) I'm a fan of George Romero, and 2) I'm a fan of the video game series.  Resident Evil is a game based on the works of George Romero, yet Romero wasn't allowed to do this film.  Just like a previous reviewer, I have also read some of Romero's original script for Resident Evil.  If he made it, it would have been superb.  Why wasn't it chosen?  Probably coz it was intelligent, it actually stuck very close to the story, it would have been about two hours long, and it would have been too gory for an R rating.  In other words-for people who like good horror films and not cruddy rock video type films.  Instead the studios figured that they'd go with Paul Anderson since he directed another lame movie version of a video game.  This film actually has a decent opening sequence, but falls flat on it's face afterwards.  Anderson decided to take it upon himself to change the story, and not for the better either.  Now everthing is all high tech and computerized.  Part of the scariness of the game was it's simplicity.  It's down and dirty approach to survival.  We have yet another clone of 2001's HAL in the form of a computer security system called the Red Queen(oooooh, scary).  Everything's a cliche in this film, no surprises.  The soundtrack is dated and annoying.  It's full of that lame Matrix slo-mo junk we've seen a million times before, as well as those lame VanDamme-esque slo-mo kicks and punches.  The ""Licker"" is pitiful.  I've seen scarier creatures in Fraggle Rock.  The cast is all pretty people, not real looking people.  All of the scientists in the beginning are hot women!  Yeah, right.  There's a scene stolen from the movie, ""Cube"".  There's basically no gore.  Sorry to sound so shallow, but the sad fact is that gore is required for a zombie film.  The only positive I can think of is the zombie dogs which looked good.  But that's the only good I could find out of an hour and forty minutes.  I feel so sorry for Romero.  He's really been getting the green weenie lately.  First, he's screwed out of Resident Evil, then some no-talent hack by the name of Zack Snyder remakes Dawn Of The Dead!  And this is Romero's genre!  He made this genre, now they're treating him like a doormat.  Accept no imitations and make it a Romero night!",1.0

"This director really has only one good movie - ""Event Horizon"" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help ""Aliens Vs Predator"" with the way things are shaping up.
This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on...
When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy.

"This movie is dreadful, just dreadful.

From the opening shot of the map, crawling with animated blood, to the contemporary vulgarisms,(""Now, that's what I call a miracle!"") director Luc Bresson shows us the sensibility of a circus owner in his telling of the rural French genius who helped re-unite France only to be literally sold-out to a powerful man with a grudge, a man who used her claims of hearing the voice of God against her so that he might have her killed in a most torturous way.
Bresson gets utterly wacky performances from a cadre of actors (Malkovich, Dunaway, Hoffman, Karyo, Jones... ) that looks impressive on the page, but winds up just making the viewer (well, me) just... embarrassed for all involved. Jeanne/Joan acts equally unconvincingly and affectedly, as if starring in a high-school production of ""Girl, Interrupted.""
Her take-your-meds, sputtering announcements do not portray her as a vessel of the devine as much as a
a kid trying to get out of doing a book report. The scenes of rape, post-mortem and of an accusing Jesus are not weird or trippy.

"The director of Resident evil, Mr Paul Anderson is a huge dissapointment to CAPCOM, the grey coloured playstation console and not forgeting the Resident evil fans world wide.
Now let me explain, why R.E is a dissapointment.
HISTORY OF THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT
The basic reasons are Paul anderson preffered writing his own script by adding additions in the movie which never exsisted in the game itself.
Before Paul anderson wasted his ink and paper on writing his script. There was a director of the name George. A.romeo.
He is the genious behind the zombie movies such as Day of the dead. His R.E script wasn't approved because he wrote the names of the real characters in his script. This is when Anderson was transferred and decided to change the whole script by using everything in his little imagination.
NO ORIGINAL CHARACTERS AND STORY
So how can this movie be a success, if the director cant even create the original characters of the game and get the authentic storyline. Not one original character is present in the movie, which is a huge dissapointment to the fans and CAPCOM's unappreciated efforts of creating the brilliant characters.
NO HORROR
The other major dissapointment is that the zombies and dogs looked pathetic, which i found more real terror in the 32bit game itself.
The movie should be aimed at children who enjoy watching goosebumps instead of being aimed at ages above 15.
SPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY
I would recomend you R.E fans or just horror lovers to think twice before buying this movie. If you are a R.E fan you are better off buying the resident evil comics, because the story and characters are related to the game. If you are a zombie horror fan, i recomend you to buy movies directed by George. A.romero and Fulci, thats the real stuff to get full satisfaction from your hard working money.

"This version of Joan of Arc was a complete and utter disgrace. The apparent point of this movie is to depict Joan as completely insane and no real saint.  So insane, in fact, that this character of Joan was completely unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  None of the other characters in the film have even a smidgen of respect for her.  The closest thing to respect would be amusement to the fruits of insanity to have one's way.  One goes away with the feeling that not a single worthwhile human value was in place.  A story of a traumatized and visibly very insane woman inducted by the elite of the time as a useful fool and then completely discarded in her time of need after literally saving France and restoring the crown.  To add insult to injury, Jesus was depicted as demonic and hideous with bulging eyes, looking like he was in drag, covered in blood, and frightful. A brutal murder-rape was ""added"" to the story to make it known that Joan was not speaking to saints or doing God's work but a severely traumatized, very immediately visibly mentally ill person who ultimately chose her own death to appease her delusions.

"I love the Resident Evil video games. I have been a fan since the first one was released in 1996. I love the storyline, the erie soundtrack, the creepy sound effects and of course, blowing the heads off of the walking dead. When I heard they were making a film based on it with George Romero directing, I went unconscious. I was so excited and couldn't wait to see it. Then, Mr. Romero was dropped from the project and it was given to the biggest hack in Hollywood history...Paul W.S. Anderson. Besides the competent Mortal Kombat, he has yet to make a film worthy of a one week run at a dollar house. This movie was shameful from beginning to end. Complete with faux-Matrix action, cookie-cutter acting, void of any horror or suspence and featuring CG that must have been made on a Tandy PC from 1988. He even trashed the storyline. There was no Red Queen nonsense in any of the games, and certainly no child hologram telling everyone they are going to die. And don't give me the excuse of it being campy on purpose. This movie failed on every possible level, including being one of those bad movies that never takes itself seriously and becoming a midnite cable classic. Anyone who likes this movie needs to see a George Romero film immediately. He is the one who started the whole zombie genre and it still the best at it. Once you see any of those films, you'll forgot about this one and realize how much better this could have been. Mr. Anderson is also helming the Alien Vs. Predator movie, due out Summer 2004. This movie has been in the works as long as the recent Freddy Vs Jason film. You'd be better off playing the 16 bit Sega game than being subjected to his desecration of it as a film. He is sure proof that talent and vision are traits not needed for a director's job in Hollywood.",1.0
"I don't know about the video game but I don't have to know about it and to be a bright one to see that the conceptors of the game were inspired by George Romero's cinema.
Take Romero's excellent movie, ""Day of the Dead"" (the third and last film in his zombi trilogy), add to it a big budget, plenty of computers and special effects and a couple of female stars, in order to grab the required audience, and you get that kind of predigested movie, that you forget as soon as you see it. The story is practically the same: a handful of characters trapped by a bunch of zombies in a closed, underground place, and who quickly slander each other for survival. ""Resident Evil"" is unfortunately typical of today's American action cinema: it's empty, noisy and brainless, in one word, standard. More than the story, totally trivial today - the virus theme has been told a hundred times, and in better, especially in ""Twelve Monkeys"" and in Richard Matheson's founder novel, ""I am Legend"" -, the biggest default of this film is the total lack of gore scenes, which is paradoxical for a zombie movie and the symptom of a politically correct U.S. cinema. Milla Jovovich is not very comfortable, the music, uselessly hard, is deafening and brings bad headache (but this is the fashion today), the beginning is totally taken from Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" and the ending, from John Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"".
This disastrous movie (but what could you expect from the director of pitiful ""Mortal Kombat"", also based upon a video game?) is a good proof that money and technology don't always do good to cinema.
A last point: it's George Romero himself who was first supposed to direct the movie. But he was put away after he brought a script we may suppose as 'gore' - and good - as his previous zombi works... Shame on the deciders! And shame on the finally chosen director! Your movie is a waste!",1.0
"My daughter was assigned this particular version by her professor, so I watched it, increasingly reluctantly.  The movie was badly made, revolving around the bizarre behavior of an apparently lunatic Joan, played by the director's wife. Incredibly cheesy acting, which is surprising, given the many quality actors and actresses who appear in the movie.

However, the main problem with the movie is the thrust of Besson's portrayal of Joan, which goes against the copious first-hand sworn testimony of her neighbors, friends, soldiers, confessors, and acquaintances at Joan's rehabilitation trial after her death. She was known by all to be a sober, steady, stable individual of great self-possession, who inspired great respect, admiration, and deference by all, especially the rough, no-nonsense soldiers who followed her.  Thus, soldiers sent to bring her to the King, intending to throw the peasant girl into a ditch, were won over on the way back to the king with their distrust turned to great respect. And too many other accounts like this to mention here. She won love and admiration by something other than magic tricks--by her character, demeanor, strength, and goodness. That's in the historical record.

The movie never makes it clear why anyone would have wanted to follow its portrayal of Joan, which inspires revulsion rather than love and admiration. The depiction of Joan's ""Voices"" is especially pejorative and is contradicted by Joan's own recorded words at Poitiers when examined by King Charles' representatives, at the trial of condemnation at Rouen, and the testimony of many witnesses at the rehabilitation trial.  That she was the victim of demented visions is not born out by the actual record. This isn't to claim that what she said is true; simply that the content of what she says she saw and heard are nothing like Besson's fabrications.

Many different interpretations of who Joan of Arc was are possible. But to be remotely honest, they have to respect the basic facts that are right there in the historical record, available to anyone with a minimal effort. Besson did a hatchet job on Joan of Arc, and not a very skilled one at that.  I don't recommend this movie as deserving even casual attention.",1.0
"I was so upset after watching this film, I had to write a review somewhere to caution people not to watch it.  The old silent version is the best I've ever seen of St. Joan, and the other '90s version with Leelee Sobieski did a much better job of showing St. Joan's human struggles as a young girl responding to the call of the divine, but used by and eventually abandoned by earthly powers.
Okay, here are my issues with this depiction of the saint's life:

1) The rape scene she witnessed with her sister.  This appears nowhere in the stories of her life.  Yes, we have very little hard facts to go by, but this fabrication made it look like Joan was motivated by revenge for her sister's murder and rape, rather than a holy calling.  The rest of the film for the most part supports this view (Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of her ""Conscience,"" for instance).
2) The scenes where, after her sister's funeral, Joan refuses to make the sign of the cross, and then removes a chalice of wine from the church's tabernacle, makes the motions of consecrating it, and then pours it down her throat after shouting ""I want to be with you NOW!""  There are two ways you could understand this behavior:  From a secular perspective, she totally lost grasp of reality after her sister's death.  From a faith perspective, this is complete heresy, not to mention silly misrepresentation of Catholic communion.  There would never have been a chalice of precious blood in the tabernacle (only the Eucharist, the hosts that have been consecrated at mass).  If someone ever performed any behavior like this, they would never be canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church.  Period.
3) The trippy scenes of her visions, where she encounters a slightly creepy Christ figure, and not St. Catherine, St. Margaret, and St. Michael the Archangel.  I don't even know where to start with Dustin Hoffman's character.  When I first saw him, I thought he was depicting Satan tormenting her in prison (his behavior certainly seemed more in-line with this analysis, although the credits list him as her ""Conscience"").  Then at the end, he hears her confession and then absolves her of her sin!  We know St. Joan was confessed (by an actual human priest) and received the Eucharist, because we have the priest's testimony.  Another inaccuracy:  They show her finding her sword in a field, and her ""Conscience"" has her consider all the possible ways that what she interpreted as a sign from God could actually have been just random chance.  While it is good to be cautious with interpreting signs, and should be discerned under the guidance of a trusted spiritual director, it is one of the basic elements of her biography that she found her sword in a chapel (I believe it was under a statue of St. Catherine).
5)Her death scene, where she is screaming as she burns at the stake, while some random person in the crowd waves a cross about, is very disturbing.  Yes the reality of someone being burned to death at the stake is pretty unnerving, but there seems to be something almost mocking about the cross, and her behavior looks more like despair than holy resignation (I know, I could never muster holy resignation while being burned... which is why I'm not a saint).  In her biography, St. Joan asked that someone lift up the cross that she might see it as she died, and her last word as she burned was ""Jesus.""

There were a few good moments in this movie.  I like that they show her repeatedly insisting that the army sends messages asking for the surrender of the English.  I like the scene where she rides across the field of battle to do this, prays for an end to bloodshed, and then the English turn away without fighting.  I like how they depicted her discovering the Dauphin in disguise.  But for the most part they made her seem like a raving lunatic.  It was a patronizing film told like the perspective of someone who does not believe in miracles, taking what I will admit is one of the more bizarre and mystifying saints' lives, and looking down on the ignorant peasant girl with a bit of spirit who got a little too much religion which made her an easy pawn for the political powers of her day.  Read the transcripts from her trial and you see a clever and faith-filled woman who is clearly grounded in reality.  This film is a gross oversimplification to the point of obfuscation of the real story of an incredible saint.",1.0
"With certainty, others may have more egregious nominees than this one; however, this is perhaps my least favorite film ever.  Which is not to say it is the least historically accurate, but it would win my vote for that distinction as well.

Jeanne d'Arc is my patron, and I watched the film in the hopes that it would provide insights that cannot be depicted in words alone.  What we do know of her is that at the very least she was humble, not only in origin but in practice.  She also only spoke when pressed to do so.  Having met understated practitioners of humility, none of them scream like a lunatic, which is exactly what Jeanne does in the movie for the entirety.  The thought that a raving lunatic would sway nobility from a local baron to the dauphin that would become Charles VII is laughable.

I really cannot provide further detail because every scene entices such cringing from the woeful depiction that I consider having watched it an act of self mortification on my part.

"Save your time and money - avoid this movie.
I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full  of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in ""her voices.""
Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.
I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.
Get the 1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.

"The Messenger: The Story of Joan Of Arc :

I was browsing through my netflix and see this movie and saw 2 stars-2 1/2 stars when I said you know I should give it a try, Dustin Hoffman is in it and it's about Joan Of Arc,I am Catholic and I like movies like that. So I see the movie and it is looking good except the graphic parts and half-way It starts to sink that what the director Luc Besson intended is his biased view of events. I then google and it confirmed my suspicions, In LEFTIST Rag ""Le Monde"" He is as quoted as saying Joan Of Arc Should have followed the commandments if she is a true Christian ,Thou Shalt Not Kill""and quote. Although he fails to realize it's Thou Shalt not Commit Murder. In fact there is such a thing as a Just War and Self Defense is covered as well. Murder is a different story,So you get another Liberal Trying to rewrite history and make Joan Of Arc look crazy. The French Adore Joan Of Arc and for Good Reason,she wasn't crazy. As for the Acting, I thought John Malkovich was great, and The Battle Scenes are good even if they are not ACCURATE by a longshot,and certainly you see why The English and French hate each other(The English Protestant wackjobs who would later rather Follow Henry and his Hideous Girl and Become Anglican-a Mutated Form of Catholicism),this movie is entertainment not historical,I will look elsewhere for A Joan Of Arc movie perhaps it will not be such a Special Effects Bonaza but I want to see a less biased movie.",1.0
"Where to start with what is wrong...The costumes and weapons are not the correct period, Jesus has fair skin and blue eyes. Joan has black hair not blond, the accents are all over Europe and not correct for the English or French except the few times a real Frenchmen is cast, and because of research done by French historians such as Roger Caratini, Its clear today that Joan's influce in battle was less leading the charge and more along for the ride.

Lets not talk about the acting, but rather the over acting. I wouldn't go after every actor but Mila J goes from wimpering idiot straight to wild eyed loon at the drop of a hat.

The real Joan of Arc was zealot that heard voices yet was charismatic enough to rally the French at a critical time and was sold out to the English when her usefulness to crazy ratio dipped too low. This movie portrays her as a raving loon that got what was coming to her.",1.0
"I have had an interest in the story about Joan of Arc ever since I learned about her in 6th grade history, so when I found out they made a movie about her, I wanted to see it. Sadly the movie is highly inaccurate to the story about the young French warrior maiden who saved her country. They start off with her childhood (might I add she was 13 when she first heard her voices, not 7 or 8 like the movie seems to think) where she watches the murder and rape of her sister. Joan did have a sister, a younger sister not one who was between the ages 16-18. While I think that Milla Jovovich is a tallented actress she wasn't right for the role in this movie, she made Joan of Arc seem like a lunatic. To make things worse her voices seem very satanic. If you want my advice avoid this movie and watch the Joan of Arc movie with Leelee Sobieski, it is very intertaining and has a more realistic view of Joan.",1.0

"I agree with most reviews of ""The Messenger: the Story of Joan of Arc."" While Mila Jovich, or however you spell her last name, is an AWESOME actress, (she was in ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" and all three ""Resident Evil"" movies) I'm sure that this portrayal of Joan is very inaccurate. In this movie she is portrayed as a screaming, annoying and lunatic b****!! What the hell was the director thinking? He or she clearly did NOT do thier homework. I have seen the 1999 miniseries of ""Joan of Arc"" starring the beuatiful young Hollywood actress Leele Sobieski, (Deep Impact, The Glass House.) Sobieski portrays Joan as an innocent but brave nineteen-year-old who fought for the freedom of France, and who sought to have the French King crowned. Although some argue that the miniseries is not entierly accurate, (but than again what movie now-a-days is?) still the ""Joan of Arc"" film depicts the herione the way the world remembers her. The miniseries is truely powerful, gripping and dramatic. It's sad that the big budget version of Joan in ""The Messenger"" is so twisted beyond any historical accuracy. In this film you don't even get the impression that Joan really was holy to the point of hearing the voices of saints calling out to her; rather Joan is simply crazy and dillusional beyond anyone's comprehension. It seems as if the director and producers intentionally portrayed Joan as a mad woman with a disperate need for making herself known to the world. But yet, as the director of the miniseries ""Joan of Arc"" stated during his research, even in books and in that movie Joan was portrayed as a sweet, loving and giving character who's strong faith in God led her to her ultimate demise; for SHE choose to go into the flame, rather than she was forced to burn at the stake. And I believe that ""Joan of Arc"" is as accurate as any film could possibly get about the ""the flower of France.""",1.0
"This movie is historically inaccurate in so many ways. I wouldn't even give it one star unless Amazon made that little a requirement of the rating process. Not only does Joan not have a sister (who is VERY brually murdered in this film), but the prince is far too old.

They also make her look like an insane heretic who is quite possibly in league with the Devil.  Then, they have her kill in this film.  According to legend, she led an army, but never took a life.  She was a standard bearer, but not a soldier.

Historically innacurate, spiritually unfaithful, this film stinks.  It is downright heretical, portraying our beloved Jeanne as having made a pact with the devil.  She is shown as a proud, haughty girl at odds with her Church.  What a bunch of bull.  The ONLY two bits of this film I appreciated were the attention given to her ring (given her by her brother), as well as the scene when she brings a child back to life (I am unaware of any other films on her that portray this true story).

"An ignorant review wrote that this movie was the truth and based on historical fact. This was an ignorant judgement and one that's being made by anyone who has anything against religion. Nothing on this film was based on fact. Joan's sister was not raped. A sword didn't appear out of nowhere. Joan didn't have some weird conscience friend questioning her. And in reality, Joan was articulate and compelling.

The truth about Joan of Arc is not found in this film or in Psychology Today. ITS FOUND IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS, THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPTS.

And while Joan was human and not a plaster saint, many testified at her trial about her compassion, her courage and her sincere faith.

To quote from Ron Maxwell's review:

""She came to be a liberator at the head of armies because she earned their trust, because she was self-less, she was viscerally connected with her people, she was authentic, she was faithful and she was loving -- immensely loving. That is partly an understanding of her power -- the power to rally soldiers, inspire the common people, win over princes and prelates, and the power to endure in our hearts over the centuries. All else is mystery. The inability to distinguish between what is historical and what is mysterious, compounded by the inadequacy in rigorously pursuing either choice, is the failure of this motion picture.""

"(...)
The story of Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d'Arc as they call her in France) is well known just about everywhere. Joan is a poor peasant living in a small village in France during the Hundred Years War with England. She begins seeing heavenly visions that tell her she is God's messenger to rid her country of the bloody English. Somehow she convinces Charles, the Dauphin with visions of being king, to give her an army to storm Orleans. Using unconventional methods she leads her army to victory. The Dauphin is crowned king and mostly forgets about Joan. She leads an unsuccessful siege on Paris is given over to the English, tried and burned at the stake, several hundred years later she is sainted by the Catholic church. The Messenger covers most of this relatively faithfully, and beautifully.

Luc Besson is a talented director filming such classics as Le Femme Nikita and The Professional. His talent is presented here in his ability to create interesting and beautiful shots, but is lost in creating a cohesive story. He doesn't seem to know what to do with the story about the young saint. In parts it seems earnest in it's recreation of this revolutionary with heavenly visions, but then it sinks into near parody of itself and in the ends sinks towards a reinventing of the events themselves asking Joan herself whether or not her visions were real or mere psychosis.

Milla Jovovich is a pretty face who has mostly been in forgettable, silly comedies and the Resident Evil franchise which might as well be considered a silly comedy for all its worth. Here, she has two modes of acting, a strange amphetamine delivery of her lines as if she couldn't spit them out fast enough, or a snarled scream as if acting was merely being the loudest person on the set. It is not a nuanced performance. For the entirety of the film she seems completely out of place.

The battle or Orleans is tame at best. There are virtually no scenes of real ambitious spectacle. We are given nothing to inform us of her revolutionary forms of combat. Instead her method seems to be screaming a lot and jumping a horse over the enemies fence. Later the storming of Paris is so humorous it is sad. Joan screams and screams that she needs back up while a few soldiers randomly knock on what must be the Paris gates. These soldiers are so bewildered a pathetic looking they seem more out of a Monty Python sketch than a serious film about war.

Beyond the visual elements the only saving grace is Dustin Hoffman's performance as the Grand Inquisitor or Conscience. It is a fine performance from a fine actor, but it is a peculiar character. He spends his time questioning Joan's own sanity. Could her visions in fact be some form of psychosis or fantasy? Could crucial moments in her life like finding a sword in a field in fact be simple coincidence? Good questions in the history of the real Joan of Arc, but they seem out of place here. Nowhere in the film are we led to believe Joan is nothing but the real thing. Why bring these questions into play during its climactic ending. The film would have worked much better believing whole heartedly in Joan's purpose and vision. Or questioning her visions from the beginning, a revisioning of the myth could be very interesting. Instead it kicks its legs out from under itself by bringing her into question so late in the film.

What we get in this portrayal of Joan of Arc is some pretty visuals and a find performance from Dustin Hoffman. Try renting one of Luc Besson's earlier films and pick up anything from Hoffman's hey day in the 70's, they will be worth your dollar and your time far more than anything thing to be found here.

"This unsightly contribution in Milla Jojovich's career proves quite well that, aside from looking breathless, panting and screaming, the actress cannot tackle a serious acting challenge.
A true mockery of Joan of Arc, this film conspires to make the Poucelle D'Orleans seem like a deranged woman incapable of controlling an army-- whereas the historical Joan of Arc showed an eerie capacity for military manoeuvres, whose fame became to widespread that entire cities surrendered at the mention of Joan of Arc at their gates.
Through her (dictated) letters (for she was presumably illiterate), and her recorded answers to the Inquistion, we have come to know that Joan of Arc, born in Domremy, was an unusually lucid 16-year-old (she was burned at the stake at the age of 19) with a gift for words (which may give credibility that she was actually related to the Dauphin through the bloodline of Anne the Adultress and thus must have received some degree of education), as well as sharing the distinction of being the middle age's most distinguished transvestite (sharing the same historical period as the Basque transvestite and noblewoman Catalina de Erauzo, the Lieutenant Nun).
Milla Jojovich's portrayal of Joan of Arc is insulting to anyone that has ever studied this remarkable character, giving us instead a histrionic and half-mad woman who cannot keep her composture for a second and who apparently has the resolution of a twig, fueled into battle by unknown fervors that vanish as soon as the battle scene is over. Joan of Arc was a hard and somewhat fanatical Christian, but in no way was she the blithering idiot that Jojovich's acting makes her out to be. There is also a scene of ""self-examination"" during Joan's captivity with the Burgundians that serves little point other than to stress the idea that Joan is absolutely nuts. Indeed, all the Damsel of Orleans does through half the movie is to claw and hyperventilate... truly a shameful performance, and abysmal script-writing.

The settings and costumes are decent, but that`s all there is to find here.
Director Luc Besson also made the useless ""The Fifth Element"", and the style-over-substance perspective of that movie is present here, too.

"You would be hard pressed to find someone more fanatic about zombie movies than myself, but there is a limit. That limit is called ""Resident Evil"". Awful acting, horrible writing, meaningless techno music and a poor storyline make up the hellish experience of sitting through this film. Apparently the filmmakers, the crew, and the writers never picked up a controller and actually played the game. The film is NOTHING like any of the Resident Evil games. Like most recent films, Resident Evil was made to draw in a younger audience, or any audience that would pay for that matter, not necessarily to make a ""good"" film. A supermodel was hired to play the leading role, rather than a professional actress; her acting is awful. This movie symbolized to me, everything that a zombie movie shouldn't be - Big budget, ""modern"" (techno music, computer graphics, unrealistic kung fu performed by a person that hasn't ever even taken a class in any form of kung fu, etc.).

"Not only is Joan of Arc presented as a nut in this film, she's clearly tripping on speed: Jumping out of her skin, screaming her head off and delivering banal lines with halting, eye-bugging intensity.
It's hard to believe that even the most religiously medieval French soldier would give this loon the time of day, let alone follow her into battle.
Mon Dieu! Run awaaaaaayy. . .
But I'll say this for the director, he's consistent. It's fast paced all the way through, what with boulders a la 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom ' getting hurled at the troops along with other JamesBondian gizmos making for cool technogore.
 Which, alongside Joan's motivation in this script ( Her sister's been raped by the posse of --er I mean the Brits) turns it all into an enjoyable comic book Western revengefest. It's 'The Quick and the Dead' minus gunslingers, set in 1429. Plus the scenes of her schizoid 'visions' are gorgeously photographed.
But as far as the real Joan of Arc, the only major historical figure whose life and thought has come down to us through sworn court testimony---Oh well, in the first place she's had writers of genius like Shaw and Twain to  balance this dramatization, and in the second place, as long as we're making films about protagonists who hear voices, wild battle scenes and trials for heresy it could have been much worse.

"I admit to seeing the made-for-television version of Joan of Arc before viewing this version. If it makes a difference, I also read Mark Twain's ""Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc"" that previous weekend, regardless of my dislike of Twain's writing style. I admit to thinking of this logical, honest, and energetic historical figure as one of the most fascinating in history. So, after viewing the scewed version called ""The Messenger"" I am perhaps too biased to speak.
  The Joan portrayed in ""The Messanger"" comes off as tempermental, insecure, and ultimately insane. This is not the Joan that is recorded in history as a kind and forgiving peasant who touched the hearts of thousands by loving them, and who never spoke ill of anyone. This is not the Joan that led fifty intelligent judges in circles of words by answering calmly, consistently, and logically all answers that were intended to lead her to the stake. This is not the Joan who claimed to hear the voices of saints who informed her of events long before they happen. No, this ""messenger"", in the midst of a cinematic mess, is a horrifying psychotic who doesnot possess the conviction that would make an army wake up let alone fight an imposible war.
  I did not like this movie. I leave you to make your own opinion, but consider that Joan of Arc was a seventeen-year-old peasant who claimed to hear heavenly voices, created a vast army and battle tactics that won back much of France, and was burned at the stake as a heretic before being declared a Saint. There are many interptretations of this historical figure, and although I am perhaps biased by my previous exposures, I don't feel that ""the messenger"" should be one of them.",1.0

The original Residant Evil had a perfect plot for a horror movie.

"I decided to intentionally not watch this movie on the big screen, after hearing reviews from several people. I then wasn't sure if I wanted see the movie at all, but I broke down and rented it anyway, as I am a big fan of Joan of Arc.
From the moment I read about her sister's rape on the cover, I knew I'd have a difficult time watching this movie, since that event never happened.  After watching the whole thing, I found that my initial impressions were correct.  This movie was just a movie, _not_ a historical documentary, which is something to definitely keep in mind.  It would've been nice if Besson had referenced the trial transcripts for a better idea of how Joan actually lived, but alas.
I (generously) give a rating of one star, only because this work has spread a little more awareness of the life and death of Joan of Arc.  I would also give this movie two enthusiastic thumbs down, except for the battle scenes, and Besson didn't even get all of those right, so a somewhat shaky one thumb up for the battle scenes. The reason for this rating is quite simple - Monty Python and the Holy Grail was much more historically accurate than easily at least half of this hellishly awful piece-of-... movie that rotted sea monkeys could've done better with.  It's much more entertaining, as well.
The beginning did not impress me at all.  I found the scrolling white text to be rather small, and I had to pause to read what was trying to be conveyed.  Also, Joan did not find her sword as it was portrayed in this movie.  (Why a small shepherdess would need a huge sword to tend sheep is still beyond me.)  I didn't really care for the hooked-on-drugs vision in the forest, either.
The scene in which Joan's sister was raped may have been appropriate if the event had actually happened.  I found it to be distasteful, especially as there were so many things in Joan's life that Besson could have chosen to emphasize.  The invention of a falsity to ""enhance"" an already miraculous story just strikes me as ridiculous.
The scene where Joan rushes in to drink from the communion chalice is not accurate at all.  Speaking as a Catholic liturgist, the Blood of Christ (communion wine after consecration) was and still is never stored in the tabernacle (where the extra consecrated bread goes after communion), which would have been locked anyway.  Joan also would not have had access to drinking the wine to begin with.  She was not full of manufactured rage, as Besson would like us to think.  Lisa Simpson from television's ""The Simpsons"" was more accurately portrayed, as far as young Joans go.  ""Who, me?  But I'm just a little girl!""
Joan also never said anything about God being angry with the English... the trial records clearly state that she didn't know if God was against the English, but he wanted them out of France.  The scene with the arrow in her chest was very touching, but she went straight back to the battle, and the battle was won that same day, NOT the next day as shown.  The more exciting storyline in this section lies in actual fact - how amazing!
I do like how Milla plays Jehanne, except for the unnecessary hysterics.  (I liked Milla in ""The Fifth Element"" and in ""Zoolander"", too.)  I also liked the concept of Dustin Hoffman's role.  This was a nice spin on things, along with the symbolic meaning of Joan's hair turning from lightness to darkness through the course of the movie.  I also liked how John Malkovich played Charles, and appreciated that Besson was accurate in the ""Find the Dauphin"" game.
History records Joan wearing male clothing during the trial, and with her head shaved for the burning.  The miter Joan wore on ""stake day"" was noticeably absent.  A cross was not held up as Joan's body burned; it was a crucifix (amazing what difference a little body makes).
I am now wondering about how many other things I've missed, since I was too bewildered at Besson's storytelling approach to write most of my thoughts down.  Factual accuracy aside, this movie could have been made into so much more.  It's highly disappointing, yet somewhat pretty to look at if you aren't aware of ""the real story"".
Bleaach.  See ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" by Carl Dreyer instead!  At least that made Ebert's top 100 great movies list.",1.0
"I guess like most people who bought/rented this dvd, I am a huge fan of medieval flicks. Granted, most films set in this period are bereft of historical accuracy; Braveheart and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves being two obvious examples. But if the film is a genuine masterpiece then such concerns are - within reason - mere side-issues.
But this effort from luc besson is no masterpiece - not by any manner of means. The rot stems from Milla Jovovich's catastrophic portrayal of Joan of Arc. If I was French I'd be mortified at the  thought of seeing that nation's most revered heroine depicted as a screaching harpie. The character of Joan comes across as downright irritating and, quite frankly, ridiculous.
What vestige of credibility may have remained was scattered to the four winds in the scene when the English Army refused to fight the French with Joan as their general. After all, this is the same band of soldiers that brutally killed and raped a member of Joan's family only a few years before (apparently): is it really believable that the rantings of such a derranged brat could inspire so much confidence in her men  - and fear in the English - that she could lead the French to victory? Of course, this did actually happen, but in the context of this film its absurd.
..., you actually find yourself rooting for the English - hoping they put you out of your misery by burning the witch at the stake post-haste. This really shouldn't be the case, but it is.
Francophiles and lovers of the Joan d'Arc legend beware: This is  three hours of torturous tosh. Do yourself a good turn and burn this travesty of a dvd at the stake!",1.0
"This movie was horrible! First of all, it was not even historically accurate--there were more glaring innaccuracies and downright fabrications spewed forth in this movie than in a televised political debate. Joan of Arc was basically portrayed as a delusional, over-intense, angry girl who threw tantrums when things didn't go her way.
Joan of Arc's heroic accomplishments are overshadowed in this movie. Her actions which helped free the France from English control are cast in a cynical light--that she was mostly motivated by a desire for revenge. There is no mention of what a good, loving, unselfish person she was--during her trials her friends and those who knew her testified how that she was all of these things.
If you are looking for a sensational piece of fluff that reveals nothing about St. Joan of Arc, then watch this movie. If you want to find out more about the real St. Joan of Arc's life and accomplishments, look elsewhere.  If you want to watch a much better movie about Joan of Arc, check out the version starring Leelee Sobieski.",1.0
"Where to start criticizing this movie? It fails so miserably on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin.
It's obvious from watching this movie that the people who made it either didn't read the historical facts concerning Joan or did read them and simply chose to ignore them.
Furthermore, you would never know Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic from seeing this movie. Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried?
Other than that I don't know what to say about a movie that seems to go out of its way to demonize a young girl who, by all contemporary accounts, was literally a living saint.
It's just a terrible movie. Please don't waste your money.",1.0
"This movie of Joan of Arc is the WORST representation of her life ever produced.  The history is not very accurate and Joan's mission was totally missed.  The director seems to have forgotten that this 19 yr old girl was the catylst that eventually ended the Hundred Years War, but under God's command.  This is a cheezy ""Hollywood"" production; looks are very deceiving.  Don't waste your money.  If you are truly interested in seeing a GOOD and more accurate movie, I suggest THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, the 1928 silent film, or JOAN OF ARC with Leelee Sobieski, from 1999.",1.0
"Despite a promising start , I found the movie extremely disappointing.
There was some good acting but the storyline completely distorted the message of Joan of Arc. Instead of the courageous and noble young lady that I believe her to have been ,in this post-modernistic , oversophisticated era of cheap thrills she is portrayed as a pschotic ,ultraneurotic who the movie seems to suggest was motivated by selfish and bloodthirsty reasons which anyone who has studied Joan of Arc would know is not true (Read or see George Bernhard Shaw's Saint Joan which shows more genius in one sentence than this movies wise guy writers and producers could ever write in their collective lifetimes) I am going to see the other Joan of Arc video and hope it is better than this one and reflects the genuine values of freedom and justice which so many older movies (but also quite a few new ones ) more satisfyingly portray",1.0
"I know all the critics panned this film, but a few people I know said it was still worth watching. They were wrong. I'm pretty sure the only reason Jovovich even got the role is because her husband's the director. I can promise you it wasn't because of her acting ability.
I truly respect Joan of Arc and find her story quite inspiring. This film turned a strong, noble woman into a babbling psycho bent on revenge for something that never even happened. Very, very few things in this film were even historically accurate.
John Malcovich and Dustin Hoffman must've lost a bet...that's the only explanation I can think of for their prescence in this filth.
The film does have Braveheart level (in violence, not quality) battle scenes, so you may want to be careful about letting little ones view this. There is a scene in the very beginning where young Joan witnesses her sister get brutally killed and then raped, which was truly disturbing. In addition to being one of the creepiest moments on film, the event never actually happened.
If you really want to know the story of Joan of Arc, watch any other film. If all you want is 2 and a half hours of mind numbing battles with special effects, this is your flick.",1.0
"Being a person who admired the Joan of Arc of our history, I was very much looking forward to the releasal of ""The Messenger.""  I had hoped it would portray Joan in an updated version. How wrong I was.
For starters, the movie ran just too long.  Movies that are long that people don't mind, such as ""Forrest Gump"" are tolerated because they were good.  This movie was just plain bad.
Aside from the fact there are fabricated characters such as Dustin Hoffman's ""Conscious,"" it was historically inaccurate.  John Malkovich was too old to play Charles, the interactions Joan had with the English were looked over in order to spruce up the special effects of the wars and it just simply concentrated on the wrong topics of her story.  I wanted to know more about Joan, not watch the soldiers brutalize each other.
The great disservice this screenplay did was portray Joan as insane rather than having a gift from God.  Only a few ""miracles"" were actually illustrated, such as Joan picking Charles out of a crowd.  Jovovich's portrayal of Joan as a shuddering, twitching mental patient was simply unnerving, not at all enlightening.  Historic reports indicated that Joan was not at all like the movie version -- quite the opposite in fact.
This movie is also more graphic than I could bear.  The raping of her sister's corpse was just plain disgusting -- as well as false.  This did not happen and Joan's visions began way before any catastrophe...
The Messenger concentrates too much on special effects and the action factor of war.  Joan is dismissed as a saint in this movie and merely portrayed as an insane woman who pretty much got lucky with people listening to her rants.  I have never been so disgusted in my life with a biopic, which is usually what we expect -- a factual version of a historical figure.  My recommendation is to SKIP this... and look up an older version of the movie or check out PBS' website for information on specials of Joan of Arc -- they care more about facts than special effects and shock value...",1.0
"Holy Cow!  Who told model-girl she could act?  I'm sure the casting director who made the call is long out of work by now.  The only redeeming quality of this film is Dustin Hoffman.

"Having been interested in the story of Joan Of Arc since grade school,I thought I'd give this DVD a try. Good thing I rented it.. I thought the acting,etc, was okay,but the movie totally lost me when,shortly before a siege is to take place,the French ask the English to surrender. Their reply is for the French to quote""Go F**K Yourselves!"",Shortly after the siege takes place,there is an endless round of ""F"" words. I'm sorry. I'm no scholar,but I don't think that,in 1420,that F word was even invented much less used in such a casual manner.. If you make a movie based on history,then keep it in a historical context.(Same problem I had with some of ""Titanic""'s language). I do not recommend this movie to anyone.",1.0
"I've been a fan of the console version of ""Resident Evil"" ever since it was released on Playstation. However, the live-action production was an EXTREME disappointment. They basically mutilated the video game story (which was brilliant by the way), and turned it into this new-age pile of .... Combined with a thrown together plot, terrible acting, and having not one solitary *scary* moment, this movie looked bad next to digestive waste.
I mean c'mon; where's the S.T.A.R.S. team? Where's the spooky libraries and bloodthirsty crows? I certainly don't recall any computerized defense system in the video game mansion. It was simple; savage dobermans, cannibalistic zombies, and numerous random monsters created by the T-virus. The game was thrilling, it had a style unlike any other console thriller ever created. It gave people goosebumps, it made you afraid to walk down dark hallways after you played it, and for the more timid, yet determined gamers, it made you do things such as sleep with some sort of weapon next to you, and the lights turned on. But this movie, every single shred of it was horrifying - horrifyingly stupid, that is. If the rating system could go any lower, I'd rate this movie about a negative 3 stars. I'm ashamed I actually bought a ticket to go see it, may the lord forgive me for being such an imbecile.",1.0
"There honestly isn't much I can say in favor of The Messenger.  The acting is terrible, the technical elements are a mess, and the movie leaves to many critical elements unexplained.  Worse still, the movie claims to be 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc,' but utterly ignores the historical evidence on Joan.
Unlike so many other bad movies, the horrendous technical elements make this movie almost unwatchable.  Le Hire looked like a refugee from Mad Max.  Some of the buildings look like they were designed by amateurs.  The church, for instance, near Orleans was actually shorter than Joan on horseback while the castles sported bizarre chutes designed to drop cannonballs onto invaders.  Even minor details, such as the ever-changing color of Jovovich's hair show nothing short of sloppy continuity and bad design.
Bad acting only complicates the situation.  Milla Jovovich, inexplicably, maintains the same expression throughout the entire movie - up to and including during Joan's burning.  Ms. Jovovich has said that were Joan alive today she would be sitting in an internet cafe sipping coffee.  Unfortunately, such utter misunderstanding carries over into her performance.  Her performance manages to portray Joan as a delusional maniac with zombie-like expressiveness.  Le Hire was portrayed as a caricature of a barbarian and lacked any real sense of definition.  The only decent acting jobs were by Tommy Lee Jones and Dustin Hoffman.  Jones put forward a solid, if somewhat lacking and one-dimensional, performance as Charles.  While I don't agree with his interpretation of the character, I can appreciate the skill that went into creating the role.  Hoffman was simply superb.
However good Hoffman's portrayal was, it brings up one of the serious problems in the movie.  His role is never explained, let alone supported historically.  He shows up in Joan's cell, questions her actions (it should be noted here that the directing here was really distracting, particularly the frequent cuts from the cell to the brightly-lit exteriors and back), and somehow turns in a very good performance.  He brings a lot of class to an underdeloped, pointless role.  It should be noted that this is the only high point in the movie.
My biggest complaint with The Messenger is that it claims to be 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc' and bears little to no resemblence to the historical record.  Despite theories to the contrary, Joan was no fanatic - this charge was never even made by her enemies - and that is what the movie insists on portraying her as.  Similarly, the entire motivation for Joan's actions, the death and rape of her mother, is pure fabrication.  Isabelle Romee, Joan's mother, actually survived Joan by almost 20 years and was instrumental in getting her daughter's condemnation lifted.  Artistic license is one thing, but if you want to tell 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc,' actually *tell* the story rather than resorting to utter fiction.
The lesson here is to avoid movies made simply to showcase the director's girlfriend.  That's why The Messenger was made and it further illustrates the lack of respect the director and cast (Hoffman and Jones excepted) had for the material.  Its false claims to tell a historical story are dangerous and irresponsible, while bad elements and design make for an unpleasant experience.",1.0
Oh my God! It's unbelievable how this movie could gain so much popularity. I think Luc Besson did not know anything about Joan of Arc. And Milla Jovovich shouldn't play this role. She couldn't expressed her (I mean  Joan's of Arc) emotions. She was crying and shouting all the time. Nothing more. Besides she was too old to play 17 years old girl. Only one thing in this movie was impressive - batallistc scenes. I am very disappointed with this movie. I guess most of the people who know Joan's biography after watching this movie would feel the same as I do.,1.0
"I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a movie.  This was historically inaccurate beyond belief.  It almost seemed like it was making Joan out to be the villain.  If you want to see a good movie on Joan Of Arc, see the ""Joan Of Arc"" movie that was on TV.",1.0
"Not very offen I throw negative comments on a film, but unfortunately this one doesn't deserve better. I really expected a better job from Luc Besson. While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role.  To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie.",1.0
"i think the producer of this movie should convince some other sucker that it has some value-i am returning it.  i think it takes a lot for me to have cognited a movie is so bad only a fool would make or watch.  despite joan's life being well documented by official records it was conceived in the recesses of someone's mind-a fairy tale. for example her mother was not raped or murdered, joan was never near death from an arrow she took in the shoulder. yes she could not read or write but what she dictated was extremely ariculate for example the letter to the duke of bedford in the city of orleans.  not what we got in the movie.  joan to me was much more articulate than the writer in this movie.  lastly, based upon the public records i have briefly read i surmise she was someone who could grin once in a while and a girl of good humor and respectful to the future king.  not some wild eyed screaming fanatic portrayed.  there should have been some atempt to account the life of such a great life.",1.0

"An unusual movie, but ultimately an embarassing failure.  Beautiful cinematography and costuming cannot rescue this false, bloated, at times ridiculous, reprise of the story of Jeanne d'Arc. The problems can be  stated precisely: 1) Luc Besson.  2) Milla Jovovich.
Besson's Jeanne is  a bellowing lunatic and latter day feminist with a wicked right cross.  She  lounges in bed until midday then furiously berates her commanders for  starting the battle without her.  Similarly, her knights can be found  sleeping late (in full armour!) on the battlefield with the English Army  directly to their front.  The English in their turn are mercilessly  pilloried as a race of brutal proto nazis, well...OK. These are just a few  of the film's more besetting problems.  Besson's Jeanne comes across as not  a maid, but a madwoman worthy of institutionalization, if not the stake.
Likewise, Milla Jovovich's Jeanne is an insult to her memory.  Alternately screaming, squeaking,  pouting and hallucinating... It is  difficult to imagine teenage boys following such a girl around a swimming  pool, let alone hardened campaigners following her into battle.  One finds  one's self looking forward to her execution.
Jeanne's story deserves  much better treatment than she gets in this deplorable film.",1.0

"There are so many things wrong with this movie, I'm not quite sure where to begin!  I guess I could start with historical accuracy.  I knew trouble was abrewin' when I found out that John Malkovich was playing the French  King Charles, who was actually only 19 years old!  Lots of silly,  fictitious stuff was added about the various people at court who supposedly  convinced Charles to betray Joan. And one of Joan's big motivations was  shown to be the rape and murder of her sister, which has no basis in  fact.
Second major problem:  Acting.  Joan was played as if she were  constantly about to fall down sobbing and have a nervous breakdown.  She  came across as a total nutcase.  There's no way anyone would have followed  Joan if  she acted the way she was portrayed here.
There were also many  unintentionally funny parts.  I  tried hard not to laugh out loud when  Dustin Hoffman popped up as Joan's conscience mouthing the most ludicrous  dialogue you can imagine.
I could go on and on, but instead, I'll  recommend that instead of this movie, you should watch the old silent  version called The Passion of Joan of Arc.  That one will affect you and  haunt your memory (in a good way) for a long time.",1.0

"Lame, shallow and dumb, are just a very few words I will mention to describe this movie.  This movie's is basically a bunch of speical effects strung together by a shallow story line that really does not end with any real resolution other than to look out for part 2.

On top of that you may notice that this movie ""samples""  ideas from other movies such as Andromeda Strain - compare the Hive to Andromeds's underground installation as well as the Hive's computer system to the automatic self-destruct mechanism in Andromeda Stain.  Speaking of computers, where else have you seen a computer go on a killing spree? Here's a hint 2001. Another steal was from Night Of The Living Dead where dead bodies are hijacked and commissioned to wreak havoc on the living.

If you want a real thrill get your self the game and start playing.  You will get 10 times the substance and all of your money's worth.

Quite frankly I do not see what is so not helpful about this.  Obviously those who did not find this helpful have no idea about the game in which this movie is supposed to be based on.  Surely it's packed with a lot of suspense and action, but it did not follow the game in anyway.  I found this movie lame and somewhat of a rip-off from other movies.",1.0
"I didn't like this movie at all... and not just because it was so historically inacurrate.  I found the acting to be atrocious.. and when Dustin Hoffman did his big ""vision scene"" at the end all I could  think was ""sword in a field.. definitely a sword in a field""  (picture a ""Rainman"" type voice here)  the only one who had any  talent whatsoever was the little girl playing young Joan.
As far as  historical accuracy, the only thing that had any semblance to fact was Joan  always going to confession.  The visions weren't correct, the characters  were so poorly conceived they were comical.
Bottom line, if you know  nothing about Joan of Arc and would like to learn more, don't watch this  movie.  If you want to see this character portrayed in a realistic manner  and very close to what we know about her historically, don't watch this  movie.  If you have any kind of knowledge of this aspect of french history  you will be disappointed.  You're better off renting the CBS miniseries.",1.0

All I can tell you is AFTER seeing this, I happened  to catch ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" on Turner Classic Movies,  and thought it was a contemporary film.  I was shocked to learn the film  was done in 1928!

Don't for one  minute be fooled by his revisionist Joan; the real woman was a real star  and a saint.  I was left with a feeling of anger, as if a fraud had been  perpetrated, because Besson's Joan simply cannot have achieved the heroism  that the real Joan so patently did.  Her trial and life are among the most  well-documented of any historical figure, and Besson's Joan disavows or  ignores what the best scholarship has long established.

"Yeah this movie is terrible. This film relies completely on those slit second scare tactics. Where it's really quite one second and then there's a loud noise which usually turns out to be nothing. When there is something, such as a zombie, it's not scary. The zombies are very boring. They stumble slowly to their victims. They're so frail you'd think they could just be pushed over. Which is how it is in the 'Resident Evil' video game. Which is why this game never should have been made into a film. I do like the games but the plot just isn't strong enough for the big screen. If they want to make a scary game into a movie they should have chosen 'Silent Hill.' It's not so corny. Not all video game movies are completely stupid. 'Tomb Raider' managed to faithfully bring Lara Croft to the big screen and actually improve her image. Sorry Capcom, 'Street Fighter' failed and so did 'Resident Evil.'",1.0

I was surprised to find out that this was a Luc  Besson film, because La Femme Nikita was good and The Professional had a  lot of soul, too.  I think by the time he made the 5th Element, Besson had  totally lost his mind and good taste.  This movie stunk in a very big way  from start to finish.  And it was long, it seemed an eternity.  There's a  few talented actors in the movie (Dustin Hoffman, John Malkovich) but they  pretty much stink in it too.  Every aspect of the film was bad, but  probably the worst was the acting of the young woman who plays Joan.  Not  only unbelievable, but annoying and unlikeable.  Also, the unnecessary  violence really left me feeling dirty when the movie was finished.  I hope  nobody buys or rents this video, not to punish Besson, but simply because  nobody should have to sit through this.  But of course they will because of  the big names in it.",1.0
"There have been rumors of a Resident Evil movie since the release of the second videogame in 1998, but it hasn't happened until now. Originally, George Romero, the director of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" wrote a script completely identicle to the story of the first videogame. Later, I discovered Romero's script had been canned and that Paul Anderson, director of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Event Horizon"" was responsible for the project. Naturally and suspectingly, this movie became another cash-in, completely ignoring the original story of Resident Evil. Even though I paid to see it in theaters on opening day, I was still sketchy about this movie. As it turned out, this movie had completely failed all my expectation, leaving me dumbfounded as to why I had even considered seeing it. This movie was another excuse to cash in on the videogame-turned-movie basis, filled with useless CG effects that have no real place in the film. The story and script is full of holes, and the one-liners get fairly annoying.

"This film was, I'm sorry, [really bad]. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.
Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theatre, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.",1.0

"How do films like this get past hollywood executives. when a film that is Based on a video game comes out, I never look forward to it.

So lets fill it with techno heavy metal music and pointless action"". This is why we get films like Tomb Raider, Batman and Robin( recently voted worst movie ever), final fantasy, super mario brothers, street fighter, mortal kombat..., the list goes on of... game, comic, action series films. I am sure that we will never see the end to these films... Directors like Sam Raimi (spider-man), Peter Jackson (Lord of the rings).

"...Sorry to all the Capcom fans out there, but this movie goes into the vault of all the rest of the video-games-turned-movie[s]. ...The story takes a odd jump from a office building that is terminated by a unknown machine that kills all the employees, to a half-naked...er, whole-naked woman waking up in a bathtub in a weird mansion.  Alice (Milla Jovovich) has amnesia from what just happened.  Only seconds later, the mansion is attacked and bombarded by gung-ho S.W.A.T.-like marines with roughneck attitudes...(yawn)!  Alice is taken captive, were there she is revealed to be a member of the squad...but she doesn't remember.  Alice meets a mysterious cop (Eric Mabius) and a charming nobody (James Purefoy) that later turns out to be a charming jerk-off...or is that a jerk-off nobody?  The Marines and the 3 are taken to a an underground lab, where the same inccident took place at the very beginning.  The machine that killed the office employees is already planning to kill the marines...As for the basic plot?  Well, when I mean ""basic"", I mean it was as if the writer just watched ""Aliens"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", took out his laptop computer and started writing a remake of the movie he had just watched and titled it ""Resident Evil""...because he just saw a commercial for some game called ""Resident Evil""...
Seriously, folks.  You need to go out and see REAL films and not just hokey sequels or dumb wannabes.  RE is pathecticly shown and scripted.  The entire movie is basically ""Aliens"" in an underground office space that looks like the headquarters for Washington Mutual bank company than a secret organization, with Zombies, mutant dogs and a grumpy computer.  Oh, and as for the mutants?  The zombies look more like homeless bums with horrible teeth hygene than flesh eating monsters.  The mutant dogs are just Dobermens with Halloween make-up on their faces.  As for the rest of the mutants, like the ""Hunters"" and ""Lickers""?  Well, let's just say that Rick Baker must be turning in his grave...wait a minute...nevermind.  The ""Lickers"" in the RE video-game were much better, were as in the film, they're piles of doo-doo that have the intelligence of a pasture cow.  The ""Hunters"" in the video-game version kicked butt totally, with their pumped-up bodies and bad attitute, were as in the film (this has to be the cheapest idea I've ever heard), they are actually ""Lickers"" evolved...where ...did that come from???  The CGI in this film is absolutely terrible.  It looks like it was done on a home computer!!!  The characters are terribly one-dimensional and have no purpose...either than to be eaten alive by monsters.  What really ticked me off was the fact that some characters in the film get close to death in one scene that is very pulse-pounding, survive, only to be mutalated anti-climatically 10 minutes later.  It was as if the director was sitting in his chair and constantly his assistant would come up to him and ask ""So...do we kill him now?"" and he would say ""Nah, better wait a few more minutes"".  This was totally annoying.  I absolutely hated Jovovich's character for her lack of common sense.  Ofcourse, these days, if you want to make a action film, gotta put in stupid ""Matrix""-style moves.  God, am I getting sick of that same formula of action!!!!  How is it that you can jump against a wall and kick a dog in mid-air motion?  Please!  Probably the worse thing by far in this flick was the ending......",1.0

"Twenty years ago, a movie like ""Resident Evil"" would have been considered a horror masterpiece, heralded for its social commentary on the evils of the advancement of mankind, and praised for its stunning array of action sequences and make-up and special effects. Here, in the age of movies like last's year's ""Thirteen Ghosts"" and countless other entries into the horror genre, it's a big, obnoxious, at times baffling effects show fueled by incoherence and banality.
The film is derived from a popular video game franchise, which would explain why the plot feels jumbled, or why its characters feel flaccid and empty. It begins with an introduction that is aggravating in its choice of leaving too much in the dark to be explained later in a less-than-admirable manner. The world is dominated by major corporations, many of which deal in such things as genetic and viral testing and experimentation. In a series of chain reactions, an underground laboratory known as the Hive is contaminated by a viral strand, after which its computer, referred to as the Red Queen, begins the containment process, locking its hundreds of employees within the complex, and extinguishing them.
Enter Milla Jovovich (character names matter not in such a film), who awakens after a fall in the shower to find a mysterious scar on her shoulder, a strange note left in her bedroom, and a dresser drawer that holds a full arsenal of weaponry. Equally unsettling is the storming of her elite home, where she, along with Eric Mabius, is taken into an underground cavern through a hidden door in her home, and transported by rail to the Hive. This sequence, as well as those to come, is poorly shot, with the use of flashy cinematography and quick-cuts; it matters little, though, because to see it clearly would not be to like it more.
The underground setting itself is another slap in the face, being everything you'd expect from a movie such as this: endless hallways of steel, an abundance of fluorescent lighting, and a sense of claustrophobia that goes unnoticed in director Paul Anderson's eyes. Joining Jovovich and Mabius is a team of gun-toting security guards led by Michelle Rodriguez. The objective of their mission centers on the Red Queen, whom they must reboot in order to regain access to the Hive's many chambers, presumably to find some answers to the lockdown.
The real evil that resides here is the story's desperation to try and provide coherent solutions to its mysteries. Once things start going awry after the opened doors release the many undead facility workers, victims of the viral strand, the story descends further into camp territory, recalling plot twists and surprises from previous horror and science fiction films, some better, some of the same caliber.
... The overall film boasts a loud, aggressive soundtrack replete with heavy bass and ear-splitting treble, becoming aggravating and obnoxious without ever attaining our interest. There are innumerable amounts of quick jolts, in which undead zombies jump onto screen to a beat of the music; the abundance of such tactics quickly grows tiresome and redundant. The antagonists themselves, from the sleep-walking zombies and inside-out Dobermans, to the clich-riddled monster that can change form and attain the strength of its victims, do nothing to raise the fear factor, providing more laughs than scares.
On those grounds, ""Resident Evil"" is little more than another horror entry riddled with familiarity and incoherence, banal characters and lousy plotting, that feels less like a movie and more like disjointed cinematic interludes that appear during the course of a video game.",1.0
"So far the worst film of the young millennium, ""Resident Evil,"" based on the video game series, is sheer torture for all of its 100 minutes. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about it whatsoever. The only frightening parts of this wreck are the dreadful script, the haggard plot (people blast a bunch of zombies while trying to shut down a supercomputer in an underground lab), and weak acting by equally weak actors. Milla Jovovich is a far cry from Angelina Jolie as a respectable female action hero, no matter how hard the media tries to incite a rivalry between them. If you were foolish enough to actually pay money to watch this, then immediately go home and cleanse your soul with the superior ""Tomb Raider."" Enough said.",1.0
"This is one of the worst disasters in the history of filmmaking.  The casting was good.  The director of photography and his lighting crew is obviously extremely talented.  The editor is obviously talented.  The production design crew was obviously talented.  The story was salvageable.  Nonetheless, the film just plain stucked!  1) The directing of the actors was completely unconvincing. Every character and every emotional expression seemed like the director had no ability to pull an original, believable performance out of these capable actors.  2) It was totally derivative of films like Aliens and countless video games: ""Keep it tight people"", ""Get over here!"" etc, etc. 3) The gore was pointlessly disgusting to the point of connoisseurship, as if gore fans will be sipping their Pepsi like fine wine and commenting in a faux English accent, ""Ah yes, that's just wonderful how the white of his eye just leaked out of that laser cut. And, oh my, the sound of walking on broken ankles is just an exhilarating aural bouquet.""  I think people are actually getting off on this stuff, which is just sick.  4) The cinematography, which again must be approved by the director, is totally overdone.  Every single shot is seemingly an extreme close up or swooping crane movement or some other camera technique that is best used in moderation.  It's again just contrived to the point of aggravation.  5) The plot development and character development is totally out of whack, so that we don't know who anyone is or why we should give a damn until halfway into the film, and this is not in a good way like in Memento.  6) A giant beehive-like underground corporate R&D complex, a supercomputer AI programmed as the dead daughter of the programmer, self defense mechanisms that meet the ridiculous criteria parodied in Galaxy Quest...I could go on and on with the laughable ideas portrayed in this film.  Even worse is the ridiculous exposition the characters indulge in to relay these facts to us.  In the end I was left with a serious case of that ""bad film"" feeling.  A waste of my time and obviously the high quality film stock it was painstakingly photographed on.",1.0

"What might have been: Opening scene a helicopter flies over the forrest on the north western side of Raccon City, STARS Bravo team, lead by Albert Wesker are are investigating the disapearance of the Alpha team, when they land they are attacked by zombie dogs and chased into a mansion where they uncover the house is full of zombies and all kinds of different monsters. The original game (currently being remade for Nintendo GameCube) had the perfect premise for a scary movie, it had the atmosphere, the monsters, the suprises and everything that kept a person on thier toes, all things which the movie that was made a s a prequel did not have. WHat did this movie have that was good? Michelle Rodrigiez is very good looking... aside from that... There were some great makeup effects, but the one non-zombie monster that appeared was the licker, which looked terribly CGI. Over all the special effects were unimpressive, they held back way to much with the gore, and there was far more eye roller moments than scares. This is what we call a hack fest flick, except there wasn't a lot of hacking... so there wasn't a lot going on here that would make it a good horror flick. The problem with a lot of game based movies is that the movies don't follow the games closely enough, that's why only Mortal Kombat has succedded to be a good movie so far, but Mortal Kombat Annihilation strayed too far from the original plot of MK 2 and failed miserably because of it. The same can be said of all of the other game based movies. Many of them have been moderate successes, but we gamers go to see these hoping for a movie that will be true to the games, not be related by name only. Resident Evil Rebirth for GameCube will be time much better spent than watching this movie. The movie has a lot of guns, and a lot of zombies grabbing at people, and neither are enough to call it a Resident Evil movie.",1.0

"""Good special effects"" seemed to be the only positive thing anyone had to say about this movie.  From start to finish, the movie did nothing to make you feel either for or against any of the characters, except perhaps for tantalising glimpses of Milla Jovovich's anatomy.  The entire movie seemed like an endless repetition of a 90 second sequence: create a spooky setting with an opportunity for special effects to go overboard, build an ""it's almost too quiet"" sense of normalcy, then introduce some grotesque horror and put a bang in the soundtrack to make it seem like everyone's jumping due to the amazing build-up of tension.
I tried to think of a worse movie, but apparently I've either repressed all such experiences, or this is genuinely the worst movie I've ever seen.  It's probably not... oh - no... in fact, it definitely isn't.

"I cannot imagine anyone who was actually involved in the 1996 Everest tragedy being at all pleased with this made for television movie.  Although Kraukaer's book of the same name seemed to show some biases and quick, sometimes scathing one sided judgements of people, no one can say that he is not an excellent and captivating writer.  In this movie, the poor script itself, would (or should) make him cringe.  There is little basis for fact in the movie as well:  Kraukaer was not the first to summit, he did not man the radio from camp once down to talk to Rob Hall...etc, etc, etc.  I wanted to watch the movie because I had read in Anatoli Boukreev's book The Climb how disturbed Boukveev was when he saw the movie on TV the night it was first played.  I am sorry that he had to suffer with this....and that he thought that this was how Americans would ""see"" the tragedy.

For example, the dialogue, when I could hear it, was spare, even terse, no nonsense, which seems to fit the strenuous physical (and mental) exertion of the climb up and the descent---no time, energy, thought for hyperbole.

The most annoying thing about the film, for me however, was the music, which was so loud---and I fear uninteresting, uninspired---that often I could not hear what anyone was saying.  I had to sit up close and listen carefully to hear what the actors were saying.  The point is that the musical score itself was not a good enough reason to watch this film to the bitter end.

"If you want to learn more about the 1996 events on Everest, there are many informative and entertaining books and documentaries on the subject.

This awful made-for-TV movie isn't one of them.  I ordered it out of curiosity because I had read how bad it was, and it did not disappoint!

Very loosely based on Jon Krakauer's excellent book about his experiences as a member of Rob Hall's 1996 Everest expedition, this ""movie"" is poorly-acted, excruciatingly badly written, and has the most melodramatic musical score in the history of movie-making (the awful music swells alarmingly to announce each commercial break!)

It's also inaccurate, and is really an insult to the memories of some of the real-life participants in the tragedy.

It would be a shame if this TV garbage were your only introduction to, for example, Anatoly Boukreev (in the film the actors can't even pronounce his name right), who single-handedly kept the death toll during this awful night on Everest from being even worse than it was.

I had read that Jon Krakauer was always embarrassed about this movie, and I don't blame him.  So save your money, your brain, and your sensibilities, and read or re-read ""Into Thin Air"", ""The Climb"", ""Left for Dead"", or any of the other books by the participants in the 1996 Everest tragedy.

The characterizations of all the members were weak. The movie lacks the cinematography and some pivotal scenes just don't have the impact you'd expect.",1.0
"There are two ways to approach this film.  The first is whether it is a fair and accurate rendition of the events of the 1996 tragedy which was the subject of Krakauer's book.  The second is simply what entertainment value the film has.  Having read both Krakauer's book and Boukreev's ""The Climb,"" this film's flagrant deviation from any semblance of reality so distracted me that I was unable to discern any entertainment value in the film whatsoever.

Things get started with a big fat lie.  We are informed at the very beginning that the film is based on published accounts and interviews of the participants.  This would lead the unsuspecting viewer to believe that the film makes an effort to be faithful to the truth.  I wonder how many people have watched this movie and think, as a result, that they know something about the tragedy, its causes, or even Everest and mountaineering for that matter.  They would be sadly mistaken on all accounts.

The film somberly announces each day of the expedition:  day one, day two, etc.  Each day finds the climbers of the two expeditions traveling as a group, reaching a new camp.  What a joke.  In reality, it takes weeks to establish the camps, while the climbers acclimatize to the altitude.  This is accomplished in small groups, not the entire expedition together.  If they had really climbed to camp IV in the four days depicted, they all would died of AMS before even being able to attempt the summit.

Hollywood being what it is, even a story about climbing Everest has to have some sex in it.  Sex American style, no less, meaning there can be no sex without moralizing.  We see Sandy Pittman's lover climb up to camp I to be with her, and a Sherpa voices strong disapproval because they're not married.  He foretells that the mountain will not tolerate such flaunting of its moral code, and he fears the worse.  This entire segment is a product of the screenwriter's imagination.  But now we know that the entire tragedy was the result of Ms. Pittman's unrestrained libido.

We don't have to wait for the tragedy proper to get a taste of the mountain's ability to have revenge.  In the next scene, a Taiwanese climber (although, there were no Taiwanese in the two groups, the screenwriter created these characters to play the role of buffoonish amateurs) walks out of his tent in his boot liners, slips on the ice and falls to his death.

I'm not going to catalog all the factual errors in the film here.  By this time you get the idea.  What happened is less important than what the screenwriter thinks would make good drama (and it's amazing how bad his idea of good drama is).

The most outrageous deviation from the truth comes during the unfolding of the tragedy itself.  As the situation deteriorates, the movie has Krakauer coordinating and leading rescue efforts, including going back onto the mountain in an effort to find Rob Hall.  In truth, Krakauer spent the night sleeping in his tent, too exhausted to move.  The only member of the two teams who made any rescue efforts at all after returning to Camp IV was Boukreev, who single handedly saved the lives of four climbers lost on the South Col.

Other reviewers have commented on other failings of the movie, and to those I will only add that it is extremely difficult to follow the movie at times, because it's hard to know who is who.  Characters are not introduced and most of them do not get enough camera face time to be recognized, especially all wrapped up in a snowsuit with fake snow and ice hanging off their faces.",1.0

"Not wanting to effect Amazon's profit margin but 'PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO' If you thought the 'Beach' was a dissapointing adaptation of a great  book wait till you see this turkey. If you have read any of the growing  number of books assosiated with the events of 1996 on Everest you will be  familiar with the tragic,unfortunate list of circumstances which lead to  misjudgement , human error and ultimately disaster. This film takes  snippets of Krakaeurs book, exaggerates them grossly ( did Sandy Hill  Pitman REALLY have a coffee making machine - and a big one at that - on the  mountain with her ? ) and makes hammy drama out of the suffering of others.  I am surprised that Krakauer even agreed to have his name associated with  this piffle , and even more surprised that the events survivors haven't sued  ! No wonder tha poor climbers died on the mountain , they are constantly  removing their oxygen masks to spout reels of poorly written dialogue. To  be fair the whole thing is a wasted opportunity.",1.0
"The story of the 1996 tragedy on Mt. Everest is a very complex one.  As  the crisis approached and once the climbers were webbed in it, the  consequences of decisions and habits begun long ago became magnified and a  true tragedy unfolded.  This movie explored very little of this complexity,  thus seriously compromising the fact that no climber in 1996 was either one  thing or another, say, either a failure or a hero.  Each climber was both.  But, this movie sketched simplistic portrayals and so the depth and  complexity of the story is lost.  The movie has its compelling moments:  Rob Hall and Jan Arnold naming their baby, soon to be born; the effects of  high altitude on the climbers' minds and breathing; the fierceness of the  storm.  But, the movie portrays time poorly, thus flattening the plot  rather than bringing it to any kind of emotional climax.  I would hate to  think that any person who cares about mountaineering and this particular  climb would base any of their understanding on this movie.",1.0

For those of you who are following this thread, there IS a Letterbox Widescreen version of this film in existence.

I rented it to watch with my 5 year old son thinking he'd cherish the memory as I did. To our surprise, we were both appalled at the immodesty in behavior and dress throughout the film. My son even averted his eyes and told me he didn't feel right watching it because it was inappropriate. I was in denial because of the memories I had and could hardly believe it. We shut it off. As I reflected on it, I realized that the movie was filthier than anything I've ever let him watch before and remembered some of the unsettling feelings i had when  I watched it long ago (particularly a drunk and immodestly dressed Carol Burnette). I feel terrible for having to be corrected and convicted by the innocence of my son. I have since renewed my vigor in strictly monitoring everything that comes into my home.

"The Fisher King is a disappointing myriad of chaotic film sequences, uninspiring characters, and a deliberately meaningless title.

Viewers who prefer creative/fantasy movies will likely be  insulted by this poor attempt to fill their needs.

I even googled whether Terry Gilliam intentionally played with frame rates  in this film because it looked so strange. I reset my Roku stick, and my incredibly fast Internet connection was working perfectly. I also tested other HD content on the same app using the same device, and it looked just fine.

When I saw the film on VHS, they had the correct information, but why was the DVD incorrect?  Are other releases of this film on DVD providing the same incorrect information, or actually listing Isham as the composer.  What made the issue even more ridiculous is how the end credits had Isham's regular orchestrator and conductor, Ken Kugler, and Bernstein always conducted his own scores by this time period.  Please, will anyone explain this discrepancy?  On the whole though, bad film, but beautiful cinematography.  However, Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn were extraordinary.",1.0

"Beautifully photographed, great music score, sucky movie. It's a 15 minute story dragged into, what? a movie that's over 2 hours or only SEEMS that long!

I found the pastor father reprehensible, stuffing HIS beliefs down his son's throats before they were old enough to decide about religion for themselves. He was just a small-town fish trying to be something bigger, basically on a power-trip. The oldest son was not strong enough or independently smart enough to fight him, but the younger son rebelled in that way preacher's kids always do: Major sinning! And boy, did this movie need some sin so you wouldnt fall asleep!

Redford's one of the best directors around, heavy and fantastic on his visuals, but he needs the right material. He even photographed Pitt in ways that remind you of a younger Redford. Hmmm.......

"Since this movie seems to inspire nothing but praise in this forum, I thought I'd toss out an opinion against the current. I think people of faith ought to be warned against this movie. It is the kind of movie that religious people are naturally drawn to. It deals with the brokenness and failure in human relationships, and it has some religious themes, or I should say, the author clearly *thinks* that he is making an artistic commentary on spiritual themes. He portrays the father of the protagonists, who is a pastor, to be a 2-dimensional pharisee, full of reflex prejudices and social conformisms. There is nothing redeeming about the father. He is just a caricature that, no doubt, reflects author's resentment of the inadequacies of the faith of his own parents. In fact, the movie is really only ""spiritual"" in so far as it provides a nice portrait of how liberals view religious people, on the one hand, and depicts the spiritual impotence of faithless people on the other. The sentimentality in this movie is mind-numbing. Once again, this reflects the author's idea of the essence of the religious belief he has personally left behind. It reminds me of a movie Jane Fonda made some years ago called Golden Pond - a movie full of anti-family, anti-religious hatreds, with a veneer of sentimentality that is supposed to disarm religious people, because after all, isn't sentimentality what religion is all about? But this is by no means the most repugnant aspect of this film. This is a film full of despair, written by someone who is powerless to heal a hangnail, much less a serious spiritual disfunction, precisely because the power of living faith is completely alien to him. Obviously, tragedy and self-destructive behavior occur in families of faith, but art is like quantum measurement: it necessarily distorts what it measures, and the more explicit the ideological message, the bigger the distortion. Misery likes company, and this film is simply an invitation to the shared misery of a cynical, sorrowful, spiritually impotent liberal living in a post christian culture. There is absolutely nothing edifying or liberating in the entire film, unless you think bitter self-pity is liberating. Secularists of the sentimental sort might enjoy this opportunity to wallow in their own heartache, and outdoorsmen might enjoy the scenary. People of faith should just pass this one up. Pretty scenary does not give mystical meaning to stupid despair, nor does it vindicate it. If you are a person of faith, save your dollars for a movie created by someone who knows what faith really is. And Please don't give your money to these despairing clowns who are wise in their own eyes. They will only use it to make more vapid movies.",1.0
"I cant believe that Ive only found one bad review of this film on the whole internet. Have you all gone mad? Apart from the beauty of Brad Pitt and the Montana scenery, this is one of the most disappointing badly made and boring films I have seen since ""Independance Day""!

"Here is Hollywood glamorati trying to make us believe in small town virtue so that we will applaude them for their touching heart rending acting. Its tripe and nothing more. There is nothing here that has anything to do with small towns; it is pure Hollywood.
  Not even the slightest attempt to portray a real small town. I mean ... an underground speak-easy club and a gambling club all in the same small rural Montana town.  Pleeeze give me a break. This isn't Chicago! There aren't enough people there to support that kind of sin infrastructure.
  The whole movie is so unrealistic, so contrived, so full of paltitudes - it is just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
  Of course in our times it is lauded as a great tribute to rural America, but it is nothing of the sort. Brad baby never has a hair out of place. He is gorgeous in every shot, as is his brother and everyone in town. No dirt under their finger nails. The people who live in that type of town lack hair stylists and manicurists. They don't look like movie stars and don't act like brats from suburbia. The people in those towns are generally not good looking, they are slow, not to energetic and, well, strange. You'll see nothing resembling that in this glamorati vehicle.
  The whole moral is that even if you disgrace your family, even if you are a drunk, a blaggart, a loser, a gambler - you really are perfection if you can fly fish. Virtue reduced to fly fishing - so 90s, so now, so trendy of Hollywood's new love of high priced cabins in Montana and long retreats in the mountains. I may not be so virtuous, but I'm a helluva fly fisherman so that's what counts (substitute ""actor"" for ""fisherman"" and you have the formula for Hollywood virtue, i.e. I may be a miserable useless human being but they love me on the big screen).

As a Christian I must object to the promiscuous and major alcoholic behavior of the orphanage lady played by Carol Burnett.

"Yes, I do like art films, non-mainstream films, thought-provoking films - and for those who are still wondering, I am no fan of action or classic hollywood formulas etc. Thus what I have to say is not based on any heartbreak over lack of action or cheesy romance or a simple linear storyline.

No, the real problem is that this movie takes on a number of contemporary topics (such as homelessness, urban isolation, depression, existential ennui, inflammatory talk-radio, ... yes the list is lo..ng) mixes them up with a dash of (obviously labored) enigma and a generous serving of shock-value items (violence, language, nudity, meaningless scenes - Robin Williams obliges competently here) and serves them up with the suggestive lure of slightly non-traditional cinematography (odd angles and extreme close-ups of faces, lips - also overdone) - with the hope that perhaps the pseudo-artsy segment will fall for these gimmicks (and forget that there is really no depth, no original thoughts or insights whatsoever) and hail it as another great, maverick production. (And judging from the nominations, the ploy worked!)

Yes, I like Robin Williams and that is why I fell for it - yet that couldn't alter a fundamentally flawed movie that's trying to exploit our interest in these ""deeper human topics/issues"". Great acting (even if I were to concede that) cannot cover-up for a pointless, phony script.

In summary, DO NOT waste your money (and more importantly TIME) on this one - even if you can see it for free!

Regards all.

P.S.  There is a difference between being creative/unconventional for the benefit of gaining unique perspectives leading to new connections/insights - and being ""creative/zany"" for the sake of it i.e. to get attention and fuel our narcissism.  It's good to be able to tell the difference.",1.0
"I *nearly* hated this film. I am a former film student, current film lover, reader, researcher, and all-around film nerd. But I just did not connect one iota with this dismal movie. I love BRAZIL and TWELVE MONKEYS, and enjoy much of Terry Gilliam's other work. But what in the heck IS this? There is 'good wierd' (BRAZIL) and then '[bad] wierd' of which this film is one example.  The story seems tied together in only the loosest meaning of the word. The relationships and coincidences just had me saying ""COME ON!"". The film seems rambling and disjointed-maddeningly so. I also found the murder scene to be horribly jarring and unecessarily grotesque. Yeah, that's my idea of a good time...
So flame me if you will, but this film is garbage. I didn't even have the opportunity to be engaged in it, it bored me so. Robin Williams in the buff. Ugh, ok. Not my idea of great film making. I kept searching for some greater idea or POINT (!) to tie everything together and I didn't find it. Granted, I only saw the film once, but if it is so bad that I have no desire to ever see it again-even for the sake of figuring it out, then a one star rating is more than appropriate.

"When in the 80's I saw Peter Graves use those little laser discs to find out about their new Mission:Impossible, I thought that was great new technology. A few years later audio CDs arrived in Portugal. When DVDs started to come out, I found out what a great picture quality compared to the old VHS tapes. And the possibility of watching a movie with English subtitles was a great way to learn English and to understand the picture much better than any language translation because there are expressions which just can't be translated. Either you understand it or you don't.

Now with Blu-Ray, the movie companies go to every effort to force the consumer to buy the same movies again, after have bought them on VHS, DVD, DVD Special Edition. They make new special features, new cover designs, new commentaries, new everything but they forget Europe is in a economic crisis and even if we are SOOOOOO tempted to buy our favorite movies with the BEST picture and sound quality available, we just CAN'T! Us the portuguese have no money and no way to get it. The Wizard of Of of course is one of those classics, as well as Willy Wonka, Annie, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, the Bond movies, etc etc etc. The list is endless.

And even if we could buy it, somewhere in the future a new medium will be invented (probably a microchip) with 2K or 4K resolution of those movies. I think we have to draw the line somewhere, people. Come on. Be serious. The minimum wage here is 480 Euros. A Blu-Ray costs between 10 and 40 Euros.

"I can't speak for the stage musical but this film does not faithfully represent the comic strip by Harold Gray. While dir. John Huston slipped in a few (weak) references that only a dedicated Gray fan would understand, the film overall is a terrible adaptation.

Daddy Warbucks is a tireless enemy to crime in all its forms & devotes his life to bringing justice to criminals who escape legal punishment. That is what Punjab & The Asp are for, they are efficient assassins who step in when ""Daddy"" needs them. Annie isn't a cute singing moppet, she is a pint-sized adventuress who endures true hardship & tragedy and often joins in Warbucks' fight against crime. Punjab is not a sideshow conjurer, Gray's world is filled with *real* magic, miracles, and supernatural occurrences. The drunken carpet-baggers in this movie would be no challenge at all to the real Annie or Warbucks, and if they crossed a certain line, the real Daddy Warbucks would send the Asp along in the night to make sure they would never hurt children again.

It pains me to write this since I am a huge John Huston fan. I can only imagine what he would have done with the real source material, not a musical that steals its plot from ""Silas Marner"" and requires these dignified, intense, often dark characters to stop and do a little song & dance every five minutes.

Skip this & read the Fantagraphics reprint series. That's where the real Annie can be found. If you like stories with intelligence, action, adventure, mystery and a touch of philosophy, you'll love the original strip by Harold Gray.",1.0
"Explain to me, please, what the Henson Creature Factory was thinking. Explain to me, even more, what Mandy Patinkin was thinking. (Vanessa Williams barely rates a mention, and here it is, now forget she exists.)
  It's become obvious down through the years that, as cartoons list  their stylish subtlety and went increasingly towards a specific aim at the  juvenile crowd, that Jim Henson and his band of merry monsters would take  up the slack that the golden age of Warner Brothers and Looney Toons had  left-- material that was aimed at kids, but with enough adult-oriented  material to keep the adults watching, as well. (Go back and watch those old  cartoons. You'll be amazed at what passed you over when you were a tot that  you find hilarious now, such as Porky Pig's many jabs at Hitler.) Henson's  bunch created two of television's finest, and most underrated, variety  shows, The Muppet Show and Muppets Tonight, both of which played the  balance between kid-oriented slapstick and more adult humor that could have  come straight from the joke book of Don Rickles. And when they started  making movies, they opted for the same approach, and when parents went to  see The Muppet Movie with the little ones, they ended up laughing just as  much.
  When Jim Henson died, Brian took over, and the Creature Factory  was born. Muppets in Space proved that the son had capably stepped into the  shoes of the father. And now... we get this sickly, stupid, ungainly,  ludicrous mess that can only be called a film because somewhere someone is  burning miles of celluloid with these images on it. At least, I fervently  hope so. Even the kids in the audience (all four of them) were relatively  bored with this pathetic attempt at making a kid-friendly version of The  Rocky Horror Picture Show (with audience participation and all). We're long  past the point where we feel we need to overly simplify moral lessons for  kids, aren't we? Yet the ""learning"" imparted in this film  sounds-- and smells-- like a dead haddock hitting you in the face.
  If  your kid is the world's biggest Elmo fanatic, wait until the video comes  out, and then tape it off PBS. But my kid is probably #2, and at least  twice she asked ""is it time to go home yet?"" (This is a kid who  sat through A Bug's Life and The Wizard of Oz with no problems, mind you.)  Does it rate any stars at all? You be the judge....",1.0
"I am a music teacher and I show musicals to my students.  We have watched some of the best...Music Man, Oliver, Mary Poppins, so I thought that Annie would be a great addition to the repertoire.

I do not recommend this video.  I'm sure there are better versions out there.  Read carefully.",1.0

"I grew up on the ""real"" annie, meaning the original broadway version, and never liked this 1982 aileen quinn ""annie"" film, directed by john huston. I never saw the 1999 Disney one until last night, when i watched it with my four year old daughter.  she wanted to see annie and i made the mistake of showing her this john huston film-- VERY dark, unappealing, and the arrangements of the songs are not good. carol burnett, whom i LOVE, played a very dark version of miss hannigan, drinking, floozing, and actually quite scary and creepy-- totally inappropriate for young children.  i think aileen quinn is extremely unappealing as annie, with none of the charm of andrea mcardle or any of the broadway annies.  the next morning when my daughter asked to watch this again, i had to tell her the dvd was broken, because i just felt it was too dark, and charmless-- even the costumes and sets were without magic (and the jeffrey holder sub-plot is just silly).  My daughter was furious and begging to see annie again, so i did some reading of reviews here on amazon, and found the other one-- the alicia morton/kathy bates version.  it's like night and day!  that one is much more true to the original broadway version-- alicia morton as annie is charming, adorable, a great singer-- tough and sweet, but not saccharin like aileen quinn.  the costumes and sets are charming, the musical arrangements are great, all the performances are strong, and it is great for young audiences.  i am usually not a fan of Disney-fied musicals-- but they did a GREAT job with this one.  and the andrea mcardle cameo was a huge treat for a fan like me.  i had to give this one star for respect for carol burnett, albert finney, and john huston, but i give it a big YUCK for the execution, and the performances. an even bigger yuck for quinn and her hair!!

Just 2 movies in my life scared the crap out of me and traumatized me for life. Michael Jacksons Thriller was one. Annie was the other. And man do I ever suffer. I grind my teeth and go insane every time I think about how bad this movie and it's soundtrack are. I hate it so bad I would rather go to a Barbra Streisand concert or see all 9 hours of Anne of Greene Gables and those evil PBS fund raisers in between than suffer the sheer torture of Annie. The sun will not come out tomorrow until this movie is destroyed from of the face of the planet. Or when the sequel Freddie vs Annie comes out where Freddie Kruger give Annie her worst nightmare forcing her to watch her own movie!,1.0
"This version of Annie is dark and mean-spirited.  Carole Burnett plays a

nasty drunkard Miss Hannigan with no redeeming qualities.  The child playing Annie looks the part, but her acting is not great.  People try to

kill Annie in this movie.  It may be true to the cartoon, but it's not something I want my daughter to watch.

The Disney version is far superior, though it takes a few liberties and deviates from the standard script, including a budding romance between Warbucks and his secretary.

Audra McDonald is luminous, Victor Garber is the father everyone wishes they had, Cathy Bates and supporting cast are funny, and Alicia Morton is believable and sincere. There is even a cameo appearance by Andrea McArdle, the first Annie on Broadway.  Unless you are a true cynic, the Disney Annie will tug at your heartstrings.  If you want a nice video with positive values to share with your little girl, the Albert Finney Annie isn't it.  Get the Disney Annie instead.

"For little girls and girly men only!

I saw this movie when it first came out in 1982 and have never seen a movie worse or more girly since. YUCK!

This movie is not only bad but it is sheer torture!

I remember how painful it was to go to this movie in 1982.

If only my parents could have gotten a babysitter while I went to this movie with my sisters.

Star Wars was my favorite movie in the world and I wanted to see it again and again and again.

NOT ANNIE! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Help me Obi-One Kenobi your my only hope!

Watching Annie was one of the most traumatic events I suffered through in my childhood that I have never been able to recover since.

I suffer from post-traumatic syndrome from watching Annie!

What could be more cruel than to take a 7 year old to a movie theater to see Annie?

""Somebody pinch me please."" Yes I remember the lines in the movie because they haunt me and I heard them over and over again with that soundtrack my sisters listened to and I wanted to step on the freakles of that cassette tape but couldn't because I would get in trouble and would have to buy another copy that would make it last longer and before the time it got old with my sisters.

This movie is worse than Anne of Greene Gables!

That is saying a ton! What could be worse?

Anne of Green Gables takes a whole day to watch and the sheer torchure of Annie outdoes Anne of Greene Gables 50 million times more in just 90 minutes!

If you like musicals don't see this movie.

If you like movies don't see this movie.

If you like DVD's don't see this movie.

If you like television don't see this movie.

If you like life PLEASE don't see this movie.

If Daddy Warbucks offered to leave me with his entire fortune to see this movie I would say no!

"""Annie"" was one of the best Broadway musicals of the past 30 years. It relied on content and talented performers instead of high-tech sets and lighting and un-taltented stars. Andrea McArdle as the loveable orphan was actually 13 as the perfect age to play Annie, who was I believe 12 in the stage show. She had a great voice and was tougher than the usual little girl. As Oliver Warbucks, Reid Sheldon was comic and warmhearted and as the beloved Miss Hanigan, Dorothy Loudon was a cynical, boozing broad, just as the charachter was written.

In 1982, Hollywood put its rather dull and child-like stamp on ""Annie."" Not only does this Annie- Aileen Quinn have a horrible voice, but is also cutesy and phony. Albert Finney as Warbucks, although he looks the part, doesn't act the part. There is no pompus humor. As Miss Hanigan, Carol Burnett get the drinking part right, but that's about all she does through the whole movie. Ms. Burnett, although rather funny throughout the film, acts like a drunk through the whole thing. The characther is more than than.

I am a huge fan of Bob Fosse, and Ann Reinking is one of his best dancers, however for this film, her taltnents were not shown. She was miscast for the role of Miss Farrel.

The story was completely revamped to make Miss Hannigan look like a nice charachter. There was also no Arab servant in the stage show.

The music was changed drastically. Did you know ""Tomorrow"" was actually a scene change song in the Broadway show? Well here it is song constantly, terribly as well. ""We Got Annie"" was planned as a song in the Broadway show, but here is sung by a bunch of people who we don't care about. It isn't particulary good here anyway.

And ""Dumb Dog"" doesn't even count as a song. Although the song about the contract invovling Warbucks in Hannigan was comic, it too was dull.

""Annie"" is perhaps the worst stage to screen musicals. How could they ruined this well-written masterpiece?",1.0

"Doesn't matter whether I am able to sing or not. I sang in the Chicago Children's Choir at the age of the actress and I am well familiar with tone, pitch, and delivery. The original 1977 Tony Award Winning musical Starring Andrea McArdle was simply magnificant!! McArdle is a child genius with an above average voice. She could carry the demands of an Alto and Aileen Quinn basically could not whatsoever!! What I cannot stomach is that so damned many people creamed over this film. It was over-budgeted and awful and as a former star myself; it was made for the pure driven desire of the almighty dollar. The Only reason an Oscar was nominated is because this was one of Houston's last musicals before his death and many of you really are not aware of how Hollywood is so very political in the decision making that goes into nominations and clout. I so very agree with the other (very few) appreciative viewers who have compared the stage version to the film version in that the spirit of Art and Talent just was not there. Finney tried the hardest to make this work and why in the heck would Houston remove the best scores from the original Broadway smash. Talent is very hard to come by and for anything to work; one musn't be so inspired about the money alone. The best films were made by the conviction of the artist. I mean CHICAGO was THE BEST adaptation and can you see the difference? I am glad that it was made for children but to take it seriously as a Oscar Winner is just plain ridiculous. Why do you think that you can purchase the movie for .98!! Great for those who have NO musical background and derive the simplicity of ...well..whatever.

"""Annie"" is the original movie based on the highly successful Broadway musical, based on the highly popular comic strip character - little orphan Annie. I'm going to refrain from reiterating the story herein, because I have already reviewed the previously issued DVD. Herein, I am taking the opportunity to lambast Columbia Home Video.
TRANSFER: IT'S NOT WIDESCREEN. Enough said! You can't squeeze a 2:35:1 aspect ratio image into a 1:33:1 t.v. screen so you get what film buffs, such as myself, have been screaming about for years - a chopped up version of the movie (affectionately known as pan and scan)that in no way captures either the scope of the image or the director's original intent. This short coming alone leads me to fail this DVD on all accounts. That the cropped image is quite often blurry, at times hopelessly out of focus, and truly a weak transfer for its color balancing, contrast and black levels, is inexcusable. I'd really like to know why Columbia decided to re-release this movie on DVD. Certainly, no updates to the image quality have been made and worse still - the film is missing 50% of its picture. Misguided doesn't even begin to sum up Columbia's blunders on this disc. Also, the audio remains the same strident mix as before. No audio clean up or noise reduction leads to dialogue sounding way too forward and unnatural, while the songs screech, rather than sing, across your speakers.
EXTRAS: Some, but not enough to make you forget that ""Annie"" is just about the most miserable looking DVD experience you've seen in a long while.
BOTTOM LINE: To Columbia executives: get a clue! Get a 'really big' clue. To the consumer - save your money!",1.0

"Has Never Seen the Original Stage Version.  This movie is a preposterous mess and it flopped for one simple reason: it bears little to no resemblance to the brilliant Broadway production of the late seventies.  The musical is full of fun and life, but the people behind this movie decided to go for a more cinematic version which was much darker and could and probably frequently does scare young children.  We have here Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily actually succeeding in capturing Annie (which never originally happened).  We even see the young orphan hanging on to an upraised bridge for dear life (an eleven year old actually in deadly peril?! For shame!!!!)  The added characters (Punjab and the Asp) added nothing but stupidity to an already horrendous film.  How can anyone criticize the Disney film of a few years ago?  It is much closer to the stage version than this monstrosity (and it included one of the best songs cut from the theatrical release - N.Y.C.).  I find it fascinatingly questionable that a cast of this caliber could have been involved in this disaster.  Some of Broadway's legendary performers (Ms. Burnett, Ms. Peters, Ms. Reinkin) should definately have thought twice.  Perhaps they were anticipating a rebirth of the movie musical and went about it totally in the wrong way.  I am so glad that I was involved in a stage production of Annie as Rooster.  One has to wonder how involved Mr. Charnin and Mr. Stousse were in this venture.  I recall seeing only that it was based on their original stage musical (however loosely).",1.0

"This travesty ranks right up there with such notably disastrous stage to screen transfers such as A Chorus Line, Mame, Man of La Mancha, Hello Dolly, Camelot, South Pacific just to name a few.  The sad thing here is this could have been an extraordinary classic movie musical considering how wonderful the original stage version was.  It's as if the producers and director got together to purposely turn this into a cheap, ugly sideshow.  Nothing, absolutely nothing works.  The added songs are unbelievably bad, the choreography is appalling!  Did you notice the dance number in Warbucks house where you can see the girls underwear during some of the kicks? Shocking!  Bernadette Peters and Carol Burnett are rediculous due to bad writing and direction.  Aileen Quinn is about as likable as watching OJ Simpson on the golf course.  I remember when I saw this film in the theatres when it first came out and sitting there with my mouth open in disbelief.  What can you say about a director who takes the most popular song in the show and only uses it over the main title?  Thank God John Huston did not direct any other musicals!  I am not too keen on the Disney version either but it is far superior to this garbage. And it is on Blu Ray no less,  what a waste!",1.0
"Yes, I know there are people that love this movie, but they clearly did not see the Broadway version or hear the music from the cd with Andrea McArdle. This is an action paced movie and it probably appeals to those who like that kind of stuff, but for those of us who know something about music and are familiar with the original know that this is inferior. Read the bad reviews of this movie and that is what I think. Should have not left out some of the songs, should have not taken place 4th of July. I love Carol Burnett and she does do a good job in this, but a little too drunk. I think the writers overdid it. Don't rememberher being so much in the play. I wrote a review of the Disney version and it the Disney version is better than this mess, but not as good as the Broadway Version with Andrea McArdle. I haven't seen it, but I was in a local production with the Broadway version. They should have made Bernadette Peters a ditsy blonde in this, but she comes off too smart. They kept her ditsy in the Disney Version. I will have to say that the Disney Version should have not had a black love interest for Daddy Warbucks. I'm not trying to be racist but it just doesn't make sense for the Depression era to have a mixed relationship.  They should have gotten Rebecca Luker(Miriam the Librarian on Broadway and a friend of mine. She would have been perfect for Grace. Not too impressed with Ann Reinking in this version as Grace. At least Audra McDonald in the Disney version can sing the way it should be. Ann is more of a dancer. If you have never seen the Broadway version or heard the original or seen the Disney version you might like this, but it is inferior to the original. So save your money and buy the Disney version and buy the Andrea McArdle version on cd. Too bad that version is not on tape.",1.0
"What an AWFUL movie adaptation of such a fun, charming musical!  The film is so syrupy, it oozes along at 2 mph.  I loved the original musical & have the Broadway cast cd, I saw it on a 1979 National Tour, and in a 1987 DC-area production, I played Cecille the maid, a ""lovely Boylan  sister"" and Frances Perkins in The White House.  So I'm very familiar  with the original musical.
First big mistake:  John Huston as director.  BAD CHOICE.  A lot of good songs like ""We'd Like to Thank You,  Herbert Hoover,"" ""Annie"" & ""NYC"" were cut, and  their replacements like ""Sign,"" ""Let's Go To The  Movies"" & ""Dumb Dog"" are much worse!  This musical is  supposed to be set in December 1933.  It's The Depression folks.  So why  set it in a movie set that screams sunny, small-town California!  The  5000 or so orphans that climb out of the woodwork of the orphanage:  what  were they - finalists in the Kiddie Olympics?  Everybody is doing  difficult flips & huge leaps & tumbling.
Albert Finney was  miscast.  He could not sing in the movie musical ""Scrooge"" and he  cannot sing here.  I suppose that's a big reason why the songs Daddy leads  or solos like ""NYC"" or ""Something Was Missing"" were  deleted.  He looks & sounds VERY uncomfortable in the role.  Carol  Burnett does nothing with the Miss Hannigan role.  How original to play her  as constantly drunk & constantly vamping the men.  Tim Curry is  absolutely too creepy as Rooster.  Just a few years after playing the  bizarre cross-dresser Frank-N-Furter in ""The Rocky Horror Show,""  that's all you can think of when you see him in this (he can do better,  folks.  I saw him do a wonderful job as the lead in the musical ""Me  & My Girl"" on tour and he was NOT creepy there).
Bernadette  Peters once again plays a ditzy vamp here, which is pretty much the only  role she can  play, and it gets old.
A previous comment mentioned that  the orphan girls kept flashing their underwear.  Add to that the maids in  Warbucks' mansion flashing their slips, panties & garter belts in  ""I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here"" & ""We Got Annie"".  Ann Reinking is a better dancer than singer, songs were transposed to a  lower key to fit her husky alto, & the director gave a millionaire's  secretary implausible & gratuitous dance numbers to give her something  to do.
The movie has a goof somebody should have corrected:  if it's 1933, why are they showing the 1937 film ""Camille"" at Radio City Music Hall?  A great film choice for a 10-year old kid, too...
In the musical Annie is supposed to  be 11, but is always cast older to convey the street-smart grit needed for  the role.  Aileen Quinn was 10 when cast, and no matter how well she  tap-danced & sang for the audition, she was too young & naive in  the role to give Annie any real scrappiness or depth.  Her performance only  adds to the cloying sweetness.
In sum: a waste, a movie & soundtrack  to be avoided.  Instead, PLEASE buy or rent the 1999 Disney television  movie.  It is MILES better, much more faithful to the musical, better cast  & MUCH better directed!  Or even better, see a local production of the  original musical.  See what you are missing...",1.0
"This movie is probably more appropriate for older kids.  But my little one loves anything with Elmo, so we turned it on. She was very frightened by the darkness of it and the scary characters.",1.0
"Dear me! This movie is completely inappropriate for preschoolers.

In the few minutes of this movie:

1. Elmo loses his lovey-blanket [in a long traumatic scene where no less than 6 disasters happen to poor blankie]
2. then has to go down Oscar's trash can [graphics so frightening of this ""going down"" that they had to interrupt it with narrative]
3. then lands into scary grouch land [angry yelling everywhere] only to
4. have an evil villain (yes! They call him an EVIL villain!!) land in some spaceship contraption and make a huge fuss over stealing his blankie and taking it away to his evil hideout...

After that I don't know what happens because my 3.5-year-old [who loves Elmo and begged for this movie] was hiding under the pillows screaming ""Mommy, stop it! Turn it off!""  What were you thinking Sesame Street writers!?",1.0

"The movie is okay (really  not that great, the kid seems to think it's alright) but the video quality is absolutely terrible - this is easily the worst looking dvd I've ever purchased, like somebody fished a much-abused VHS copy from the dumpster behind a shuttering Blockbuster and then dubbed it in SLP and then converted that to dvd on their personal computer.

"This show is very dark for Sesame Street.  My 3 year old who is usually not disturbed by things very easily was very frightened by the villain who came and stole Elmo's ""blanket/lovey"" in a pretty aggressive way. My son was physically shaking and started to cry.  He now doesn't want to watch Sesame Street at all; not even the regular show.
After he calmed down, I tried to get him to watch again a little later in the film so he could get some resolution.  That was also a mistake because the comments were that if Elmo went to get his blanket he ""may never come home again"".
If you have a child under the age of 3 who is not cognitively aware of things or maybe over the age of 4 or 5 and rationally understands what is happening and isn't attached to their Lovey/blanket/transitional object your child may enjoy this film.  Otherwise, I would pass.",1.0

Save your nonsense for other things, Sesame Street, and tune into reality.  Teaching children gender is a ""point of view"" is not only a lie but a sinister way of destroying identity. Saying gender is a point of view is like saying the color of a zebra's stripes depend on your point of view.  Utterly ridiculous!",1.0

I did not know what the movie was about before I purchased it, but who can go wrong with Elmo right. NOT!  His age do not need to see things like that.  I feel that movies should keep things as innocent as possible for as long as possible, without all this good and evil.  Let innocence stay innocent, every child is not ready for this stage of learning yet and by right they should not have to be ready to be exposed to deception at such an early age, they will learn soon enough.",1.0

"The film shows the melancholy of that period. Charles Bronson's character is good with wrists, and thanks them he earn some dollars. He is honest, and considerate with his friends, especially a woman and a cat. Optimal performances are James Coburn's and Strother Martin's, too.

I like the open credit scenes, while the fine and suitable score. I point out also the rejoicing chorus, similar to Burt Lancaster in ""Elmer  Gantri.""

I forgot to pay attention to the format, and I was disappointed when I realized the widescreen images vanished after the open credits. An edition like this should not be done ever. I threw away my copy. Buy the widescreen edition when be available, not this. I rate only one star because of the full screen.",1.0

"I rented this for my 4 year old based on other Elmo videos he had enjoyed.  Bad move!  Other parents, beware!

This movie takes a main character aimed at 4 year olds and plunks him down in a script aimed squarely at 8 or 9 year olds, full of very scary situations and offensive language.  My son was frightened by many scenes, including ones where the villain stole Elmo's blanket, mocked him, locked him in a dark cave, etc., for what would have been almost an hour of scary, unfunny storyline if I hadn't fast-forwarded to the end.

I think the editors realized the issue, because they have Bert and Ernie as ""audience"" interrupt multiple times to say not to worry, that Elmo is going to be OK... which did not work at all with my son.

Very disappointing considering how wonderful the rest of the Sesame Street videos are.  I'd rate it minus stars if Amazon allowed.",1.0
"My Daughter may need therapy after viewing this hectic mess!  I am being facetious but, she is almost two years old and one of her first words was Elmo.  After seeing him mad, falling down, and yelling at his friends, we had to play an Elmo music DVD to ensure that he was OK.  I do not recommend this for young children, especially those who live in homes where chaos is not the norm.  She simply was not used to all the activity displayed here.  My Daughter is not timid - she is quite the opposite but, she would cry out Elmo's name at every scene that showed Elmo in a compromising situation, not knowing if he was upset or hurt. Actually, I'm not sure if this film is good for older children either, based on what I've seen.  0 stars.",1.0
"This video was purchased for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas by his Grandma.  She even bought a VHS version for her house so he could watch it at either place.  The sole reason she selected this video was because of the title character.  Yes, my son is a full fledged member of the ELMO fan club, like many children his age are.  We soon found out that Grandma wasted her money...BIG TIME.  The movie is a bit strange to say the least, and a little on the psychadelic side.  The most disturbing part is when the ""evil"" character arrives in Grouchland via helicopter.  This is when my son BEGS me to turn it off and says ""It scares me, mommy."" (while covering his ears)  It didn't take us long to figure out that this was not the video for him!!  It was heartbreaking when I saw the fear in his little face.  With the typical daredevil little boy personality, we were surprised at his reaction and both Grandma and I wished we had previewed the video before we let him watch it!",1.0
"My two year old son is an avid Elmo watcher.  He can't get enough of the furry red guy.  This movie seemed like a natural to add to our growing DVD children's collection.  That's why I was completely shocked that my son was ""traumatized"" by this story.  Elmo's blanket gets torn when he is reluctant to share with his friend.  This scene sent my son into hysterics.  Elmo's blankie happened to look exactly like my son's and we had to locate his blankie and make sure it was okay.  Once he was calmed down I continued the movie.  The following scene shows Elmo's blanket falling into Oscar's can and subsequently being sucked through a ""do not open"" door.  My normally outgoing, and well adjusted son broke into shrieks once again.  That's where we ended the movie.  My son has no attachment to a bottle or pacifier, but he loves his blankie.  The content of this movie may be too upsetting for a child with a similar love object.",1.0

Although I liked some performances (Joey Mazzarino as the bug,) and some songs (the STOMP - inspired song at the laundromat) the big picture was completely ignored in this video.

"Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the film that everyones seen a million times! The Knights of Ni! The Bridge Of Death!  Bring out your dead! The Camelot song! Castle Anthrax! Swamp Castle and Herbert and Luckys wedding! Coconuts! French soldiers in Britain (mind you own beeswax!)! The Black Knight! The Three-headed Knight! Insane animated bits! Tim the Enchanter! The RABBIT!!!! The intermissions organ music! Even the opening credits are brilliant!! Love the Anglo Amalgamated Bertram Ostrer film Dentist on the Job fake film starting it all off just to screw with our heads, heh heh Dreem toothpaste for me! Credits signed by Richard M Nixon. Reference to moose in credits! Flashing red and green!! Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. You cant expect to hold supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you. I mean, if I went round saying I was an emperor because some moistened bink had lobbed a scimitar at me, theyd put me away. King Arthurs sword fight the crappiest ever. We are now the Knights Who Say Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing!

Not many films have these many bonus features, so this review is more a review of those items than of the film itself  there are already several bonus features on the first disc (the two commentaries, etc), while the second disc is devoted to them.

The first disc has a very long and awesome animated opening, showing the king, the many-eyed monster, flags, opening vaults, angels, splitting clouds, angels flying, more clouds, and the Grail, of course. Scene selections with some animation and sound. Disc One says that it has extras, but its only a bit of animation, and the text to see the extras insert disc 2; no, into your DVD player. Yes whatever  Audio and subtitles, more animation, with the options of Screenplay: Read as you watch!, English, French, Spanish, For people who do not like the film (taken form Henry IV Pt. II, by William Shakespeare), and if you linger on the menu you hear a voice say get on with it!! In the audio, you get a few options, plus commentaries: Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, or John Cleese and Eric Idle and Michael Palin. Hmmm intriguing! Theres a follow the killer rabbit feature you can turn on or off, so that whenever the white rabbit appears on your screen press enter on your remote or click with your mouse and you will either see into the mind of Terry Gilliam or learn the financial secrets of the accountants version. Interesting and more on that later. Of course, what you actually get is a sketch of King Arthurs hand on his first riding into the scene, an accounting rabbit that shows how much the production crew paid for mud in the bring out your dead scene. Helmets and swords for the black knight fight scene cost 500. Sketches from witch-burning scene. Parsnip and string for witch-burning scene cost 0.22. Petty cash voucher for meals for extras (2 per person, 35 individuals). Camelot castle cutout plywood cost 40. Sketches for Terry Giliams God animation. Model cow for French castle, 19. Other animals, 9. Other sketches and photos. Wood for Trojan rabbit 50. Horse and rider for two hours, 5 per hour, to ride past historian. Springboarding monks sketch. Medieval maidens costumes rental. The madmans make-up. Snuck into Hampstead Heath to film the Lancelot attack wedding scene. Lunches for wedding guests and five pints of Kensington gore. Crone and her warts. Sketches for Roger the Shrubber scene. Crazy frozen land of Nador animation. Rental of stuffed rabbit, rental of rabbit puppet, cleaning blood off of cave. Memo to self: insure holy hand grenade. Rabbit cave and holy hand grenade scene sketches (on bloody rabbit icon). The Black Beast of Aaaaaaargggghhhh sketches. Bridge of Death sketches; invoice for Bridge of Death items. Sketches and shots of the final boat and castle scene. Invoice for shearing of putrid sheep and a bottle of whiskey (prop man). Invoice for 80 student lunches and sketches of final pikemen sequence. Hire of police light, 4.50.

The hard of hearing part reads out the menu itself (useless, no?). The King Henry IV Pt. II subtitles are probably not accurate, and roughly follow the action of the play. tis Gaultree Forest. Hanging on Hotspurs neck. I feel happy becomes Happy am I. Mention of Falstaff

Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones commentary  the American voice and the British voice  Terry Jones dressed as a woman (?), changing into his cow costume, Gilliam would change into womens clothing (the two don't seem to be in the same room at the same time); ast least thats the scene that they set, and well have to take their words for it. Fun with subtitles and titles the first time they showed it to audiences they couldn't believe it; the cheapskate opening captions also happened because theyd run out of money and needed to eat up time. By maintaining a very low production standard, you can get away with murder; its always dangerous when you try to make good proper films, and you cant really do these kind of jokes, says Gilliam, who by now has worked with large budgets. Costume and setting is 14th century, but Arthurian legends are told in the 14th century about the 10th century. In the opening castle scene youd find one of the busiest traffic spots in London, in Hamstead Heath, directly behind the camera, Terry Gilliam acts as Patsy. All castles in the film are Dune Castle, from different angles. They question the authenticity of having everyone filthy with missing teeth, etc. Lack of close-ups, filming too fast, too primitively, too ambitious to have too many gags in it. Watery tart scene written by all Monty Python members. Black Knight scene shot in Epping Forest. John Cleese (Black Knight) and Terry Gilliam (Green Knight) learned sword fighting for this scene. Took a week to shoot the scene, with no budget. The scene didn't work when edited, so they spliced in scenes of John/Black Knight not speaking and it was fine. Tried dubbing the Black Knight lines with other voices. In New York at the opening, the Vietnam war was on, people were anti-war, didn't find it funny. Hired a one-legged man to do the final leg of the Black Knight. The last leg goes off a puppet. First head-banging monk is Neil Innes. Always obsessed with monks and flagellation and self-abuse. The witch is played by Connie Booth, John Cleeses wife at the time. Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film is said to be Tom (actually, William) Palin. Neil Innes was the seventh Python. The photo of God was WG Grace, one of Britains most famous cricketers. John Belushi and Gilda Radner were at the New York opening and introduced themselves to Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones talks about putting the script together. Terry Gilliam talks about how Monty Python came together. At the BBC, once a show was green-lighted, the cast were left to their own devices. But after four episodes they were almost cancelled, because the execs didn't understand the weird humour, but by that time it was too late  critics and fans loved them! Terry Jones talks about horrendous meetings that they would have trying to decide what to call the troupe and their show. The Horses Spoon and a Basin, Owl Stretching Time, The Toad Elevating Moment, and they settled on Bun Whacket Buzzet Stubble and Boot. The BBC said No, this is stupid, you cant name it something like that. They had a working title Circus, Eric Idle suggested Gwen Dibbleys Flying Circus. Maybe our whole show should be like Terrys animations! Terry Gilliam is the blind soothsayer lunatic who cackles. The Knights who say Ni was always the funniest scene when they discussed and rehearsed it, but they had trouble filming it. George Harrison said that Monty Python were the spirit of the Beatles continuing, since they started the year the Beatles stopped. No ad-libbing, all scripted and rehearsed, so they could shoot quickly (later Eric Idle mentions that he ad-libbed one line into the Bring out your dead scene). Terry Gilliam talks about the difficulty of co-directing, having been a secluded animator, and how Terry Jones launched a re-think of knights roles in society from gentlemen to mercenaries, showing how castles had sealed interiors to protect the inhabitants from their knights (why would that be needed if knights were gentlemen and not scoundrels?). The Tim the Enchanter scene in a quarry in Scotland, great light and sky. The Bridge of Death scene was one of the first shot. Shortened the ending tremendously, moved on to the end, there was supposed to be more dream-like, floating stuff in the end.

Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin commentary. Shot in March and April. Opening titles got huge laughs at Cannes. There had been a bomb scare at the theatre, though, so the fire brigade stopped the film right after the opening credits, pulled out the audience, and then they went back in and watched it, the audience thought it was a gimmick. Llamas, moose, Nixon, fish of any kind  old Python favorites. Discussion of Michael Palins mud-eating, which is never used/seen, Palin lost it on the 14th take and beat the ground with his fists. Michael is a sweet-tempered man, but even he can be can be goaded to fury by directorial perfectionism. Says Cleese, There is a version of this story in which this outbreak of most unusual bad behaviour on his part  much supported, I have to say, by all the spectators  was in fact occasioned by his discovery of the fact that hed never been on camera at all. I only heard that version recently, I hope its true. One of the rare ad-libs in the movie. He hasn't got s*** all over him  definition of a king. Original film was a collection of sketches that only had Arthur in a few scenes, and even went into modern day, Harrods, and others. The natural world made the film look great. The original soundtrack was one of the first sacrifices of the 16 or so pre-release test screenings. Black Knight scene comes from a story Cleese had heard from 1957 of two roman wrestlers who had become so entwined that the victor died! Cleeses one-legged stand-in was named Richard Burton. The voice of God is also Graham Chapman, so when He is talking to Arthur its really Graham talking to Graham. Neil Innes is the porter whos crushed by the Trojan rabbit. The old historian is also the guy whos not completely dead yet in the Bring out your dead scene. Neil is brought in because none of the Pythons could sing. John Cleese didn't like this scene, he thought that it was too bitchy. Smoke, air of menace. Cleese thought that the Glasgow girls would have been sexier if they were London girls in the Castle Anthrax scene. Lots of snickering about the girls who were cast for this scene. Meta-comment  where the whole scene would comment on itself!! Restored many years later. King and Prince Herberts guards scene John Cleeses favorite scene, he says it twice. Wide shot only, no close-ups. Lancelot running towards Swamp Castle had to be re-shot, because it was blurry, they did it on Hampstead Heath as well. Look carefully, there are two peasants pulling Roger the Shrubbers cart. Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd were major investors early on. Animation after the Knights of Ni second scene introduced to move plot along more quickly. Cleese nearly blown off of the crag. Total cost of film: 229,000. Electric donkey bottom biters!! Idle: Gilliams visual sense is unbelievable. Cleese on the army: We recruited them for fees of about a banana-and-a-half each a week, and they turned up and were immensely helpful and fun and enthousiastic. Thank you, students of Sterling University!

Among the language options you can select to have the screenplay flash across the whole screen. Ironic!

Disc 2  nice animated menu, but nothing too sophisticated.

Singalong  Knghts Of The Round Table (1:25), Sir Robin (1:25) and Monks Chant (2:00), with insitructions on how to use the DVD box to self-flagellate.

Quest for the Holy Grail locations. For 46 minutes, with Terry Jones. Inconsistent with the dignity of the fabric of the castle, was the reason given for not being able to shoot in any Scottish castles, except for the one that they did use, which was in private hands. A lot of hanging around and leaning against the castle. With Julian Doyle, production manager (who was also the arresting officer). Lancelots attack castle. They buy the script at Dune castle souvenir stand, where they have coconuts hanging about the souvenir stand. Theyre told that about 70% of the visitors know the film, 50% come because of the film - some come in chain mail! Dune Castle also triples as Castle Anthrax. The worlds worst name for seductive castles. Budget was supposed to be 150,000. They re-do the lines One day, lad, all this will be yours. What, the curtains? The find the Cave of Kair Bannogh again, its gotten ominously silent. Talking to Hamish Macinnes, leader of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team. Michael Palin re-creates his catapult into the Gorge of Death. The island castle, Castle Aughhhhh, from the final scene of the film! Talked to the new owner (since 1965), with tales of knightly families losing it in drunken bets Find some local kids, put them onto camera to re-create the final charge scene with four kids! Even up to the arrest scene!! Organ outro music over credits. Directed by Julian Doyle!!

Sacred relics: Coconuts. Ministry of Coconuts gives information about coconuts for nearly three minutes! Gorilla gloves! Earmuffs, kneepads. Teaches how to knock them to sound like horse hooves. Japanese version, 8:30, which includes The French Castle, The Knights of Ni. One of the narrators is the voice actor who was the original Lupin Sansei!
BBC Film Night, Monty Python and the Holy Grail Location Report, 17:10. Alternate shots of the knights approaching castles on horseback, Terry Gilliam young and jubilant. John Cleese commenting on the directing. The jokes tend to be secondary to whether it looks good. Smoke in all shots, arty visual effects. How many laughs are there in the smoke? Flying cow. Eric Idle with fuzzy hair. A grail is a bird like a dodo with a very large beak, the grail is never found, its anticlimactic from the start Reading dialogue backwards Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Island, Chrysalis, Charisma, and Michael White the theater producer backed the film. The French taunters stand-in with non-French accents for the sake of filming (reading from script). Interviewer asks Graham Chapman how many poofters are there in it? Only one that Ive detected, but were not made for each other. Had trouble keeping track of who plays what, and whos left over. Scene of stage hands behind the fake castle wall throwing animals.

Old Rubbish shows nutty items, such as the Investors Preview of the film, old press releases and some visuals. Narrating a radio review of the film from May 1975.

Artefacts contains five film posters!!!

Photos contains a ton of behind-the-scenes items, such as the black knight scene  we get to see Cleese with his arm behind his back, and the mutilated Black Knight puppet, Terry Gilliam as the Green Knight, someone flying over the Bridge Of Death, 35 pics in total.

Trailers contains the original UK trailer, and the US 2001 re-release trailer. The UK trailer runs for three minutes, and is an audition for motion picture narration  in American English, in Scottish, in another Scottish goofy accent, and finally in Chinese!! Awesome scene of a castle cut-out toppling, just as King Arthur knights the mud peasant before killing him (out-take? Goofing around?). At the end, we see that its a Chinese restaurant ad!!! The US 2001 re-release trailer is the same thing, but a wee bit longer somehow and with nicer colours and sleek Now, for the first time on the wide screen cheesy stuff. Ha ha.

Unshot Footage shows Lego Knights (1:43 of the Camelot castle dancing scene, Were Knights Of The Round Table), Location Recce (In March of 1974 two first-time directors disappeared while looking for locations for their first feature film. In 2001 their footage was found in a garage in South London which may finally explain why there was so little money left to make the film itself), shows silly narration over stock footage from any old place, for 2:13) with Directors Commentaries, and Unused Ideas, consisting of 13 fascinating sketches  practically worth the price of admission here!!

"I purchased this in part to upgrade to Blu-ray from the dvd I already own and because it came with the Ultraviolet digital copy.  So far as I am aware it is relatively new to Blu-ray, and yet the slip of paper which has the redemption code for the Ultraviolet copy is already expired, and indeed does not work.  So if you were planning to purchase this at ALL based on it coming with a digital copy, you will not really be getting a digital copy.

"I had been told several times that this was a really good classic movie and finally found a copy of it. About midway thru I had the first urge ever during a movie to shut it off. It was literally that bad! But, I decided to push to the end. Big mistake! The movie just ends abruptly. Literally! The screen rips in the middle of a scene.

This movie is an absolutely travesty and wholly unfunny. I have not the slightest clue what people find funny about this. Maybe its the opiate of the masses. Maybe its one of those cult movies like the Ed Wood stuff that is so bad its funny, but this doesnt really put itself out that way and its fans seem to really be deluded into thinking its funny. It just plain isnt! At all.

If that wasn't bad enough the sound wasn't any good either and for good measure the DVD locked up on me but only
once!

I played the regular DVD right after watching the Blu Ray and without question the quality is MUCH better. The picture isn't anywhere near as grainy, the contrast is much better and the sound is better. I haven't been this disappointed over the tranfer of a Blu Ray Dvd since Die Hard.

Consequently, I am desperately tired of new editions coming out every twenty minutes, with minimal special features, hoping to wrest more money from people who went through college saying ""ni"", singing about spam and saying ""burma"" because we panicked.  This is the third packaging of this edition of the movie (and I believe fourth DVD release), and the rationale seems to be that there is a tie-in with the highly unnecessary ""Spamalot"" stage show.  I cannot fathom why this happens rather than there being, say, something NEW out of five funny men who are still not dead yet.  Come on, leave it alone and do something else.",1.0
"Without a doubt, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was so dull; it literally put me to sleep. Even the ending was lame. I don't understand why they even bothered making such a stupid movie in the first place.

I especially don't understand why so many people think this film is so fabulous. I mean, come on, guys, what's the overall point of the movie? What's the general theme?

"But I thought this movie only succeeded on being dumb and pointless. Hard to fathom considering that it's supposed to be an inspired and comedic take on King Arthur. I popped the dvd expecting a witty, satirical parody based on what some friends told me. What I got was time taken away from what I could've been doing. Like, wrapping my nuts around copper wiring and testing it's conductivity with a lightning rod. I tried to watch through the entire thing but had to stop halfway through and finish it some other time because when I wasn't bored out of my mind, I was constantly picking on the stupidity of it all. I will come out and say that SOME bits at the very beginning were pretty funny in a silly-ass kind of way (the coconuts and the socialist peasant). But I would have to say that the humor just isn't there for me the rest of the way. Some border on infantile while others border on what the hell did I just see. It was that awful. Maybe the reason people revere this movie so much is because they defer to the comedy troupe. Well, then I would have to say thay this is the wrong movie to revere. I haven't seen any other monty python movie but hey, if they're all on the same level as this one then I'm pretty sure I'm not missing much.",1.0
"Yes,we all know that the film itself is the ""Sgt. Pepper""of their career.( I say that with all affection ). We further know that the 2 Disc. Set is the best version ever released! ( Even if it doesn't have the full Japanese soundtrack like the original Critereon version...SHHH! )
So....why is it,that less than two years after the original 2 Disc. release,did THIS version get released? And why would you buy it?
The Discs. are EXACTLY the same.( Not to mention the original release 2 disc. set is STILL available.)
The Script Booklet? ( The original is still available,and WITH all the cool photos.)( And,not to mention,if you put the English captions on,it's the same as having the script book! )
The Film Cell? ( It's not even a unique image. It's the Knights at the Castle of Guy DeLombard,looking up at the French Taunter. )
The Pretty Black Box? ( It's not THAT pretty,and not as black as say,the cover of ""Smell the Glove"" )
Basically it's a tarted up rip-off aimed at unsuspecting Python fans! Buy the original 2 Disc. Set and save your money!",1.0
"Lame and predictable. Mind-numbingly boring. I can't even begin to explain how lame and corny this movie is.  Not funny AT ALL. Not one part.  If whiny british accents is your idea of comedy, then by all means.  Funniest movie of all time?  Jeff Shannon must be on some sort of PCP because the whole dialogue is extremely lame and pointless.  ""I'll ask you three questions.  What is your name?  What is your quest?  What is your favorite color?  (Next guy comes).  What is your name?  What is your favorite color?  What is the capital of Arcadia? (or some stupid name of a country)"".  Gee, who the hell didn't see that coming?  Hilarity ensues.  Not quite.  A flying rabbit biting people's heads off.  Next.  The communist peasant approaches and is grabbed.  Soon we hear him scream HELP IM BEING REPRESSED!  Perhaps they were planning on introducing the punchline in a later release.  The guy pretending to ride a horse with the guy behind him clapping bowls together maybe was clever the first time.  Actually it wasn't.  By the the 20th time they did it I was ready to kill myself.  I know you people are thinking  ""yeah well, you just didn't understand the spoof on the King arthur legend"".  Oh, I understood it alright.  Just because a parody makes sense doesn't mean that it is funny.
Knights that go ""Nee""?  Wow, that's clever.  I'm sure the creators of this movie were in a meeting thinking real hard about this one when the boss's son comes up with this cockbarf.  Let's have a scene where this group of idiotic knights scream ""NEE"" loudly and obnoxiously until the viewers brains are completely destroyed. This kind of humor is humor that you'll find in after-school TGIF sitcoms like Full House.  Who is going to laugh at garbage like this? I sure as hell won't which is promptly why I threw a boulder at my television and punched some guy sitting next to me.  I'd rather be shot in the face with projectile diarrhea then watch any parts of this movie again.  As you can see I've bashed this movie pretty good and although it is well deserved, I think it's pretty safe to say I'll be hit with a lot of non-helpful votes.  Good day to you all.",1.0

"This is an excellent movie, but the DVD edition is awful.  There are numerous defects in the DVD.  The worst problem is that subtitles appear even when they are turned off. I know that there are supposed to be subtitles during the credits as a joke--but I'm talking about ALL THROUGH THE FILM!! The company that released this movie is doing nothing to correct this problem--so steer clear.  I returned my copy and bought the older edition of the DVD on Ebay--It is a great movie when subtitles aren't popping up every few seconds!

This disc can experience the following problem: Captioning that appears on screen regardless of what you select in the subtitles option. This disc has RCE (Regional Coding Enhancement) which may be the culprit. There is a site that addresses the RCE issue but the corrections shown there do not fix this problem. This problem does not happen with all DVD players so it's a crap shoot as to whether or not it will play properly for you. I suggest you just buy TSNKE (Thou Shalt Not Kill Except) on DVD instead. (...)you can send the insert cover to the director and he will sign it for you!,1.0
Monty Python's Holy Grail is a great movie but the DVD problems take the fun out of watching. The subtitles cannot be turned off no matter how many times you go to the subtitle menu and turn them off. For this reason I recommend you do not buy this DVD until this problem is fixed. I feel I wasted my money. Why invest in DVDs if they have glitches? There are plenty of other Python DVDs to enjoy.,1.0
"There are many DVD players that have a problem with unwanted english subtitles appearing in this film. CTHE has taken the position that if you are willing to spend more money to send the defective DVD back to them, they will replace it ""sometime after Thanksgiving"". Given the large number of DVD players that this title has problems with I think it is blot on their reputation that CTHE is still distrubuting these defective discs.
There is an extensive discussion at the official Monty Python website (Pythonline.com) about this problem on their bulletin board.",1.0

(not to mention that in the actual scenes of the movie they used FOG everywhere they went as a scenic prop)...most of it is GRAINY as well..if they had made this with a different ""look"" it would of been much more enjoyable..but the color was saturated it was very bright & the whole thing looked DULL when putting up with the Fogginess (the grain isn't that annoying, but my god the fog is it makes it look so saturated & DULL...........as for the much critisized ""ending""= its not bad at all, it was an original & mean-spirited way to end the silly thing (& it showed that it wasn't taking itself too seriously)-..i sort of liked it....this is by no means the funniest movie ever made (not even close)>>>BUT it is funny on its own terms...& some funny scenes (which should of been carried out further & done better) keep it afloat & afterwards it just sort of lies there like a cheap, likable movie.....i did laugh out loud at the ""run away-run away"" scenes & the taunting frenchman,the Black knight,  the killer rabbit, & the part where they threw the cows & other animals at them off the castletop..& there were some other amusing scenes (Knights who say Nee was funny but has been way over-rated)...the animations were not funny (if they were intended to be)...there were lots of dumb misfired gags that bogged it down as well. ...overall it is a very OVER-RATED comedy thats very original & likable (although not always funny)..lots of things ruin it from being a great movie (which it could of been had it been done better)..i watched it a second time & i felt about the same about it..but it does give some good scenes & is well worth renting...(the other python movies are more amusing & better done IMO)..i wanted to love it, but its just been too Over-rated by all its ""fans"".its a fairly good movie....",1.0

"The moral of the film is that we should not strive for genetic improvement, because this would create jealousy, sadness, resentment, discrimination, etc for those were not as genetically gifted. This premise ignores the fact that drastic inequality already occurs in natural evolution, and has always been an element of all life. This film plays into currently popular egalitarian ideologies that try to ignore, eliminate, or camouflage this process, in a quest for a utopia where everyone can believe that they are more or less 'equal' to everyone else and there is nothing to offend anyone's fragile ego. But of course, this is the antithesis of evolution. So, in short, the premise, conception, and perspective of the movie are lame. I only made it through the first 30 minutes or so, and it was uninteresting and predictable. The main character's parents express some sort of Christian/naturalist faith in natural childbirth (playing to popular attitudes today), as if rolling the dice with your child's genetics is morally superior to using science to reduce their suffering throughout life from genetic defects, or allowing them to enjoy superior traits (who wouldn't want straight teeth? perfect eyesight? healthy bones? a strong immune system? a quick mind? excellent memory? a non-violent temperament? etc. ). The kid goes on whining about his older brother having all this good stuff while he has to wear glasses, etc. Though, again, you don't need eugenics for this dynamic to happen. Check out ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". I suppose one could say that Gattaca is a science fiction film for whiners. I would recommend going to read some Nietzsche instead. We all succeed through the advancement of even a few, especially if this advance is passed down genetically to future generations. Whiners/egalitarians would refuse this advancement to all future generations, so that they don't have to feel inferior and no one is offended. And the final message of the original - more or less, ""where would you be if only the genetically perfect were born?"" - this is a specious argument, since there are countless billions of potential people who have not been born throughout human history. Who is crying over these billions of unborn babies? (hmmm... many people against eugenics today might also support abortion. Go figure. Maybe the writers of the script were pro-life Christians?) Anyway, you, me, none of us would be here if more genetically advanced humans were being selected, but then again, those who would be here would live happier and healthier lives. And that is what evolution is all about.",1.0

"Why are there two different versions of this on Blu-Ray on Amazon, and what is the difference?

(Not counting the weird ""bilingual"" one in English/Esperanto.)

Here is one, already released - ASIN: B000HEVZ6W

New one, not out yet - ASIN: B00C6F60HE

Also, both Blu-Ray disks say they are in NTSC format.  I thought we left that behind when we transitioned to High Definition.  Shouldn't they both say 1080p or something similar?

"Hello audience...my beautiful readers. You trusted me through Suddenly Last Summer and you trusted me through Twilight. Now, I've got another for you. Oh but it's so much worse than both of them put together and mixed around. This is Gattaca. I mean the name should put you off immediately. Gattaca? Seriously? Is this a new pokemon figure...eww. Anyway, I had to watch this movie in class...I'd rather take a test. It's one of those modern movies that makes you really nervous and anxious even though you were having a perfectly carefree day before and would have continued that way if you weren't forced to be ""entertained."" You know what I mean--the dramatic music in every bloody scene...the huge, bare interiors of buildings with only shiny white walls and no furniture whatsoever...no, I take that back...maybe a simple metal chair in the middle. And then they have that close up on disgusting things like blood and needles. The characters, however glamorous themselves, can not save the movie due to the script. It reminds me of cardboard. My monotoned professor could write a more engaging script that was less predictable. Every thing is eeked out of proportion. There is never one relaxing moment. Even when the two love interests are strolling through this field of shiny futuristic I don't even know what's, and they  are ""connecting"" by having long, ""original"", and ""inspiring"" drawn out back and forths like (this is a rendition):
girl: I've got so many things wrong with me....""(long pause)
boy: ..no you don't...(another long pause)...no you don't...(looks up and squints into the sun, mouth slightly open, and turns to the girl moving his head at 1 cm per second looking more like he will kill her than love her)...no you don't..."" -fade out very slowly into next scene...All of this is bound together by unmelodious frantic tinkly themes that are always hinting that multiple homicides are about to be committed.

Alright, alright. I will now give you the plot overview because I know some mean person will say: ""you didn't even review it! Gosh! I'm going to give you a bad rating."" Well, here you are: So, there is this dude named...oh I forget but it's not important. He's a dude. That's all you have to know. He lives in this ""very realistic"" time that will ""most definitely"" be reality in twenty or so years when there is a class system based on genetics. This means if you have a heart defect, you are going to be a servant all your life basically while those who are physically and genetically perfect rule over you...having all the high positions etc. Wow...so inspiring. Sorry, I just hate science fiction. I find it tedious and just stupid. But, this is stupid on all levels. So the great drama of this tale is that our dude has a heart problem but dreams of going to space of course...and so he decides to pretend to be a healthy dude so he can go. (There are all these genetic tests in the building where he wants to work such as blood tests.) Anyway, to do this, he gets this other dude to give him his blood which he will use in place of his own and does all this stuff so that very little of his own DNA will be left there and painstakingly leaves the other dude's fingernails etc at work because this dude is valid. And of course, there is the intense drama that our dude will be found out. Bla bla. And through all of this intense stuff, there is the girl...the girl with the mystery. The chemistry between them is so intense, so relatable, so honest, and so real it's like...it's like...oh I know, you know when you go to the store really late at night and you think the store is completely deserted until you realize that there's this creepy guy there in the isle who is staring at you as you reach for the peanut butter and all you think in your head is: why the hell does it have to me? and how the hell can I get out of here alive? ....that's what it's like.
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my review! Please leave nice comments because I haven't said anything mean about you, now, have I? Cheers.",1.0
"Let me come right out and say it--I hated this movie.  Hated, hated, hated.  Okay, that might be a little too harsh.  After all, it's not as bad as genital herpes, swallowing cat piss, or watching a Michael Bay flick.  But as far as genius sci-fi goes, this is inferior, an imposter, an in-valid.

Gattaca does have an excellent premise, and has garnered quite a cult following.  Manipulating genetics to form the perfect human being is an intriguing concept.  Utilizing Science to eliminate birth defects and create a person less susceptible to diseases or illnesses is a possibility that many might consider justifiable.  On the other hand, tampering with nature is bound to have its repurcussions.

My main problem with this story is the fact it tries to pound one element into your head over and over again and never offers much of anything else.  A man born all-naturale wants to have the same priviledges as his genetic superiors.  For the first half, it worked admirably.  Then it started to get pretty dang stagnant.  Still it kept riding this one-trick pony till the cows came home.  Not sure what that means really, except I was annoyed and bored to freakin tears.

Ethan Hawke does a decent job.  But how many fingerprint id's, blood samples, and heart tests can a man fake?  Then they had his face plastered EVERYWHERE, and nobody could make the connection he was a murder suspect?  PLEASE!!!!  I don't care how blind your ego makes you, it is completely obvious!

Plus the differences between the valids &n in-valids were blown way outta proportion.  Granted, he shouldn't be able to run as fast or swim as far.  But he can't cross the freakin street?  This movie might be making a statement how ridiculous prejudices are, which does of course carry some merit.  But I felt this was way too heavy-handed.

And possibly one of the worst scenes I can recall off the top of my head--the party date with Uma.  She realizes he is a murder suspect and has been deceiving her, watches him beat down some cop, forces her to run off with him, and then they make love under a gorgeous starlit sky.  Atrocious!

Another thing I didn't care for--this had relatively few cool futuristic gadgets and gizmos.  The cars looked retro, but they made a cool humming sound as they sped past.  The cops didn't have any laser guns or sweet tracking devices.  Nobody had cell phones.  No teleportation tubes with dialethium crystals or electronic floatation devices?  Nothing really.  Bummer.

Anyway, I'm sorry.  I'm rambling.  But seriously, I don't put this anywhere close to the elite sci-fi masterpieces.  In fact, it is one of my least favorites of the genre.",1.0

Yes,I totally want to see Values And Fighting Crime as A Conspiracy to impose on civil liberties Please Hollywood you haven't it done before,and as mentioned there is a great Car Chase with A Chevy Vega,the film on the dvd was re-edited so alot of the chase isn't there,The Character's Trans-Am Is Great but did not get enough time despite a little more than the Corvette. Also,In The Seven-Ups Movie(1973),Roy Scheider 's Character(also then a Police officer) uses a Pontiac Ventura (looks like a Nova) So How Come in Blue Thunder we see another Pontiac? Yes they were popular in the 70s/80s courtesy of Smokey Films and even now but That to me seems the conspiracy was Roy a Pontiac Spokesmen? the dvd Snapcase that comes with my dvd also features a little booklet explaining how this Cliche of a Hollywood Movie came to be,the writers were disturbed by the fact Helicopters or a Helicopter(police) were flying over their home,Heaven Forbid Police Patrol the area,Of course originally they were picturing a Dystopian PoliceState movie(How Original.) and they came up with this even more Original of a Idea for a Movie,the final Product you see of Blue Thunder.

"The film Educating Rita is a comedy but making viewers laugh is not its only purpose. This film also tackles many serious subjects, like for example, alcoholism, the struggle to better oneself, the relationship between teacher and student, social class distinctions and disillusionment with one's life and work. Educating Rita is an adaptation of a stage play written by Willy Russell in 1980 and was directed in 1983 by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the film Shirley Valentine. The two main characters in this film are played by Michael Caine (Dr. Frank Bryant) and Julie Walters (Rita), who plays here the same character she had played before in a stage production of the play. The supporting actors include Michael Williams (Brian), Maureen Lipman (Trish), Jeananne Crowley (Julia), Malcolm Douglas (Denny), Godfrey Quigley (Rita's father) and Dearbhla Molloy (Elaine). Educating Rita is the story of a twenty-six year old working class woman (Rita) who, before having children, would like very much to learn about herself. In order to do that, she enrols in an Open University literature course. Assigned as her tutor is Bryant, an older literature professor who suffers from low self esteem and self-pity.
You do not need to be very literate or educated to understand this film and grasp its meaning, because it is primarily character-oriented, in what it focuses on the lives and experiences of its two main characters. Therefore, and at first sight, some people might even find it a bit boring, as the basic plot, outlined above, presents nothing out of the ordinary. Some background knowledge of English literature would be helpful though, although not necessary to the understanding of the main storyline. Due to the fact that the character played by Julie Walters decides to study literature, the film contains many references, made by various characters, to English writers and poets such as William Blake. For instance, there is a scene in the film, where Bryant, angry at Rita's attitude, shouts and asks her if she has changed her name to Charlotte, Emily, Anne or Virginia. This happens because Rita's real name is Susan but she had decided to be known as Rita in honour of a writer she admired called Rita Mae Brown. In this scene Rita tells Bryant that she no longer calls herself Rita, and one understands better the new names Bryant suggests if one has some knowledge of literature. The names mentioned are not random names but the first names of very important English writers that Rita had come to know in the course of her studies, which are Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bront and Virginia Woolf.
Educating Rita is set and filmed in Liverpool and much of the action takes place in Bryant's office at the University. Although this film is not very visually interesting or has any notable special effects, because it does not show us any fantastic worlds or out of the ordinary settings, much attention was given to the differentiation between the characters and locations of Rita's and the working class' world and the ones of Bryant's, fellow professors' and ""normal/day"" students' world. The places they move in, the way they speak (different accents) and the clothes they wear show us how different their cultural references, their views, their attitudes and lives are. For example, in one scene we see Bryant entertaining his friends at his house, where they are drinking wine and listening to classical music and Rita's family and friends, on the other hand, are drinking beer and singing popular songs in a pub. Because it serves to characterize these different worlds and conditions in life the scenery used plays an important role in understanding the characters' actions. The sets we see in Educating Rita achieve the aim of showing us the differences between the two main characters' worlds and this is well exemplified in the choice of their houses and their location. While Rita's initial house is a very simple one in a typical working class neighbourhood, Bryant's house is large, well furnished, has a garden and is situated in a middle class neighbourhood.
The filming is good and the flow of the story is not interrupted by technical flaws or bad photography. It is also important to talk about the music score. It works well with the film and a concern about choosing the right music for every moment is noticeable. For example, when we see Bryant for the first time, we hear calm music without a great variation of rhythm. On the other hand, when we see Rita also for the first time, loud and triumphant music emerges, making us pay attention to that character and think about the part she is going to play.
In Educating Rita we get to know Rita, a hairdresser, who decides to enrol at an Open University, to study literature and get an education. The tutor assigned to her is Dr. Frank Bryant, a depressed and often drunk university professor. Her husband, Denny, does not agree with this change in her life, and wishes her to be a simple hairdresser and housewife as she had been until then, and to have children like all the other working class women. Although Denny opposes her decision, she does not give up studying, because she is, and in her own words, ""trying to sing a better song"". Denny's growing opposition makes her one day have to choose between her husband and her education at University. She chooses education and leaves Denny. Because of this she has to find another place to live in and moves to Trish's house, an educated and emancipated woman, who also plays an important role in Rita's education, with her ideas and sophistication. Many changes occur in Rita's life, after starting to attend classes at university and being tutored by Bryant, who helps her to get an education. She develops from an unsophisticated and uneducated woman, who is embarrassed at talking with ""normal/day"" students and professors, to a well educated woman, who is no longer afraid of talking to other students and writes essays like them. Her clothing style and the way she speaks change and she leaves her job as a hairdresser to work as a waitress in a restaurant. Her tutor enjoys her navet and spontaneity, as she is so different from his other students, whose pretence of sophistication has dulled their enthusiasm. As Rita becomes more educated through Bryant's help, the educator also grows through his relationship with her. At one stage Bryant gets worried that the education he is giving her is going to change her entirely and that she will become like one of his other students, losing her spark for life and joy of learning. He likes her the way she is and is afraid of ""spoiling"" the beautiful person she is. He warns her about his fears but Rita does not give up on getting an education. Nothing stops her from doing her final exam, for which we see her prepare during the film. At the end of the film she is a changed woman, but is she a totally different Rita?
The film's script is quite good. It must have been a challenge to write the script for Educating Rita, as the original play it was based upon only featured the two main characters and the screenplay had to introduce in it (and at the right time) the characters that are only mentioned and do not actually play a part in the play. The screenplay tells us an interesting story, the dialogues are very witty and it makes us want to know what is going to happen next, how Rita is going to handle her ""education"" and how Bryant is going to react to Rita's development. Because, as said before, the film focuses mainly on the characters of Rita and Bryant and they occupy most of the film's action, they must perform well or the film will die. To my mind Caine and Walters play their parts very well and give us convincing performances. They also have great chemistry together. The other actors do a good job as well.
I think that this film is in some ways similar to other films that cover the topic of a person wanting to better herself/himself and a tutor/teacher who helps her/him doing that. One of these films is My fair lady, a film based on Pygmalion, a play by George Bernard Shaw, where a Professor (Henry Higgins played by Rex Harrison) teaches Eliza Doolittle (played by Audrey Hepburn), a poor florist, how to speak correctly and behave like an upper class lady. Educating Rita distinguishes itself from My fair lady and others of the genre not only because it is a more modern film, set in our times, but also because, among other things, Rita is the one who decides to get an education and she is never presented as a ""thing"" the tutor is going to mould at his will. What also distinguishes this film from others with a similar subject is its end. It is not the usual ""they live happily ever after"", but it ends with a choice made by Rita. Bryant wants Rita to go with him to Australia. Will she go? In my opinion the film and its plot add a different view of this topic to Cinema and make us think about the influence of education and the goals we set for ourselves in our life.
The director's main purpose in making this film must have been to make us think about our attitudes and how education opens new doors in our lives, how it allows us to have a choice",1.0
"The movie 'Educating Rita' is a film about a drunken professor, Frank, played by Michael Caine, who begins to tutor Rita, played by Julie Walters, who is a hairdresser from the lower class of society. Michael Caine wasn't acting very well, he always seemed tired and bored. Rita had a very annoying voice, so I couldn't sleep during the movie (good one!). Julie Walters didn't suit the role, she just didn't seem to enjoy it, as well as not being very good at it. I didn't like the ending, where Frank went to Australia. The best part was where Rita was arguing with Denny, who then went and burnt her books. I give it a 1/5 because I couldn't sleep during the movie",1.0
"The one-star IS NOT FOR THE MOVIE. I love the movie!!!! The one-star is for the rental price!  I am a proud and usually happy Amazon Prime member, and the number of movies available to watch are better than the previous movie app I had before.  However, quite a few of the movies of the type I love (historical and period movies, especially those made in the late '90's and 2000's) ARE NOT AMAZON PRIME. That was the case with ""The Age of Innocence"".  The movies which are NOT Prime tell you ""how to watch this"". That doesn't make any sense to me. It implies that if you ever rented the movie from Amazon in the deep dark past, you may be able to watch it for free.  I don't think, in my case, that that applies to many movies at all. I didn't have an iPad until 2011, so I mainly watched rented DVDs. SO, if I want to watch a Movie that IS NOT PRIME, I have to rent it. I'm not sure, but I think I had to rent this one for $3.99.  Once you start watching the rented movie, you can only have it for 48 hours. After 48 hours, it returns to movie land. However, you CAN RENT it, let it sit around in your device for months or years, and then watch it-IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY STARTED VIEWING IT. Please, Amazon, for the price I pay monthly for Prime and for ALL THE MONEY IVE SPENT ORDERING FROM AMAZON, I think you could give me a better deal on movies!  PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES PRIME ONES, GIVE US A LONGER RENTAL PERIOD FOR A LESSER PRICE, AND TREAT US BETTER. I also want to add that so many movies are in another language, with subtitles, particularly in the category of movies I like-historical, period pieces. There are plenty I would like to have watched, but reading subtitles and watching what's going on isn't my cup of tea. Well, that's a petty point.

"An overrated forgettable movie.

The novel by Wharton is already hard to read, as it is pure navelstaring by a rich woman trying to make her fellow rich people look ridiculous.

Most common people do not waste their life the way these bored upper class people do. Normal people are instead productive and take pride in that.

This movie is one longwinded pile of dialogues about trivia, without passion or any other emotion, certainly lacking the original humorous style (which was the sole redeeming aspect of Wharton's work).

Action you won;t find much here.

The characters are all unpleasant One would not want them as one's friends. They are either weaklings or moochers. No heroes here.

I love Edith Wharton and The Age of Innocence is one of my favorite books, but this movie is awful. It is a hokey, boring attempt at bringing Wharton's beautifully written, Pulitzer Prize winning novel to film. From the laughable love scenes between the Countess and Newland Archer to the annonymous narrator that cuts in with background information to the strange lighting effects that make you think there is something wrong with your TV, this movie butchers a classic and puts good actors to shame.

"This is a remake of the Asian film Ju-on and sadly, does not live up to the original at all.

I'm a horror buff of over 3 decades and to me, Ju-on was intense and genuinely scary. In fact, it is one of my all time favorites...

With this in mind, I found the remake very disappointing. It seemed that everything that made the original so chilling was either changed or omitted. The parts that were changed were done so with special effects that were, I suppose, to give the film a more polished look. For me, this only served to make the film predictable. This, along with changes made in the storyline (to make it more mainstream?) took so much away from what could have been (in my opinion) one of the scariest films in years.

The original, subtitled version is certainly in my top 10, if not top 5 scariest films.

1) It only gives you cheap scares, which aren't very scary, that does not have any lasting effect.

2) The story line sucks. It tries to draw the viewer in by making it into a tragic love story that isn't very well done.

3) There is very little character development.

4) It's VERY boring.

"America can't do nothing original they stole the idea off of the chinese great success in their movie (Ju-on).

Bill Pullman was grossly underutilized, albert scanty screen-time was written that way in the script for him.",1.0
"This movie is as pointless as two squirrels screwing in a wool sock.

First of all, it's not scary.  Neither the plot nor characters provide any real ""horror"".  In fact, Toy Story was slightly scarier than The Grudge.  Simply because there are a few shock scenes, in which the main device to shock is a sudden change from very quiet to very loud, does not make a horror movie.  What's more, it sure doesn't make a good horror movie.

Sarah Michelle Gellar gives a lifeless performance as the lead.  I suspect that for this abomination of acting she'll be lashed until she drops, never to receive a lead role again in which she doesn't show full frontal nudity.  The only way she'll be investigating any more deaths is in a Scooby Doo sequel.

Oh my!  There's a person in the attic.  Wow!  There's a mute, old woman.  Watch out!  There's a little Japanese kid meowing like a cat.  It's simply people walking from one dark room to the next, being confused by whatever nonsense could be imagined without rhyme or reason.

"For those of you who had read my review of THE FOG, the remake of the classic John Carpenter movie, you will not be surprised in knowing that I think this movie is the same tragic case of too much style and not enough reason. In all Horror movies or thrillers, as a director, or writer, you must succed in answering the 'Why?' of the movie. I'll admit that they did that partially but, I wanted more of a reason. This movie was your typical shockfest with no real reason or resolve. Even watching the movie in the theatre, with many people making noises, I knew that the movie was going to be bad. I walked out the last twenty minutes of the movie. I'm going to give everyone a piece of advice for the purposes of this movie: If you have to seriously wait for the movie to answer the why throughout the whole movie, don't see it.

True, some scary parts are scattered throughout but it's all for nothing and has no rhyme or reason. I'm surprised that this movie did so well in the box office. But, when you take a look at hollywood right now they have really been focusing on remakes and Japanese horror. And this is both. But, don't choose style over plot!

I've even heard that they're making a GRUDGE 2. God help them. My friend told me that JU-ON, which is the original, was much more satisfying with much more reason.

In short: The characters were flat, there were stupid characters just waltzing into a dark room not knowing what they were going to find, there are unexplained sightings of ghosts and things, the main character doesn't know what is going on and, quite frankly, doesn't hold your interest for too long.

Just my opinion. They could do better than this.",1.0

"The prefaces of reviewing the grudge will hopefully allay concerns of people who enjoyed this... movie and are just reading to compare notes. The preface is simply this, a movie has a beginning middle and an end. It has development and it moves, no matter how confined the actual settings are. If character development is not an issue (and it isn't generally in horror movies) then plot movement is vital. To be more specific it is vital to making a good horror movie.

The grudge does not move. It does not plod either, but patiently instead walks constantly in the same circle, slightly alternating steps on each cycle. In effect this is a director's filmmaking exercise, taking the same elements of horror repeatedly and putting them in different containers. The sounds - including a sort of a Bjork Medulla-ish, throatal, moaning as children often make to prove they have a sore throat, isn't especially effective. The shadows are a little better in framing the suspense, but the small japanese house used as a setting is too symetrical and neat to be frightening.

Being PG-13 there are no chills from gore or violence or shock, all action is cut away from at the last second to maximize the potential audience. Imagine the same effect as Aliens vs. Predator's rating minus the attractive face of Sanaa Lathan or laughably bad directing. So instead we are repeated to the same teases as AVP offered. All buildup, no payoff. No variety, no change of pace, and no characters with interesting enough personalities to break the mood.

Our 'story' begins (or more accurately our stage is set) in a Japanese hotel room. A sudden suicide leaves a woman widowed, her husband having thrown himself over their balcony with no explanation or warning. From there the premise as explained in the trailers is played out. When someone dies in extreme agony the curse stays and all who encounter it are cursed. That's all. There are no Poltegiest of Hellraiser type developments. All we have are a series of excuses to show off the next scare tactic approxamitely every 15-20 minutes.

The Plot-Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a Tokyo College student who caretakes for an elderly woman in a haunted house.

Where a little dead tokyo boy screeches noises and loves to take bubble baths in the tub and a angry mother drags herself around the house on her chest looking for her sons rubber duckie.

The Negatives-

This movie is not scary, who was scared from this movie???? whoever got scared from this movie deserves to be slapped like a pinata.

I can see people saying""OOOOOH that little naked boy scares me when he goes ""AHHHHHH"" OR ""that big black spider cloud thing coming down from the ceiling wow that was scary""

Yes World, this movie is a waste of time, It's another Terrorist attack from JAPAN and it's on our cinemas!!!!!

Yes it's true look it up.

-Sarah Michelle Gellar Can't Act!!!!

If she's not slaying vampires i don't want to see her in anything. She's stiff, shows no emotion and is horrible as a lead in a horror movie. Plus she has no horror movie experience Oh yeah she was in ""I know what you did last summer"" but she got killed off anyway. Thats Right, if you can't act, you must be killed off.

The Positives-Hahahahahahaha, it's sad when the best scene in a ""horror"" movie is sarah's makeout scene in the beginning, maybe if she had flashed a boob in this movie this could have gotten an extra star.

Conclusion-This movie is a laughing stock,The japanese directors figure""See, Americans like ringu, they will like grudge, Ha ha stupid americans, we make money off them, ha ha""

So I'm sitting through the film waiting for a really interresting, unique storyline explaining why these ""things"" are so pissed at the people who walk through their front door. Waiting, waiting, waiting... movie ends... Waiting, waiting, waiting... credits end, back to DVD menu.

Um... ok... So they're just mad for no reason???

I thought maybe there'd be more of an explanation in the DVD extras. There were, in the making of the movie, but I found myself thinking, ""Thank God I didn't go to this in the theater!"".

It lacks in the story department mostly. Sure, there ended up to be a reason as to why these creatures are haunting this seemingly oridinary house (they were killed without knowing why they were killed), but I got to thinking, ""Why aren't other ghosts in other movies and stories like this?""

It just was a sheer dissapointment. I am a major fan of horror, but mostly in horror games since I have yet to see a really good horror movie that makes me wet my pants and turn on all the lights in the house (except maybe Silence of the Lambs). So I was a little scared of my bed once I finished this movie, but that's about it, and I got over that quite quickly when I got really tired.

I suppose this movie might be worth seeing if you've seen very minimal horror movies and/or games. Then you might be scared (like I notice kid's get really scared by this movie). But if you're desensitized like me, it's not worth your time or your money.",1.0

"I am a horror movie enthuseast. I am (...) old and have seen more horror movies that anyone in my middle school. I've seen horror movies that range back to the oringial Frankinstien and Dracula up to this recent film ""The Grudge."" Out of the 100+ horror movies I have seen three have struck me as ""scary"" and this was not one of them.

1)The Shining
Why: Ingenious directing by Stanley Kubrick, and amazing acting from jack nicholson

2)My little eye
Why: The very clever use of webcams and sharp writing

3)Candyman
Why: One of the few ""mad slasher"" horror movies I've seen with and exeptionally smart plot (with the exception of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" and ""Psycho"")

The reason ""The Grudge"" is not scary is because it lacked all of the things that made the movies above scary. As I said with the Shining ""ingenious directing and acting"" and we all know Shara Michelle Geller is not the greatest of actors/actress and the way this was directed made it look low budget and like a student film. As for the writing, it's not sharp at all. Although you can understand the movie, it all made sense to me, but in the end, if you think about it, it's....well, pointless. And as far as psychological horror...it tries to be psychological by lacking gore, sex, and drugs, and while that is all well and good, taking a pointless killer movie and taking these out these things does not make it psychologically scary. Candyman was very gory, and it had drugs, and a little sex, but it was still scary. And the writer apparently thought he had a great idea by having a ghost with a grudge on someone, and by the time he's almost done with the script he remebers that he never gave this ghost a reason to kill people. So, he writes a random idea (say, a woman falling in love with another man, while she is married, for no apparent reason) and he hopes the viewer would not understand and just find the jump scenes scary. I guess he succededed with many people but not with me.

I guess I will never understand why my friends parents had to sleep with nightlights on after watching this movie...",1.0
"most people give Constentine 1 star (agreed its not that great a movie...but still) yet for some reason you people actually found something good in this piece of crap???

the only thing that made me jump about this movie was that i almost paid 8 bucks to go see this at the new theater in my town (thank god i got a free pass instead). Basically here is what you are paying for when you see The Grudge, cheap acting (not the worst but nothing that special, except for the dumbass kid and Sarah Michelle Gellar who cannot act to save her life), horrible incoherrent plot line that involves a story that is never fully explained or makes sense in the end, and another failed attempt of making a decent horror movie by hollywood.

it does start off in an interesting way, but quickly slows down and falls into a deep pit of retardation and psychologically traumetizing idiocy for the audiance. not only that but everything was predictable such as the boy appearing on the different levels as sarah's character passes on the elevator, sarah not leaving the house in the last seen (the golden rule of horror films, make something so insignificant and god damn stupid keep the main character in the path of danger just to drag another 5 minutes of 'terror' into the movie), and finding out the ghost (phantom, whatever the hell i still don't care) boy's father killed him and his mother at the end.....heres a big question for all you people, why the hell did that happen? just cause the mother was interested in another man? then where the hell is the mother and why do they kill people for no random reason?

please if you consider yourself a person that loves good films than avoid this, ignore all the 5 star reviews. i don't know any of these people personally so i won't say that they are retarded or stupid, but maybe they were high at the time or they got paid to say those things.

"The idea of a horror movie being so dull that it put me to sleep, and a restful sleep at that, really surprised me, as I like a lot of different film genres including horror and the variety of horror styles. I will try not to repeat what others have said, but essentially I expected better. If you like The Ring you will love The Grudge? What a lie. I did like The Ring, but I don't care much at all for The Grudge. If I was to give The Ring 4 or 5 stars, I could honestly give The Grudge not much more than 1 star.
A complete viewing of The Grudge later, did convey to me the basic concept and the essentials of the plot which were intriguing enough. I was left thinking what a great concept was in this movie, yet it was portrayed so lifelessly. The scares... Weren't.
Gellar's acting has been better. Pullman's wasn't so bad, but seemed merely workman-like. I think it did so well in the first week or so of initial release to theatres simply because the commercials and trailers were better than the movie they promoted. I do believe that I would likely appreciate much better the original(s) that The Grudge was based on.",1.0
Poor Sarah Michelle Gellar she had to suffer through the making of this terrible film. Lets see there is too much in common with the ring and I loved the ring but that is not a good thing. I mean they took the girl from the ring and made her look different and that was the villain. Don't waste your time on this one.,1.0
"The best thing I have ever seen Bill Pullman do was at the beginning of this uninspired yet marginally creepy film. It is worth owning just to watch Mr. Bill's first scene. He has owed us this ever since Mr. Wrong. Thank you Bill, thank you SOOOO much. It was only fair.

The rest of the movie is creepy in parts, but breaks its own rules more than once. Once you finally make sense of it, you will realize that it was only confusing because it broke its own set guidelines for what is happening. Even the writer made statements in the ""making of"" doc that contradict what happens in the final flashbacks. He says something about a certain someone ""not knowing why she was murdered"", but that particular person knows only too well why she is being attacked.

Leave it to Sam Raimi to cheapen and commercialize a legitimately original Japanese film, inject Hollywood mainstay actors who are known for being little more than cardboard cut-outs, and then supress the truly inspired film so that Americans won't ever see it. Shame on you, Samuel P. Raimi, and all others who are suppressing the True Art of film. The 20th century saw the creation of the film medium, the 21st century will see its destruction. That is, if those who love film don't do something about it. Films are not made to be REMADE, they are made to stand in their own right. What's next on the agenda? Remake Vertigo? Remake Raging Bull? Where does it end? Remake The Godfather? Citizen Kane? They'll do it. And people will pay to see it. (sigh)

"This is a very good case for NOT remaking classic Japanese films. Ju-on is the scariest film my Lao wife and I have ever seen. We watched the original in Japanese with English subtitles.

I said, ""lets just go, it was #1 in the theatre in it's first week of release."" Let me just say that roughly 10 minutes into the movie, she hit me in the arm, because I picked out a bad movie. I told her we could just leave and go to dinner. She said, ""maybe it will get better"" It didn't. Afterwards, when walking out of the theater, another couple was blabbing about how bad it was and we commiserated together and all 4 of us stated what a colossal waste of 2 hours it was.

"Last evening I had the major disappointment of viewing this so-called horror movie, and it was way more HORRIBLE than horror. The only ""scary"" part was some weird sound that came out of the ""ghosts"" mouth - sort of like a frog croaking. I was scared alright - scared that the sad actors playing the roles of the ghosts were perhaps in need of medical attention. The entire movie was a bore, had no real storyline that made any sense whatsoever, the acting was mediocre at best, and it was hard to follow. It seemed to go backwards in time and then forward, and in either tense, it was difficult to follow. Perhaps in Japan it was considered scary, and if so maybe in that culture scary would be some freak who kills his wife and kid when he discovers his wife has a schoolgirl crush on her teacher, and then the freak/coward hangs himself. The untimely death of the wife and child then causes them to become freaky ghosts- the wife, who is a contorsionist, slithering down stairs like a snake, croaks like a frog, with stringy hair and bloodshot eyes, and the son looking deathly pale except for black eyeliner around his eyes and instead of croaking, he screeches like a cat. It then appeared that the authorities (ie. police), knew about the weird goings-on in the ""haunted house"", so in that case, why not demolish it. It was a pathetic, ugly house in the first place, so seeing that murders took place in it, just knock it down and go on with life. Instead of being afraid of the odd ghosts, the rest of the cast who were supposed to be scared to death or near-death should have just had a good laugh into their croaking and screeching faces, and then maybe the ghosts would realize how ridiculous they were, and just go away. The ending left me feeling empty as I had no idea why the police and medical personel would allow Karen into a morgue to what? see her dead boyfriend on a slab ??? , and since that was the case, why leave her alone in the morgue after she just went through such a tramatic experience in the haunted ugly house ??? Oh and lo and behold, just who materializes behind her but old bloodshot eyes herself complete with that ""scary"" croak voice. I still don't know what the Grudge is, and maybe Ju-on means grudge in Japanese, even so, did the ghosts have a grudge on whoever entered their house??? Terrible, terrible movie that deserves ZERO stars !!! Please don't waste a dime on this waste of time !",1.0
"THE GRUDGE was predictable and trite with the scariest thing about this movie being Sarah Michelle Geller's acting.  The ghosts, as the movie progressed, took on an almost silly feel.  I half expected a bathroom scene with one of them jumping out of the toilet!

Add to all of the nonsense the fact that the viewer can never quite figure out what the ghost does to people.  Does it suck out all of your air? Does it eat part of your face off and leave you a wandering zombie? Does it breathe on you after a lunch of really strong garlic bread and onion rings? Or does it just have a really big frog in its throat and is frantically begging for someone to perform the Heimlich maneuver?

At least in THE RING the demon's doings were consistently evil. I can't wait for the satires and parodies on this one.  The filmmakers should have a total heyday!

"I really wish the current tend of remaking foreign horror movies would just end now. Sometimes you need to realize the movie was lacking in the first place. The Ring was horrible and the original was even worse. Darkness does not deserve to even have a rating. After watching The Grudge, that says it all. It was simply put..horrible. Most of todays current horror movies are geared towards young teenagers that are just now experiencing horror movies and in that case, they probably work. The other core audience are movie viewers whose favorite movies are movies dramas and comedies and decide to see a horror movie ""once in awhile"". Obviously the sight of some kid who pops up every 25 mins to make a funny sound will scare them. I just kept thinking it looked like something out of a Bill Cosby Puddin Pop commercial and the kid was hungry. Also, the kids were TOO similar to characters from The Ring. I find that much of the Japanese horror scene is starting to repeat itself. I recommend Audition or Living Hell for the true horror fanatic.

"I'm not sure why, but I had high expectations for this movie. It was extremely hyped up when it was released, and alot of people responded. However the movie failed to deliver. In an effort to maintain a PG-13 rating, the filmmakers and editors began a pattern early on. This pattern was fading to black everytime something exciting began to happen. In the beginning all that happens is a couple different people in different places get so scared that they become speechless. Some seem to have been scared to death. I actually just made the movie sound better than it is. It's not a good horror movie. You can't gather up a bunch of frightening images and call it a horror movie. I was very disappointed, I feel that most others might also be disappointed. In the DVD features there is a featurette called ""Under the Skin"", it talks about what makes us scared and why we like to be scared when we watch horror movies. It was kinda interesting, but this movie didn't arouse any fear under my skin.",1.0
"I wanted to like this movie. Especially after friends went to see it in the theater and claimed it was one of the scariest movies they'd seen in years. Wow - should be good. Think again. Turned out to be a joke of a horror film - an utter waste of time. Maybe the big screen, the dark theater, being at the late show at night, and perhaps the full moon and high tides had something to do with how they felt about ""The Grudge"". For me, this movie was slow, predictable, and down-right disappointing. I don't always need blood and guts in my HORROR movies, but sometimes it sure helps. Ask me what I think a classic scary/horror movie is and I'll respond with ""The Exercist"", ""Halloween"", ""Psycho"", ""Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""When A Stranger Calls"", ""Final Destination"", or any of the old classic Vincent Price films from 30-40 years ago. ""The Grudge"" being an (Asian) horror classic? Give me a break - this kind of innocent suspenseful horror is weak in my book. Watch this movie and tell me your horrified of the little white-faced kid with the shiney black balloon in his mouth. It just wasn't scary! To top it off, director Shimizu felt this movie was so good - he imported half a dozen American actors to make a 2nd (U.S.) version. The first version being ""Ju-on""... also a major disappointment. The two movies are 90% the same... with the exception of the American actors. The same house is used, as is the same sister's apartment, the care center, grocery store, elevator, not to mention script and plot. There is no soundtrack to speak of throughout the movie. The director relies on objects jumping in front of the screen at just the right time accompanied by screeching violins. Sarah ""Buffy"" Michelle Gellar (""Scooby Doo"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") continues her roll of choosing below average scripts. Bill Pullman (""While You Were Sleeping"", ""Casper"", ""Newsies"", ""Spy Games"", ""Independence Day"", ""Lake Placid"") on the other hand, is distinguished as a leading 2nd man... and I was disappointed at his role here (very little dialogue and screen time). A long and tedious 91 minutes to get through. I went in with many lofty expectations - and left with none.",1.0
"Are you kidding? This movie wasn't even worth the rental. It does move along rather slowly, not that movies that aren't face-paced aren't good, they are, but usually they have a better plot and characters involved. The storyline doesn't play out in chronological order, not that it matters.

The movie in a nutshell:

Bill Pullman jumps to his death in the beginning, reasons unknown as to why. Then the girl Yoko who is the old ladies caretaker comes upon the ghostlike boy and cat and she gets yanked into the attic. So now Sarah Michelle Gellar is a substitute for Yoko because the agency she works for thinks Yoko is sick because they can't get a hold of her. So Sarah goes to the house and does the cleaning routine and she hears a banging/meowing noise so she investigates and finds a taped up wall. She rips it open and there is the boy with his cat again. She leaves because the cat is growling at her and goes back to doing chores. Then the boy is at the top of the stairs and so on. So, Sarah goes back to check on the woman, and she is talking to someone. She goes into her room and sees her staring at something and asks her what and she replies ""I just want her to leave me alone"", then tucks her into bed. She looks up into the corner and sees this black shadow octopus looking thing and she sits in the corner with a look of fear in her face. The police come and investigate and find two corpses which were the married couple, the son of the old woman, and a human jaw. (They both die from the little ghost boy.) In the end it turns out that the little boys mother had a crush on Bill Pullman and he didn't know, and her husband killed her son and her in a jealous rage and then himself, and Bill Pullman came upon them and then he killed himself the next day.

What a waste of time.",1.0
"The Grudge plays exactly how a horror film should. An orchestrated series of incidents coupled with a protagonist who's trying to get to the bottom of things. Following the cult success of the much talked-about (but pretty lackluster) The Ring, this is another Japan-originated production which has made its way to Western shores. Does it keep afloat in the world of horror, or sink like its preceding overseas cousin? While it does have its scare attributes to contribute to its genre, The Grudge never allows its story to surpass its moments of terrifying fun, and it's a shame that the effectiveness of the so-called fun wears out almost too soon.

Although keenly reliant on story logic, the biggest problem isn't exactly a lack of horror elements or one-sided cliched characters, but that the plot progresses rather sluggishly behind a curtain of tried-and-true tactics. The truth behind the entire mystery is eventually uncovered, but a ridiculous amount of stereotypical `don't-open-that-door' type scenes overly dominates the movie, with one happening after another and another. While this sounds fitting for The Grudge, the sequence of events become all too predictable and repetitive to a point you know the film is trying to prepare more scares. The split-second frights are especially grating after the first several attempts and serve as cheap annoying distractions while its bizarre use of telling the story at different times makes an uneven mess. By the time it ends, it feels as though the movie has exhausted itself.

On the plus side, the characters aren't the usual you would find like most of the similar kind. Expect them to be well integrated into the movie's appropriate atmosphere. Also, the film does have its moments to have you bounce in your seat and feel uneasy, and may even perhaps provide a good laugh or two. If you have yet to see any of the previous Ju-On movies, then this remade version isn't a bad place to start. In a time when horror films seem to be waning down, The Grudge could rejuvenate your interest in them once more. But others should be forewarned, since it is a pretty forgettable film after one viewing. Creepy flicks tend to leave a lasting impression long after they end, but The Grudge isn't one of them. Although it may make you jump early on, don't expect to maintain that frightened feeling for long once that same door is repeatedly being opened, over and over.",1.0

"This Butterfly got me completely dissapointed when I watched on video some years ago. The only thing I really liked (and I mean really) was the orchestral sound. An open-air stage like Arena de Verona needs a bigger orchestra than usual and the sound of that big mass of sound was really well and carefully carried out by Maurizio Arena.
For the rest, the only thing I can say is that I don't understand how italian audiences have so little respect for Puccini and his masterwork, 'Butterfly'. Not only in this DVD recording, but also in the equally horrible 'Butterfly' in La Scala by Hayashi/Maazel, you have to deal with a noisy public and the feeling that no one is listening to the music. Nor I understand their satisfaction applauses at the end (did they really enjoy?).
Raina Kavaibanska can probably be a great soprano, despite her harsh tone, but always looks arrogant, unsensitive, overacted and disagreeable on stage. The only place I liked her was in a 'Trovatore' in a Domingo/Karajan production in Vienna, but in general she tends to act like an old-fashioned prima donna who wants to gain prominence everywhere. And that attitude is specially unfortunate in a role like Butterfly, so a delicate woman. It's really horrible to watch Kabaivanska behaving like a sergeant in Act I .
The other singers can do nothing to better it up, but in most cases they even don't seem to want to do it. Antinori has nothing of a romantic character and does his acting job plainly and unexpressively. Saccomani is also plain and dull.
I love this opera and do not want to watch it acted like this, so I ask to the other reviewers: Did you really think that a better 'Butterfly' couldn't be done when you gave it FIVE stars?

 do for football but even better and Orson Welles did the narration. This film was produced in 1979 and is hard to find but is one of the few films that includes
 Neil Armstrong being interviewed.  It is a MUST SEE!!!!!  The next film would be Ron Howard's ""In the Shadow of the Moon"". This too is an excellent documentary

"...read the reviews with interest - but frankly I was gutted to discover that Criterion have 'mutilated' this superb doc by messing with the original score/arrangements.
'Deep blue Day' by Brian Eno and intermittant musical inserts lasting only a view seconds (which previously transported the viewer away from the immediate scene with the Astronauts) have all been removed - the magic has been squeezed out of this classic piece of video/doc architecture by a company who have done the equivalent of a painting a moustache on a classic oil with a black felt tip pin!
Please cure my depression with some info on how I can get my hands on the original classic version on DVD or VHS? (unmutilated)!

"This film is only a must for the extremist Floyd/Farmer fan and collector; just to say,""I have it!"".  There was plenty of drug use, a fair amount of sexual play and an ex-Nazi. The problem is that none of that made  the movie interesting.  Almost all of the character scenes were plain  straight on shots.  Even the dramatic landscapes that comprise much of the  films setting seem muted by the lack of life and genuine emotion from the  actors. The Monkees TV show had better camera work.  The Floyd score is  heavily re-mixed well into the film as to make it still pretty neat but  unintelligible as published Floyd music.  Reminds me a bit of 'Liquid  Sky'.  It was probably a more interesting experience to make this movie  than it was watch it.",1.0

"The President is up for reelection and he gets caught in a sex scandal with a young girl. What to do? After a lot of talk among his staff, they rope in Hollywood people to create a completely phony war in Albania to distract public attention, using artificial media.

Sounds hokey? Well, yes. The movie refers to Reagan's military invasion of the island nation of Grenada shortly after a terrorist bomb killed hundreds of US troops stationed in Beirut, the claim being that Reagan was trying to distract the public from the troops being killed. Never mind that the Grenada invasion was real, and certainly did not distract the news media from the Beirut bombing. Also, even in the days when the Internet wasn't widely used, there's no way a completely fictional military action would not have been exposed shortly afterward.

But the movie does allow for that. They then use a convicted dangerous felon to play a soldier left behind in the supposed war, which would distract the public anew.

If you can believe that a completely fictional military action would be widely reported in the major news media and somebody not quickly reveal the hoax for what it is, this movie might be for you.",1.0

"Ok, so the acting was great from all involved, which of course is a star packed film. The script is carried by an interesting concept, one that posits American politics is all spin with very little truth. Very good. So why am I giving this one star? Because the film posits you can manufacture a fake hollywood produced war unbeknownst to the American public which would be fine except for a few nagging and distracting OBVIOUS questions:

Wouldn't the Albanians know they are not involved in a war?

Wouldn't their neighboring questions know?

Wouldn't the press, foreign and domestic, head straight to the borders to try and cover the war and refugee problems?

Wouldn't the Albanian government be so flummoxed they would openly go to the press and UN with scratched heads and say its all good and well to be declared an enemy of the US but there is no small nor large war going on in Albania? That they aren't being bombed, gassed nor shot at? That the people are farming and starving as usual?

Wouldn't the European nations and its media also know there is no war on their continent?  I mean after all the US is a NATO member.

What about US troops and Generals? Even if the generals are willing to lie would the actual troops know none of them were being deployed to Albania? Even if it was a Delta or some other such elite agency?

Not only does this film charge the American public with general stupidity, which one could argue to be true, but it also believes those watching the film are also.

So one star for the fact that there is a great cast wasting its time on a script with worse holes than Ridley's Prometheus.",1.0

"Clearly by the rating you have to be expecting some sort of negative positions on the film, and you'd be right.  Because in my opinion this film was trumped up to comedy gold, only to realize itself as nothing but a false laugh in the back of an empty theatre.  Yeah, I don't know what that sentence entirely means, but I do know that Wag the Dog lacked realism (except for the end, but assuming there's a chance you may actually watch this I figure I'll be nice enough not to spoil this.)

The plot centers around DeNiro, who is a political mind who is supposed to help control public opinion in the face of a presumably soon-to-be leaked sex scandal.  To spin his magic DeNiro teams up with a Hollywood producer, played by Dustin Hoffman, who plans on making this cover-up the masterpiece of his career.

Well, that's the story.  So now you know the basic beginning to what I believe is far from a masterpiece, as Wag the Dog lands much closer to a master flop.",1.0
"For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie.",1.0

"I've been disappointed by movies before.  At times I've felt as though I wasted my two hours and money.  But rarely do I feel absolutely disgusted and depressed from a film.  This counts as one of those times.  There's  no hero in this movie.  Not one person whose actions seem admirable, or at  least neutral.  These characters are simply out to betray the populace and  the office of the Presidency for the sake of one mans' campaign.  Primary Colors had a similar theme, but it succeeded where Wag the Dog  failed.  It presented a full view of the President in question, and that  man had some strong redeeming qualities.  Also, Primary Colors had it's  fair share of characters who were appalled at the President's behavior.  In  Wag the Dog, no main character seems to have the slightest dought about  their campaign of deceit.  Meanwhile, they're easily able to invent a war  and pull the wool over the public's eyes.  I understand that, as a comedy,  the audience isn't expected to accept the characters as role models.  Nevertheless, I was unable to suspend disbelief in the plot, and I was left  feeling hollow inside from the lack of any character to identify with.",1.0

"Booooooring nothingness!  While watching this film I felt just like when watching a tv-weekday-afternoon soap opera: I kept wanting to reach inside my set and shake the characters and scream ""Get a life!""
Ok, so this is not high-action.  No plot twists, no ""surprises""  (I had recently seen ""Howards End"" and was delighted to see how the characters all ultimately intermingled).  That's ok.  But ""The Winter Guest"" presents the mundane as art.  Almost in a perverse, mocking kind of way-- daring me to notice that the emperor is, in fact, wearing no clothes.  Like when someone takes common household items and displays them in an art gallery.
Yes, beautiful scenery: starkness of winter, the black-and-white cinematographic equivalent of ANdrew Wyeth's painting.
But the characters were a bunch of atrabilious, disgruntled, dyspeptic, meddling, scowling, harping, belligerent quidnuncs.  It's like they ALL got up on the wrong side of the bed or something, and were egging each other on, trying verbally to start a fight!  Note: THis conclusion reached from only about 50% of the dialogue; the other half I could not understand because of the way heavy Scottish accent... hmmm, maybe I missed the good half, and would have written a more favorable review had I been able to understand more of what they said.
In my defense, I do tend to appreciate the depiction of the seamy side of life more than most.  I do not need ""pretty"" or ""exciting"" to consider a film valuable.  But this film was downright vapid.  Furthermore, the characters were unlikable, their dialogue hard-to-understand and edgy, and their interactions Soap-opera-style melodramatic.",1.0

The fact that Hollywood used them to represent to bring the message of the salvation of Christ showed me that they did not know what they were talking about since the Mormons believe that Christ and Satan are brothers and do not represent the bible but they represent the Book of Mormon. They did quote some scripture correctly but the dream of the pearl was just way too out there for me. I threw the movie in the trash. When Christ enters your life you will have peace that you are sealed with his redemption and he does change you from the inside out.

"This movie obviously was not intended for actual followers of the faith. I got this movie believing it would be a Christian inspired movie & that I would be able to enjoy it with my family. I did not realize that I would have to forward through the first half of the movie. At first,I thought it was miss-labeled or some sort of parody making fun of Christians who believe in the Rapture.

 I saw the R rating label, but I believed that was because the movie might have a little more kick that might offend some more conservative or younger viewers. The labeling was deceiving & not explicit enough. There was full blown nudity & depraved sexual acts. For a moment, before fast forwarding through *multiple scenes* of sex acts, I felt like I was watching a Porno Flick!!

Yes, this movie talks about Christianity & one woman's struggle & journey, but most of the Christians in this movie are Robotic or Cultish. They are not portrayed in a very positive light. Anyone who is truly a devout believer & follower of Christ and knows the true word of God may feel offended by this film. On the other-hand; if you are not, you may be encouraged to watch & you just may love this film.

This film sends out conflicting & mixed signals!! Not only is the Rapture part totally off, but the mixed signals tells people at first we are going to get you filled up with all forms of lust from these sexually explicit orgy scenes, then you can sit back & listen & watch how you can become a Confused,Conflicted & Kooky Christian!!",1.0

Perhaps Amazon was not aware of this, but this is a huge misrepresentation. I did not expect to purchase a sexually explicit and sexually bizarre movie.

If I wanted to purchase a sexually explicit movie, I would have purchased one, however, I resent being tricked into purchasing one because the title is Christian in nature.  Besides this, the movie is totally depressing after you get past the trashy sex part.  What a piece of garbage! Little to nothing to do with the Rapture as a Christian knows it.

I fast-forwarded past the extremely EXPLICIT sexual scenes to see if it got any better...not in my opinion.  As is so common these days, the ""Christian"" aspect was portrayed more like a cult of whacko's (reminiscent of Heaven's Gate cult minus the spaceships) hanging out, waiting for Christ's rapture of His believers.  I should have boxed it up and returned it but I was so appalled that I had a ""knee-jerk"" reaction and snapped the disc into pieces and threw it in the trash so it wouldn't be viewed by anyone I know.

"Just caught the movie this week on SyFY channel. I was expecting a monster movie. Because it starred David Duchovny, I kept waiting for the trick ending. In the end, I felt tricked

The movie sets up Christians as simpletons worshipping a cruel god who will not take his heel off your neck until you say you love him. The heroine refuses to 'say uncle' and gets zapped as a reward

It is a grim movie used to play out the various arguments against the existence of the god of the Christians. If your God loves us, why does He let good people die horrible deaths etc. Assumption: if your God loves us, He owes us

The film uses the most literal interpretation of I Thessalonian: 16-17 (For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord) which is called 'the rapture' by many Christians.

The usage 'rapture' is derived from 'rapiemur' in St Jerome's latin Vulgate translation of verse 17 : ""deinde nos qui vivimus qui relinquimur simul rapiemur c*um illis in nubibus obviam Domino in aera et sic semper cu*m Domino erimus""

'rapiemur', is a form of the verb 'rapio' - snatch, seize, carry off

Since Americans in particular understand 'rapture' to imply ecstasy and joy, the use of 'rapture' to explain various apocalyptic explanations of Thessalonians, Joel etc gives Bible bashers a weapon to make their arguments about an unjust god, and the fools who believe in him. Some rapture, suckers

The physical interpretation of some end times doctrine/dogma in the film is well done and has a shocking effect. When the trump sounds, literally, it is haunting, and the horsemen of the apocalypse are intense. The director created some powerful images with the lesser animation capabilities of the era. The specter of death has that effect

As propaganda it is heavy handed but should give satisfaction to the ones who have a need to see their beliefs reinforced by a fantasy.

Myself, I felt I wasted a lot of time watching Duchovny, expecting any minute a trick ending, some space aliens, or at least a few mutants",1.0
"What a disappointment. Hoping to see a stimulating, thought provoking, and meaningful film I sat there and viewed the most illogical, poorly directed and nonsensical film of my life. While the subject matter and story line have the potential to succeed, the actual implementation of this project falls short in all areas. If on the path of salvation, or contemplating a mad dash before Armageddon, stay away from this enterprise as it may very well lead you further from the elusive blue light than you hoped.",1.0

One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  First one that's ever gone straight to the trash.,1.0
"There isn't much to save this movie. People are upset with its portrayal of a born-again Christian, but the hard, sad truth is, MANY people are like this. They live empty, shallow lives, get bored, turn around, preach to everybody, fall by the wayside, and wind up disillusioned with their new-found faith. And they wind up worse than before. Very typical.

People call this a slap in the face of Christianity, due to its portrayal of a believer, but really, it hurls the slap in the direction of people who don't believe as Christians do. It is annoying. Annoying, also, is the boy's constant referral of the final book of the New Testament as ""the book of Revelations."" If you actually LOOK at the text, you'll see it's just called ""Revelation."" No ""S."" This irks me. A genuine sign of lack of comprehension, is adding a final ""S"" to titles that are written in the singular. I see it all the time. As I do here.
And the writer of the film says War is the First Horseman. Actually, the leading horse is white, a false peace, leading up to war.

But the general message of this film is, only a few of the billions of people on Earth will wind up in Paradise. God, in His infinite wisdom, keeps pumping more and more people into a corrupt, over-crowded world, hoping one day he might get it right, creating the same flawed beings over and over, but turning his back on them when they stumble.

A disturbing thing in this film is, I believe, a very realistic depiction of the psychological abuse the youngsters experience at the hands of the pious. The born-again's roots are not deep enough to take hold, as per the parable in the Gospel, and the innocent pay. The psychobabble of the mother talking about God taking them, the mother and daughter, up to Heaven, to be with the husband, who is the girl's father, and being left to look like fools when it doesn't happen, which has ALWAYS been the case with stories of the Second Coming, are, of course, what are expected to happen here. The woman looked like Linus Van Pelt, in his annual camp-out in the pumpkin patch, awaiting the ""Great Pumpkin."" This has happened many, many times in the real world, and it leaves people with egg on their face every time.

I think my biggest problem with this film is, it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak. The doubters are seen as cynical, and the believers are seen as a secret society, and the main character is a bit of a loose cannon, who looks for God, can't find Him, suffers disappointment after disappointment, committing illegal, immoral acts along the way, and finally being taken to the gate of Heaven, just for God to say ""Nah, I don't think so,""  and leave her in the ""Outer Darkness"" to look in from the outside, forever.

It's a propaganda film, and a bad one, at that.

A little post-script, many weeks after writing this review: I would like to know what's so ""not helpful"" about the above review. I tell in it why I didn't like the movie. Maybe because I have criticized ""Christians"" as being pious and lacking in reading and comprehension skills?",1.0

"I think I would be offering a valuable public service if I would announce to all of you that this movie is a bigoted, narrow minded slurr against Christians and the Bible (i.e. the message is that all people of faith are mentaly ill and brainwashed maniacs) This movie mocks God, Christ, and people who profess to have faith in the Bible. It makes all people of faith to be nothing more than silly idiots who are insane and cannot have rational normal thoughts or actions. I saw no redeeming value in the twisted, biased, and comic-book parody of end-time Biblical prophecy. Do not be misled by the title of this film. This movie contains perverted sex scenes, nudity, and violence. If this movie had stereotyped any other group or class of people as it has done Christians it would be banned and the people who made it forced to make an apology. It's TRASH!!!",1.0

"Although this movie does have some intriguing points and does a good job of bringing up age old scepticism,it inadequatly depicts Christianity by demonizing religon and lionizing the proud and rebelious. Mimi Rogers who plays Sharon does a few things that make me wonder why so many people would feel sorry for her. First of all(and I blame this largely on Hollywood)when Sharon decides to turn a new leaf and try to better herself AKA not sleeping around in promiscuous group sex,she instantly goes to a 180 extreme by rigid rules and preaching to others instead of knowing God,loving God,treating herself and others with reaspect and trying to lead a decent life. Hollywood always makes this statement that you're either extremely pious or you indulge in every kind of sin;no inbetween,how unoriginal and closeminded.
Secondly,she kills her daughter one day before the rapture not because God told her to,but because of her own lack of faith. All she had to do was wait ONE DAY!That in itself shows her selfishness and how shallow her soul is.
Lastly,near the end of the movie,when she is sooo angry with God(
why I don't know,God did not order her to kill her daughter)
she has the chance to be reunited with her daughter in Heaven if she would just accept God and His commandments. Naturally being the idiot that she is,she refuses. If any human is that proud and that self-absorbed then they don't deserve to be in Paradise.
I really like Mimi Rogers,but this script was so sterotypical and biased that it would turn away anyone who was considering a religous life.",1.0
THIS MOVIE I SAW WHEN I 1ST CAME TO CHRIST AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES THIS MOVIE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE LISTED AS A CHRISTIAN MOVIE!

"Without even the camp awfulness of bad sci-fi or the risible portentiousness of the Cecil B DeMill epics, The Rapture is a strong contender for the title of worst film ever made.  The acting is third rate (you can practically see the actors trying to stifle yawns as they lurch mechanically through the wooden script), the concept trite beyond belief, and the conclusion almost (but, sadly, not quite) comic.  Anyone with an IQ greater than their hat size is unlikely to enjoy this film.  It is, in short, Christian schlock as only Hollywood can make it.  The tedium of the religious content comes from the total lack of imagination with which it is treated.  Whereas an atheist can find something of artistic interest in Goethe's Faust, even a born again type is unlikely to find much to write home about in this terrible story of a woman who moves from one shallow life (a ""sex addict"") to another (a ""born again""), who loses her husband and then feels compelled by her god to shoot her daughter (wasn't there something in the Christian philosophy about not killing?  I guess that got lost somewhere along the way).  Just when the film presents the (slender) possibility that a critique of religious extremism and emotional pain might be on offer, the film lurches to a conclusion in which the end of the world arrives (but not soon enough to spare us from this film!) and the protagonist's narrow little world of gods and heavens is revealed to be (of course) true after all.  This film is a complete waste of time all around, without a single redeeming feature.  There should be a negative rating available, for this bathetic (sic) effort deserves a minus-5.",1.0

"Dumb. Seriously dumb. Even if you make allowances for it being some 70 years old, it's still a dumb movie.

Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard play David and Ann Smith, who have been married three or four years, and are very much in love. Then a county clerk shows up and explains that due to a hard to believe technicality, they aren't really married. Of course they really are, due to the common law marriage rule. And David is a lawyer, so they both know that is the case. Still they go through this absurd farce of doubting whether they want to get married again. Having more money than sense, they are able to prance around in expensive restaurants with other people (his law partner for her; a cheap floozy supplied by a guy in his club for him), upset parents and other relatives, and behave like a couple of spoiled brats. But then, we knew they were spoiled brats from the opening scene, so I guess the audience deserves what it gets.

"This is a strange one. An Alfred Hitchcock movie that is absolutely anonymous. In fact, Hitchcock made a couple of forays outside the thriller genre and both were very poor. ""Under Capricorn"" is a kitchen sink, tear-jerker and ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" is, ostensibly, a screwball comedy. The problem is Hitchcock doesn't understand the screwball format and the pace is slow and the jokes unfunny. Montgomery is badly miscast as the obnoxious husband, and his asides and grimaces make it seem like he has a bad case of constipation. Lombard is, as always, good, but she can't do much with this material. Did I mention that the screenplay is also extremely poor? The thing just doesn't hold together. On the one hand, Montgomery is so stupid he doesn't mention the fact of the illegal marriage to Lombard until it's too late (we never learn the reason for his reticence). On the other hand, Lombard who has been desperately waiting for Montgomery to tell her about the unofficial marriage (though she already knows)then becomes completely unforgiving of someone we have previously been led to believe she loves deeply.

A farrago of nonsense. Just don't go there!",1.0
"I ordered the Signature Collection, and was anticipating the arrival, for I wanted to watch most of the movies that I had not seen. I received the package, opened it, and instead had received ""The Evil Dead, Ultimate Edition"", a DVD that is not even Alfred Hitchcock. I called Amazon about my problem, and then they proceeded to put me on hold time after time as they looked into it. It turns out that the DVD I received is tagged by Amazon as ""The Alfred Hitchcock collection"". They admitted to me after 10 minutes that they were aware of this, and would arrange for return shipment...my problem is:
1. They only cared about getting their mislabled DVD back..it would entail time and effort on my part to package it, drive to a dropoff point (my gas), and get it back to them. For all my effort, they would be happy to reimburse me for the cost of the original order (nothing for my additional time and efforts)
2. They never even cared about my getting the product I originally ordered, only the return shipment
3. When I asked to speak to management on two phone calls, each time they would put me on hold for minutes, and would never come back.
4. I strongly recommend that you buy this elsewhere, else you will go through the same headache that I have
5. I have purchased thousands of dollars of merchandise through Amazon, so I am not bashing them out of spite...this instance has only opened my eyes as to how customer unfriendly they are when things go wrong! For, in this case, the customer always comes LAST!
6. I challenge you to find a customer service number as you log onto the website...why can't you find it easily...its because they don't want to deal with you!

"Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors of all time and probably my personal favorite.  I have found genius in every movie he has ever done, except for this one.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith creates characters that come across more evil than misunderstood with the exception of Mr. Smith.  He is misunderstood and his life is turned upside down over it, so you do feel for him.  However, the other two main characters in the movie, Mrs. Smith and his best friend, are the type of people you don't want in your life.  Unfortunately for Mr. Smith, these are the two most important people in his life, two people that selfishly drop him like a bad habit for their own selfish motives.  Mrs. Smith is never even in love with the friend, yet she is willing to marry him. Had Mrs. Smith been made an antagonist, I probably could have loved this film. Instead we are to hope for her happiness as well.

I am also a big fan of Angelina Jolie, so when I heard about a remake of a Hitchcock classic I had never seen, I was excited.  I held off watching this one til I saw the new Jolie/Pitt version, which made no difference as they were nothing alike.  The new movie was an extremely enjoyable film.  It was meant to be sexy, fun, and absurd, and it worked on all three levels.  Hitchcock's movie worked on none of these levels.  And I have found more comedy in most of his suspense movies.  It also lacked the sarcastic element of The Trouble With Harry, which could have made this a far better movie.  And it lacked a couple that you rooted for in the end like most great romance comedies.  If there was a comedic or romantic element to get here, I guess I didn't get it.",1.0

"This movie shot right to the top of my WORST EVER list.  It was atrocious, boring, and has nothing to recommend it. Pullman not only was a disaster in  the acting department but as a director he should be shot.  I could only  hear one in five words in outdoor scenes, but I just had to watch it right  to the bitter end, as I could not believe how bad it was.
The plot  shifted around like a dogs hind leg, right when you thought there was going  to be some action - fade to black - new scene with absolutely no  explanation.  It was an agonising experience, one I do not intend to  repeat.  I just cannot believe how amateurish this production was and all I  could recommend about it was the scenery of hills, dales, trees and more  trees which were far more interesting than the wooden performances by all  concerned.  Lane struggled valiantly but she must be desperate for money to  accept this role (personally I'd rather beg in the street) than be  associated with such a poor production.

Criterion continues to push the envelope -- the limit of how much people are willing to pay for what are frequently sub standard prints and transfers of classic films.

"TERRIBLE picture quality. Quit watching after five minutes. Looks like a copy of a very fuzzy, washed-out VHS or Beta tape.

"I just visited Medicine Bow where I bought a copy of the book and read it. As some have said the movie skips along and there is not enough time to do justice to the book. Worse yet, in many cases there was time to do a scene just like the book, and it would have been better, but they chose to do something different. I like Bill Pullman but he just doesn't come off as the tall black haired gorgeous Virginian. Diane Lane does a good job as Molly. Too many liberties were taken and huge parts of the book are missing, including one of the main characters..

"This movie had such promise, such potential.  In the first half hour, we see John Goodman, James Gandolfini, and Donald Sutherland: not actors you'd expect to find in a film whose basic premise, as it slowly -- ever so slowly -- unfolds, is a goofy little morality play about the Devil working havoc on Earth.  Supposedly, evil can be transferred from person to person by mere touch, as if it were some virulent form of leprosy.  While this seems innocuous enough at the outset, it rapidly becomes hopelessly banal.  Oooh, Azazel is the demon's name!

It surprised me in one way, however.  We live in a culture that is largely secular and decreasingly Christian; yet Fallen is designed to appeal to people whose catechism in based in 19th Century theology.

By the end, it became clear what a miserable concoction this really is.  Goodman, Gandolfini, and Sutherland have nothing more than cameo roles.  Denzel Washington does his best with a story that falls apart after the first half hour, but even his talents can't save a hopeless retread like Fallen.",1.0

I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my rating,1.0
"Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.

I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.

But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.

By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....

The script is idiot from page one.

The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.

But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.

Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.

Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.

Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????

Want more?

In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???

In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).

First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive.

Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.

We have none of that here.

Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.

Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.

But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under ""The story ends bad"" label. Without any depth.

Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.

What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the ""this is an open-ending"" kind of talk!

Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel?

Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: ""Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!""

Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great.",1.0
"A good friend of mine told me this movie was really good and talked me into watching it with him. Let's just say we're no longer good friends.

"Hey, I've got a great idea! How about, you go back and watch the Twin Peaks series, and then after watching that series, you completely rip it off and make a movie you claim as a ""original"". Fallen has fallen into the plagarism trap and tries to pass itself off as being it's own. If you go back and watch the Twin Peaks series you will find that Fallen is nothing more than an inferior [imitation] of perhaps the greatest television show of all time.
From the general plotline all the way down to the details, the cat at the end of Fallen is a complete [copy-cat] of the owls in Twin Peaks. Go back, watch it, it's all there.
Fallen has the cabin in the mountains much like the rural setting to Twin Peaks and even the last shot of the movie is a verbatum replay of the exact same shot at the end of Episode 16 of Twin Peaks.
Trying not to give too much of either away both revolve around ""carriers"" going after the main character, who is in both, you guessed it, just happened to be police officers.
The one difference is the poor quality of this Twin Peaks remake. It is nothing more than a b-rated [imitation] with A-list actors going along for the ride.
Both main characters even sang for crying out loud! Twin Peaks must be rolling over in it's grave right now thanks to this harsh injustice it has been served.
I could write for hours but to save me the disgust and you the boredom I will end this review by stating...WATCH TWIN PEAKS! Throw Fallen in the garbage and watch the original.",1.0
"How can a movie made in that hip city of Philadelphia not have at least a little something going for it?

""Ah, but then, there's Demi Moore!""
Maybe. Are you sure it's her? If it's really Moore doing the high kicks and back bends around the porn-pole, then she's a much better dancer than an actress. It's conceivable that the whole sordid boring mess was created specifically for Ms Moore to show off her silicon, which she does abundantly, but hey, were your eyes focused on her face consistently enough to be sure it was indeed HER silicon? Would it matter whose silicon gets revealed? I mean, jell is jell! I suspect that Ms Moore's ladylike enunciation and prim manners wouldn't win her the camaraderie of the other pole-polishers backstage either.

"obsesses with sex, which gets tedious quickly unless you are also obsessed with sex (I'm not).",1.0
"After the problems with the Hrabal text in I served the King of England (see my review), Kundera suffers a similar fate. Lets start with quoting the beginning of the Wikipedia review, which sets the scene as follows:  ""The Unbearable Light-ness of Being is a 1988 American film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Milan Kundera, published in 1984. Director Philip Kaufman and screenplay writer Jean-Claude Carrire show Czechoslovak artistic and intellectual life during the Prague Spring of the Communist period, before the Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, and detail the moral-political effects and personal consequences upon a bohemian mnage  trois: a medical doctor and his two women.""

This is definitely not the Kundera of his many books, and Jean-Claude Carrire, else an excellent script writer with/for eg Buuel's last six films or so, must have gotten too much under Kaufman's thumb or not have given a damn once he saw where things were going, but must certainly have been paid well. What we more generally have is a money no problem fashion product by a fashion director with international staff. The Czechoslovak atmosphere of 1968 caught by a film-crazy, unrealistically brave youngster (some would call her dumb and stupid), and while most locations would be authentic, the film has nothing Czech about it. It could have been anywhere, mostly New York, the revolt probably in Chile.

I have not found any review of the film by Kundera himself, but knowing his work, I would expect that his comments were not kind. After a positive (but rather shallow and uneducated, very American) first review in the Criterion Collection by Michael Sragow (1/11/1999), twelve years down the line, Mark Lova (31/1/2011), in a very clear analysis, sums up the arguments ""It's a good question: Why care what Kundera says? I did assume that some people would care. I think if you want to do more than be a consumer of art, if you think that movies and books are not just things you use once and then throw away, you should care too. Obviously, you might like the book, and not care about the film, or you might like the film, not the book. (etc.) However, if you care about the book, you might at least wonder what Kundera was complaining about.""

Where does that leave me? As I have expressed elsewhere at some stage, I do not like falsifications, and Kaufman's film to me clearly falls into that category. If you already refer to the author and title of the original book, you should show more respect - or is it simply skill (as opposed to money)?

""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.

It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.

When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a ""must see/ will change your life"" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times).

"""The Unbearable Boredom of Watching.""  That's what this movie should have been titled.  It is a long, relentless, punishingly dull movie following the lives of three people intertwined by a common relationship with each other.  Two of them, Tomas and his mistress, Sabina, are talented yet shallow hedonists who seem to have no interest in pursuing anything greater or more meaningful than sexual gratification.  Tomas' young wife, Tereza, is a sad, pathetic, naive woman who is devoted to her husband despite her knowledge of his ongoing affair with Sabina.  The story takes place in the 1960's era of Communist oppression in Czechoslovakia.

After spending about 3 hours watching this movie, one comes away struggling to find some meaning in it all.  There were opportunities to make an interesting movie -- the tension between the women who share a common lover, the impact of Communist oppression on the lives of Tomas and his wife are but two examples -- but the writers and director chose an incredibly boring and meaningless path instead.  There are several episodes of gratuitous sex, nudity, and a lengthy homoerotic scene between Sabina and Tereza that add nothing to the meaning, quality, or entertainment of this movie.

I can really find no reason to recommend this movie.  If you are looking for a love story or a fascinating tale about interesting people and their lives, you will be sorely disappointed.

This movie is all about style *as* substance, it's very shallow  and I imagine enjoyable only if you're willing to accept this type of movie  as shallow entertainment and nothing more. It's not a shoot-em-up action  movie, but it's about as deep as one and you probably need to be in that  mind-set to like it. Personally I like my dramas a little bit deeper. I  guess this is a good movie to point to as proof you dig deep movies or  something, as this is accepted as a deep movie, but I'm telling you, it's  about as deep as spilt milk.",1.0
"I thought about rating this movie a 2 but I know that it will haunt me for the rest of my life. I seen this movie and every time I look at it, it hurt my freakin eyes.  The movie takes place mostly in a psychiatric hospital and poor helpless teens are being terrorized by Freddy.  But does it really matter?  Because you don't care for the characters in the first place.  Good let them die. The sooner they die, the sooner this movie is over.  The plot had no freakin point.  And the actors might as well been on drugz thru out the movie.  But I must admit, the director must have some talent for making this movie as bad as it was.  Almost as bad as ""The Blair Witch Project""  Do you got something to say about what I wrote?  And I know you do.  Please write to me at:  omicron_30@yahoo.com",1.0

"This movie has very few laughs in it (maybe one of two).  Apart from a few attempts at lame jokes or cheap slapstick that simply aren't funny, it's a huge miss on the comedy front.  Most movies of this ilk are silly, but they contain multiple laughs.  To me, it was like they weren't even trying all that hard to be all that funny with any original material or new jokes.

On the other hand, it's a fairly decent retelling of the Dracula story.  Not great, mind you, but passable.

Brooks' problem is that he can't be allowed to work alone.  He has to have someone to contain him, someone like Gene Wilder did with ""YF.""

I expectd a ""High Anxiety"" tour de force from Harvey Korman and the perfect timing and deadpan delivery of Naked Gun from Nielson. Instead I saw two great professionals struggeling desperately with third rate material. I'm sorry that there is no way to give zero stars.

"This is the second of John Ford and John Wayne's cavalry trilogy (Fort Apache and Rio Grande are the other two). The yellow ribbon in the title refers to a tradition that the girls would wear a yellow ribbon to indicate that they were faithful to a lover in the cavalry. But the girl in the story manages to get three men to each believe the ribbon is for him. Neat trick, the little hussy!

Anyway, John Wayne plays an officer who is one week away from retirement as the movie opens. He was actually pretty young at the time, but the makeup people did such a credible job that he really looks like he really did look when he got old -- except, as I recall, he was heavier than in this movie.

The movie opens with a narrator who says ""Custer is dead."" This was the news of the day, and the Indians are teaming up, all the different tribes -- at least the young warriors -- to fight the white man, because the buffalo came back as Custer died, so they figured it was a sign from the Great Spirit. You know, when these religious fanatics take a notion . . .

Anyway, the thing is a pretty typical cavalry versus Indians, with Wayne taking time out to talk to an old friend, one of the chiefs, who explains that he cannot control the young bucks because they don't listen to him anymore, since they got this sign from the Great Spirit. Nevertheless, Wayne and his soldiers (in the last hour or so of his command) stampede the Indian's horses right through their village and so make it impossible for them to make war.

Frankly, I don't believe it. I love John Wayne, but this was a very boring movie.",1.0
"Update (Sept, 2010)

The more Westerns and more John Waynes I watch, the less I like this movie. Other than the famous director and lead actor, and nice surroundings, this movie has nothing. No story, no charactor, no plot, just nothing.

For good John Wayne, I like Stagecoach, Red River, Fort Apache, Comancheros. I do not like the Searchers, North to Alaska, True Grit.

----------------------------------

What is a western movie? You need actions and fast pace. You do not get any from this movie. There is not much plot. The pace is very slow. The old man is near retiring and it is very boring. The girl theme (Olivia Dandridge) is not entertaining. There is not much to say, just not a fan of it at all. Really boring.

It is no comparison to High Noon, Hombre, Man of the West. For Indian Western, Broken Arrow is much better. Even the Searchers is better than this.

"Ya know, I hated this film the day it hit the theaters, and after viewing it again last night I still hate it.  This is a part 4 in a series, and when films hit Part 4, things are usually rather stale.  It's possible to make a decent 2 and 3, but by the time you get to 3, people pretty much know what to expect, so you'd better do something unique to make it good.  Nightmare 3 managed to do this, though good as it was, things were starting to feel a bit been there/done that at that point.  Plus, Freddy's demise at the end of 3 was believable and was the most final of all his other ""deaths"".  If they hadn't have tacked on that last scene to keep the sequel door open, 3 would have been a wonderful place to end the series and have it go out with a bang.  However, the power of the dollar is even stronger than Freddy on his best day, and soon we got part 4.  Part 4 definitely has that feeling of a film done just for the sake of doing a sequel.  Sure, they upped the budget and gave it more visual razzle dazzle, but the low budget of the first film played a huge role in how effective the movie was.  Nightmare On Elm Street's low budget helped it immensely, it didn't hurt it.  The big budget on 4 hurts it bigtime, coz that's all it has going for it.  We get all the cliched scenes of the heroine creeping around the dilapidated Freddy house, the jumproping girls, all the stuff we loved about the earlier films, yet this time around it's zero scary and downright tiresome.  You know something's wrong when you can't get Patricia Arquette to reprise her role and replace her with probably the worst actress the series has ever seen.  Second, Renny Harlin directed this-Nuff said.  All kinds of new cornball rules and twists are added to the Freddy mythos, and it's stuff a middleschool kid would find lame.  For no concrete reason, Freddy returns and terrorizes Kristin, the heroine of the previous film.  Once she's out of the way(to both Freddy's and the viewer's delight), Freddy sets his sights on a whole new slate of kids which he gets to through redhead Alice, who has inherited Kristin's dream powers.  Sound dumb yet?  Basically Alice fills in the Kristin shoes by figuring out how to fight Freddy while her annoying teenage buddies drop off like flies.  Like I said, it's more of the same ol, same ol, but without any kind of thrill to it.  How many times do we have to see Freddy pull off his sweater to reveal the chest full of souls?  I will admit however , that the girl being turned into an insect was rather cool, and kinda disturbing.  Now I realize that when a series goes on for awhile that the boogeyman ceases to be as scary as he used to coz we're all kinda used to him, but c'mon, man!  Don't turn the guy into a joke for crying out loud!  Hell, I love the Friday the 13th sequels, but those were silly from the moment Jason popped into the picture, so it's fine that they remained silly.  Nightmare on the other hand is a series that started off legitimately creepy and turned lame as it went on.  What they should have done is just stop at 3.  I know the money people would have rather died than do that, but that's what they should have done.",1.0

"After the fantastic third chapter DREAM WARRIORS I expected an even
beter follow up in this fourth film. When I left the theatre in August of 1988
I was crushed.  NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 THE DREAM MASTER is an
incoherent, nonsensical mess. A real dissaster. Let me reitterate A PIECE OF
CRAP!!!!!. The movie has no plot at all, just a bunch of effects sequences linked together by nonsense. Freddy returns, despite his ""HOLY BANISHMENT"" in
part3, with no explanation at all. Lead warrior Kristen Parker is not only a
different actress but comes across like a whole other character. New heroine
Alice takes on the personalities and skills of her friends whom Freddy has killed. HUH!!!
 Freddy seems to have almost God-like powers this time out and
is able to transform one character into a tiny insect. Heck, if he can do that than I wonder how anyone can even hope to defeat him.  None of this is ever explained.
 Characters resite a ""dream master"" ryme that is awful and makes no sense at all.  I won't even try to explain the climax because I still haven't figured it out myself. Something about ""Freddy can't look at his own reflection or the souls of his victims will rip him apart from inside."" HuH!??!!??
This was the most financially seccessful Elm Street film, but that is because of the big openning it had.  When all the fans like me who loved the third movie laid down five (this was 1988) bucks to see what would happen next and walked out wishing we hadn't.  A real stinker that totally insults Freddy fans.
  If you enjoyed this movie than allow me to recommend..
 HIGHLANDER 2 ,  ROBOCOP 2,  SUPERMAN 4: THE QUEST FOR PEACE,
 JAWS: THE REVENGE,  MORTAL COMBAT: ANNIHILATION ,
 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION
 KING KONG LIVES,  CAPTAIN AMERICA (1989), the American GODZILLA (1998)
 or THE ALLNIGHTER
To all of you fans who were offended by this review. Let me just say that in 1988 I was absolutely in love with the Freddy series. I really TRIED to like this one. I found it hard to. The people I saw it with didn't like it. My friends hated it , and the kids I talked to in my high school didn't like it either. In fact I cant think of one person I talked to at the time who did like it. So, In my own  defence, I don't believe I am alone in my opinions about part 4. Like I said, I tried to like it and I WANT to like it. after all its Freddy, my hero from my youth, but its just such a mess. I know from the letters written the front of Fangoria in '88 that alot of people did/do like part 4. But then I remember that alot of people like dope, alchohol abuse, self mutilation, child molestation and crack cocaine",1.0

They all pretty much got what they deserved from beginning to end, and you were actually glad to see the main character losing everything.

It's not like he was the man stealing bread to feed his family.  Johnny Depp is a great actor, but I wonder how many of these horrible roles he's going to take on.  Even with his charm, I could not bring myself to 1) like George as a character, or 2) like the movie.  The story was pretty standard, something I've seen a dozen times before... only not as good.  All you have to do nowadays is have a thin story, a nice soundtrack with old songs to reminisce by, and to set the time period, and a couple of montages, and your done.  Oh, I hear Cream, then it must be the 60s!  Wait, is that Wham?  Must be the 80's!  I suggest ""Goodfellas"" if you want to see a good movie on the criminal lifestyle.  Blow is a retread of better movies... though some might call that an homage.  Yea, right, an homage... that's what Blow wanted to be.

Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.

Nor does it have anything else.  ""Interactive Menus"" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.

I must say that this film wasn't worth seeing it. The story was about nothing, there wasn't any interesting plot.
I admit there was one or two funny scene (for example when the two couple telephoned to each other or the pistol duel) but the rest there were long and boring without any humour.

I was tired of all of the low moral standards of modern movies, so decided to go back in time and watch some old ones, expecting a little more discretion.

The wife just up and leaves her husband with some random guy she just met for absolutely NO REASON. It was really, really sad. So then you see him invite both of them to the house to try and win her back. I didn't watch beyond that because I was so horrified by it all, so I don't know if it ever got resolved.

"Sick & Stupid Score: 7/8*

Infidelity is funny?  Not.  And neither is this movie.  The marketing positions it as a classic ""screwball"" comedy but it hardly comes up to that standard.  If you laugh once or twice during the whole movie, you will probably be laughing at some disparaging remark made by someone sitting next to you.

Employing the liberal theory of marriage that any bad behavior can be justified if a couple can talk about it openly and endlessly, this movie comes to the conclusion that infidelity is no big deal and no reason for divorce.  If you think snappy chitchat is a good substitute for intelligent dialog, you might find the script interesting.  Chitchat is what Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr do best; whereas, Robert Mitchum comes off like a talking fence post.  Jean Simmons is just ditzy, and no one is sure why she is even in the movie, including herself, judging by her acting.  Note, also, all of these actors are on the downside of their careers.

Avoid this so-called comedy.  It is and was an un-funny flop.
__________________________________________________________________________
* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.",1.0

The audio is plagued with balancing  problems with dialog so soft in some scenes that you can't hear it.  Surround effects are poorly done.  Even the soundtrack doesn't sound very  good, and this is a digital medium that is superior to CD!
This DVD is  abysmal!  I can't believe anyone could have watched this and thought it was  a good product.  The studio should be ashamed!  Do not do what I did and  ignore these reviews: trust me, no matter how much you love Highlander, you  will hate the DVD version!

That said, I found this Blu-ray disc to be profoundly disappointing. The ""HD"" quality of image reproduction vacillates between 2 completely undesirable extremes. The rendering of at least half of the movie is so grainy that to compare it to streaming a youtube video over a dial-up connection would still leave it wanting. At other times, the resolution is so crisp that the scar make-up on the Kurgan looks about as convincing as fake vomit from a strip mall novelty shop.

"Watch this for its value as a pop culture classic, but be aware that it is mysogynistic and homophobic, with an awkward, lurching plot, underwhelming action scenes, and exceptionally visible suspension wires.

One other female character: the prostitute who shows up at the antagonist's hotel room for the purpose of using ""kinky"" as a codeword for evil.

You may find yourself asking questions like, ""why is that man doing backflips when walking would clearly suffice in this situation?"" ""Why isn't that woman calling the police, for whom she works?"" ""Why is there crime scene tape but nobody guarding the crime scene?"" ""Why aren't they arresting that man for assaulting an officer?""

"To begin with, Neil Diamond could never sing. He has always ""talked"" his songs, he doesn't sing. Even on simply-constructed rock tunes, he has a totally grating, unmusical voice, no breath control, and the sense of rhythm of a polka dancer. Now, put him in a movie called ""The Jazz Singer,"" and what you get is something akin to casting Fatty Arbuckle as Errol Flynn. Diamond is a product of the commercial Brill Building, a heavily promoted performer of marginal talent. His acting is atrocious---laughable in fact. He has made an entire career out of the same three chord song structures and a voice that resembles the sound of fingernails scratching a slate board. Jazz singing is the territory of truly talented people like Mel Torme, Mildred Bailey, and Ella Fitzgerald. They had musical voices, impeccable phrasing, innate rhythm, and a vocal range that spanned multiple octaves (as opposed to Diamond's stiff, frog-like, off-key utterings). It's a joke, really, that Neil Diamond was even given this role. What's next? The cross-eyed, mule-faced Barbra Streisand playing the life of Heddy LaMarr? Hey, I've got some other ideas for those Hollywood producers: how about Sally Jesse Raphael and Jerry Springer as Clark Gable and Carole Lombard? Springer can play Lombard, and the gorgeous, sexy Raphael can play Gable. She already has the mustache. Then we can get Billy Crystal to play John Wayne. Finally, Alan Dershowitz should be given his acting break, don't you agree? How 'bout casting him opposite O.J. Simpson in ""Anything Goes?"" Hey, open your eyes. The liberal Hollywood freaks have made popular culture an oxymoron. There are no more absolutes, everything is relative. All criminal behavior is rationalized and the perpetrator exonerated via psychobabble like ""his Dad never plaed catch with him, that's why he's an axe murderer."" Ugly is now beautiful, stupidity is now erudition, and immorality is now a virtue. Anything goes so long as money can be made. Since the end of WWII, and especially since the drug-infested 1960s, we've allowed the barbarians to assume control of all social, political and cultural discourse. Now all we can do (to paraphrase Chubby Checker) is wonder just how low can we go.",1.0
"Ugh. Poor plot development and cardboard characters. For example, he loves his wife sooooo much and discards her sooooo easily? Not likely.

Not I, that's for sure.",1.0

"I ordered one Highlander Blu Ray and received two. I was charged for two but it does not show up in my Amazon account
All the Highlander blu ray disks that i have tried do not work with either of my blu ray device even with updated software. the playback is unreliable once the preview are finished. The intro gets stuck in a loop and you can never get the menu up. I even went to Target and bought one to copmare with the same results. i returned it to Target and the replaced it with a second that was defective on both my blu ray players. I then had to get a store dredit because Target will not refund money of opened DVD/Blu Ray disks. What a nightmare.

I couldn't cancel the order, I had to wait for it to be delivered, then they want to charge about half of what movie costs to send it back so i kept it.

"""Highlander - The Director's Cut"" was received today and it is almost as much of a disappointment as the ""Special Edition"" DVD (which remains completely unviewable on a any TV larger than thirteen inches).

I am running the disc on a Samsung BD-C5500 Blu-Ray player to an LG 55"" wireless 1080P LCD in a dedicated home theater and ""Highlander"" Blu-Ray is genuinely awful.

Fuzzy, dark, flashing heavy pixellation make this Blu-Ray at times almost unviewable.  Obviously little time was spent in restoring the original and little care was taken with the conversion to Blu-Ray.  For a classic cult movie the studio obviously felt that fans would accept anything that was even marginally viewable.

If you are a ""Highlander"" addict I supposed you could justify this just to say you have the film on Blu-Ray or that the superior ""Director's Cut"" is better (it is), but if you are looking for ""Highlander"" on Blu-Ray to be anything other than more nearly-unviewable garbage I would advise keeping your money in your pocket and not wasting the time or effort to be disappointed.",1.0
"I fall into the ranks of those bitten by a nostalgia bug.  I first saw this film right after college and remember loving it. I suspect that had more to do with the group of friends with whom I saw the movie than the movie itself. At least I hope that is the case.  The acting is horrific and the film just doesn't hold together.  Too bad they didn't hire a choreographer for the fight scenes. Pathetic.  My teenager says he now has confirmation that I have zero taste in action films.

As far as the DVD itself goes, it was noisy in the machine.  The sound was at times too low to be heard, and at other times too loud for comfort. The picture was grainy and often much too dark.  At least running the volume control up and down gave us something to do while watching it.

After the credits ran, we threw it out. I don't recall doing that with any other DVD I have purchased. I suppose I could have donated it to the library, but why inflict this on anyone else?",1.0
"It's a shame to find that a great movie like Highlander hasn't been released to DVD in a descent format. I mean, if you want to keep the original aspect of the movie in video quality it's OK, but the fact that none of the 4 or 5 different DVD versions of this movie have spanish subtitles it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Even nowadays when almost all of the DVD versions have multiple language subs. I was thinking about getting the complete saga. But maybe that's not a good idea.",1.0
"I first saw Highlander in 1986 when it was originally released. I don't remember what I was thinking, but I do know that I was twenty five and I loved it. So it was with a certain expectation that I decided to revisit this movie some two decades later. What a colossal disappointment! For the entire duration I found myself wondering: a) What did I ever see in this hash of bad writing and worse acting? b) When were we ever going to get to the part where the movie didn't suck? I never did find the answer to my first question, but the second question was finally resolved at the one hour, fifty six minute mark when at last the credits rolled. Christopher Lambert has got to be one of the most lifeless actors ever to lumber across the screen. My answering machine can deliver lines better than he can. Most offensive of all was the sword play. The fight scenes were embarrassingly bad. The sword fighting more closely resembled watching a couple of teenagers with sticks playing at being knights in their back yard than it looked like the work of trained sword masters who've had an eternity to perfect their craft. Seriously, I think I once saw the Three Stooges perform more realistic fight scenes. The one bright spot was Clancy Brown, who did a fantastic job as the evil Kurgan. His tongue in cheek portrayal of the malicious psychopath brought the only ray of light to this otherwise lifeless B movie.",1.0

"There are cult movies that have something special about them but are just not mainstream, and then there are cult movies that are utterly awful but that some group of people loves anyway. Highlander is the second type.

Highlander creates a great fantasy scenario. An unexplained, even among its members, group of immortals is born on Earth over the ages. They have to cut off each other's heads in attempt to be the last one standing, at which point the last one will receive some sort of great prize. Interesting issues of their (semi) immortality are touched upon, such as what it's like to be with a partner and watch them grow old and die without them.

Despite the interesting premise, the real problem is three-fold: 80's cheese dogging every inch of the film when they are in the ""current"" day period fighting, throw away acting, sloppy set-ups for action premises, particularly the last part of the film where a relationship starts out of nowhere. It just doesn't stand up as a good film, and as I watched it I either laughed at how bad it was or kept wondering if I should just shut off and stop the terrible waste of time.",1.0
"I must not understand the genre, because I though this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen. I picked it up because it had Sean Connery in it, and I have never before seen a Sean Connery film I didn't like. Not what I expected at all. Too weird.",1.0
"I tried, lordie, I tried to watch the whole thing.  I just couldn't.  ""Highlander"" is wallowing somewhere near the top of my list of worst films of all time.  What's wrong with it?  Well, pretty much everything.  Christopher Lambert is such a wooden actor he should have tried out for the lead in Nutcracker.  No facial expression, no tone of voice, nothing.  The costumes, particularly the alleged 16th century Scotland getups, are like something out of a Studio 54 disco party.  The makeup --take a look at the layer of beige on Sean Connery, designed to make him look like an Egyptian or Spaniard or something, it's never clear which.  It misses parts of his face.  The music is ham-handed and intrusive, particularly during the fight scenes.  You can tell it's supposed to be exciting because the music gets real LOUD.  The scenery, awful.  There's the scene where Lambert gets dunked in the Scottish lake and discovers he doesn't drown... you can actually see the sides of the swimming pool festooned with plastic water plants.  There's the combat scene with Connery where the castle is made of plastic bricks that tumble down with every sword stroke.
If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was a Monty Python sendup of the real dungeons-and-dragons genre.  Alas, it's not.  It's supposed to be serious.  Test yourself, see if you can watch it until the end.",1.0
"First, I am really fond of this movie. But, each iteration of DVD has been hugely disappointing. The wit and imagination that crafted the movie in the first place is nowhere in the minds of the people doing the DVDs.
For instance, the opening scene (in Madison Sqr Garden) originally piqued your curiosity by showing a fight scene that is surprising (to say the least) for the time and setting... but in this new Immortal Edition, they've spliced in scenes from 16th Century Scotland BEFORE the parking garage fight even begins.  What could they have been thinking?
Worst of all is the technical quality of the DVD: the video transfer is mediocre at its best; the sound is worse, with volume and clarity fluctuating all over the place; and the subtitles - are simply MISSING for most of the dialog.
Like the other digital versions of this movie, the Immortal is a half-hearted and half-witted effort! If you like this film, as I do, buy the VHS version, and keep hoping the owners/producers eventually join the digital age.",1.0
"I love the premise of this film. I truly do. Random immortals are caught up in a game where they must kill each other by chopping each other's heads off, the last survivor proclaimed the winner. Later chapters with better attention paid to quality are excellent films and well worth a watch, but sadly, what should have been a great sci-fi film is an utter disaster in its execution.
First off, the casting. Great actors, but you really start to wonder what to do with their accents. You have a Frenchman playing a Scotsman, while the Scotsman plays a Spaniard, and it gets more muddled from there. Fortunately, the accents are completely mangled to the point where you can't distinguish them for most of the film, but I'll get to that later on.
Second, the soundtrack. You remember Flash Gordon, right? All Queen, all the time. Well, as if that wasn't bad enough, it's repeated for this film. Now I can handle a couple of Queen songs in a row, but I'm just not enough of a rabid fan to put up with it for an hour and a half without whimpering at yet another Queen song boring into my brain. Using one group for a rock-with-vocals soundtrack is something that should never be done unless you are making a film about that group, which will assure that only rabid fans are forced to sit through it.
Third, the direction. What is going on here? Cut scenes from past and present are sort of tossed together as if they were held in place only by duct tape, jarring the senses of the viewer. It's enough to give you a migraine.
Finally, the technical difficulties. The soundtrack is loud, the dialogue is hushed to the point of muffled whispers. Lambert has a soft voice to begin with, but with the sound so muted I missed half of what he said and had to rewind and try to read his lips. At least here is where the failure of the sound technician compensated for the misplaced accents. For half the movie you couldn't even hear the accents. The lighting technician apparently didn't show up for work, either, as half the battle scenes are so dark you can't really get an idea of what's going on, guided into belief that there's swordplay only by the sounds of crashing blades. Combine this with the director's poor choice of angles and even what is visible is of very little help in seeing any action.
It's sad that what on its face should have earned at least four stars was degraded by sloppy production to a waste of celluloid. Read a synopsis of Highlander and then watch the much better done sequels.",1.0
"The film rates a 5. The anniversary edition rates a 5. The packaging rates a 0. At the beginning of this dvd is a preview for a movie. You can't remove it, you can't skip over it.

"Like most of the folks writing these reviews, I enjoyed this movie immensely, especially considering the added footage that explained some of the dangling subplots. The picture quality is even better than the VHS, whose print I found to be dark and muddy. I would prefer to give the movie 5 stars, but there are some serious problems with the DVD format in this instance.
WHAT ABOUT THE SOUND, THOUGH? Most of the dialogue was next to impossible to hear, unless the characters were shouting. Fiddling with the volume constantly is not only distracting but downright aggravating. The special features are also in need of serious adjustment. I wanted to see stills from the production, and they went by so fast they were impossible to view. And the scene selector, wherein you are SUPPOSED to be able to skip to your favorite scene is difficult to navigate.
All in all, the movie itself is a delight. The DVD technology, however, needs to be handled by someone with a technical clue.",1.0

"*Edit* I don't know how this review got here, since I wrote it about the (awful) ""10th anniversary edition"" and NOT about this ""Immortal"" edition, which hadn't even been released by the time I wrote this. //
You will not find a worse image quality on DVD even if you tried! First, it is appalling to sell a letterbox transfer as ""state of the art"", as it says on the box. Only an anamorphic transfer derserves to be called that.... The picture is so bad, I truely have seen better looking VHS-tapes. The people at ""Widescreen Review"" must have been drunk or bribed to rate it 4.5 - there simply is no other reasonable explanation. The noise in some scenes is so bad, it looks like snowflakes - this cannot be attributed solely to the high-speed film used for some parts of the movie. Diagonal lines are completely torn up by the lack of resolution. There are artifacts of all kinds throughout the movie. It is a shame! The sound quality is very disappointing, too - this is what you get when you try to squeeze a stereo master into the 5.1 format - very unnatural sounds with artificial, reverberated ambience and dialogues. Some very disturbing noise (hiss) is clearly audible, too. I have to use all my discipline not to resort to very personal, R-rated comments about the studio and producers who are responsible for this terrible DVD. Too bad, because this classic movie would have deserved much better.",1.0

This is a hack job. Folks, there is a reason this disc sells for 10 bucks - and it's not because it's *that* bad of a movie. The only worse disc I've ever seen is ""Metropolis"" - and at least that movie was 70 years old. Avoid this disc; go w/VHS.",1.0
"Wide Screen Review's review of this DVD?
""The non-anamorphic DVD picture exhibits sharp and detailed images, with excellent color fidelity.

Noise is virtually non-existent, but scattered artifacts are visible throughout.""  This is no classic, but I bought it for the low price and Wide Screen's review.

I have no idea what they did to it,  maybe drag the source in mud and jump on it a bit, but it's really -really-  atrocious.

"Amazon has mislabeled this particular ""Two Disc Collector's Gift Set and Limited Edition Ornament"" DVD of It's a Wonderful Life, as presented in Widescreen in the stats section.  IT IS NOT.  I own the previously released Collector's Two Disc set (full screen), which looks fantastic by the way, and this is the SAME EXACT set.  I bought this thinking it was even newer and was presented in Widescreen, as it said it was, but was duped.  You are only paying more for a flimsy plastic package that will just be thrwon away anyway and a cheap little bell on a thin red ribbon.  NOT worth the extra money at all. SO, the only difference to this one is fancy packaging and a bell.  DO NOT buy this if you are looking for a Widescreen presentation because it is NOT!  Didn't open the DVD at all because when I got it, it even says ""full screen"" on the bottom of the packaging.  At least I have a gift for next Christmas.",1.0
"Okay, I goofed by not reading the reviews here before I bought this title. Please, don't make the same mistake I did. All of the glowing praise for this film is for the VHS version, if you noticed.
The DVD transfer is, in  a word, terrible. Whatever film stock was used for the low-light shots  (which is most of the film) was pretty grainy, and the DVD just accentuates  that to an ALARMING degree. Add to that the pixelation artifacts, and the  way certain backgrounds in shots don't move or change their appearance AT  ALL with foreground movement, giving scenes a plastic, cartoonish look.  This is a cheap way to cut down on the DVD's data size, but it shows. I've  seen indie films shot on 16mm that looked better on a VHS dub than this.  Maybe they were shorthanded at the mastering lab that week and let an  intern get a ""big break"", I don't know. The THX certification is  definitely NOT deserved, as the mix on the sound is equally bad, with FX  stomping on dialog in key places.
Having said that, if you are bound and  determined to buy this, Russel Mulcahy's strong grasp of the visual at  least doesn't disappoint. Some of the best match dissolves and scene  transitions to be found anywhere. The DVD should be shown to aspiring film  students:What TO DO with a camera, What NOT TO DO in the mastering lab.",1.0

"There is absolutely NOTHING new in this DVD release as to extras - just the same old Tom Bosley ""Making of..."" and Frank Capra Jr.'s recollections.  It is a total shame that for AFI's # 1 Most Inspiring Film of All Time that Paramount can't come up with NEW extras!  There is so much that could be done - but isn't.  The Tom Bosley featurette is centuries old - and was originally made for TV! And it isn't all that good to begin with. So ALL you get with this new packaging is...new packaging in a cheesy Christmas tree-backed box along with a cheap little bell with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" writ on it.  How wonderful if they had an ornament such as the one released by Hallmark in 1996 - a small tableau of George and Mary and ZuZu beside a Christmas tree.  That was a fantastic ornament!  But a tinny little bell is all you will get with this re-packaging.  So, if you have 2007's double disc set you have everything already - except for the tiny, tinny little bell.

Jimmy Stewart's character was a born loser. Everything bad happened to him from the beginning. He also passed up opportunities to better himself. He ignored the prettiest gal in the movie (Gloria Graham) for a plain Jane (Donna Reed). To me, Lionel Barrymore's was the best character in the movie and he certainly gave the best acting performance. This was a big Frank Capra disappointment.

"One movie on which the studio will milk the fans the world over for as many times as they can! Alright, I held back buying the 60th Anniversary edition released last year thinking there will be a definite release of this gem. When this double-disc release was announced, I was very hopeful that at least now after countless releases, this will be the definitive edition of the film but man, they proved me wrong again. Rather than working on the new release, they just repackaged the 60th Anniversary edition alongwith another disc featuring the colorised version of the film. No new extras or commentaries here, so in case, just like me, if you were looking forward to own a definitive release of this wonderful film, looks like you may have to wait a little longer.

I received a e-mail back from  Amazon & they assured me that it was a colorized version of the movie. Well, I got my DVD today & on the back of the DVD it say's B & W. This is the same movie that was released a couple of years ago. It has the same stuff on it as the last movie they released. (The making of it's a wonderful life & A tribute to Frank Capra). There is nothing different about the movie. Paramount just wants to make more money. That's all it amounts to. So, all of the questions in these reviews are answered.
THIS MOVIE IS BLACK & WHITE- NOT COLOR!!!!!!! If you already own this movie don't buy it! You will just be getting a copy of the movie you already own & they won't refund your S & H, because the movie isn't defective. Amazon needs to watch what they are doing.

"Read the book, but DO NOT BUY THIS TRAVESTY! Worse than a made for TV oversimplification, this HBO film completely distorts and actually REVERSES essential facts of the true, exciting and important story detailed in the book upon which it is based (St. Martin's Press, 1997). Anyone with respect for the history of submarines and submariners should avoid this poor ""dramatization."" It isn't even a ""taut thriller,"" as People Magazine was quoted as saying. It's just a boring whitewash of the actual events. Besides failing to show that an irresponsible cowboy US Submarine Commander (James Von Suskil of the USS AUGUSTA, the man and the ship both cowardly renamed in this low-budget stinker) recklessly caused the accident, they depicted the Russian Captian receiving a hero's welcome when he returned to the USSR, when in truth he was tragically court-martialed and imprisoned after taking necessary steps to save his crew and the eastern seaboard of the US! Why do people make movies like this, and why do actors like Max Von Sydow and Martin Sheen participate in covering up the misdeeds of a reckless US sub commander and the depraved indifference and cruelty of the Soviet Navy toward its own sailors. The simple truth of the book would have been far more exciting and enlightening. Shame on everyone associated with this little piece of anti-history!",1.0

"I enjoyed seeing some actors such as Dave Foley(despite his Politics),Stephen Root,and Bryan Cranston among others, I don't like that Ron Howard is involved and for that Matter Tom Hanks. The Movie/Series is portrayed pretty good except when it gets to ""1968"" and after that it is basically Boring and dull. The Episode on the Wives was Unnecessary, and the introduction to each episode with JFK ranting about going to the ""Moon"" as well Repeated as a Special feature,the 1968 Episode I feel is disrespectful because it is more Politically Inclined and easy to do.(Read Leftist Slant.)And it comes with a Little Booklet and when It gets to ""We Interrupt This Program"" the little booklet says When Journalism was giving way to Sensationalism does it neglect to mention that journalism has always been Leftistslant and in such Case Sensationalist such as Duranty and his Stalin Apologetics for The NY Tass?My Favorite Episode is the one with Bean in it,And The Corvettes Racing/Drag Racing although some errors as the Apollo 12 Corvettes in The Series are NOT the 1969 Cars as it should be But Replicas which I understand but you can't fool someone by using something as Easily identifiable from the side as a 69' Corvette and the 1971/72 Corvettes which were used in the episode and passed off as 1969 Corvettes, The Astronauts Did indeed Have other Year Corvettes but not in the Riverside Gold/Black from 69, over the years they were several colors, and Riverside Gold was 1969 Color,There is lazy editing because the Same 3 Corvettes (Gold/Black) You see all have Rally Wheels and Later one is shown with the Deluxe wheel covers which The Actual 69' Has. Also in Episode 3 the CGI and the Background I noticed was Terrible. I Preferred Watching ""The Right Stuff"" Different Topic Yes but better and ""When We Left Earth"" than Watching anything Tom Hanks and Howard have to do with,I am glad I got the Set for less than $10 New I feel it could have cut out the episodes that were OFF Topic and focus on the Apollo Missions as the Filmmakers say it is about.",1.0

It's just as bad as Armageddon, but with no Aerosmith in the soundtrack.",1.0
You couldn't relate with the characters because you had no idea who they were. The first seen is of two gentlemen walking through the burnt woods of a warzone and one guy is badly hurt and burnt and crying. It was hard to attach to the character and know how to care without even knowing who he was and how he related to the story. Seem very fake and bad acting. Unfortunately there has been some incredible war and bravery movies since this movie came out and this one does not measure up.,1.0

"In previous reviews the aspect ratio of this DVD set is often mentioned. I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition!",1.0

"The 1st seven parts of a 12-part series are pretty good - but the 8th part undercuts the value of whole series as far as I'm concerned. The 8th part, which dealt with the aborted and near-disasterous Apollo 13 mission, should have been a story of the triumph of magnificent behind-the-scenes technological solutions to incredibly difficult problems. However, the Apollo 13 story was instead inexplicably turned into a 3rd rate soap opera highlighting 2nd rate journalism.

About 3  million Americans are getting shut out of Hank's loving tribute to Project  Apollo because of this short-sighted attitude on HBO's part.

But it's like you took all that psychological realism of having a non-hero ""hero,"" but decided to make up for that karma and standard for realism with making the dialogue, command interactions, and battles as unrealistic as possible.

Ok ok no spoilers, but spoiler: men did not walk shoulder to shoulder 2 file deep when they advanced on enemy lines. They laid down cover fire, used smoke, had artillery support, used mortars, and stayed at least far enough apart when possible so that 3 guys wouldn't get shot dead with a single round. Also, if you can flank an artillery piece because there's not enough infantry around it... you do that with the entire company rather than sending a single squad around and hurling the rest of your men headlong into certain death. Also... while flamethrowers are cool, you simply don't use them to blow up artillery that's not in a bunker. Why? You use grenades or mortars which have better range and aren't heavy, and don't run the risk of getting shot and blowing up your entire unit. Also, if you're coming up on the back of an undefended artillery piece, you don't need that. You can just shoot everybody. Those guys would have been way more effective with submachine guns or even rifles, probably.

Also isn't anybody that the ""kill it with fire"" approach will set off a gigantic pile of ammunition? You're attacking a gigantic cannon that's firing continuously. Doesn't anybody stop to reconsider the ramifications of dumping lit fuel on that at 10-15 foot distance? If that stuff blows up and you're close enough to use a flamethrower, you're super-duper dead.",1.0

"This was a train wreck. I watched it thinking it's got to get better. It doesn't. Take a pass on this and save your change. Send me and e-mail and I'll give you my copy. It's that bad. The acting, for lack of a better word, is rudimentary. The plot, water thin.
It is nowhere near the neighborhood of ""Saving Private Ryan"". It's one of the all-time worst WWII movies I've ever endured.",1.0
"One of the worst WWII movies I've seen.  One plus, the uniforms were good and it looked as though the U.S. troops had M-1's. The acting was class ""B"". Not recommended at all.

"This is not a movie: It's a succession of clips stitched together. I don't know if this editing is the one decided by the director but the result is exceptionally bad. For instance, we see the battalion attacking German positions and taking much of a beating. The sequence after we see the survivors of the attack lying and moaning. Where are they? What has happened? Have they made it? After a while, we understand that the attack was a failure but we never saw the fall-back order and the retreat. The whole movie is like that: There is no scenario, no tenure, nothing interesting in the end. Quite upsetting when you're getting used to higher movie making standards.",1.0
"I have a hard time imagining that the veterans of the bloody Huertgen Forest battles would relate to this historical fantasy. It was a truly horrific campaign that deserves as serious a treatment as the Normandy landings got in Saving Private Ryan. As an earlier reviewer said, the bridge battle scene is quite ludicrous, and the Huertgen campaign was certainly not decided by four fresh replacement soldiers knocking out a couple of unprotected Panzers in a banzai flamethrower attack. So as a historical record ... forget it. As a human story, I didn't find it any more convincing. It hinges on the conflict faced by the lead character, Private Manning, between wanting to stay alive on the one hand, and having to take on the responsibilities of leadership for his small band of green recruits, which of course puts him in harm's way. That requires a pretty sophisticated script and some good acting, neither of which is available in this case. Throw in a stereotypical and one-dimensional commanding officer who doesn't care about casualties, and you have all the ingredients of a major cinematic disappointment. The Huertgen Forest deserves much better.",1.0
"A movie about the battle of Hurtigen Forrest in the closing year of WWII. A battle left in obscurity because it represented America's highest attrition in any battle during WWII and clearly the poorest leadership. A lofty subject the execution of which was mutilated by inummerable basic errors in tactical details and equipment. The quality of the film is eroded further by a simplistic and inaccurate script, substandard directing, and mediocre acting.

The script is flawed in that the language and even the situations are purely modern anachronisms so that the characters end up talking and behaving as if they were in Vietnam at Hue 24 years later.  The tactical decisions each enlisted and officer makes in the film are laughable.  The characters portrayed are so inept that they must have been in a coma during basic training.  For some absurd reason, it seems like every GI in that film feels compelled to come out of his fox hole and talk to his buddies without care while being shelled or in full battle; as if having a pleasant walk in the park. Ask any vet, unless ordered to do so or a fellow soldier is injured, no soldier in his right mind would do something like that when being bombarded by artillery.  At one point some guys pick up a flame thrower that uses a fire hose (a fire hose????) to shoot the flame! The Germans in a tactical retreat withdraw the 88s back last after the infantry so that they remain exposed to the advancing enemy?  And it just went on.  I had to stop the film after a while because I was laughing too hard.  The only thing those involved in producing and directing this film knew about their story is that it was during WWII in Europe and that the Japanese were not there.

Ultimate conclusion, this has to be one of the absolute worst war films I have ever seen and I have seen many. I've seen bad foreign war films that are better than this HBO film.  Hands down, this has to be the worst HBO film I have seen in a long time.  Don't be fooled by all the stars the film has. I frankly don't know why so many reviewers rate this film over two stars!  Rent the movie first if you're thinking about buying it so that you will only have lost $5 instead of $20 in watching this ridiculous film.  I originally received this movie as a promotional item; I watched it once and gave it away in disgust. One star is too kind a rating for such an amateurish film. Watch 'A Bridge Too Far', 'Cross of Iron', 'Stalingrad', 'Band of Brothers', or 'S.P.R.' for very good films covering WWII battles in Europe.  Unlike these great and accurate productions(at least tactically if not as to exact events), this film is but a waste of time and money believe me.",1.0
I had high hopes for this movie and I could not have been more disappointed. It had neither plot nor character development. The jokes were few and far between and most of them were mean-spirited jabs at Japanese culture. Bill Murray seemed to be either bored or just doing his lounge lizzard act during the movie. Even my wife though this was a pointless waste of time. Great idea that next left the batter's box.,1.0
"Dreadful film, too many historical inacuracies to even mention. Just dreadful. Pass it up and either read a good book or watch a decent documentary.
My favorite part is when the German infantry are ""pulled back leaving the Artillery out in front"", or wait- maybe it was the fire hose flamethrowers, or no, the backwards west wall obstacles, or.. or..
It has ONE good monent when they are walking in the woods- then they ruin it by having the guys stand around talking next to the front line foxholes. Oh the pain....",1.0
"There are only one or two moments in the film worth watching. Like walking through the woods . They they get to the front line and stand upright outside a foxhole and talk.
(...) Accuracy is at a minimum, historically its baffleing how they got this story from what really happened, and all in all it is very clear producers and directors had no clue what combat in WW2 was like.
Don't rate it high in honor of the vets that fought there. They would be discusted that it was done so poorly. While lip servce wa spaid to the vets, and they did talk to a few of them I am told, obviously they did not listen. I assume it was to keep the cost down. Which is a shame as most fo the problems could have been avoided if they had competant advisors on set that the director listened to. Go watch "" a walk in the sun' instead.",1.0
"This is truly the worst film i've ever seen. Arnold Schwarsonager does more realistic filming. The characters are 'flat': they tell no backround to their lives in the film apart from their names. I think its dumb where Manning (ron eldard) is promoted to sergeant directly from private. Even Audie Murphy's heroism wasn't enough to be promoted to srgnt that quickly. And since when has someone been able to fit a Thompson clip into his m1 jacket pocket? At the end comes the bit that makes me laugh. The classic NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!as mannings buddy comes to check up on him and innevitably gets killed. Someone got paid to write the script? jeeeeezus!  another sad bit is where Sanderson, the private gets separated from his platoon and has to hide under the stick pile, which is there 'coinsidentilty'. Anyone could have seen his fat arse poking out of that pile. The German officer type person and his Action Man style Scar on his face is quite a gas too. Reading another review earlier, i too agree that Sandersons psycho scream with the flamethrower will leave anyone wetting themselves with laughter.",1.0
"I'm a WWII war movie, game, novel buff.  I bought this sight-unseen because of my interest in such subject matter and because I was told it was a good film.  I've never seen such egregious over acting in my life.  At one point, a green soldier (forgot his name) used a flamethrower (a weapon normally used by elites) to burn some German 88LL crews.. he kept on screaming through out the entire melee in such an over dramatic manner that I literally was laughing... and I don't think I was supposed to.

"I only bought this for Keanu Reeves, and thankfully, it was only 3.99, so it wasn't too much of a waste. I also bought Tomb Raider, and was expecting to hate that, and like this. Funny that.
I survived a very long 28 minutes, and then switched it off. I just couldn't watch it anymore. I wasn't concentrating on it, and if I'm getting bored during a film, I will check how long has gone by. I first checked 15 minutes into the film.
I am crazy about Keanu Reeves, so I thought this film would be a good buy. Plus, it's not very well known, and I was shocked to find out it was made in 1997 - I thought it would have been early nineties or so. If you think Keanu Reeves is gorgeous, do not buy this. He looks about average. I dunno whether its due to the storyline or what, but he acts like he's drunk, and looks & acts like a total sleazebag. His hair looks greasy, and he just doesn't look like him!
Anyway, back to the film. None of the characters are introduced, leading to me get very confused about the lead character, who starts off the film, kissing a girl in a hospital, and then going home, and sleeping with another girl, who decides to slash her wrists just before I stopped watching. He then proceeds to run off with his ""mate"" Keanu Reeves, and pick up two girls along the way.
Maybe the film gets better later on, and maybe I'll watch it again sometime. But I'll need to be in a BIG Keanu mood to watch this again. Which is worse: Bram Stoker's Dracula or this?! I don't understand how a film can be based on a letter!",1.0

"...a laughably-contrived exchange of dialogue in which an African character actually tells a jewish character words to the effect of: he's ""sorry that the jewish people have suffered so much."" Really? This poor guy is locked-up due to killing a bunch of slavers in an attempt to free himself and he's going to take time to get weepy about oppression of jews? Seems Spielberg wanted to steer any conversation (of the time) away from the heavy and obvious jewish involvement in slave trafficking and as well as use. I credit him for continuing the barrage of self pity, but he needs to mask that crap a little better. That's right, go ahead and research their role in the slave trade for yourself.

Matthew McCawnuh-huh-ay (I'll spell his name correctly when he drops his fake southern drawl) and Morgan Freeman have absolutely no apparent role in this film. I'm serious, especially when juxtaposed with Anthony Hopkins's terrific portrayal of J.Q. Adams. The scenes trying to feature Freeman and McCawnuhwhatevs were boring, meandering and weak. Had Spielberg simply gone with a more authentic telling, it would have made for a better film. Hopkins flies to the rescue in the end because it was a great character played by a (at the time) great actor. However, the contrivance of myths surrounding a period of history like this is insulting. I would suggest Spielberg stick with the facts, but Schindler's List proved he is more interested in manipulating audiences with cartoonish, overly-fictionalized villains, so why would this film be any different.",1.0

"Based on a true story, A group of west african slaves, Led by Cinque [Played by Djimon Hounsou], Forcefully take over the la amistad slave ship and they kill their slave owners. Just a day later, They are captured and bought to spain to stand trial on murder charges. A lot of very talented actors are in this movie. But, I truly think that Spielberg went too far with this one. I never thought i would be saying this about a movie, But this movie was literally too hard to swallow for me. It was much too violent, Much too ugly, And the story also fails to tell of what the supposed ''hero'' of the film did just a year after he was freed from slavery. Cinque actually became a slave trader himself. To me, That doesn't make Cinque a hero, That makes Cinque a traitor, As well as a sellout. Because so many extremely brutal things were going on in this movie, I was unable to make it to the end of this movie. To tell you the truth, Watching this movie can give a man bad dreams faster than any horror movie out there! Now, I know Spielberg had good intentions when making this movie, Being that he wanted to give moviegoers a vision of what black people had to put up with when this was all happening in real life, But this was too raw. I could never imagine anyone wanting to actually own this movie! How the hell would you watch something like this that's barbaric more than once? Although i am a fan of Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, And Matthew Mcconaughey, I am unable to ever attempt to watch this movie all the way through. And yes, It is true that Cinque did become a slave trader just one year after being freed. Look it up on the internet if you think i'm wrong. To me, This movie's focus shouldn've be so much on Cinque, It should've also gave a deeper insight to some of the many others that had to suffer with him on that boat. Although this isn't a bad movie, It's certainly a movie that you'll most likely never wanna see more than once. What disturbs me is that this movie is actually being used for educational purposes in schools! I know these brutal events really took place, But that doesn't mean that you have to attempt to reenact these violent events scene for scene in a movie. Again, This is not a bad movie, It's just much too hard to swallow, And that's why this movie gets only 1 star from me.",1.0
"This is a film about a true life incident. Some slaves on route to Cuba mutinied and took control of their ship. They attempted to force the surviving crew to take them to Africa but instead the captain of the ship directed it north and it was captured by the Americans.
This then led to a complicated debate about what should happen. Under existing law it was clear that if the slaves were from Africa then the taking of them as slaves amounted to kidnapping. They were entitled to kill the people in the ship and to escape. If on the other hand they were slaves from Cuba their actions would amount to murder.
The various court cases were however not about these issues. What they were about was procedural matters of whether the ""slaves"" should be returned to Cuba for a trial run in a kangaroo court or whether they should not...
The critical thing of course is that the trials were not concerned about slavery at all. Slavery was a given, the question for the various courts was simply were these men slaves or were they free men wrongly reduced to servitude and further if so what court should make the decision.
Instead the film tries to make this film an epic which somehow showed that America was for slaves. Hopkins makes a number of moving speeches on this theme but the reality is that it is all nonsense. This incident had nothing at all to do with the move to abolish slavery in the United States.
The film also is obnoxious as it relegates the Africans at the centre of the action to playing the role of dumb oxes who are saved by intrepid white characters.
If these ideological problems don't cause you any problems the film is a reasonably well executed florid melodrama.",1.0
"This film takes manipulation to a new level. First of all Speilberg spends the whole first 1 1/2 hour stating and restating the self evident truth that slavery was wrong. O.K so just how guilty is the white audience supposed to feel before enough is enough? Secondly Speilberg evidently has no quams about rewriting history so long as it pushes his P.C. agenda. In reality Adams and the blacks he was defending never met, and they(blacks) never sat foot inside of a courtroom. Another of Speilbergs interesting oversights is that the lead character(i forgot his name) after being set free form the evil shackles of slavery, returned to Africa and and participated in the slave trade. If this trend continues I wonder what goofy bunk he'll try next? Maybe he can remake a ""historically accurate"" WWII movie where the Japanese won.",1.0
"There is something cartoonish about Amistad. If social malefactors in real life had evil, cunning and opportunism so obviously stamped on their features, broad layers of the population would have no difficulty, as they do, in sorting out their friends from their enemies. Several processes seem to have been at work in producing this failed artistic result. No one has ever suggested, in the first place, that Spielberg was a profound thinker or an artist of unlimited talent. It is not the director's fault, naturally, but the phenomenal success of his films over the past two decades has undoubtedly been bound up with social and artistic processes of a rather retrograde character. As a result, almost all of Spielberg's films and the conceptions they embody are truly childish, not 'child-like'. But there is another critical element which must be added into the mix when considering the specific failings of Amistad: the truly deleterious impact of `political correctness' on artistic work. Nearly every aspect of the film reveals a desperation, a mania almost, to satisfy the strangle hold political correctness has over much of society. It is in this light that one has to view the film's extremely idealized portrayal of the Africans. The treatment of slavery itself as an historical phenomenon also suffers. Very little  matter-of-fact analysis occurs in Amistad. The director is determined to focus the spectator's attention on the horrors of the situation at every moment for fear of being accused of insensitivity to the suffering of the slaves. Under those conditions, where events and people are depicted as they ""should"" have been and not as they were, the possibility of an objective historical accounting, as well as the possibility of the artist being honest with himself goes out the window. We are left with a stilted, distorted picture, arranged so as not to offend. The fact is, nothing but intellectual harm has come from the influence of political correctness. Amistad demonstrates this.",1.0
Steven Speielberg is a very talent film-maker but he sinks on this film.i'm wanting Morgan Freeman's character&Dijimon Hounsou charater to have more pressence but not here.they have no voice.but the characters of  Anthony Hopkins&Matthew Mcconaughey have to save the day.typical of  Hollywood.always have to smooth things out when something serious is going  on and the voice that needs to be heard is silent or forced to be Soft.it's  a crying shame.every voice deserves to be heard.,1.0

It is really nothing more than a boring - and equally badly  made - derivative of the TV  mini-series 'Roots' that was inflicted on us some 20 years ago.

"So I finally got to see this movie after all these years.  And frankly if I had know how poor this movie was, I may have just left it alone.

The movie has Stallone in it who was a big shot EMS or director of EMS or something like that.  But he has fallen from grace and he can only find work as a taxi driver.  That doesn't really make sense to me.  A guy who did all that good for people and makes one mistake and suddenly he's reduced to a taxi driver?  He couldn't find work anywhere else any field?  His only safety net is to become a taxi driver?

Plus why does anyone tolerate him at the scene of this accident or in this control room?  Do they just let him in for old time's sake?  Nostalgia?  If I went to one of my old jobs and tried to help out, they would probably be happy to see me and ask how I was doing, but if they were in crisis mode like these guys were, they'd politely ask me to leave.  They wouldn't put up with me like they did with Stallone.

Also throughout the movie, Stallone is saying he won't leave anyone behind.  But he leaves George behind to die without even really trying to find a way to get him out, or make him comfortable in his last few minutes on Earth, or even leave him with a light source so he doesn't have to die in the dark.  Plus when the old guy's wife dies, the husband insists on not leaving her behind, but Stallone tells him to leave her.  So he's constantly leaving people behind and contradicting himself.

The worst part is when Stallone himself is left behind with one of the survivors and he throws a temper tantrum because he's mad at the tunnel or angry for being in such a bad movie, I can't really decide which it is.  So they eventually get out and he has to tell a woman that her boyfriend, George, died but he managed to get her bracelet back that he borrowed from her for some reason.  ""Yeah, sorry your boyfriend died, but here's a tacky bracelet to remember him by!""

The only parts about this movie that I liked was the dog, Cooper and the performance by Trina McGee.  Her performance was very good and she made me believe she was actually scared for being in the situation she was in.  Other than those two things, this movie was lame.

"This movie goes way off the unintentional comedy scale.  A rag-tag group of survivors, containing every possible patented Hollywood character, from the dignified elderly to the know-it-all WASP and the fiesty token minority, are subjected to a truly hilarious disaster that makes the Poseidon Adventure look like Citizen Kane.  My favorite part of this film is the invincible dog.  You can always tell a Hollywood hackjob by the invincible dog, which always survives everything and is, gosh, just so darn *cute* that you're supposed to get all weepy with relief when it survives through to the credits.  A classic example is the golden retriever in Independence Day that, in an awe-inspiring display of poor blue screening, somehow jumps out of the way of a fireball that just destroyed Los Angeles..and of course just at the last moment.  A cousin of that redoubtable pup is found here, where it actually disappears for half the movie and then suddenly comes paddling out of nowhere in a moment that is clearly intended to be triumphant, but is just flat out funny.  It's long been known that people watching a movie react far more emotionally to injuries to dogs than to people, but you've stooped pretty darn low when you have to fall back on that as a plot device.",1.0

"Having seen the original film and thought it brilliant, I bought the DVD version.

The original film was a full night's entertainment at the movies, and was shown in two parts with an interval between them.

But in the much abridged DVD version, many important scenes have either been left out entirely, or have been so cut as to be meaningless. For example, the scene in the hotel when the Jackal, on his way to his first meeting with the OAS conspirators, tumbles to the presence of their ""gorilla"" behind a curtin in the lobby, goes straight back out and phones them, telling them to get rid of the Gorilla immediately. Important character development: cut right out.

And so on, and so on.

I got one DVD and feel cheated. I would have preferred to pay whatever (cost to Universal < A$0.50 ) for the extra DVD and got the whole thing. I would be ashamed to play this disappointing cut down UNIVERSAL PICTURES (UK) DVD to any of my friends.

Could serve as a coaster under a beer glass, perhaps.",1.0

"Not much to add to earlier comments, except this: if you're looking for that truly dreadful Bruce Willis disaster of a so-called 'remake', and were directed instead to this original 'Jackal' by mistake, then go no further.  You don't know how lucky you are to have missed the pure dreck of the remake -- rather, you've found your way to another masterpiece from the director who gave us ""High Noon"", and much more.  Think of it as having embarked on a snipe-hunt for junkyard trinkets but happily stumbling onto a real gem.  The DVD print is excellent, right down to conveying the subtley bleached effect that I recall from the original release, and the classic ""look"" and texture of the old Schneider Panavision lenses and European lighting -- all effects that heighten the movie's authenticity and mid-60's ambience.  This classic is a far cry from the phony, who-are-you-kidding cinematic comic books of today that try to emulate computer games for overgrown adolescents.  The writing, directing and acting are lean and direct, the visual style is spare, efficient, exceptionally effective.  When you consider that this is a well researched, fairly accurate telling of actual people and events, you have one of those rare movies that, like ""The Third Man"", seriously upped the stakes for the espionage/suspense genre, raising the bar to heights that its imitators can't even hope to reach.
Sad to say, even if the image is 1.85:1 aspect, it's letterboxed in a 4:3 image that blurs all to hell if you try to blow it up on an HD screen, indicating it's a cheap low-bitrate transfer on single-layer disc. The 1.85:1 marketing hype just means the tiny image isn't cropped. Sorry, fellas -- that's a 1-star job, even for 1998.",1.0

"This is not a review of the film (which will have to wait until I get a playable disk). This is a review of a specific product, the Universal Blu-Ray + Digital HD. I ordered one. When I tried to play it, it locked up 32 seconds into the movie. None of the player's controls would function. I unplugged the player, plugged it back in again, then tried skipping chapters. After the 3rd chapter skip, it locked up again. I couldn't remove the disk without first unplugging the player and plugging it back in again.

Oh well, a given disk could always be defective, right? Amazon promptly sent me a replacement. It ALSO locked up at the exact same point, 32 seconds into the film.

"If you already own ""Half Baked,"" don't waste your money on the ""Fully Baked Edition"" DVD, because the extras are a huge waste of time -- the added comedy bits are so poor it's embarrassing, like something high school kids would produce.  The director commentary is also thoroughly uninteresting -- she just repeatedly says ""That was funny.""  When you watch the deleted scenes, you'll say, ""I see why they deleted that.""  There's nothing of value here.

Dave Chapelle had nothing to do with this edition -- he's not on the commentary track or in any of the bonus materials, nor are any other actors from the film.

Don't be confused -- I LOVE LOVE LOVE Half Baked -- and I HATED the extras on this DVD.  Total waste of time and money, a big disappointment to Half Baked fans.

"I'm a huge fan of half baked as I'm sure most people are. Hoping to receive more hilarious footage and outtakes of everyones favorite stoners I found myself buying the new edition of this dvd. How could you miss with a list of added features such as..

Five Minutes with the ""The Guy on the Couch""

Different Types of Smokers

Granny's Guide to Bakin'

Well they missed big time. The guy on the couch.. some imitation rolling around for five minutes with a pillow covering his face as he rolled of the couch. Lame! Types of smokers.. animated and not even amusing. Granny's baking someone throwing a bunch of things in a pot like a cooking show. The whole thing was poorly produced. The only additional footage was things that they edited out of the film. ie originally they had Kenny calling Thurgood to do the whole scene in the movie where they visited him and tell him how they are going to get him out.

This is a pitiful attempt to turn a buck off of Half Baked's fan base. I want my money back.",1.0
"I will be one of the first to admit that I used to think that this movie was God's gift to me. I fondly remember sitting my my couch with my two best friends, blazing up and laughing at the same scenes we kept rewinding and watching at least 10 times in a row. Of course, after the movie was over, we remembered the most quotable lines:

""They killed Killer, yo!""

""Bitch, you know what I want.""

""If you want a heifer with cheese, just turn around and ask me for a heifer with cheese, yo!""

""You walk on two legs, homo erectus. Did I say 'homo'? I didn't mean that!""

""We have to save Kenny's sweet virgin ass!""

Sure, if you're looking for funny lines to quote out of context with bloodshot eyes and a mouth full of Fritos, this is the best movie for you. If you're looking for comedy to enjoy while you're sober, this might not be the best DVD to purchase.

I was severely disheartened when I viewed this movie again. I haven't seen it since Freshman or Sophomore year (around the time when the movie came out in theaters), and back around those times, I had my own Billy Bong Thornton, Wesley Pipes, and if I remember correctly, I even had one named Bowl Cosby. (Weedheads aren't the most creative bunch.) Needless to say, this movie did not pack as much of a comedy punch as it did back in the day. I guess pot comedies are not as funny when you're not on pot.

A little note about the extras on this disc: they suck, blow, and any other euphemism you can think of for the action of fellatio. Different kinds of smokers? I was looking forward to more celebrity cameos, Jon Stewart and Stephen Baldwin being my favorites. What I got were several crudly animated and severely unfunny shorts about what kinds of smokers there are. If I wanted to see bad animation of unfunny material, I'd watch Shorties Watching Shorties, thanks. Granny's Guide To Bakin'? A young woman dressed up as an old woman cooking recipes with slang terms for being high in the titles. While the recipes actually do look legit and maybe even edible, do we really need to watch an old woman smoking up and completely ruining a batch of perfectly good brownies? The cook in me wanted to stick my own head in an oven.

The alternate ending is not funny. The deleted scenes were deleted for all the right reasons. I'm supremely glad that they were not included in the movie, because not only were they stupid and completely not entertaining, they also had nothing to do with the overall plot.

All in all, I am horribly disappointed in this edition. It's not worth any money you spend on it, and you'd be much better off getting the VHS edition than this subpar ""Fully Baked"" edition.

But then again, if you enjoy this sort of thing, go for it. This is a classic pothead comedy for classicly trained potheads.",1.0
"But hey, he hadn't hit the big time yet so you can't blame him for wanting the paycheck. I saw this movie in the theater when it came out, and utterly despised it. Yeah, there are a few funny antics here and there, and I got a kick out of some of the characters/cameos; the ""MacGuyver"" guy (reminds me of myself), snoop dogg and others, even the guy on the couch, but that's about it. They're hardly in the movie anyways, and the main players get themselves into simply asinine situations that I had no interest in seeing them out of. Even more sinister are the anti marijuana undertones that I picked up on, and the almost subliminal means in which some were delivered. One good example is a passing reference to reduced sperm count made by the narrator (Chappelle), what other purpose could that be meant to serve? It didn't elicit a chuckle from the audience if that was the intention. If the intention was in fact to subliminally steer people away from pot, I'd say the makers of this horrible waste of film stock failed miserably. Plenty of smokers seem to like it just fine, myself and a few others notwithstanding. Why that is is beyond me.",1.0
Book was good.  Movie not so much,1.0
"Except for Terminator 2 (which sacrificed any plot in favor of 2 hours of things exploding), I doubt I have seen a movie as overrated as Half-Baked.  I guess it's not surprising that this movie appeals to so many people, because so often what appeals to most people is the lowest-common denominator (look at any Pauly Shore movie and tell me that's not true).  There is a plot to this movie- barely.  Three pot-smoking guys decide to sell high-grade weed to raise money for a friend's bail.  That's about it.  But the plot is clearly secondary in this movie, which basically ends up being 2 hours of guys saying ""We're stoned, man!  We're stoned!  Duuuuuuuh...""  The acting isn't too bad.  But when your character is a guy who has fried his brain on pot, it's not too difficult a role to play.  Overall, this movie lacks a decent plot, good acting, and any actual humor.  Had there been any real jokes in the movie- something other than ""Duh, I'm STONED, MAN!""- the other flaws would be easier to forgive.  Half-Baked would probably be half-funny, if it were more than just an excuse to put stoners on film.",1.0

download speed. The screen said ""loading"" and then the movie started. It would play for a moment and then the screen would say ""loading"" and the movie would pause. This happened time after time.

"The single star is for the blu-ray transfer, obviously not for the movie. I just saw the Spanish edition of this blu-ray, which I assume to be the same, digibook included. I guess Universal has released the same transfer everywhere, so this can apply to all blu-ray edtions of this wonderful movie. Even though Harper Lee's book is of course denser in detail and much richer, which always happens because books and movies are different media, I still think it is a fairly good, unpretentious, touching adaptation. I usually dislike kids in US movies, but these are truly an exception, they are just adorable. All actors are outstanding, and of course Gregory Peck's understating acting is truly exceptional. Not to mention the very brief, breathtaking appearence by Robert Duvall at the end of the movie. Elmer Berstein's score is a true classic, simply marvelous. The photography is also beautiful but...yes, the transfer is, once more, fairly disappointing. They have abused DNR once more and the result, although not as badly preposterous as, let's say, ""Sleepy Hollow"" or ""Out of Africa"", is still quite sad. Details are lost, borders appear blurry at times, and, most sadly of all, faces are rather waxy, very waxy at times. I just don't understand the obsession for getting rid of the celulloid grain, which was a natural part of movies for many decades; it was the way these wonderful movies were shot and watched in theaters for generations. Comparison with other black & white classics on blu-ray such as ""Night of the hunter"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" enhances all that is miserably lost in this one. A real shame. One would think that after the ""Gladiator"" affair, which had to be re-released with a new remastering toning donwn the DNR, this mistake would never be made again. But it does seem Universal is getting pretty good at spoiling wonderful movies. After watching the short documentary ""100 years of Universal: restoring the classics"" one feels really sorry that so much effort and care is spoiled at the very end with the absurd DNR obsession. They are even proud of removing the natural celulloid grain, and, gee, that is really upsettting!! Specially in the samples from this very movie, where you can see faces loosing detail and turning waxy as they show the restoration in process...One also fears the worst for future releases. Please, Universal, don't do crimes like this anymore.",1.0

Not only that but it was not fun to watch/read.  The little conflicts Scout and Jem find themselves in are outrageously dumb.  Do not watch, do not read... stay ignorant of Harper Lee.",1.0

I have really come to the end of my rope concerning Universal DVD releases. Why hasn't this film been cleaned up and at least out out on a widescreen format? Their is no excuse for this. They are by far the biggest and the worse dvd distributor in the market. They continually release dvd after dvd with framing errors-no digital transfers-no extra features---grainy dirty negatives without any concern about preserving these films. Its pathetic. To add to all of this they will release these films then pull them over and over again how many more re-releases of one film can you produce?Why? your not adding anything but new crappy artwork for the cover. Whens the last time the original cut of the Blues Brothers has seen the day of light??Now The Jerk is also among your lame releases. GREAT film HORRIBLE release done by the worst in the biz. Simply put UNIVERSAL SUCKS.,1.0

"Until Universal gets its act together and releases a proper version of ""The Jerk"" on DVD, there's really no reason to own this film on DVD.  Save the money and get the VHS version.
""The Jerk"" was Steve Martin's theatrical debut; he also co-wrote the story.  Directed by comedy legend Carl Reiner, ""The Jerk"" doesn't really have a proper plot.  It's more a series of gags strung together.
Martin is Navin Johnson, who was ""born a poor black child.""  Actually, Navin is the adopted son of an African-American family.  The family is dirt poor but happy.  On Navin's 18th birthday he sets off on the road to find fame and fortune.  The fame and fortune come after Navin invents the ""opti-grab,"" a handle for eyeglasses.  Unfortunately for Navin, his invention causes the user to go cross-eyed.
The wonderful Bernadette Peters co-stars as Navin's trumpet playing girlfriend Marie.
For a 2000 release, there really is no excuse for this bare-bones DVD.  It is presented in full-screen format, and the print has aged -- badly.  Every single scratch is shown in the clarity only DVD can provide.  Add to that Dolby Digital 2.0 mono sound and, worst of all, no special features.  Nothing.  This is a movie screaming out for a special edition release.  It's certainly not worth it to buy this for your home theater system.  Save some money and get the VHS version.  It probably will actually look better on VHS.
""The Jerk"" is very funny, and a great debut for Steve Martin.  It's a shame the DVD is so poor.",1.0
"The film itself remains, 21 years later, one of Martin's best efforts (""the new phone book is here! ""), and one of the overall funniest flicks ever, as other reviewers have noted. Why does this DVD  stink, then? It's full-screen only...NO WIDESCREEN! This is blatant  cheapness, laziness, and disregard on behalf of the DVD company, since many  of their other '70s comedy classics (""Slap Shot,"" ""Animal  House"") have been packaged properly with both full-screen and  widescreen options. There's just no excuse. It would've been nicer to see  Navin and his ""Special Purpose"" without the sides of the film cut  off.",1.0

"I was very dissappointed in the technical quality of this video.  Having already seen this film, I was very disturbed to find the first 20-30 minutes of the movie deleted.  There were scenes that did not appear in the movie.  For instance, there is a scene that takes place between Swayze and his wife that discusses his taking the job.  This scene was deleted.  I'd like an explanation for this.  This purchase was made as a X-mas gift. Fortunately, the person who saw it was totally clueless about the deletions, but I was not.  This will definitely cause me to question the quality of Amazon videos in the future.

"Spectacular Epic of Monumental Proportions.  A first-rate action adventure classic suspense sci-fi fantasy country-western educational comedy drama thriller gang-bang documentary.  Head and shoulders above the other great films of it's genre (The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, etc).  Definitely a crowning achievement.  It will probably go down as the #1 movie of all time.  Also, the check is in the mail, I'll respect you in the morning, and I have a bridge for sale.  YOU BETCHA!!!",1.0
"First off, we're given a character that we can't really like: a man who lost his CDL and just got out of prison because he got into an accident that killed someone. Accident or not, someone died through his carelessness and/or incompetence. So what do the filmmakers do? Put him back behind the wheel. Strike one.

Swayze, in addition to driving illegally, is smuggling. Despite his supposed remorse for his prior offense, he has no problem taking a job that any moron can see is a shady deal.  Big strike two.

One of the most ludicrous scenes is when his wife and daughter are kidnapped. The mom runs through the house screaming her daughter's name. The daughter turns around from the bathroom mirror with a blank-faced ""Huh?"" (uh...she totally missed her mom's panic-stricken screeching?). Then, as a reward for all this misadventure, the FBI cheerfully gives Swayze, the killer-behind-the-wheel, his license to drive again. Strike three, and bye-bye. I have no sympathy for this guy and his whiney family at all.

The director should have let Randy Travis sing for two hours; at least that would have given this film some entertainment quality. If you want to watch a halfway decent trucker movie, rent ""Smokey and the Bandit.""",1.0

"The 1971 movie ""The Beguiled"" begins and ends with Clint Eastwood singing.  The movie is worse.  I picked this one out, bought it, and watched it all the way through.  That isn't Amazon's fault.  It's my fault.  Save yourselves.  I wish there were fractional star values for less than one star.  Pamelyn Ferdin was the best part of this movie, and Pamelyn is better known for being the voice of Fern on ""Charlotte's Web,"" as well as starring on ""Star Trek"" in 1968 as a young child, on ""Green Acres,"" ""Gunsmoke,"" other westerns, Charlie Brown specials (as the voice of Lucy), and many other TV series roles as well as several movies.  She can be proud of her acting on ""The Beguiled.""  I'll bet Clint Eastwood doesn't talk about his performance much.  He shouldn't.  The ""R"" rating is for one nude scene that lasts 2-1/2 seconds.  If you have to choose between being beaten half to death or sitting through this movie, then it's an equally bad experience either way you take.

The other actors hammering out their lines as fast as they can, so the next one gets their turn.  I'm normally a huge John Wayne fan and absolutely adore Kathryn Hepburn, just not this time around for either.  And yes, I was extremely disappointed.  Was genuinely hoping to enjoy.

The transfer is terrible.  The aspect ratio should be correct but it doesn't play right on a HD LCD widscreen TV.  It plays in a small box with black bars all around and no amount of fiddling with the setup changes that.  The film transfer is loaded with scratches and color drop-outs which is a shame because this film was beautifully shot in some amazing scenery.

"During the first half of the 20'th century (and before) there were many injustices perpetrated against the negro. Those stories need to be told and understood. This movie tries to tell such a story but failed because it ignored the historical realities. I lived in a place much like the one in the movie in the 50's and was overwhelmed with the liberties the movie took with ""the way it was.""

First, had anybody white or black been caught with their hands in a cash register with 3 dead people around, they'd have been sentenced to die.

Second, the black people in those days were very poor. There were also poor whites. In the movie, these poor blacks wore cloths from Norstrom's! Not the way I remember it.

THird, there were some powerful white landowners that might have behaved as depicted in the movie. However, I often heard stories of charitable acts to the poor blacks. My father, who owned a grocery stroe, gave them food at Christmas. He forgave numerous blacks when he caught them red handed shop lifting. The cruelty and arrogance of the whites in the  movie do not reconcile with my memories. Although I will readily admit such folks existed.

My grandparents had about 20 blacks that worked for them. My mother's nanny was black. I would characterize the relationship as one first of employer-employee, and second as one of affection. My grandmother, and I saw this many times, would be more of a supervisor not a bourbon drinking white ninny. I think my grandmother was more represntative of the way it was than the white woman in the movie. My mother and father tell stories of working right along with the blacks picking cotton.

Fourth, the blacks had a heavy and difficult to understand accent. Living in the west, I often am asked to repeat soemthing I said with my sourthern accent. Similarly, in the south, then negro at that time had a very strong accent...more of a dialect. The movie has them speaking the King's English with a fake accent.

Fifth, the dirt roads in those times were more like two tracks with pot holes, not well manicured packed gravel paths like you would see in a park today.

Again, I truely believe there have been many injustices against the negro. It is unfortunate that this movie could be more historically accurate so that those of us who lived in that era and that location could not be repulsed by the deviations from the truth and more moved by the fundamental stroy.",1.0

"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can appreciate satire and comedy skits but this collection of skits surrounding snippets of a campy space movie just doesn't work. Individually some of the skits are good or at least mildly amusing; like ""Two IDs"" starring Rosanna Arquette and Steve Guttenberg about a fact checking machine that does a history analysis of a man's dating history to let user's know if he's a good candidate. Or Ed Begley Jr. as the ""Son of the Invisible Man"" who doesn't realize he's not invisible and runs around naked.

The best part of the movie was looking out for the familiar faces, some who were popular in the 80s and some who are more popular now. They include the likes of Arsenio Hall, Phil Hartman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Peter Horton, Griffon Dunne, Joe Pantoliano, Joey Travolta, Steve Allen, B.B. King, David Alan Grier, Kelly Preston, Marc McClure, Carrie Fisher and more. If you're into campy this is it.",1.0

"I just watched this again, in a mood to see something I could laugh at, and it never disappoints. I am a HUGE Carpenter fan and whenever I see this remake I wonder what the hell went wrong. The direction is listless, story points that should be subtle are broadcasted, the acting is wooden, and the screenplay reads like something written by a 12 year old from his dad's notes. This seems like the kind of film a pissed off and contractually-obligated director would turn in to the studio - something that might seem ok when viewed in the dailies but when cobbled together is utter, abysmal garbage. But it does entertain - oh yes, in a Mystery Science Theater sweet-baby-Jesus-that-was-bad kind of way. If you want to see a real gem, see the original. Everything that was done right in the 1960 version was done wrong in this one. Watch it with a few friends and a few beers and laugh your ass off.",1.0
"John Carpenter remakes yet another classic horror movie and again it just doesn't work. When you take a movie based on one that is 35 years old, coming from a book that's even older than that, and you try to adapt it to modern day life, something is going to be off. If it had been set in the time it was written, it would have made more sense, but would still have been a pretty weak story. A massive blackout impregnates the town woman with alien children who can see your thoughts and force you to do what they wish. It's not the best story to begin with. Add to that a group of actors who are passed their prime and really don't want to be doing this film and you get another s*** movie that is basically a waste of time.",1.0
