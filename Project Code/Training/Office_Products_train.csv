"I bought this for my husband - his new Bible was too thick to fit in most cases. This one is great, and sturdy enough for a weighty Bible. Plus the leather-like look of it gives it a distinguished, masculine look.",5.0
I was worried when I ordered this case for my Bible (Letra Super Gigante) but felt much better once opening the package. It is darker and more rich in color than it appears to be in the picture. It fit the Bible perfectly.,5.0
"I really like this Bible cover. Rustic look and room enough for a large Bible or a smaller Bible with reading device, journal /notepad and pens. Also has a pocket in the front. Highly recommend!",5.0
"This is a very good Bible carrier for our large print Bible. We were afraid it would not be big enough, but it is exactly the right size.",5.0
"I recently got the Complete-Evangelical-Parallel-Bible-International, which has 4 versions of the Bible, and it fits in this case. What more can I say than that it does its job?",5.0
"My husband is very happy with zippered cover for his new bible.  It is masculine and rugged looking, kind of like him.  Also handsome for any man to carry.",5.0
"Nice book holder, the leather is quite nice and my husband really liked it. I would recommend it to others",5.0
"This is a great cover for the price, especially if you have a large Bible.  Very happy with my purchase.",5.0
I bought this to give to my husband for Christmas. It fits his Bible perfectly. This is a good source.,5.0
"I bought this for the Hendrickson Parallel Bible-PR-KJV/NKJV/NIV/NLT Hardcover (reviewed separately).  It fits perfectly, snug but not tight.  Zipper works good. Material is faux leather or pleather?  Minimal, so don't expect to have room for a set of highlighters or to put your touchpad device in with the book.  Came well padded and protected along with other items in box.",5.0
This oversized bible cover is durable and handsome for a guy to use and it has lots of room in it,5.0
"This is a very sturdy cover that makes my scripture seem more substantial. I have seen others that have more storage, but this is exactly what I had been looking for.",5.0
Exactly what I wanted and needed. Fits my large Bible perfectly. The handle makes it easy to take to church and I love the pockets on the outside.,5.0
Will fit the normal large 9.5 inch  X 7.5 inch bibles. Great leather material. Has pockets for notes and 2 pen holders.,5.0
"This is a very nice cover. I have a Tyndale Life Application Study Bible. It fit perfectly, and had room for a 5"" x 7"" spiral note book. The price was great too.",5.0
"PROS:  The cover fits my Bible perfectly.  Even though it's faux leather, it still looks good.

CONS:  The handle seems to be on the flimsy side.  I don't use the handle much.

SUMMARY:  I would highly recommend this product!",5.0
this was for my 9 year old son.  His bible was getting pretty tore up so I got him this bible cover.  It was masculine enough for him to want to use it.  nice quality too it seems like it will hold up well.,5.0
Very nice and roomy for my Bible and other information.  Well made and the inner Bible holder is a real plus.,5.0
"I will use this in my ministry to hold bibles and Bible literature. You receive a zippered case with handles, Bible cover, long strap, a pad, a pen, and a highlighter. I was only looking for a Bible Cover for my Hindi BSI (OV). The price for this whole set was fabpriceulous, as many covers alone were the price of this set! I ordered 3 colors: Black, Green, and Pink. I am happy with my purchase. I feel that this is sturdy enough to endure daily use. The front pocket of the bag is perfect for either a small notebook or even the small tracts and handbills that I will use. Inside the bag are extending cloth pockets and attachments to attach the Bible cover inside the bag itself. The strap can be used on either the Bible cover or the bag. I had thoroughly examined the pictures of this bag, I thought - but I hadn't noticed the metal ""Cross"" zipper pulls. They were on all 3 bags that I purchased.
I DO like that the bag, though.",5.0
I wanted something I can carry to church and RCIA book. I actually separted the 2 and put my hymn book in the book cover and the bible and other worksheets in the organizer. I love it!,5.0
"This bible study organizer is just the right size to handle my Life Application bible, my notebook and pens. I sleek and large enough for a few personal items, so no need to take a purse to church.",5.0
"Absolutely love this bag/organizer.  Holds my workbook, bible, study book and so much more.  Love that it comes with a highlighter and pen as well as a notepad.  Plenty of room for lots more.  Would recommend to anyone that attends church or bible studies.  All your items in one place.  Really excited to use it.  Got it a lot quicker than anticipated.",5.0
"This was just what I was looking for. A cute, but understated bible-holder-organizer. It's actually much nicer than it looks. It is large enough to hold an over-sized bible study book. I love having everything handy: pad of paper, highlighter and pen. It's really perfection!",5.0
"I wanted a new bible case that I could also carry other items such as my keys, cell phone, glasses, notepad, wallet, loose paper, etc.  This organizer worked out perfectly with room to spare.  The bible cover fits my bible perfectly.  It comes with a pen, highlighter and note pad and it has 3 storage slots on the inside, I just wish it had a few ""creditcard"" pockets for my bookmarks.  I love the velcro hooks that allows you to detach the bible cover from the case.  I saw the lime green/brown and the pink/brown ones in the store for $35. I ordered the black instead because those colors were VERY bright and looked like they would get dirty easily and quickly (they should come in more colors). I didn't have to pay taxes or shipping and it came within two days.  Great product and great transaction!!!",5.0
I got this for my mother-in-law who really loves it.  She loves all the storage compartments and her favorite feature is being able to completely take the bible out without any hassel during a bible study and then easily replace it.  It was cheaper at amazon.com than anywhere else and it arrived a day earlier than even amazon estimated.  Good purchase all around!,5.0
"wonderful bible study bag. has plenty of room for study notes, a notebook, and the pocket on front is perfect for my keys and phone. I also like the fact that the bible case is removable. great features. yes it is large, but for study it's perfect for me. highly recommend and have a friend who bought one just like mine because she loved it so much.",5.0
"I have a large print study bible and I like to carry a journal and the bible at the same time. This is like a small briefcase or purse, but I feel like carrying it and my purse is better than juggling my bible, journal, pens, etc... I would buy this again!",5.0
Perfect size. Nicely made. Very roomy inside. Arrived fast. Packaged well.,5.0
"This is an Extra-Large Bible cover. It has a section inside that you can slip your bible into, and this section closes with a clasp, which is very important because that keeps your bible from getting all wrinkled and squished. But it's much larger than the size of a bible. It's so roomy that it can hold all my little notebooks and pens, and I have a alot of stationery that was making my old bible cover bulge out. I really, really love my new bible cover! One million stars.",5.0
My wife loves it.  Best gift to date,5.0
"I received this awesome Bible cover organizer yesterday as a gift. Wow, I just love all the features: water proof with purses handles plus a removable shoulder strap...out side pocket for easy access...huge inside pocket for note storage...a slot for small note pad (works for either right handed or left handed writers)...pen and highlight loops. Also, a big plus are the hook and loop quick release tabs to pull the Bible out for study. In addition, the organizer may be used as a lap-desk. This item was well designed, in fact I would love to see it manufactured in leather.",5.0
High quality Bible case very well made and holds not only my Bible but essential small items I carry in my purse. With this case I do not need to carry a purse into church. Very conveient and attractive item.,5.0
Great quality and holds everything I need!,5.0
"I purchased this item as a gift for my beautiful sister , and she absolutely loves, loves, loves it!!!",5.0
"Exactly what I was looking for! I needed a Bible cover that would allow room for all the notes, cards and other items that I have slipped into my Bible over the years. Even with all those items inserted, the case stills zips closed easily. The fabric case seems more durable than my old one. The long carry strap is optional. I won't use it, but I'll set it aside for possible future use. Great purchase!",5.0
"I LOVE this Bible case.
I came with a highlighter and a notepad which was great!
I love the look and feel of it and the fact that it holds my extra large Bible.
I love it!
I may purchase again as a white elephant gift... someone will love it!",5.0

"I like this Bible Study Organizer very much.  It is was a little bigger than I anticipated, but I can fit everything inside it, including my study notes and glasses.",5.0
"We are very much enjoying my ""Bible Study Organizer Coal with Leather-Look...""  We had it almost a year and use it every Sunday.  My husband and I put our bibles inside, along with his glasses and other assorted items for our Sunday morning worship.  It is holding up very well and is most convenient.",5.0
I love the look!!!,5.0
This is so cute and handy.  Just way too big for my size Bible.  Good quality too. I love that it had a pen and highlighter and notepad included.  The inside pocket is great size.,5.0
"I like this.  It holds my study notebook, handouts, pen and highlighter with my bible.  There is an outer pocket that I use to hold my phone.  The bible cover is separate and sits within the purse which I prefer to having the bible attached within the bag/purse.  I can take my bible out and leave my note-taking items in the bag.",5.0
I got to have this baby im going to buy this on Friday it God say the same and my sewing machine baby ill be completed.,5.0
Bought for a Christmas gift and they loved it,5.0
My daughter loved it!,5.0
"I love this bag/bible cover. It fits my Key Word Hebrew-Greek Study Bible perfectly. I loved that it came with a pad of paper, pen, and highlighter inside. It has 3 purse-like pockets for my wallets and things from my daily purse, so I don't have to carry a purse on Sundays. Love this so much. I love the extra strap for the shoulder. Definitely a 5 star bag.",5.0
Love it.  Exactly what I was looking for,5.0
"I was worried about the material and how big it was. The material is great (not cheap) and its big, but not overly big.. hangs on my arm/elbow like a purse and carries ALL my teaching supplies and books!!! WONDERFUL AAA+++",5.0
I really appreciate this bible cover! It meets all my expectations and more! It fits my NIV study bible perfectly along with all the extras I have to put in my case! I could not have made a better purchase! Thanks Amazon!!,5.0
Wonderful deal ! Would buy again! Thank You!!,5.0
Love this bag so beautiful my inspire bible fits perfectly in it. Very chic. Will order again. Arrived on time.,5.0
Love it,5.0
"For it's compact size this little ""handbag"" can pack a whole lot of things. I use it for my bible. I can store pens and a few 1/2 inch books along with a workbook and/or notebook. I bought the black one and I love it!

There is an area to place the bible that is much like a book cover that is firmly attached to the ""bag"". You can fully unzip and open your book without taking it out. Great feature for quicker easy pack up and go. The outer cover is stiff and keep its overall shape. The small pocket in front fish mouths a bit for lumpier items and the handles are sturdy.",5.0
arrived as scheduled. I love it.,5.0
love it lot of room in it.,5.0
"This is a great Bible organizer.  I would love to find one just like in leather, though I know the cost would be significantly more.  The set up for keeping materials and the Bible is super efficient. My daughter has one in the pink and brown and she loves her as well.",5.0
Love it,5.0
Excellent Item!,5.0
LOVE IT. VERY NICE AND STURDY,5.0
"Love it! the pockets on the inside left me room to put my sunday school lessons in, some notes and left me room for my bible. I absolutely love the bible cover. It gives a firm cover for the binding and allows you to hook or unhook to the actual case itself. My husband wishes the bible cover was sold by itself because of the sturdiness around the binding and the covers and then instead of the usual cover where it zips around it just snaps. Zondervan will you please sell the covers like you did in this study organizer cover ;)",5.0
"This organizer has everything I was looking for ~ a Bible cover, space for a notebook to take notes, a pen/pencil holder, a holder for a highlighter, and a divided accordion pocket for storing notes.",5.0
Nice it holds large Bible and much more,5.0
"This is a great organizer, I love it! Lots of pockets and space, very helpful for keeping everything neat and tidy. Love that it has a purse strap.",5.0
Well made and useful items inside. Shoulder strap is essential!  You can even remove the part that holds the Bible and carry it separately. It's a great gift too.,5.0
Everything I expected.,5.0
"great organizer, perfect fit for my study Bible....",5.0
my husband loved his,5.0
Came with everything the description said it would include. It also holds my Our Daily Bread Devotional NLT Bible with no problem and still has room for a notebook. Good value overall.,5.0
"Love this! My life application study Bible fits perfectly in the removable inside cover. I can also fit my small devotional or study books in the pockets on the left inside cover. My over-the-shoulder strap was NOT adjustable, but it works just fine for the length I would want.",5.0
Great case! This case is the perfect size!! Holds a notebook and plenty of other things.,5.0
"Awesome!  I love it!  Big enough for my bible study book, bible and notebook.",5.0
"This has been a great purchase so far. Holds my Bible, note pad and pens.",5.0
Very good,5.0
I bought this for a friend and she loves it!  Thank you,5.0
Everything fits in there nice and neat; my Bible my Sunday school book my Monday night Bible study materials. Instead of having multiple things to carry everything is in one very nice organizer bag.,5.0
"This is fantastic and practical and I get many compliments! Love that actual Bible cover is small and unobtrusive, but larger part has room for study books, highlighters, etc.

I use a wheelchair and the strap is easy to toss over back if chair, but size is also easy to hold in lap for service. Very useful for me - especially that I can scoop up my workspace and zip it in to go - nothing goes flying!",5.0
All I needed and more. Love the Bible cover that came with it. Plenty of room. Very sturdy. Not made flimsy. Will order another one in different color.,5.0
"This is one of the greatest organizers I have found for my Nook and other items that I need to carry along with me on a daily basis.

Love it!!!,5.0
Yes,5.0
Looks nice,5.0
Really like this case.  Holds the items I need for study and for church.,5.0
The book over is for one size. Should have some smaller inserts for smaller bibles or sell the removable book cover different sizes. I like this product.,5.0
"I collect Bibles and I read and study them daily. In order to not have it mangled from excessive use I use Bible covers. I bout this one for my mom. We do Bible study together and this cover has a place for everything so you don't have to carry a separate purse or need an additional case to hold Bible highlighters, notepads or additional study items. This has it all. Well made and of very good quality for the price.",5.0
"I fell in love with this straight away. Its a bit bigger than I was expecting but I am certainly not complaining. Now this says the inner bible cover fits the Zondervan Life Application Study bible, and it does, but I notice with mine it sort of crumples the cover a bit as its very snug. Maybe an additional inch or so would be ideal. I enjoy the fact it came with a note pad, pen and highlighter so everything is right at hand when you need it and still has room for additional things. On the inside on the side where your pad and writing utensils go there is an accordion type filing area that gives you some space to file and store Church Bulletins etc. I am very impressed with the quality for the price!",5.0
My mom loved it. The color is great. It is for large bibles and has plenty of space for other books or notebooks,5.0
This was a gift for a friend but I think I will get one for myself.  Good quality. Good product.,5.0
"I have been using this for almost a 1.5 years and it still looks great.  My organizer is used daily as I bring my Bible to work every day and do my devotional while I'm eating my lunch.

I am able to keep my Bible, study guides, church bulletins, pens, highlighter, Post-It tabs, and ruler all in one bag.  I don't use the shoulder strap as I prefer to put the organizer in the crock of my elbow or carry it by the straps.

I am so very, very pleased that I purchased this organizer!  It looks nice and does more than I hoped for.  It is truly a blessing.",5.0
"I really love the bible organizer, the bible case was a little to small but everything else was great. I would recommend this product",5.0
"This organizer is great, because it holds every thing. Plus it comes with a pen, note pad, and a highlighter already in it. I use it for the two bible study's i an in.",5.0
"This bible case is excellent. It has lots of space for bible, hymal, an ipad. plus compartments for other stuff.

I would recommend.",5.0
My NIV Study Bible fits perfectly!  The picture doesn't do the actual organizer justice.  It's must have if you have a bible like mine or similar.,5.0
"I purchased this type of bible carrier because my bible has tabs on it and all the other covers would cause my bible to be in the  ""tab down"" position whenever it was carried, which would crush the tabs.  The added benefits of extra storage for my catechism, papers and pens was perfect.  The bible is inserted into a cover within the carrier and the cover is secured to the carrier with velcro tabs and can be removed, (cover and bible),  whenever needed.  I love this carrier.  Highly recommend it to protect your bible and to carry all your needed material.",5.0
"Got this for my teen daughter and she loves it! It's durable, has a zipper on the back and a place for two pens inside. I was impressed with the quality.",5.0
"I got this for my 8 year old you is getting her OWN big girl bible for Christmas...

This item arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It was exactly as it was described and it looks great.  Thank you!,5.0
My 6yr old loved this cover.  It is rather big for her bible but that just leaves room for a small notebook and a few pencils.  It's girly while not so much that she'll outgrow it too soon.  It is also well made and easy to wipe clean. very happy with purchase!,5.0

For the size of my bible ( 9"" long, 7""wide &  2"" deep) the fit is perfect.  I even have an inch extra both top and bottem.  I was going to buy 2 more but seems to be some kind of problem with the packaging or whatever.  Mine came boxed wih those air-filled thingies.  No problem with mine.  what ever the problem is I hope it gets resolved soon.  I've got 2 more bibles to encase.  Thanks Zondervan for a beautiful case .

"I used this book for my intro college writing course.

"The essays collected here represent a diverse array of opinion and thought, but they are all deeply informative and masterfully written by people whose thinking has had some marked impact on Western society. This book reminded me that I know so little about so many things. It's divided into sections based on subject, like poverty or gender or scientific discovery, so it's easy to find what you need quickly if you're using the book as a reference. Within each section multiple, differing viewpoints are presented on the topics, so the reader gets the benefit of a diverse sort of ""conversation"" between the authors. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about logic, philosophy, critical thinking, or the world in general.",5.0

It was a required book for my son in college.  He got an A in the course - I don't know if it was because of the professor or book.  We would have rented it if the price would have been right.  This was priced right and he was able to resell it and recover a lot of our purchase price.,5.0
"Wow! I was completely impressed on how much I was able to take from these texts! The 8th edition has a wonderful range of ancient to contemporary texts. From Plato to Lao-Tzu, Virginia Woolf, Jim Mason and Pete Singer. Though, I did use this book for a class, what I learned will take me through many walks of life. This book contains enough texts to address (maybe not answer but address) all the complex issues of humanity. This is a great book for extreme annotation, with critical thinking questions from the author at the end of each piece! Awesome!",5.0

"Needed this book for my son's class and didn't have much time to order it, thanks for sending it fast.",5.0
"I bought this book as required for a writing course that I'm taking as pre-requisite. As an adult learner, it's kind of difficult to go back and get stuff that you need for school AND to take it seriously.

The book is organized by the types of writing of the authors noted, from Machiavelli to Marx's Communist Manifesto.

The essay questions were challenging, but really designed to make the student think about the topics being proposed by each author.

I enjoyed working with this book and chose NOT to sell it back (despite that I could have used the money!) because I'd like to work with it on my own.",5.0
"I used this book for my freshman English 1301 class. It is very thorough and interesting. I'm sad to say that I had to sell it because well, I'm a college student and need money! But it was one of the few books that I would have liked to keep.",5.0

We received an actual copy of the book that did not have writing on it or in it. As a brand new book I found that well worth the price. Thank you for having books accessible at a cheaper price. My son had to buy a Buisiness Law book from a college book store that was $365.00. If we sell it to you guys can we get close to the money back.,5.0

"Charley's alphabet approaches the first day of school in time to ""help a child learn the a-b-c's.""  However, along the way there are some mishaps and confusions that require sifting and sorting, searching, and trying again until words are formed and learned.  This book is not only a wonderful alphabet book for children, it is also a view of the reading process for teachers.  Alphabet Adventure is a delight of vibrant colors that cascade the pages of this book.  The carefully written story invites inquiry and higher level thinking.  The language and illustraions provide opportunities for not only enjoying the story, but for conversation between parent and child, teachers and children.  I love alphabet books and was so delighted to find this book that I bought two.  It is a ""must have"" book for Kindergarten and first grade teachers.  Parents and grandparents need to share with young children as well.",5.0
"What a wonderful collaboration!  The story of ""Little i"" by Audrey Wood and the illustrations by son Bruce are wonderful.  This is an imaginative introduction to the alphabet for even the youngest child.  The illustrations are colorful and BUSY.  My children love this book!",5.0
"A,B,C,D,E,F,G-- ""Alphabet Adventure"" suits kids to a 'T'-- Funny, bright - kids laugh with glee-- Next time please read it with me! (and anyone else who loves colorful and wonderful Wood surprises!)",5.0
"As soon as I discovered that Alphabet Adventure was on the bookshelves, I rushed to purchase it.  Being a Kindergarten teacher, I am always looking for quality books to use with the children in my classroom.  Each page of Alphabet Adventure is filled with a wealth of extension activities for children learning their a b c's.  Characterization of the letters will bring interest to the emergent reader as Little 'i' tries to find her dot. I plan to use this book as a springboard for my introduction at a staff development meeting next week.  Thank you Audrey and Bruce for your contribution to the classroom by providing outstanding literature appropriate for the young child.",5.0
"Adorable!  Another winner from Audrey Wood with charming, bold graphics by her son Bruce.  My son will eat this one up.  My daughters were raised on Piggies and King Bidgood.  I understand copies are flying off the shelves.",5.0

"My almost 3 grandson is fixated on the alphabet and refused to sit for any story that didn't contain letters or numbers. With ""alphabet storybooks"" in the Amazon search engine, this book came up. He adores it! The lower case ""i"" looses his dot at the beginning of the story, and we had so much fun searching for its hiding place on each page once we discovered at the end of the book that the dot likes to play hide and seek. My grandson's parents have read the book again and again to him, as have I and many babysitters. The storyline moves quickly and the beautiful illustrations contain so much to look at and discover. A great book for children who don't yet know the lower case letters and a fun book everyone will enjoy reading again and again.",5.0
What an amazing adventure the little letters go on! The kids enjoy trying to find the dot for little i on each page.,5.0
"Nice book with good illustrations.  Our grand kids love this one, and it helps them in learning their letters and finding words associated with letters.",5.0
"I purchased 2 different Audrey Wood's alphabet books for my 3 preschool age children. They love them both equally and have been their new bedtime request. Each page is covered with beautiful illustrations, a story which engages them, & many opportunities to secretly teach my children more about the letters. I purchased them used on amazon & am glad since my kids can get pretty grabby with their books & I feel much better buying a used book in great condition for a fraction of the cost. I would definitely recommend these books for a fun, educational adventure.",5.0
"My almost three year old son latched onto this book as soon as it arrived in our home.  It has beautiful and vibrant illustrations and there is a lot happening on every double page spread.  There is a bit of a plot, where the letters all search for little i's dot, and the dot can be searched for on every page.  My son especially likes the page which shows all of the letters with an object that starts with their respective letter, he can go through and name all of the objects on the page.

Lots of fun to read, we like.  Would make an excellent gift.",5.0
My grandsons loved the first one.............got the other 2 for them for Christmas.  They read books every night before bedtime.,5.0

"I was looking for a good alphabet book for a college course and found Alphabet Adventure.  I was drawn to the colorful illustration.  I brought it home to share with my two boys, ages 4 and 5.  They loved it!!  My five year old is working on lower-case letters in Kindergarten and he enjoyed finding them on the colorful pages.  He liked the Ladybug as a replacement for the dot on the i.  He enjoyed saying the alphabet and he changed the name from Charley's alphabet to Gavin's alphabet.  My four year old repeated the alphabet on every page by finding each letter and pointing to it.  I think this book would be great for preschool teachers and kindergarten teachers for review of the lower-case letter.",5.0
"I wish I could give this book 10 stars! I first saw this book (along with Alphabet Mystery and Alphabet Rescue) in a school book order catalog, and we decided to check them out at the library to see if we'd like them. My 3 year old son loved them so much that we just ordered all 3 in hardcovers because they were only being sold in paperback from school. He LOVES them all, but Alphabet Adventure is both his and my favorite.  This is such a cute book and my son is learning his lowercase letters from it.

I would recommend this book to anyone with small children that are learning the alphabet, or learning to read and write.",5.0
"For Christmas my daughter always receives books so I do months of investigating before making a purchase.  I already knew of Audrey/Don Wood from the Napping House and Silly Sally.  I'm still fascinated by the excellent illustrations in the Napping House.  While browing through an actual bookstore, I ran across their alphabet series and the illustrations looked EVEN BETTER than Napping House so I immediately browsed online and found this book to be the highest rated and most popular and made the purchase.  SCORE!!!  My daughter loves, I love it.  As others have mentioned, Charley's alphabet is going to leave Alphabet Island to help a child (named Charley) when little i loses its dot.  On every page you can find the dot hiding somewhere.  It's really an awesome story and will help your child identify their letters and become more familiar with them.  I can't recommend this book enough.  BUY IT!!!",5.0
"This book is great for many reasons!  1st my boys love looking for little ""i's"" lost dot on every page.  I like how when the red dot goes in the blue water it turns purple, because it opened up discussion on mixing & making colors.  The page where each letter finds an item that starts with that letter is great. It really helps us talk about letters, sounds, and words.  They love that little ""i"" is a trickster and how Capital I outsmarts him.  I like how it references lower and upper case letters.
In the end the letters go to school with Charley and that helps us talk about how my older son will go to Kindergarten.  Every night my boys each get to pick a story for me to read to them, and this is always a favorite!",5.0
"My pre-k age son found this book at the library and loves it so much that he does not want to return it!  The story is interesting, and the pictures are great.  We are going to have to purchase one to have at home.",5.0
"My son cannot get enough of this book!  We first borrowed it from the library (three consecutive times) and then eventually had to purchase it because he wanted to read it all of the time (I thought other kids should have the opportunity to check it out of the library!).  It has really taught him his ABCs in a fun way, and now he has the story practically memorized.  Although I like the book I have to admit that I'm a bit burnt out on it because my son wants to read it at least once a day (it was four times a day when we first received it)!!",5.0
"I borrowed this book from the public library and enjoyed it so much I had to buy it.  It is great for working on the letters of the alphabet with younger children.  They enjoy looking for the missing dot, which is hiding on every page.  The illustrations are very vibrant.  The children I read this story to enjoyed the mystery.",5.0
Alphabet Adventure is perfect for a child in kindergarten who is really concentrating on learning his abc's. This is a very cute story about how the letters help eachother out. My son likes to read this book over and over and can almost read it back to us now at the end of his first year of school.,5.0
"Something looks a little funny. Little letter ""i"" is missing its dot! All the lower case letters of the alphabet go on an adventure to find little letter ""i""'s missing dot.

Once you notice the dot is missing, you and your child(ren) can look throughout the pages to find the red dot. Some are a challenge for little ones to find which makes it fun for the older sibling(s) as well.

This is a GREAT book covering the letters of the alphabet! My 3 yr old LOVES this book. My 5 yr old enjoys it too whenever we can pry it away from my youngest. Since the kids are already into looking for something in each page, I have them look for other letters too. It's a great way to get them to learn their alphabet letters, especially the lower case letters.",5.0
"One of the things I really like about this a,b,c book is that they use lower case letters... not to worry, the upper case letters make an appearance as well .  I bought this book because I found that my daughter was having problems recognizing lower case letters.  That is a ""capital"" problem being that, when writing and reading, most letters are lower case.  It seems that a lot of pre-schoolers learn the alphabet in all upper case, which can later be a problem when they are learning to write and read.

The author used an engaging story taking the little letters and the reader on an adventure to solve little i's problem of a missing dot (be sure to look for little i's dot hiding on each page).  There is also a 2 page spread in the book that shows each letter with an item they picked in order to help little i choose a new dot - s picks a star, h picks a heart, c picks a cherry and so forth.

I like this so much better than Chicka Chicka Boom Boom which uses rhymes that aren't very clever to tell a story that isn't very clever which in turn makes it tedious to read to your child.",5.0
My son and I enjoyed this story. It felt like we were part of the adventure.  The colors are vibrant and fun. Audrey Wood is great.,5.0
"My two and a half year old daughter has shown an intrest in learning the alphabet as of late so I have been buying alphabet books like crazy.  The all time best alphabet book is Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.  This one is also excellent.  It is a bit more sophisticated than Chick Chicka but it engages my daughter all the same.  The premise of the story is that little i has lost her dot and all of the other letters of the alphabet embark on a trip to find it.  The really clever part of the book is all of the background illustrations.  For example there is a picture of a slide with the letter s sliding down it, the letter c is climbing, there are b's on a bridge.  Not only can your child learn the letter's but they can start to connect the letter's to words.  Every time I read this book I see something new. Your child can also help to find the i's dot on each part though this is rather difficult.  The dot is small and well hidden and in my opinion too hard to find.  My daughter only knows where it is from my pointing it out to her so many times.  I have one other small nit picky point. For the letter J they chose a jack o latern.  My daughter thinks of a jack o latern as a pumpkin which starts with p so it is confusing to her.  I wish they had choosen something a littleless open to interpertation for j.  An older child could understand that a jack o latern is a carved pumpkin but an older child would probably already know their abc's and not need this book.  Overall we love this book and the oppurtunities to teach your child from it are endless.",5.0
"I got this book from the library, and quickly put it on our wish list here at amazon.  I really enjoy reading this book to my 3 year old son...who by the way learned the letter (i) from this book and actually drew it on his magna doodle one day!!  Your children will enjoy the storyline that goes along with learning the alphabet. My son requests this book again and again!
I personally love Audrey Wood's books.  Her stories (inc. this one) are always fresh, innovative, fun, and lively, and very creative.  The illustrations in this book are fun, colorful, and make you want to spend time looking at each and every page with your child.
Get this book and enjoy reading it with your child or class, I don't think you or your the kids will be disappointed.",5.0
"Charley's alphabet has been working hard all summer on Alphabet Island, getting ready for the first day of school. But as their teacher, Capital T, lines up all the lower case letters, it finds that lower case i has lost it's dot. The letters look all over Alphabet Island, but can't find little i's dot anywhere and Capital T is becoming frantic. It's the first day of school, they're going to be late and Charley really needs his alphabet. Fortunately, Capital I has a plan. He thinks i's dot is playing a prank and hiding from everyone and he knows a way to make him come out and save the day..... Audrey and Bruce Wood have authored a marvelous picture book, full of charm and humor that pre-schoolers and emerging readers will want to read again and again. Her easy to read, amusing text moves the mystery along at a good pace. But it's Mr Wood's amazing, bold, bright and busy artwork that make this book stand out and youngsters will enjoy all the wonderful details in each illustration and finding i's dot on each page as it plays hide and seek with the reader. Perfect for youngsters 3-7, Alphabet Adventure is a terrific teaching tool and a delightful way for kids to begin recognizing letters and learning phonics.",5.0
"Bold and captivating, this alphabet concept book is a must have for the beginning reader. Not only is the story of the missing dot on the ""i"" appealing, but children can learn and enjoy the letter characters and detailed illustrations. This book would also be great for library story times and back to school themes. Another jewel from the ever-popular trove of the Wood family!",5.0
"The book is a delightful story about the letter ""i"" that has lost it's dot. The illustrations on each page show the dot in different locations through out the book. This is a very interactive book that is great for reading before bed time. The illustraions of the book are vivid and whimsical. Children of all ages would enjoy this book. It is a must have for all those primary teachers.",5.0
I am a preschool teacher and these books are just great to review the letters.  There are 26 books with short and good stories.  Each book is about one letter.  My students love them because they have nice illustrations and they can learn a lot of new words that start with the letter we are learning.  Buy it... you won't regret!,5.0
"The Alphatales Library is a great tool for introducing letters to young children. Each book has extra ideas for parents and/or teachers, a practical page that asks to find items beginning with the letter, and a cheer for each letter as a way to review with energy and enthusiasm.",5.0
I teach students with various levels of social and cognitive skills.  Alpha Tales stimulate and educate all!  Alpha Tales and the suggested lesson guides  printed on the back inside cover of each book benefit children of diverse learning styles.  C. Hodgins,5.0
"I bought this set for my preschool/kindergarten class to help them learn their ABC's.  These books have short stories filled with fun characters which keep the audience entertained. The large pictures on each page make it easy for students to see them during story time. Even my own 6 year old daughter, who ALREADY knows the alphabet, enjoys reading these books.",5.0
"If you are trying to teach kids the alphabet this is a fun way. They actually do have a seperate book for each letter. Some alphabet series combine some of the letters at the end, because they are more difficult to write about, but these have actually achieved what so many before have failed at, they make complete stories about even the most difficult letters (for example - X) and it is still fun. It doesn't seem like a stretch. I also love these because they read like any other story, not like something educational. This way it doesn't bore children. My daughter really likes them and she thinks they're funny. I always let her be my critic because she has a very short attention span and gets bored very easily.",5.0
"I'm an intermediate elementary school teacher...I bought these books for my son, when he was three.  He loved them so much that I also bought them on cd.  He would fall asleep at night listening to these stories...I think he memorized them at first, but he was really reading by 4.  In nursery school, and now in kindergarten, I send in the book which corresponds to whatever letter of the alphabet his class is learning.  His teachers love them too.  I also bought the handwriting book that goes with the series, but that seems more difficult, or for older children than the books themselves.",5.0
"These books are wonderful, the stories are cute and fun to read and the illustrations are enjoyable.  The ""find"" page at the end of the book is great; my kids have fun finding pictures that start w/ each letter.  I highly recommend this book for kids who are learning their letters by sight and sound.  They are AS fun as reading Dr. Seuss stories but kids are learning in the process.  Expensive but WELL WORTH IT!!",5.0
"These books are very fun and have engaging stories. It's so easy to add extra learning opportunities with these as well such as counting, shapes and colors. I've used many different letter formation practice teaching tools and this one is by far my favorite! I definitely would add on the letter formation practice pages with this set. It's a bummer it doesn't come with it (I thought it did) but it's also worth purchasing.",5.0

Item received. Thank you.,5.0
"These books are great! I've been enjoying them with my newly-turned three year old and we both love them. I am a licensed elementary teacher with my Title I (reading and math therapy) certificate. There are many advantages to this set. The biggest advantage is that they are enjoyable. The stories are cute, funny, and entertaining. We never tire of reading them.

The stories are great for read-alouds but do not expect a pre-schooler to read these by themselves. They include quite a bit of rich vocabulary that needs to be explained or talked about. I see that as a positive thing!  We never run out of things to talk about when reading these stories.

My daughter adores the chants at the end. She stands up on and stomps her feet and claps her hands as I say them.

Each book has a two-page picture that says, ""How many things can you find that begin with the letter __?"" From a teaching standpoint, those pages are the most significant as far as phonemic awareness goes. They spend the whole books hearing the sound and then at the end get to practice listening for the sound themselves.

To be honest, I haven't even cracked open the teaching guide as I am not currently in a classroom. Flipping through it now it looks like it contains tips on reading the stories to children, a few short activities for letter recognition practice, and a few thoughts on assessment. The majority of the teaching guide contains mini-book versions of each of the stories that can be photocopied and sent home with the kiddos, along with the cheer.

My mom is a Head Start teacher and after seeing these she is investing them for her classroom as well! I highly recommend.",5.0
Helps the children relate to words of all the alphabet and allows me to introduce vocabulary words,5.0
I've used this set for over 10 years to teach and review alphabet letter sound with my first graders. We use one book a day for the first few weeks of school along with a alphabet letter formation notebook. All of the stories are short and fun. They all have a fun cheer in the back that the students enjoy.,5.0

I purchased this set of books for my kindergarten classroom.  I love using them to reinforce the letter and letter sounds we are studying!  My students enjoy them very much.

The stories add life to some of the monotonous materials that were given to me by my school district.  I highly recommend them!,5.0

"This set of books is wonderful for teaching letter-sound correspondence. There is one book for each letter of the alphabet, and at the end of each book is even a little rhyming ""cheer"" for that letter. I've used these books with preschool age through kindergarten students for years and as a teacher I really enjoy watching the students respond to each one enthusiastically. Each book also teaches a lesson like not being a copy cat or to not tease others, and therefore are excellent for teaching comprehension concepts as well such as sequencing, comparing and contrasting, etc. These books are an essential part of your child's library- it's never too early to start reading!",5.0

"Cute, fun, exactly what I wanted for a first ""tot school"" calendar. It comes in several large sheets that you have to punch each item out of, which can be a little time consuming but not horrible. The paper is a little bit flimsy so be sure to remove them carefully, I would suggest laminating them as well, especially if younger children are going to be handling them. It would be nice if the set came with some sticky tacky or something similar to stick them on with but I just bought velcro dots and that works great.",5.0
Great for any classroom!,5.0
"We use this daily in our homeschool,  I laminated it and put Velcro on the back and it's held up to everyday use for over a year now. My kids love the bright colors.

"Great calendar! For all the other reviewers complaining that it's flimsy...why would you buy this to use WITHOUT laminating it? It would be nearly impossible to interchange numbers and words without laminating it...any calendar would be that way. It cost me about $30 to laminate this at Kinkos. My preschooler loves it (we home school), and has fun doing the numbers and words each day. It's cute, colorful, and I love all of the pieces it came with.

Unless you have been in the teaching industry, you would not even think of using this product. But honestly you don't need to wait for the children to go to school to help them! Home is where introduction such as this activity becomes more meaningful and fun!. In fact, it really helps keep the young ones more involved and observant as well as being proud of their accomplishments!
If you have young ones at home, I would definitely recommend this product, be sure to laminate it, it will last longer...",5.0

"I will take other reviewers suggestions and do a cheap laminating job with clear contact paper, but for the price if it doesn't last long it is not that big of a deal, you can replace it.  It is very complete in its contents.  I bought it for a gift for my daughter who homeschools her 4, 5, and 7 year old and know they will like it.  She has an entire wall that readily accepts push pins so probably will not velcro the items, but it is rather large so velcro and a large flannel board might be a good suggestion for some since the entire months should be displayed with the calendar for recitation every day.",5.0

"We have enjoyed this calendar in our homeschool classroom this year. The kids love adding the new date each time and checking the weather to see whether it's cloudy, rainy, sunny, etc. The cards that came with this calendar are perfect for lower elementary students--as we add the cards for today, we are able to review the days of the week, observe the weather, and recognize which dates are weekends and weekdays or special holidays. I only wish I'd been able to get it laminated. The pieces are made of stiff cardstock, but they still bend and wrinkle a little bit as small hands manipulate them.",5.0

"No, this is not the top quality calendar you will find.  I ended up laminating all the smaller pieces at home and putting velcro on them (nothing to stick them to the calendar with).  But it has been so useful and so much fun for my toddler to do date and weather with.  Aesthetically pleasing.  Lots of different holiday/special occasion fillers to use.  I'd say the material is probably card stock.  Not flimsy, but also probably easy to rip.  If you have access to a laminator, definitely consider this product.  We have loved it!",5.0
"I purchased this for my son, who is turning four this year. He loves everything about school and cannot wait until he gets to start Kindergarten. I decided to get this because I wanted a way to teach him how to use a calendar so he will be prepared for his first day. As a budding educator, I find this set to be educational and fun. My son loves the illustrations and enjoys changing the day and weather cards with me every morning. I would have been super awesome if these came pre-laminated but no one here is complaining. Thank you very much for making such a nice product.",5.0
This chart is a great way to teach weather. My 3 year old and I go to the window every morning (or outside if it's nice enough) to see what the weather is. Then we go to the chart to match the day's weather to the picture and word. It's a great addition to our morning routine.,5.0

I got a paperback and was initially concerned if it would be easy to tear, but when it arrived, I found that the covers are made of a thick somewhat glossy paper that is quite sturdy. Good purchase.",5.0

"Perfect bed time story that ends with sleeping Peppa and George. (I think stories that end with the main characters asleep helps set the tone for sleepy kids. My two love peppa so this would have been a success no matter what.  Peppa and George are polite and well behaved in the story too, only asking if they can stay in the tub longer and brush their teeth longer to put off bedtime. (Normal kid behavior) also I'm pretty sure they read a curious George book before falling asleep. <3",5.0

My daughter is a huge Peppa Pig fan. We've seen this episode so she was familiar with the story. It follows the typical Peppa Pig episode format and isn't a GREAT story but it'll keep your preschooler entertained.,5.0
Cute!,5.0
"Whenever our 3 year old gets into something, we try to find a book or two that goes along with it so when she became obsessed with Peppa Pig we of course had to pick up a Peppa book. If you are at all familiar with Peppa Pig, you have a pretty good idea of what you will find in this book.

 Its bedtime for Peppa and George, but the little piggies are not sleepy. So first they go outside and jump in muddy puddles (of course!) until bath time where they have a grand time splishing and splashing. Although they want to play in the tub longer, Daddy Pig says that bath time is over, so they get on their pajamas and brush their teeth before finally snuggling into bed. With teddy tucked into Peppas arms and Mr. Dinosaur tucked into Georges arms they lay back and listen to Daddy Pig read The Red Monkey book. And as they listen to how the little monkey gets ready for bed, they fall fast asleep.

As you can tell, the story is a very typical bedtime story. But the pictures are nice and the fact that it is Peppa Pig and George is more than enough to make my daughter happy. I don't mind reading it to her every night, it is quick and it soothes her. I do like that Peppa and George listen to their parents, even though they want to continue what they are doing. I don't care for the idea that they are allowed to go outside and play in mud right before bed, but so far the explanation that the rules are different for pigs is working.

Overall, a cute little book that I would recommend to other parents of Peppa fans. I see more of these books in our future.

"Both my kids love Peppa, the way these books are written are the same as the TV episodes so if you haven't watched the episodes on TV then the stories may seem incomplete or lacking in detail. We have watched all Peppa pig episodes at least 5 times! So these books are simply an extension of what the kids watch on TV. They enjoy having me read it to them during bed time and looking at the pictures and pointing out their favorite characters. The stickers in the 'Dentist Trip' were really nice. Great books!",5.0
"Only found out about Peppa Pig in March when my niece was visiting and asked to watch Netflix, saw Peppa Pig and wanted to watch it (I didn't even notice it was there)... this book is the same as the first episode I think... the splish splooshing and rolling around in mud puddles... (double-checked... it's peppa pig season 2 episode 4-2)

We gave our presents to our niece/granddaughter (me 'n my lil sis/our mom) via Skype. Our older sis read the 2 Peppa Pig books (also bought Peppa Goes Swimming) and showed us the pages. Very cool books. As you can imagine the books were the PERFECT companion to Peppa Pig: Hug N' Oink 12 inch Plush (questionable sellers on amazon based on reading reviews so I bought it where ""I don't wanna grow up... I'm a ____  __ kid"")",5.0

"My niece loves Peppa Pig and loves to swim, so got this fun little book for her to enjoy over the summer.  Peppa and George look pretty cute swimming.  Like the arm floaters.

"Like all things ""Peppa Pig"", my 16 month old granddaughter loves these books.  She looks at the pictures and points to her favorite characters and enjoys having them read to her over and over. The book was shipped quickly and was priced right. It's difficult to find ""Peppa Pig"" items in USA stores because it seems that everything Peppa is made in England and you have to find them online.
I like these books so much I bought 10 different books, all published by Scholastic. You can't beat the prices here on Amazon for these books.",5.0

My brother says they will be re-reading this story many times.",5.0

"This was a birthday gift for a 3 year old. She loves Peppa and bedtime stories. The story is simple enough for a small child to read on their own but for toddlers, it makes good book for story time.

"My son loves peppa pig and this book does not disappoint! My son is 2.5 years old and the length of the book is perfect for his age. It holds his attention span and the illustrations are awesome.

"I just loved the Ever After High book series (well still do, since the series started again), and I am planning on watching the series as it seems a lot of fun. :) The characters, the story, the setting, I just love fairy tales, especially retellings, so this one is perfect.

When I saw there was a Yearbook, with art from the official series and the series, with maps, cards and fun stuff I just knew I had to have it. It will give more insight in the series, and make the world come more alive then ever. And it did! I already knew quite a few things that happened, but some stuff was new (the stuff from the series).

I also liked the messages at the beginning and end pages, it really made it come more life + more personal, and it was so interesting to read. They were also different styles of writing/fonts, though at times that made it hard to read (so a few I didn't read because of that reason).

The art was really pretty, though I did have to get used to the non-book series art. It looked a bit weird at times, but after a few pages I got used to it and actually started to like it.

Of course, it has been a few months since I last read Ever After High, so I did have to get used to the wordpuns/word use, but after a while I was just loving it again. So creative.

The book is set in sections with various stuff, from lessons, to balls, to characters and their descriptions. This book won't bore you, if anything you will want to read this book over and over again.

Definitely recommended for those who love this series.

"My daughter is two, almost three and she loves Peppa Pig. I was excited to order this book for delivery on its release date. We read it the first night at bedtime and she listened so intently. There's not much of a plot line, like most Peppa books, and that's perfect for bedtime! They jump in muddy puddles a bit before having a bath, brushing their teeth, and hearing a bedtime story as they fall asleep. That's it! Simple and fun to read. My daughter has wanted to hear it each night with her bedtime books. If you have a Peppa lover, it's a good way to end the day :)",5.0

Sometimes we only go to 30 or 40 and sometimes all the way to 100.  It is nice how the groups of numbers are arranged in a logical manner.  It is up to us to get kids to love numbers and math from an early age. This poster helps. We also do pre K Sudoku with him, which he does happily.",5.0

"I got this book along with 2 more from this series for my preschooler and Im pleased with the material inside this little book. I like that the pages are scored wich lets me make as much copies as I need, some are a little difficult to rip from the book but if you're patient you'll succeed. What I do to store this kind of books(ones you take apart to copy) after taking them apart and copying them, I put the pages in sheet protectors in a binder, just label a divider and Im set. That way they are accesible and can flip thru the pages as needed while protecting them from dust and handling(even curious toddlers). I just wish the price was lower, I just feel that way after buying books that are 1"" thick or so for the same price...
Delivery was fast, product came in perfect condition!",5.0

"Bright!  Big!  Colorful!  Helpful!  My triplet 5th graders were working on place value and having a hard time with the decimals.  I ordered this and taped it on the walls (we are not home schoolers, fyi).  Not only did it have a good number line (hundred thousandths to billions) it came with a great fraction chart, which shows in pie chart form fraction/percentage/decimal equivalent.  My 7th grader is really using the square roots chart.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product for teachers and for parents who have visual learners!",5.0
"My children reference this chart almost daily in our homeschool.  Such a great resource for visual learners!  The long place value chart has been very helpful for teaching decimal place value to my third grader.  My advanced math child checks it when he has questions about scientific notation values.  I love that it has all the information on the same chart so we can compare the values.  The Roman numeral chart goes up to 10,000 - higher than my other Roman numeral charts.  The fraction and decimal equivalents are clear and helpful.  The squares and square roots is a good reference chart.  Personally, I love the colors and the design - colorful but simple.  10 feet long x 9 inches tall, it fits on the wall in our ""schoolroom"" and is not too big for our space.  The fraction and Roman numeral, etc. charts are slim (9"" x 24"") and also fit well on the wall.  I also cut out the tiny charts on the packaging and they are taped to my son's desk.  For mid-elementary and older students it is a true help.",5.0
This place value set is very big and is broken down into about 4 or five parts vs 50 like most place value sets. It is large enough for all students to see no matter where they sit in my class.,5.0
I love this tree in my classroom. The only thing I would like is for the squirrels to be able to be used in the small tree as well. They are adorable but I don't have a tall enough bulletin board to use it at its full size with the squirrels. But other than that it's great!,5.0
"It's super cute, the squirrels are adorable!",5.0
Wonderful! Laminated and ready to go!,5.0
Perfect for classroom decorations.,5.0
"The ""Tree"" is a fantastic addition to the many bulletin board purchases that I have made over the years.  I have many ideas to use it throughout the school year with science, reading, and writing activities.",5.0
"I ordered this kit for a fall bulletin board and love that it comes with green leaves too. I also love that you can extend or shorten the tree trunk. Unlike others, I think the quality of the paper is just right. And maybe what I love almost as much as the product is the box it came in. I finally have someplace to store large items like the tree that I bought in my local teachers' supply store.",5.0
Better than I expected! Thanks :D,5.0
Perfect for school use.,5.0
Beautifull,5.0
These were used for the open house at my school. It was a lot of fun watching the kids try to find their leaf.,5.0
This works well in my second grade classroom. It works well for all year since I can remove the leaves and add snowflakes to the board for winter time. Easy to put together,5.0
"Loved this!!  Good quality and i love that i can reuse it due to the erasable leaves!
It looks great!",5.0
"Nice size..quality material..will last a long time. Like the two different sizes and leaf colors. Used on our Sunday School bulletin board with scattered leaves and said, 'We are Falling For Jesus'.",5.0
This treel is really nice with vibrant colors I used a colored leaves border with  it. The only issue I had was that the tree with the squirrels is too big to use on the bullentin board so I am only able to use it with the shorter tree version.,5.0
"I use this tree with my fifth graders to inspire them from where they were when they started fifth grade and where they will be after growing in knowledge through science, math, reading, and social studies.",5.0
"I like this.  It is big,  And it has a lot more information than my 6 th grader needs right now.  This is a great addition to a homeschool .

This place value system bulletin board set is a must have for elementary and middle school math teachers.  Bright and colorful graphics make it aesthetically pleasing to visual learners and the informational content provides a quick reference for students who need additional support.,5.0
This made a nice topper for my white board.,5.0
would buy again,5.0
"I had one just like this when I taught sixth grade and left it behind when I went to teach high school geometry.  I didn't realize that high school students still have trouble with place value.  I also like the fact that it shows the exponential form, especially for high school students.  I went shopping high and low for another place value set but this is the only one I really liked because the others seem too simplistic.",5.0
The Scholastic Place Value Bulletin Board was a great help in my classroom. I would recommend this product to everyone.,5.0
Perfect for what I needed in my classroom. It is a great resource for my students. It offers so much information,5.0
I purchased this for my classroom. This is my second year using it. I laminated it just to ensure its durability. I don't have any real complaints.,5.0
"Great, and perfect size but a bit expensive.  I am a teacher and on a budget, this definitely busted my budget.",5.0
My wife is a teacher and this was perfect for her classroom. Its perfect for any classroom or learning center.,5.0
This is colorful as described in the picture and  large enough to hang around one wall in a standard size classroom,5.0
"This is a wonderful set for my middle school RSP students. I love that it has the common squares and common fractions. The kids still struggle with place values less than 1, so it's been a great help.",5.0
"The chart arrived promptly and in good condition. I have one place value set that I use for lessons and I also got a set that I cut apart and use for a number line. The demonstration that the number line, that is often used to help the students with place value, has the numbers in opposite order of the number line.",5.0
This helps students understand place value for 4+ digits and decimals.  It's a bonus to have the challenge of also learning Roman Numerals.,5.0

Worked perfect for what I needed for my bulletin board!:),5.0

Perfect to do a huge board!,5.0
It came without any creases & I laminated it just to make sure it would withstand my kids. Love this for our home-school lessons.,5.0
Too cute and really useful teaching kids,5.0
Exactly what I was looking for. My daughter is turning two and is ripping through flash cards at lightning speed. I figured it was time introduce the days of the week along with the calendar. This is exactly what I remember hanging up in my elementary classrooms! I attached all the pieces with Velcro circles. She loves updating the weather and days (with a little help from Mommy). You could probably laminate and hang it on something a little more interesting but foam board is all I could think of at the time. It's quite large but that's not a bad thing considering it catches her attention. Holidays have special calendar days as well as blank pieces to fill in your own. Definitely recommend!!,5.0
Big! Bright! And durable! Love this package. My homeschooling son is very excited to get it mounted.,5.0
My wife bought this for her Kindergarten class.,5.0
"Love this calendar. Had it laminated and it's pretty much indestructible now. The only drawback I can tell as of now is that I wish, and so does my 5 year old, that it had more weather options. Partly cloudy, cold, warm and hot.",5.0
This calendar meets my students' needs for calendar time.  It's large enough for my students to see at meeting time.,5.0
"This is perfect for my in-house daycare.  The giant Sun comes in two pieces which I took to staples and had laminated.  I also laminated all of the rest of the pieces at home just to make them a bit more sturdy so this will last for many years.

It comes with many holiday options, which is really nice.

You will need a way to attach the pieces to the calendar.  For that, I bought some little Velcro dots which worked perfectly.",5.0
"I love it. It comes with everything I was looking for. I also made these cute pockets out of fleece for the numbers, months etc. So that they can be on the wall next to the calendar for easy access. My 3 y/o looks forward to doing our morning calender activities. It is adorable. I took clear velcro small circles and put them in each square and on the back of all the cards.
This is perfect for people on a budget. For the price is gives you what you need. It is not cheaply made. I would definitely recommend this product.",5.0
"I purchased this for at home. My 3 and 4 year olds have been interested in the calendar so I thought this would be perfect! it is brightly colored and the kids love it! We go over the calendar, months, days of the week and weather everyday!  Highly recommend!",5.0

excellent working like new still from the day it was purchase up on till now.. recommend to others.,5.0
I love this! It's great for homeschooling and my kids like to change the date and weather. It help teaches them on a daily basis.,5.0
"Pieces are fairly easy to pop out. I had my 5 year old help and he had a blast doing it. I loved the value for the price. I was glad we went with this choice, since we had to pay to have it laminated (it comes with a finish on it, but it's still not very durable) and for Velcro and magnets (to hang the pieces and hang the calendar). It comes with some blank special days so you can make your own. We laminated them blank and write on them with an expo marker so we can mark a great variety of exciting days coming up. The 4 page idea sheet that comes with is great - gives some great ideas for using it to encourage all sorts of preschool learning. I let the kids (5 and 3 year old - we homeschool) set up the calendar each month and choose the patterns of colors (every other, weekdays/weekends), which makes having the two colors of numbers fun. The big sun comes in two peices, as mentioned earlier and ours lined up almost perfect (slightly off but you can't even tell). The size is perfect - big enough for the kids to see well and manipulate, but small enough to fit nicely on our refrigerator. So pleased with this purchase!!!",5.0
"Wonderful! This uncluttered my sons room and kept him from throwing his stuffed animaks around. More importantly,  more play room! Well bulit and expands upmto 6 feet. Love it!",5.0

"First, I knew these were sturdy ""plastic paper"" but I laminated them anyway for durability. nothing lasts long in a preschool class! I added velcro to the numbers, days, month, etc. 8 months and it's going strong!!

I really have enjoyed it. And for the price, it is truly awesome!",5.0
Great poster but I wish it was thicker . I bought these for my daughter to learn things before preschool,5.0

Love it and so do my preschoolers. Thank you!  It's bright and fun. The kids love the sun and the bright colors,5.0
This calender is unique to me because I haven't seen it any where else. It's an excellent tool to teach calender skills. The colors are eye catching and draws the attention of the third graders in my class.,5.0
"As a former teacher, I believe in surrounding children with useful learning tools that are created with children in mind. My daughter recently turned two and is already leaps and bounds ahead of children her age! By her second birthday, she could sing her ABC's, speak in complete sentences, count to 30 in English, and has begun to use some Greek (numbers 1-10, animals, colors). At 18 months, she had just over 100 words! So, I absolutely believe in spending now to purchase educational items, even at her very young age!

I wanted to begin teaching her about months, dates, holidays, and weather. I looked at many items before finally deciding on this one. It has been a hit!! She LOVES having time with ""Mr. Sun"" after breakfast every morning. We use all the features (Today, is/Yesterday was/Tomorrow is) and she has begun to learn her days of the week. She may not be able to use them in order, but she does know how to say her days! We also use the weather feature -- I have her go look out the window and identify the weather. We absolutely would recommend this to children of ALL ages and to anyone, teacher or parent, to utilize in either home or classroom!!",5.0
In perfect condition. A++++I put it up in my classroom already and the colors really stand out on my bulletin board.,5.0
I guess I should have looked at the dimensions of this product as its much bigger than I expected but other than that the quality is great! I can't wait till we start our new school year to introduce it! One happy homeschooling mama!,5.0
Very nice product! Worth the money. Just need to laminate and use velcro and you are good to go! Thanks for any awesome product!,5.0
This calendar hangs in my two and four year old's room.  I home educate them and we use this calendar quite often.  I laminated everything to make it more durable and attached velcro to the numbers so they can be easily removed.  I wanted to make it so my children can interact with it as much as possible and make it last at the same time.  I have had this since October and seems to be holding up well.  Being a former teacher I think this calendar would work great in the classroom as well.  I definitly recommend this product!,5.0

"This flip chart comes with very catchy songs to familiar nursery rhyme tunes that my kids love! They know the tune, so it doesn't take long to learn the songs. Lots of rhyming too! Great way to learn the sounds of letters. My 4 and 5 yr old use it often and it was well worth the money!
Ex: (Tune: Ms Lucie had a Baby)
Hannah had the hiccups
hic hic hic hic hic hic
and all that hic hic hicupping made Hannah feel quite sick
her daddy didn't worry, he knew just what to do
to scare away her hiccups, he simply hollered BOO!",5.0
The product was just as expected.  Love it and my daughter is using it in her classroom.,5.0
"The letters of the alphabet come alive with these songs set to familiar tunes! The pages are printed on heavy-weight laminated paper, so you could use a dry erase marker to identify the target letter. I am very pleased with my purchase.",5.0
"Familiar tunes, fun and silly lyrics, very memorable and fun for kids. We have the book (which is also interactive) too, and got this for the preschool. We ordered another alphabet song product, it was terrible by comparison. This is the best!",5.0
My students thoroughly enjoy these songs.  It is a great instructional tool for school or at home.,5.0
"I don't know why they have this listed as ages 9-12, but my 2 year old loves this! we do one letter each day, play the song a few times, and we do the letter dance (just a dance we made up for each letter to help her remember them, it's not part of the chart).
I would definitely recommend this for a preschool teacher or a parent of a preschooler to help them learn their alphabet. I also recommend the calendar and time chart too.
They are durable too; she flips them herself.",5.0

This is a great flip chart for preschoolers learning their ABC's. I love the CD that accompanies the flip chart. The songs are unique and catchy...but don't count on your kids remembering them...they're too unique. Great way to have the kids point out the focused upon letter after the song - lower and upper case. Highly recommend.,5.0
"I ordered the ABC Sing-Along Flip Chart & CD for my five year old preschool classroom to use at the beginning of each new letter of the week. The songs are not at all cheesy and the kids even try to sing along with it even though the songs can be kind of fast. The song follows the words on the chart and repeats the words twice. The first time I used this I had each child come up and make a circle with a dry erase marker around the letter we were learning about. That was a long process in which I would not recommend unless you have a small class size or impeccably well behaved children. lol. The next week we did the song and talked about the letter, but this time I added the chart as an activity during center time. The kids LOVED having this choice during centers. Not only does this chart teach about letters, but you can also use it as a fine motor and handwriting tool as well. I would completely recommend!",5.0
"My 3 year old loves these songs.  funny lyrics to classic songs with a sing along book.  She learned these in pre-school so we bought after asking her teacher where they were from.

I wasn't paying attention and didn't realize the flip book was so large.  Thats even more fun for the kids.

Good product!",5.0
Absolutely love love love this chart! Love that the songs go with it and are funny making it easy to learn,5.0
Highly recommend for preschool teachers or home schoolers. I first used this back when scholastic sold it with a cassette tape. I wore that one to shreds. The construction is high quality- pages are thick and wipeable. The songs are so fun to sig and act out. Plus we have the kids take turns coming up and finding the letters in the pages.  I am glad I found this replacement for a good price. I just had to get it. I gave the old one. too taped up to turn the pages to a kid in the class.,5.0
Great product!!  My students love singing along to this book and cd. I would recommend to anyone who needs a circle time idea. You won't be disappointed.,5.0

"This book has so many open ended activites to use in centers that the possibilities are endless.  The activities focus on three main areas-Comprehension, Fluency, and word study.  What is really helpful is that there are activites at 3 different levels for all areas, which makes planning a breeze.  I wish I had found this book years ago instead of wasting my time making file folder games,etc.  Along with the three centers represented in this book I will have a writing and listening center--and I am set for the year!",5.0

"Bought this for my 3yr. old daughter who loves to play with magnets on the fridge. I was looking for something that stood up by itself without it being to big - this is perfect. I also bought her these cool little magnets (at Amazon) that are different shapes in which she can make butterflies, boats etc. All around this by far is the one present she plays with everday. Totally worth every penny!",5.0
This is a convenient place for all those magnetic letters that won't fit on the refrigerator.  It folds flat when not in use and has some heavy duty velcro to hold it in place when it is set up.  A simple design that really works.,5.0
"This worked out perfectly for us.  I homeschool my daughters (ages 2 & 4).  I really wasn't ready to hang a full-size marker board on my wall, but I needed a small board and a magnetic surface.  I love that I can fold it up and put it away.  My 4 yr old can also easily set it up and move it around.  We use magnetic letters, numbers,animals and various school manipulatives on this board.  It also erases and cleans up very nicely with just a dry paper towel.  Good deal!",5.0
"I have a one year old grandson and while I know he is to young to really appreciate this product I have to say, he loves it.  It works great on his fine motor skills and on learning which way the letters should go.  I feel it is really teaching him quickly and look forward to many many days of playing with it.",5.0
"This is an excellent product. I primarily use it to teach my son alphabets and numbers using his magnetic alphabet sets, and the product is serving us very well. We have placed it on the carpet in the play area, giving us a convenient and comfortable place to sit and play with his magnetic letters/numbers etc., which were otherwise languishing and getting stuck under the fridge. I intend to use this to teach my son basic word building etc. as well, since it makes using the magnetic letters so very easy.

I especially love the fact that it can stand on its own, and yet, is so conveniently collapsible. The best part is that one can also write and wipe off on the surface, so, we have begun tracing shapes on the easel.

All in all, very versatile and very useful. I see several years of word building on this excellent product!",5.0

I ordered a set of numbers and a set of letters with this board. It is good size for putting letters up. And they stay there. Have not tried to use it as a writing board because I don't want to make it dirty or messy. It folds up for easy storage. It stands well and I just put it on the floor for my baby. She can put letters on it herself now after some practice.,5.0

"Absolutely love this table top easel. Very sturdy and doesn't take up a lot of room when using it. We use it for magnetic letters and numbers. I haven't tried using dry erase pens on it so I can't rate it from that standpoint. Overall, I would definitely purchase it again (although I probably won't need to given its durability)",5.0
"This is a very sturdy magnetic board that is a great value for those of us who are too lazy or not crafty enough to go out and buy galvanized steel from a local home improvement store to make a DIY board. Because it is made of metal, it is quite heavy, and your child probably will not be able to pick it up and maneuver it around on their own. Keep in mind that when it is unfolded and laying out flat, it is only magnetic on one side, the side with the little logo that says SCHOLASTIC Little Red Tool Box.
Speaking of Scholastic, I didn't pay attention that this board is actually Scholastic brand and not some random small company. I've always trusted Scholastic for children's books and educational items. If brand matters to you, this would be a reason to choose this board over the other Edukid board, although they both seem to be the same product (both have complaints of being a bad dry erase surface).",5.0

"Very popular with the children I see in my office!  This is nice quality light weight material.  I was concerned that it would not be large enough and material insufficient for multiple heavy magnets (I hate the hassle of returns), BUT it is a great size to both use and easy to put away.  I like that it folds for storage, very convenient.  My large magnetic sets are now a new 'big deal,' again!",5.0
This is a great 2-sided board for my daughter to put her magnetic letters on.  It is the perfect size to sit on the floor for her.  I am a teacher and could also see how this would be helpful in my classroom on a tabletop.,5.0
"I can't say enough about this product. I home school my son and this product has been a lifesaver. I do have a full size white board hanging on the wall as well. This is still the board of choice. Its so easy. It stays open in triangle formation with Velcro at the bottom so it stays open very well. When your done undo the Velcro and it folds flat to store easily. I keep it right at the desk so its perfect for any concept you may be trying to explain quickly where the whole wall board is  not really necessary. This is double sided also. Both sides are white boards and both sides are magnetic !! it can be in the middle of  two students and both can use it at the same time without seeing the others work. The board wipes fairly easy but even better if you use some Expo (white board care Cleaner) . Then everything comes right off. I would definitely recommend their product. The price is also very very fair . These white boards , especially magnetic ones, can get pretty pricey.",5.0
"Just as advertised, for the price sturdy enough for a rough 2-year old.",5.0

This board has changed the way my 1st grader and 2nd grader think about spelling.  We use this board on the dining room table with magnetic letters.  My kids manipulate the words on the board and can easily see the similarities in words on their spelling tests.  It's like the light bulb went off when we started using this board to practice spelling words.  I highly recommend it with a set of magnetic letters.  These are the ones we purchased that work great with the board https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECI9EM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 .,5.0
"Great table top board that has given a home to the magnets that used to liter my daughters floor. She really likes the board and plays with it often.  She has just turned two so we are using it for animals and shapes at the moment, but she thinks it is fantastic and I like that when I need to I can fold it flat and put it away. Didn't want a giant easel cluttering up the room.  This fits neatly on her kid table and then folds flat and slips nicely under her book case. I also loved that both sides had the whiteboard/magnet surface.",5.0

"Easy to set up, easy to fold away, two year old loves it. Lightweight. Great  features are it also can be used with dry erase markers and there's two sides to the board. Can be used on floor for smaller children which is where we currently set it up because it would be too high up on a table for a two year old.

P.S. -- These are for my 23 month-old granddaughter.",5.0
"These are a classroom favorite.  Being magnetic and being able to use dry erase markers has made them very versatile.  This has been such a popular item with my students - one that they choose when they have free time - that I've had to use clear packing tape to secure the top of both.  They've lasted a long time, and they are a vital part of what we do.",5.0

I use this in my classroom. It is easy to carry around in my classroom and works nicely with my small groups. Thanks!,5.0
"I seriously don't know how I got along without it before! I am a teacher and I bought it for my guided reading/guided math table. I love that it is magnetic - I don't have a magnetic whiteboard or really anything magnetic in my entire room (except my filing cabinet) so that was a nice plus. From the pictures it looks like it is metal - it's not metal. It's actually sturdy cardboard with a coating over it. I don't plan on letting my kids use it, so the quality for me isn't an issue. All the colors I've used so far wipes off well - the colored expo markers leave a slight residue but they wipe off with a moist towelette. I also like that I can use both sides. I would definitely recommend this product!",5.0
"Both sides are magnetic.  A real plus when you're entertaining more than one child.  The four-year old can find the letters for the words, while the two-year old can find the pictures the words spell.  (I bought letters and magnetic pictures to go with this board).  Both grandkids liked it a lot, which means I like it a lot as well.  Have not even introduced markers, as this will be used strictly as a magnetic board.",5.0

It's a great size.  It folds up and is easy to store away.  You can use as dry erase board as well as with the magnetic letters.,5.0
Our 2 year old loves this we had animal and letter magnets for the fridge and when we purchased we were able to clear up some fridge space along with giving her a mobile play center for her magnets.  Its the perfect size she is able to move it herself along with it being able to be folded up and put away is very nice for clean up time.  We have yet to try the white board to see if it holds up but we just don't want her running around with white board markers yet lol.  Overall would highly recommend this.,5.0
"Rather than have all the magnets on my refrigerator this gives my grandson the ability to play with his magnets and always be in my sight, without my having to be in the kitchen!  The magnetic quality of the board is terrific.  A dual sided board makes it even more fun!",5.0
"Bought this board along with Melissa and Doug wood and magnetic letters and numbers kit.  The size is great for my 2-year-old grandson to play with, and there are 2 sides to use.  This is a big hit in my home and will grow with children as they become more creative...great learning tool too.  I also bought a container of magnetic foam objects so we can work with his spelling as he has now mastered his letters and numbers.  I believe it is also compatible with dry-erase markers for older children.  I highly recommend this board...great size to travel with also.",5.0
I bought this daughter after seeing her interest in magnets at 10months old. She is now 19months and still loves it. My friends 2yr old also enjoys putting the magnet animals on and off this board while reciting their names/sounds!,5.0
This is perfect to use with the magnetic letters! Our refrigerator is stainless steel so we can't play magnet games on it. This is the perfect answer. It's not too big so it stores nice (folds flat) but big enough to spell words (we have the jumbo upper case letters) and sits nicely on the coffee table or play table so it's the right height. My two year old loves it!,5.0
"We had purchased Melissa & Doug magnets & had some made & went looking for a board.  THIS IS IT!  It is so reasonable and has been in use ever since we received it.  You can spell words, put the Leap Frog base on it to put in letters/animals, numbers, etc.  It is also double sided.  Even though it's not intended they also like to put things under/inside the board.  They can roll things through it.  Highly recommend & every child should have one to put their magnets on.",5.0
"Love, Love, Love it! Danica Loves it TOO! It actually works, and seems to keep my little ones attention for longer than normal! It is also a dry erase board!",5.0
"This is one of the best things I've bought my 17-month-old grandson. The easel is perfectly sized for a toddler table. It sits at just the right vertical slant for usage. It's sturdy, doesn't tip over and doesn't slide around on the top of the plastic table despite a lot of activity.  My grandson loves to pull up a chair and take magnetic letters, numbers and animal shapes on and off the easel. It's been perfect for the basics: 1-2-3, A-B-C, spelling his name, and learning names of animals. We've had the easel a couple of months and my grandson's interest has been steady since the beginning. I have another grandbaby on the way, and this is on my top 10 gift list for her!
Side note: I bought three boxes of magnetics (letters, numbers and animals) - this was overkill.  In retrospect, one box of mixed, large-sized magnetics would have been ample to start with.",5.0
"I bought this easel for my 20 month old niece for Christmas because I made her some photo magnets and their frig is not magnetic. The price for this easel is great. Without seeing a real picture, I was worried that it might be flimsy; however, it is quite sturdy and doesn't look like it will wear out easily. It folds flat, less than 1 inch thick when flat. One flap on the bottom is around 1 foot long and the other is about 2 inches. The flaps have velcro on them to make them stick together when the easel is up. The easel stands sturdily on the floor or table.  Both sides are both dry-erase and magnetic. It was exactly what I needed and my niece loved it!

I would recommend this!",5.0
"The book Classroom Management written by Jim Burke is and excellent resource for all teachers. This book gives much needed information about classroom management.

I selected this book to help me keep up with student services for my higher education career. It is really important for me to be informed of best practices and I have found this text very helpful.,5.0
"This is a great overview of Student Affairs work. It is well organized, concise and pretty easy to read. I was accessing it online through the library, but decided it was worth purchasing because it will continue to be a good reference after I finish my master's degree.",5.0
"I just finished reading ""the Green Book"" from cover to cover in preparation for teaching my introduction to student affairs class for yet another semester.  Clearly it remains the gold standard for central textbooks for such classes, though like any scholarly work, there is room for improvement.  The editors surely had a daunting task of creating a comprehensive text for the first year master's student in student affairs, to introduce that audience to such a dynamic profession.  They accomplished this task very well by gathering highly accomplished leaders in the field (one might say 'the usual suspects' for the most part) to convey their wisdom.  The book reflects the prevailing philosophy, one might say world view, of the emerging profession of student affairs.  This could be seen as an upside in that it does help socialize new professionals about the prevailing ways of doing and thinking in student affairs.  However, the book does very little to challenge the conventional orthodoxy of the field, namely postmodernism.  In fact, it barely even defines it.  This indeed an omission from the previous edition where Robert Young took the reader through various schools of thought and helped one understand the difference between rationalism, empiricism, pragmatism, and postmoderism.  As one who plans to use this book for years to come, it pained me greatly to see this material abandoned.  The consequence is that people in our field become intoxicated by the postmodernist water in which we swim and fail to critique its limitations.  I should pause to say here that the chapter that replaced Young's chapter on Philosophies and Values in the new 5th edition was, in my view, one of the strongest in the way of what it did contain.  What is missing is more from the book (a chapter on philosophies and world views impacting student affairs) more than what is in the current chapter on philosophies and values.

The selection of chapter authors seems motivated by an insiders or emic perspective, reinforcing the postmodernist bent of the book as well.  This comes with the strengths of having authors write about topics that they have researched in the past, thus theoretically providing a stronger review of that subject matter.  The limitation this provides is that the chapters may suffer from a lack of objectivity.  For example, there has been a great deal of criticism recently of the National Survey of Student Engagement, and further research published in the Journal of College Student Development regarding whether students are able to accurately report a self-reported gain.  Such research undermines the accuracy of the NSSE.  Yet, the chapter written about Student Success is written by the author of NSSE and focuses inordinate attention upon it.  Clearly, that person should be a chapter author in this work -- but perhaps someone else might have written about Student Success who could offer a more objective, and critical, review of the subject matter in this chapter.

Some chapters were particularly strong.  Gary Pavela did a super job addressing selected legal issues, Kezar brought Organizational Theory (an otherwise sleepy subject to many) to life, Komives did a bang-up job with Leadership, and Arminio gave a refreshing piece on Professionalism.  Though well intentioned, a new chapter on strategy and intentionality seemed to miss the boat on helping student affairs professionals understand what strategic planning processes are like at their institution -- these processes are important for folks to understand regardless of their level in the organization.

On the whole, Student Services remains a great choice for a primary textbook for introduction to student affairs classes.  There is nothing else on the market that comes anywhere close to its breadth and quality.  Some years from now, we can look forward to a 6th edition!",5.0

Arrived just as expected. Everything went smoothly.,5.0
"An easy-to-digest overview of foundational information about higher education, it's various forms and functions, and the functional areas within the field of student affairs. Several chapters also address some essential competencies of student affairs professionals, such as ethical behavior, and many of the chapters give examples of how the information can be put into practice (such as those on assessment). Overall, a good introduction to the student affairs field and an asset to the Foundations and Functions of College Student Personnel course that I took.",5.0
"Let's face it, this isn't a book you buy for some light beach reading. The Harlequin section of Amazon is ====> that way in case you clicked on the wrong link or something.

That having been said, this was the first book I read for my Student Affairs master's program, and it was actually FUN (say what?); mostly because it explores a lot of the core concepts you might have picked up while working as an RA in school or an admissions counselor straight out of college, but you had no idea how the heck how to use these ideas in a professional and ""intentional"" way.---By the way you will be hearing ""intentional"" a lot in your courses---

The writing is pretty clear cut, the cases presented can be illuminating. It will definitely give you the foundational knowledge you need for the rest of your courses and beyond. I have kept this book on my shelf because it is a pretty good resource to go back to when trying to identify challenges or solutions I may be unfamiliar with in higher education.

Join professional networks, bug your mentors, relish group projects (for the first time maybe), organize a cohort BBQ, work hard and have fun!",5.0

"The reason I purchased this notebook (more aptly called a notepad) was its cover. Specifically I planned to separate it from its signature and use it in a collage art journal project. If you are interested in the cover for an art project or otherwise, there are a couple things to note:

* The front/back covers are glossy
* In the upper right of the front cover there is a small, yet noticeable ""green edition"" logo (this may not be the case for every pad, just note it's possible you may snag one)
* The barcode and company blurb are poorly placed on the back cover and obscure an entire butterfly
* As a nice touch, the inside back cover notes the artist along with a rundown of each of the butterflies depicted

Beyond that, there are a few other notes:

* The binding is glued, not sewn so it doesn't open flat unless you coax it to
* This is a thin, though not overly scant pad of paper (30 sheets/60 pages)
* Its measurements are similar to a standard postcard (just shy of 5.75"" x 4.25"")
* The paper quality is actually better than I expected--smooth, bright white, ~25lb; it stands up quite well to repeated erasures without degrading; handles oil and gel ink relatively well (though liquid ink will feather and bleed); and can be torn away from the spine with relative ease

I love this book.  It's easy to read and yet conveys tons of interesting information.  It's a work of art.,5.0
The book came exactly in the condition described. It only had slight highlighting in some areas.,5.0
This book is excellent.  Well written and format is easy to read but most of all the accompanying website and lab book - really help in studying.,5.0
"This book is an instrument to understanding our senses and hour our brain interprets the world through this sensory information.  Though, at first, it feels like a Biology 101 class, the author is superb at explaining the  complex processes of our brain and sensory systems.  I am particularly  impressed with the organization and development.  Very real, fun examples  are used to explain some of the phenomenons our sensory system  ""creates"" for us every day.  Concentrating on vision, this book  explores the wonderful world of perception and how we interpret our  environment.  The material will pleasantly surprise you!  My complements to  the author.",5.0

The book was as described from the seller and was in good condition. There was no highlighting in the book and it looked like it was brand new. The binding of the book are also in good condition as well.,5.0
This book covers in-depth how the brain actually interprets various signals from different senses right down to the biological level. There are some very interesting facts. I don't want to spoil too much but one of the most interesting things I read was about how complicated perception really is. Some processing actually occurs before it even gets to the brain. Also the processing itself is not a single chain of signals but different areas have different effects on each other. The brain functions almost like an object-oriented program where different parts of the brain can have different effects on other different parts of the brain. Some really neat stuff.,5.0
"When I got this book in the mail, it was almost in new condition. I could tell it hadn't been used that much, but that was good for me. I would use this seller again for future books.",5.0

"I got this for school, it's a good textbook, not too dull, and just what I needed for my class.",5.0
This disc is amazing to use if you are in Sensation and Perception and rented or bought a book without the cd. It solidified my grade by a whole letter I would wager. You learn the theories and process better because the cd offers videos and pictures and diagrams that assist those like me who learn on more of a visual level.,5.0
I rented this book for my Psych class. It's brand new & includes the CD. Wonderful condition of the book!,5.0
Great book and cd. It was exactly as decribed in the ad and I received it on time. Thanks so much,5.0

Unable to read the writing on the pages where inspirational notes and holidays were marked.  Waste of money.,1.0
"The title is deceptive, at least to me, I was expecting affirmations in this Inspiration diary but it's actually full of quotes from the bible.  I would prefer it be open about that or that Amazon displays that.  If you want biblical quotes its a fine diary.  I returned mine based on it not being a true representation of what it is.",1.0

"I have ordered this calendar for several years and always been very pleased.  This year I ordered two, one came in okay shape, the other is so poorly cut that the pages stick together and it has become virtually impossible to separate them without tearing part of the page.

I am very disappointed...",1.0
"I bought this based on the recommendations of a few review which were quite positive. But then I saw the negative review that said the pages were glued together and the publisher agreed to replace the copy.  I thought the problem would be solved so went ahead and order the calendar. Alas, I just received it and many of the pages are glued together. I had to rip them apart which left ugly rip marks on many of the pages.

It is a shame because the calendar is well done, but the printing is completely unacceptable.",1.0
"This is the laziest, more glaringly cash grabbing calendar I've ever seen.  If you are considering getting one this year, forget it.  And for anyone next year: unless they change the concept, you've been warned.

There is no insight in the questions, just crappy multiple choice questions about the plot.  If you are studying for a test on memorizing the entire Walking Dead TV series, this is a great tool.  If you want any information that isn't face value from the show, move on.",1.0
"I hate it. The hole is too close to the top. It has ripped over and over.....

Please better construction of this calendar!

I punched another hole. My only hole puncher makes the hole at exactly the same point, so I used scissors to poke a hole...as you can see in the photo, the result is a mess.",1.0
Not enough room to write. I didn't even use it.,1.0
"Loved the cover of this book, but when it arrived, I was severely disappointed. Th lesson plan spaces are in columns with no divisions for various subject.

"I ordered this from the Book Depository on Dec. 13 and as of today (1-17-11)..and TWO attempts, I have not received my calendar yet.  Now, granted, I did contact them and they were very apologetic, even sending me a replacement.  In the meantime,though, I went to another site, ordered the same calendar, and got it within 4 days.  So, I'm not sure what the hold up was for the Book Depository. The calendar is very nice, though and I'm glad I finally got it...even if it was from somewhere else!
  And, of course, at this point, I will be asking for a refund from the Book Depository.",1.0
"I ordered this product based on some of the marketing for the product.  One being that the photographs were worthy of framing which is totally not accurate.

It doesnt include a whole calendar of each month before doing individual days.

Next year Ill just buy one in person. It isn't worth thirteen dollars to me.",1.0
"The book was larger than I expected. There was not enough space on each page for documenting daily activities.

I thought I was buying a Chuck Norris Calendar to give as a present to my Dad during an early Christmas celebration, and the barcode sticker labels this as a ""Chuck Norris  2018 Day-at-a-Time Box Calendar"" but it's a Harley Davidson calendar. I even checked inside to see if it was a joke... nope... motorcycles. My Dad doesn't give a poop about motorcycles. What the eff am I supposed to do with this?",1.0

This was going to be a gift, but after I received it, I was too embarrassed to give it away.",1.0
This is not a full size journal. It's half the size stated. Either that or they shipped the wrong size. I needed this for a gift and had to run out and pay full retail to have what I needed in time.,1.0

The clasps were broken and fell off of the sketchbook as soon as I unwrapped it from the plastic.

Does not work with ps4. Seller said you need some kind of adapter and then change the settings.  I couldn't figure out what adapter you need. I just want to plug it in and have it work. Not buy adapters that i don't know if they work or not. Pain,1.0
Absolute garbage. The cover ripped the second time I used it with minimal force. Clearly where the gap is for the lock is a weak spot. I can't believe they can charge $60 for this. The material feels so weak and flimsy that it would look out of place in a 99c store.,1.0

"Product in photo is not what arrives.  Chef hat in photo has cute font with Junior Chef, personalized name, and swirls.  I ordered a kids chef hat 11/26.

Contacted Seller through Amazon, that personalization and colors hadn't been specified by me yet.  Seller finally contacted me and answered questions regarding colors--I ordered a white hat with hot pink thread.  What came was a white hat with plain black stitching without the large JUNIOR CHEF (like the product photo on Amazon).  After contacting Seller through Amazon (Seller had no customer service phone# available or invoice) and several emails back and forth with Seller, finally received a contact phone#.  Spoke with Donnie on 12/15 and he informed me that they would fix the mistake and send out another hat, and would notify management about the misleading product photo.  I emphasized my order of a white hat with hot pink personalization three times while on the phone with Donnie.  Didn't get second hat until 12/24, barely making it in time for Christmas.  This time a hot pink hat came with plain black stitching.  After getting the wrong product two times, I chalked it up to lesson learned and will never order from this Seller again.  Misleading product advertising and terrible customer service.",1.0
I would not recommend this book.  I like the cover and that's about all.  The tabs don't work well for me.  The binding makes it difficult to turn the pages and keep them flat.  Next time I'll purchase one with coil binding.  I don't think I'll be ordering an address book online anymore.,1.0

So if you want to refer back to your monthly calendar you would have to go all the way to front etc..  I would think it would be more better if you have the month, followed by the weekly, then daily for a 6 months period. May I'm the one operating one a weird schedule...",1.0

After putting the wall mount piece up, he put the bolts into the back of the tv and they literally broke off into the tv.

"The content of this calendar is very funny, exactly what I wanted for my desk.

"Too little, I thought this was a paperback book, but it was just several pages.. I would not recommend  it for the money.",1.0
I don't write reviews but felt compelled after receiving this journal in mid December 2012. I am extremely familiar with this style of journal. I've owned many and given many more as gifts over the years -- it's my favorite journal. When I received this particular one purchased from Amazon I was surprised by the leather -- it seemed a little cheaper and significantly less supple than usual. I told myself not to worry about that too much bc leather is a natural product and you should allow for some variation but I guess in the back of my mind something seemed amiss so I checked the paper and it was completely different than the usual paper -- it was too smooth and way too cheap (the paper in a Moleskine journal is far better quality in comparison when normally a Roma Lussa has the better paper of the two). Then I tried to let the journal lay open (as if you were half way through the journal) and it was like a cheap journal that would not lay open (the Romma Lussa usually does lay open so you can write in it with ease). I returned it to Amazon and purchased a Roma Lussa elsewhere which turned out to be exactly like all the other Roma Lussa journals I've previously had. I don't know what to think regarding the one I received from Amazon -- if I received it from a less reputable seller I'd believe it was a fake.,1.0

Most of the issues are the same as I noted here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Beaded-Bookmark/dp/1593593287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf Beaded Bookmark</a>

Used, in Clean Condition. Some Markings. All pages intact. May not include CD, access code, or DJ. A+ Customer Service!

The lack of the CD will make installation pretty much impossible and, once again, the instructions for use are probably in a TXT or PDF file on the original CD.  And you can pretty much forget downloading the installation software off the web.  I even checked out http://www.peterpauper.com/ with the thought that they might have a little section on downloading or installation and there was nothing.  Of course the other problem is that, for older books, you probably can't just do plug-and-play.  I'm sure that you need drivers for something like Northanger Abbey.  I did check Amazon to see if here was a more current version of Northanger Abbey but even the newest versions didn't seem to support plug-and-play.  A couple were even DOS based.

What's different here is that, never mind the lack of a DJ, for that price it really should come with a nightclub.  With a disco ball.  And maybe even a live band.  I know that might make reading hard for some but, what with the voices in my head getting pretty loud these days, it might make it easier for me to get through Northanger Abbey.

Of course there is another theory: Conspiracy.  Note the following examples:

&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Floral-Silhouette-Bookmarks/dp/1593593414/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Floral Silhouette Bookmarks</a>

The Wolf bookmark was just the tip of the iceberg.

Some of these do come with the installation CD, access codes, and DJ.  And maybe even the disco ball.  BUT, and this is only a conjecture, but what if really this has something to do with the BEAD being radioactive.  Yeah, the shipping might be $3.99 but the LEAD LINED shipping container and containment case will cost quite a bit.  Add to that, there are quite a few complaints about the little tassels falling out.  Radiation poisoning?  Coincidence?  I think not.  And then there's that problem of missing CDs and access codes for only SOME of these bookmarks.  So if it is weapons grade plutonium and the access codes are to allow several bookmarks to be used together in a book like, say, Jane Eyre, so that they reach critical mass by the time Jane and Mr Darcy get together... well, who knows what might happen.  (And DJ may be code for Military Consultant.  Just sayin'.)

"Look, I don't own this and I'm not going to buy it. Ok, it looks like a nice bookmark but the thing that grabbed my attention was the ""1 used for $41.25.""  I mean, look at the write up on it: :

Used, in Clean Condition. Some Markings. All pages intact. May not include CD, access code, or DJ. A+ Customer Service!

What good is a bookmark without the CD or a access code!  I mean how am I supposed to get this thing to work without the instructions (which are probably in some TXT of  PDF file on the CD) -- not to mention the installation files.  And without the access code I probably wouldn't be eligible for any upgrades that come out.  OK, OK, no upgrades is probably what you might expect for getting the bookmark used.  But, I mean really, for 41.25 I would pretty much expect -Daily Deals- to send out someone to actually read to me.

And no DJ!  Really!  What am I supposed to do, mix my own music while I'm trying to read?  Have you ever tried doing a decent mix to go with Northanger Abbey, the Canterbury Tales, or Pride and Prejudice?  And don't get me started on Gravity's Rainbow!

"The satisfied reviewers must have received cartridges from a different batch.  Of my two cartridges, one took a lot of prompting and then wrote for about a week.  The other cartridge never wrote at all out of the package. I am guessing it is either defective points or ink viscosity.  When you shake them very hard several times you can get about 10 words of ink out of them.  Then you have to shake them again.  I guess you get what you pay for.",1.0

"After reading all the reviews mostly praising this roller ball refill I purchased the pen and a package of refills.  The pen okay, nothing special but the ink was horrible.  There was no flow at all...skips constantly....I tried all of the refills just make sure I did have a lemon but they were all the same.  I very recently bought several journals from this company and found them to be the best ever so I felt confident....

 I am a pen person, never written a review before but felt this was too bad to be true.  The very best refill i've found and been using for years is the Schmidt...the make refill for every pen from not expensive to top of the line pens...they write like a dream and last for a long time.  I highly recommend the Schmidt for any pen you are thinking of buying.  After all it's the ink that matters.  The pen is just the container.",1.0

Skip this product and find other ones with a 0.7mm tip.",1.0
"The problem is that fine-tip rollerballs don't write. Find ones with a medium (~0.7 - 0.9 mm) tip. Any pen thinner than that just won't put out the ink. They are really hard to find on Amazon, good luck. Other than that, they fit, and they were cheap.",1.0

I really considered purchasing this bc of the mixed reviews, but they were so true. I will be buying from someone else! Shame on Amazon though for allowing some employee to smudge the hell out of the cover, it is very obvious they were wearing greasy gloves or their hands were dirty. What a shame",1.0
It was dusty/dirty and the cover was bent upon arrival. Wasn't in any packaging. There was also small scratch marks on the inside of one of the covers. Not worth shipping back for the price. It went in the trash.,1.0
"I had high hopes in receiving this address book, but when it arrived, it was covered in sticky fingerprints. I bought two..one for my sister and one for me and opened the package in front of her.

I shouldn't feel like I have to Lysol wipe a product the second I take it out of the packaging. Aside from that horrible ordeal, it was a bit smaller than I had imagined (just a tad smaller than my hand).. was hoping for better professionalism for sure and wish this address book was larger as well.

Bookmark is beautiful but arrived bent leaving a wrinkle about 1/4 of the way up. Pretty much ruined,1.0
I bought two of these and one had absolutely no beads on it. I bought two because I have two daughters and try to buy the same so there is no hurt feelings and was surprised about how there isn't any quality control.

"I ordered this map after searching and searching for one that showed Alaska as actual size.  When I purchased it there was an image, that indicated it was a vertical map, it contained Alaska, Canada and the lower 48's.  The map that arrived is a typical map of the lower 48's with Alaska as a tiny box in the lower left hand corner.  Now that I come back to my order, it shower as ""no image available""  My guess is this has happened before and they finally decided to fix it.  Regardless, my son started a project where he is sending a little guy he made out of felt all over the states to get photo graphed so he can learn about the US.  We were stoked when the map arrived in the mail today only to have him left completely disappointed, as well as myself when it was not the correct one.  It will be returned and our search will continue, it boggles me that it's so unbelievably hard to find a map with Alaska, and Hawaii for that matter, pictured in ""to scale"" size, as apposed to creating the illusion they are tiny in comparison to the rest of the states.",1.0

"I bought this map for my classroom. Something that is not clear from the photo is the dismal, dark, dead-foliage coloring. It is much darker in person than it appears on Amazon, and has a black border.

Why all the states are shown as dark olive, purple, dull burnt orange, or brown beats me. Unless your nose is close to the map, you cannot read the names (in black) of most of the states. You can't even easily distinguish the borders of the states! Moreover, the map shows EVERY interstate highway, which makes it hugely busy and adds to the difficulty in reading it.

I am returning this map. I'm sure I can find something better for my 8th grade classroom.",1.0

I hardly ever write neg reviews for products but I was very disappointed that this map was pre-used. There are 8 holes in the map--2 in each corner through the laminate.,1.0
"This was sent to me in a standard, square U1 Amazon box.  The laminated map was rolled into a tube approximately 2 inches in diameter and 40 inches long.  When the box arrived, it had been bent in the middle and the lamination on the map was kinked and damaged, making impossible to display as intended.  The box had no stiffening and the the map was not enclosed in any kind of protective mailing tube, only its shrink wrap which is not designed to prevent damage from bending.

This is very disappointing as Amazon so often gets the packaging right.  Even more disappointing is the ""Leave Delivery/Packaging Feedback"" on the Orders page doesn't actually take you anywhere to leave such feedback, but dumps you into a standard help page with no controls on it to enter feedback.",1.0

"The comebacks and insults in this book are truly lame. Most were old, bad lines. I was embarrassed just reading these let alone using them.",1.0
"The book is attractively put together but filled with the weakest and lamest come backs there are.  It's as if a twelve year old put this together.
Here are some of the insults and comebacks they give you:
""You still think you can be anything you want -- and get paid for it.""
""Are you still paying off your student loans to poseur school?""
""Don't bother me; I'm living happily ever after.""

There is nothing in here you would use in regular conversation.  Nothing to keep in your arsenal to bust out, spur of the moment.
The book is not funny at all, so it's not even enjoyable to just flip through.  Thumbing through the thing you're struggling to find at least one that is humorous.  They lack all originality.  Majority of the things written in here I learned in the early '90s, in grade school.  The other half are the type of slogans you'd see on a fat kids t-shirt, like ""Did you take the short bus to school?""

There are tons of books on Amazon filled with wit and humour, but this ain't one.  This book is a waste of time.",1.0

"I'm a huge fan of pretty much anything paper related as I make all lists, plans etc the old-fashioned way - and Knock Knock pretty much has the market cornered to a T. Not only do their product cater to whatever function, interest or humorous penchant you might have, the paper is also excellent quality - not flimsy like other I've bought. I own probably about a dozen different variations of this particular type of product (meaning the size) - ranging from the basic to do list to packing view decision-making etc. I also have post-it versions and smaller lists. To date, none of these Knock Knock notepads have ever let me down and as a product I would rate them a solid 5/5 without hesitation.

This review is for the WHAT I ATE pad.

The fact that this pad is currently marketed on Amazon for more than TWICE the regular retail price of $6.99 (at the time of my writing it's at over $14!) is absolutely ridiculous - hence my revised rating.

I would also point out that the spaces are VERY small and limited; so if you take anything like dietary supplements or want to keep a more detailed account of what you're eating, this simply isn't going to cut it unless you have tiny, diminutive hand-writing, this is just useless unless all you're writing is single words in each space. Not one of Knock Knock's best.",1.0

I was so excited to get this item in the mail.  I ordered 4 different posters and this was the last one to come.  They all came laying flat in a big box except for this one.  It was rolled up and squished flat with creases and wrinkles all over it.  It was in the same size box as the other sellers but instead of laying it flat they crammed it in rolled up and ruined the poster!!!!!,1.0
Use caution when ordering this product.  I didn't look further down in the Product Details to see that it was the Quick Stick.  I didn't want Quick Stick since I am placing this on a fabric covered bulletin board.  There needs to more detail at the top of the item that says Quick Stick.,1.0

I teach Kindergarten.  My school ordered a class set for each kindergarten class.  It is not even halfway through the year and I already have had one that ripped and is unable to be repaired.  All of the others have holes in them from wear and tear near where my students' backs hit them.  There is no way that these can be used for longer than one year (if they even last that long).,1.0

"Through less than mid-school year,  75% of the large pockets have begun to rip.  In an effort to avoid the very problem that developed, the kids are careful to keep only folders, NOT textbooks, in the large pockets.  Other nylon chairback storage that I used for 5 years prior still have not torn.  I tried these for the additional divisions in the smaller pockets.  What a waste!  These have been a huge disappointment.  I wish I had purchased additional storage pockets like the ones I already own.  Teachers, do not spend your money on these.",1.0

I just got this today and I am so disappointed.  I picked this schedule because of the colors and the ability to write out my son's tasks but that isn't what I received. They sent me the inserts with the clock in the center which is crap because I don't have room to write and no colors.,1.0

"This is a multiplication chart as advertised.  When I opened the very large box, I found the poster with a FRAGILE sticker on it.  The sticker did not peel off.

I must have misread the description because I did not know they were self-stick until they arrived. They would not stick to my classroom wall. Then I tried laminating them so that I could use tape to hold them up. Still no go. I ended up using mounting tape to get them to stay up. They do not look as good as I expected. Very disappointed.,1.0

I can not believe people would actually think to sell a calendar for $40-$50.  It is absolutely RIDICULOUS!!!! What is even worse that someone would even think about buying it!

"This was a US$15 calender sold for nearly US$50. It ended up costing me NZ $125. I would have liked to have known its actual value before buying but no where was that explained. I presumed it was more than a normal calendar and something special for $50.
I complained to the seller who has ignored me completely and I complained to Amazon who said there is nothing they could do. Amazon should not be allowing sellers to charge more than 3 times the value of a product. I will not be using Amazon again and wish to be deleted from your mailing list.",1.0
"Never received the item in time for Christmas, or at all, and was highly disappointed.  When e-mailing the seller, I was given every excuse in the book, including husbands death on Christmas eve.  Funny that she e-mailed me late on Christmas eve and never mentioned this.  Then I was told her computer malfunctioned and then yet again it was her clerks fault for sending it to the wrong address and she didn't have access to her work computer.  You get the picture. Doesn't even deserve a star and this seller should never be allowed to sell for Amazon.com again.",1.0
I am sorry but that is an insane price for a 15 dollar calendar. Not only that but I have to wait until September to get a 2010 calendar because of this dumb price. Who in their right mind would spend that much?,1.0
"Who would seriously pay almost $90.00 for this? I consider myself pretty obsessed with the series but still-I'm not that ""dazzled.""",1.0
I don't know who on earth would pay this price for a calendar. I bought this calendar for my sister way back in September for her b-day and I payed less than $20. It is crazy that they aren't making anymore.,1.0
"I had no idea that there even was a twilight calendar until i just so happened to run into it here a few weeks ago. Then it was $50 and I thought that that was insane...WHAT ARE THEY DOING?!? who is going to pay $100 on a wall calendar. Shame on anyone who does, and double the shame on the seller. I can think of many things that i can do with $100 and buying a wall calendar isn't one of them. I just can't believe it. I'll stick with a plain old calendar for this year thank you very  much.",1.0
"If i could rate this any lower than one star i would! its a few pages of paper, just the same as any other calendar. Whoever this is should think about the people who are true Twilight fans.. i'm sure the majority of us really can't afford to buy a calendar that expensive. More money would be generated if they simply re-printed! Whoever was doing the PR for the calendars and Twilight in general definately slacked off in Australia.. or at least in places other than Sydney and Melbourne... hadnt heard one word about many Twilight things such as the calendar, the Twilight Prom and merchandise in general. Fair enough it has been on the internet.. but alot of people i know, live away from home and don't tend to surf the net while visiting home during the university holidays (early nov to mid feb, and before that are exams and assignments!). By the time many of us fans over here have heard of merch or events its been too late, as the only Twilight information we seem to be able to get is all from searching on the net, and hoping to get lucky. Seeing as alot of us have found out about some awesome Twilight things too late, we're hoping they do an awesome event again when New Moon comes out. as for the calendar.. i will be MAKING my own. its amazing what cardboard, images, photo paper and magazines can become with a little creativity and ingenuity!",1.0
"I searched a lot of places before someone finally told me that the 2009 Twilight Calendar was released by Borders exclusively.  When I went to Borders, they told me they had sold out 2 weeks ago and that they are not printing more.  Who in the world did their PR for this calendar?  I am certainly not paying $94.99 for a wall calendar.  It is just plain absurd.  When Borders got the exclusive rights to print and sell the calendars, they should have looked at the contract a lot closer and not have put a cap as to how many were allowed to be printed.",1.0
$49.89?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? That price is ridiculous. I'm a huge fan but I'm not spending that kind of money on a calendar and if you do your crazy.,1.0
"I am furious with Amazon.  First off for promoting this seller to sell the Twilight for $87.  Who in their right mind would buy a calendar for that amount of money.  I sure won't.  I should have bought it when it was in stores for $13.95.  I didn't only because I thought I'd get it for Christmas.  Since I didn't and the store no longer have it available. I was going to order it here on Amazon.  At first I thought maybe the price was a mistake.  But after reading the reviews, I can see it's real.  How can Amazon promote this I have no damn clue.  I wonder now if Amazon's prices are true for other products or are they exploiting those products as well.  The seller of the Twilight calender should be removed and banned from Amazon.  If you want to charge that high of a price, go to Ebay, NOT here.  I am a fan of Twilight, and this saddens me big time that both the seller and Amazon can pull something like this.  Just think of the young people that truly love Twilight.  I am hunting else where for the calendar.  Plus, this makes me think twice before I order again, for a long time from Amazon.  After reading all these reviews I'm surprised too that the calendar is at that price still and the seller is allowed to do this and rip people off.  And, if it is $87 dollars this tells me that the calendar can't possibly be new, and is most likely previously bought and being sold as a new item.  If anything it should be sold as a used or good condition type product, not new.  Also, no where did I see this calender being sold as a limited edition.  Sure exclusive but not limited edition.  What is amazon and this seller thinking!!",1.0
I had absolutely no idea that these would be so expensive. I have looked everywhere in my area and CAN NOT FIND ONE! The only place that has them are the airport. You have to go through security to get to that Borders. I have been wanting one of these forever. I never knew that they would be sold out so fast. If the price was lowered I would buy it. Now I have to keep looking until I find one.,1.0
"I was searching for this particular calendar for a friend who is a true Twilight fan. I, too, enjoyed the books, and thought I would get a calendar for myself as well.  I have watched as the price has gone from 13.99 at Borders (and I should have gotten them then) to the current price of 87.99.

This is a serious exploitation of the current Twilight obsession of so many people.  If this seller seriously thinks that intelligent people will sit still and pay this price, they are probably correct - if someone absolutely positively HAS to have this item.  Not me - I am headed over to my local Hallmark store for a calendar - won't be Twilight - but it will not be 87.99 either.

I have taken note of the seller's name, and will not purchase anything from them at any time in the future. What a sad commentary on the exploitation of the consumer.",1.0
"I couldn't decide between ""Free enterprise at it's worse"" or ""Serious Twilight buzz killer"" so I just decided on ""Disgusting"" because that is what this is. Someone somewhere should be seriously ashamed of him/herself but I'm quite sure they're too busy laughing their way to the bank.",1.0
$88?  For a calendar?  Better be made out of gold for that price.,1.0
"I just saw, I think it was within the last few days, this calendar go from $49 to $69 to $88.
Shame on Amazon and the seller. What a rip off! I was going to get this as a gift but not for that price.
My suggestion, gather 12 of your favorite Twilight photos, go to Kinkos or CopyMax or local printer and have them make a calendar for you for $15 - $20! They both have online set-ups. I'd rather take the extra hour to make my own...",1.0
Have you lost your mind? An $80 calendar?! I may be a Twilight fan but that doesn't make me an idiot! Good luck selling that at that price! I can run to Borders 20 minutes away and buy the same calendar for $20!!!,1.0
"I would love to have this, but not for this ridiculous price. I went to Borders to get it and they no longer have it. They said it was a limited release, something about they were only licensed to make a certain amount. That makes me angry that they would do something like that just so it would be more collectable. Besides, they would make a lot more profit if they released more. Isn't the whole point of having things like this making the fans happy? They aren't doing a very good job by making it so hard to get.",1.0
"Beautiful!  I loved these cards, have since given them away as gifts and intend to purchase more.",1.0
"This might be the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  As a Christian, I'm appalled that someone is trying to play this off as a portrait of Jesus.  As a lover of art, I'm disgusted that someone is actually making money off this.  It's a Kenny Loggins/David Copperfield bastard, not our Lord and Savior.",1.0
"Jesus looks a little too pervy in this picture for me.  I'm pretty sure that Satan created these cards and is trying to undermine a Lord through this overly intense Jesus.  He looks all stare-y and overly dramatic, like he's trying to read your mind.  And he's also a little too Anglo in this picture.  I thought we all agreed that White Jesus was a myth and that he looked more like the Middle-Eastern chap he actually was.  This Jesus looks like he'd turn into a lobster halfway into his trip around the Sea of Galilee.  Stay away from these fraudulent cards if you know what's good for you, and buy the Spmc Preaching Jesus action figure with the kung-fu grip and the color-change power ring.  That Jesus looks appropriately olive-hued and doesn't look like he's all constipated or something.",1.0

"The Family Plan-It calendar is a good idea with two major flaws:

1) The pages are coated making it unable to use pencil.  Any person with a family knows that you must be able to erase schedules as things change with a moments notice.

"Christian parent BEWARE of this new age mysticism extra-biblical revelation!!!!! Do even a few mins of research and you will see that Sarah Young is a New Age Mystic and is heavily in to NEW AGE ""channeling"" and other occult practices. The book is full of extra-biblical revelation Young claims comes directly from Jesus. God explicitly commands nobody to ""add to (His) words"" and that is (sadly) exactly what New Age Mystic Sarah Young has done with ""Jesus Calling."" Beware Christian as even Satan can appear as an angel of light. READ THE BIBLE. NOT THIS HERETICAL TRASH! Jesus speaks through HIS WORD and the HOLY SPIRIT...NOT SARAH YOUNG!!!!",1.0
"I gave this as a gift to a few people and they all loved it.  It is an easy read and leads one to believe it will be a nice introduction to helping a person build a relationship with Christ. What is does for many people is it replaces time in the Bible with the reading of this book. After a careful read my self I see that, Sarah Young, perhaps wanting a word from God that was more than the Word of God, she ended up being deceived herself. ""Deceiving and being deceived: 2 Tim 3:13, and she has taken millions of Jesus Calling readers along with her. Remember I Tim 4:1 "" Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons."" The writer has made millions of dollars by steering people away from the Word of God (the Bible) and towards Jesus Calling. An example of a misrepresentation that I found on two separate pages that contradict the Bible's true Jesus Christ.  Supposedly she was told by her ""Jesus"" that the last words he spoke after his resurrection and before ascending into heaven were ""I am with you always.""  But the statement made by the true Jesus Christ on the Mount of Galilee were not His last words before ascending into heaven.  His last words were spoken from the Mount of Olives as recorded in Acts 1:7-9, 12. The 2 messages Sarah Young received from her ""Jesus"" contradict the words of the true Jesus Christ in the Bible. Regardless of whether the writer has been listening to a deceptive spirit (I Tim. 4:1) or to her own confused thoughts (1 Corinthians 14:33) or a combination of both, she is misguided and is in turn deceiving others (2 Tim 3:13) whether she realizes it or not.  Believers must search the Scriptures for themselves to see if the things they are being told are really true (Act 17:11) and they must test the voices they are listening to ""because many false prophets are gone out into the world"". 1 John 4:1).  It is not enough that a teaching makes a person feel good if it is not based upon the truth of the Bible, then it is to be avoided.  Unfortunately, believers who are not well versed in the scriptures will not be able to catch untruths and deceptions when presented to them. It is my prayer that readers be more discerning and work to recognize God's truth from man's almost truth.",1.0
"disappointing.  I thought this would be a great gift for my aunt, who loves reading the book Jesus Calling, in the morning before work...  I thought this would have something a little different.

"I really dislike this book and after having used it I am surprised at the good reviews.  I am wondering if the reviewers reviewed the books after having only completed a few of the pages.  This book is only designed to be be reproduced.  It is not good for an individual user.  This is unfortunate because I bought two of them for my homeschool students.  The worksheets themselves are fine but the book is completely unusable if you don't make copies.  And why would I buy a workbook for $15 each if I just had to photocopy the entire book? Throughout the book it will tell you to color and cut out such and such and then glue it onto the next page....the one that we just cut up?!  This isn't just a once or twice occurence like I thought in the beginning of the book.  It is almost the entire section on landforms.  Beyond frustrating.  And frankly, the worksheets aren't worth that kind of effort.  Today I decided to just skip that section (I will read them the info but not have them cut up the book rendering it useless) and I had the kids cut out the book it tells them to make and put in numerical order.  Only it is impossible to do that.  Once put in book form the first page is 1, flip and you are on page 3, next page is two and flip and you are on page 4....scream!  The way they have printed the booklet makes numerical order an impossibility.  As if that isn't bad enough I just flipped to the continents and oceans section to see that the chapter on oceans is entitled The Four Oceans...with a description that goes on to accurately say. ""The five oceans are Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Southern.""  Each photo shows the 5 oceans and each question asks the child about the Four Oceans.  At the end on the quiz they ask the child how many oceans are there in the world and gives multiple choices answers...including both 4 and 5.  A kindergartener should be pretty confused by this point on such an easy topic.  Evan-Moor really messed up this workbook. I wish I could get my $30 back. Argh.",1.0

""We asked 100 women...What part of your bodies do you and your girlfriends spend the most time discussing?""
""What U.S. state do you think has the most beautiful women?""
""Name a bad habit that can make a pretty girl unattractive.""
""Name an excuse that a man uses to postpone marrying his girlfriend.""
It's time to update the questions.",1.0
I received the wrong size and was charged the wrong price.,1.0
This is my first year teaching and I purchased 4 other pocket charts. This pocket chart was not like the other. This one seems as though the plastic pockets were melted.,1.0
Stitching was poor and coming apart. Pockets smaller than advertised. Returned it.,1.0
"My biggest gripe - I failed (my bad!) to read the full product description, instead relying on the short description printed next to the item, and did not realize the calendar commenced in August of 2014. I would not have purchased it if I had known this. I had assumed I would ""lose"" January-June, and still have 11 months remaining...instead I will only get 9 months of use out of the thing  - and for the price I paid that does not seem at all fair.

Additionally, if I had read the reviews - which I normally do, but in this case I thought ""how bad can it be? It's paper with dates and boxes on it, right?"" I would have noted that it is indeed an anti-American piece of....work. As the daughter of a recently deceased veteran I am insulted by the absence of a Memorial Day sticker. Cinco De Mayo is here, all right, along with Labor Day and Earth Day, Grandparent's Day and Ramadan - not to mention TWO each of Thanksgiving, Halloween, Columbus Day, Christmas, New Years Eve, Kwanzaa and ""Hannukah begins"" (because Hannukah starts twice?). But no Memorial Day? Really?? Not acceptable.

Returning is very tempting, but unfortunately I bought it because our schedule has gone completely nuts and I just plain don't have time to sit and wait for another one. So I will keep it, use it, be grumpy at it, and NEVER order products made by Orange Circle Studio again!

Edited to add: I just scanned through the stickers and there are NO stickers related to any of the holidays honoring our veterans or our nation. No Veterans Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day....nada. Now the stinking thing is going back.",1.0
I have received one with failures. For example after 27th August comes 18th December!,1.0
"Did not like this calendar at all. Magnetic strip would not hold securely and hook broke off while it was hanging. Also, did not like the fact that the space for the names was a fold out card.

"I had the 2014,and loved it but regrettably went with a different planner this year. Only reason I'm not buying this is because it should cost $14.99. The mark up here is ridiculous, especially for a planner almost 4 months into the new year ( usually discounted at this point).",1.0
"Just bought this.  If I hadn't already written on it, I would take it back.  This product is a huge slap in the face of every veteran and every true American.  There is a ""Cinco de Mayo"" sticker, but no ""Veteran's Day"" sticker.  There are no stickers for other holidays in other countries.  Cinco de Mayo is a holiday of great significance, in Mexico; it is merely a partying day in the U.S.A.  Shame, shame, shame on Orange Circle.  On the usefulness side, only 10 months will stuff under that plastic holder; you'll never get 15 pages under it unless you chop the older pages out.",1.0
"It is a tear off pad, so by the time I turned each page to mark birthdays, it came off the magnetic backing, so its useless to hang on the side of the frog like planned.",1.0
"I don't like this calendar. It has five months of 2013 pages in it--useless--and it doesn't have a month spread. Also, the wire binding is so large that it's difficult to write anything on the left side (Wednesdays)--it gets in the way. I bought it because of the pocket, but I need to get a different calendar to use.",1.0

This, my friends, is actually a container for storing rice. When it arrives, it has a lovely sticker on it that even says ""rice box"". It will not dispense normal sized dog kibble. The dispenser can't turn, at all. I tried. After waiting WEEKS for this to arrive, giddy at the idea of replacing our current food container with something a little nicer, I was highly disappointed. Now I will have to swing by our local pet food store for a larger container than the one I had originally, as I foolishly dumped the remainder of the bag into this container.",1.0
"I was tired of the spongey type dish wands that leak or the sponge rips off, so I decided to give this style a try. While this brush looks pretty, I find it extremely disfunctional. For example, washing something small like a knife requires a squirt of the handle for soap but it's a waste since you don't need that much. Then trying to wash something like a cup or glass is awkward since the handle doesn't fit into it so you can't even touch the bottom with the bristles. But one of the worst things about this brush is the splatter and ricochet of soap that ends up all over when you're washing something.
I wish I could return it but I have already used it. I will return to the old standby of the spongey style unless a better invention is made.",1.0
Disappointing. Not inspiring or spiritual.,1.0
"This is a no foam shampoo, hair does not feel clean",1.0
I think they would be handy for the car or camping. They are strong and washed pretty well. But more economical to use a regular bar towel for pick ups if your gonna wash it anyway.,1.0
Smelled good when opened.  Lost smell after a few days.,1.0
This calendar is horrible.  The months are in the beginning of the calendar then the weeks after all of the months.  Who does that?  I want the month with the weeks for that month following. The month page the clander is so small you could even write more than 1 event.  I like to look at my month at once.  If you return it cost you $5.00.  I love Amazon Prime but not today with this purchase.,1.0
Yuck,1.0
My marble cutting board arrived damaged (a large chip out of the lower right hand corner) and there were no rubber tips included--the outside of the package was not damaged--now I seem to have no choice but return it through Amazon--paying for the postage--and no guarantee if I order another that it will not be damaged before it was shipped or the rubber feet will be included in the new order--what can you suggest I do?,1.0

If you need it does have everything you need for common core answers,1.0
Useless impulse buy.  Read Pathway to the Common Core by Lucy Calkins and take How to Learn Math by Stanford's Jo Boaler and you are up to speed with the Common Core.,1.0
"This is a terrific idea that was very poorly implemented. Having the Common Core Standards readily available sounded fantastic. Including learning targets or 'I can"" statements was amazing as well. However, as others have stated, the print is so small that the cards are rendered useless for classroom display. Additionally, the ""I can"" should not be on the back of the corresponding standard. Finally, simply adding ""I can"" to a standard is not the proper way to create learning targets.",1.0
"Common Core has been designed by ALEC, big businesses and politicians with a multi level agenda to reach a final objective: end public education. Common Core and High Stakes Testing were not devised by educators, but politicians and businesses like Pearson and Gates . Any questions: read [...]",1.0
"The font size is laughable.
I think it's about a size 12 or 14.
Kids can't read it in the pocket chart because it's so small.",1.0
Don't waste your money on this if you are buying tools to help a child with common core. absolutely useless!!!,1.0
Why would you pay your hard earned dollars to fund this common core stuff more?  Do you really think displaying standards in your classroom is going to help anyone?  Save your money for the time that teachers are phased out of the classroom in favor of computers and you won't have a job anymore.  Its time to stand up against common core ppl and buying their stuff is not going to help this go away.,1.0
"Unusable for the classroom teacher.  Standards are written on cards that are only 16"" wide and @ 3"" tall.  Even students seated in the front row can't read the size of the font.  There are MUCH better free options on various websites.  Save your $.",1.0

Paper is beautiful and I love the colors! ..... BUT it jammed up so many times in my printer that I almost tossed both in the bin! My dollar store paper worked just fine before and after trying to use this paper but its just not thick enough. Im heart broken as I love the pattern. I eventually taped another piece of paper to this one to get it work.... but won't be buying again.,1.0

"I ordered 5 of these and 3 of the other brown owl notepads as well, and NEITHER of these came as notepads. They were still the same owl characters but instead of a note pad it came in a package of 36, three inch tall cut outs, 5 different packages. I did order cut outs in the same order, but I chose the assorted colors cut outs. Never did I click on these for cut outs and I am sure of it. I'm not the idiot that ordered it thinking it would be a magnent, I actually read and double checked product description.

Unfortunately even my colorful owl cut out order got screwed up too. They were supposed to come in the 6 inch size and I got one of them in 6 inches and the other 2 in 3 inches. Not sure who to be mad at for this, Carson Dellosa or Amazon.
Cannot for the life of me how to figure out how to return these things. I am extremely dissasatisfied.

I was SO disappointed that all 3 lines were not on my copy, as advertised. It only says Write It Down. The inside of the book is awesome and gives you plenty of room to jot down memories and a place for a picture. I would suggest you use a bible pen, such as the Micron pens you use to write in a bible. That way years down the road, it hasn't faded or bled through.

I can just about squeeze two entries in  a day which is useless when I'm trying to schedule a family of 5. There is nothing about this calendar that makes it any better for family organization than any other calendar. I used to buy a calendar that had a space per day per person for up to 6 people.

"I gave this a rating of one star, not because the Turn Technologies ResponseCard XR Clicker was a bad product, but because the one I purchased was in AWFUL condition.  When I brought the clicker I spent extra money on the one that was described as ""like new"", however what I received should have been described as ""poor condition"".  The clicker was very dirty (I spent a decent amount of time using Clorox wipes to clean it, as it looked like it had been through the ringer), and the screen was scratched.  I could deal with these two problems, but the clicker does not work correctly either.  The first day I used it and it kept turning off, I thought it just needed new batteries, however I changed the batteries and it still turns off on its own all the time, and does not always record answers.  Unfortunately, I am a very busy college students with some health problems.  This semester I had to return to school a week later then everyone else, so I order this clicker (because I didn't have enough time to get to buy one in person at the bookstore) and thought it would work great.  I was so disappointed when I opened the box, and then even further disappointed that it did not work right!  Even the guy that sits next to me commented on how bad it looked, and tried to help me get it to work.  If I did not need this so badly for class I would have returned it, but I didn't have the time.

"Today was my 10th day of school.  I teach first grade and have good kiddos.  I usually buy nametags that I put down with Velcro, but thought the adhesive ones would be quick and would work well.  They are awful!  Probably half of my class have the corners curling up already on these nametags and they look terrible!!  I have wasted my money.  I usually buy ONE set per year.  I laminate them and attach to the desks with Velcro.  These will need to be replaced before I even get through the first quarter, if they even last that long.  I wasted my money.",1.0
"I loved the design and what this tag included. I thought it was perfect for my first grade students. When they arrived I realized they are self adhesive, which I thought would be great. Then I put them on the students desks. I wish I never wasted my money on these.  They do not stick at all. My students pulled them up within days and not one of them lasted through the first month of school.  Not only to they peel up, but they rip easily.  Do not buy these.",1.0
I was really excited about these until the day after I applied them. That's how long they lasted...1 night. They were curling up the very next day. Waste of time and money.,1.0
These nameplates did not even last for the first week of school. They were peeling off by the second day of school. I would never purchase these again.,1.0
"These don't stick.  I bought these last year and they didn't stick.  I got them by accident this year because I was in a rush to order name tags and I liked the reading strategies on these name plates.  When they arrived and I saw that they were the self-adhesive ones, I sighed and decided to return them.  Then I read the reviews saying how well they stick so I changed my mind and put them on the desks.  We have standard wood type desks.  Everyday I go around the room with packing tape and tape down all the name tags that are coming off the desk.  It is only the second week of school.  Don't waste your money.  Maybe they stack to plastic desk tops?",1.0
"It's tiny and it's made very poorly.  The case it comes in is also very flimsy.  The box top says it's by ""Highlights for Children"", so I bet I could have gotten them for free with a subscription or something...  Most definitely not worth 20 bucks!  Don't waste your money!",1.0

"For those who are non-musicians or buying for a serious music student, save your money and do not buy this.  The music map is drivel except if you reorganized it, increased the font and then MAYBE a possible device to stimulate ideas and topics to start writing about music.  But then you would get more for your money buying a good book on writing.

As for a catalog of an artist's work, you could simply buy an old fashion 5 or 8 subject lined notebook for far less and organize your papers.

The few pages of lines staff music paper is of extremely limited use. As a music composer, if I am working on a medium to large project I requires dozens of pages of staff paper to organize ideas --- and even then I use a music notation program such as Sibelius and Finale. I'd go thru the staff in this within a few days and its small size would make it difficult to legibly write anything more than two musical lines.

A person devoted to music performance, composition, song-writing accumulates a large library over time and for notes, does not need all the puffery this moleskin has.  Just a plain note blank notebook with an address book is enough.

If you are not seriously studying music and are an avid listener, then there may be more use - though I do wonder what the heck you would do with the staff paper.  Judging from the examples, all I can see it being is a quick way to jot impressions of your hearings of music and a brief history of a band.

But even as a music lover, I think this is mostly junk. If you want to have a place to post album covers, articles, etc buy a simple scrapbook to complete.",1.0

"I normally LOVE this product as I am very picky about my planner, wanting both a monthly calendar and weekly pages.  I have used this planner for 2+ years now and ordered again from Amazon, only to have the small/pocket version sent to me and not able to find the med/large size on the site.  I had to go to B&Noble for it (and paid more) and then was disappointed to see that the monthly calendar layout at the front of the planner had changed and was no longer the traditional American calendar layout but a monthly list, European style.  Had I not discovered this by opening the product, I would have returned it but now no longer can.  I'm disappointed with both Moleskine for changing it and Amazon for not sending me the version that I ordered in the first place.",1.0
Have used this product in past years.  Ordered one for 2013 and VERY disappointed.  Poorly constructed.  Would send back but already opened.  The dividing ribbon actually tore one of the pages when I tried to open.  Have already ordered something different and will pitch this one losing $14 but feel I would be miserable all next year trying to use it.,1.0
"I have used moleskine books in previous years, but never have I had a problem with the quality of it up until this order. After opening my package, which arrived fairly quick,the strap that secured the planner broke the first time I opened and closed it. The thing about this planner is without the secure-strap, the pages, after uses and repeated folding it will flare up and won't close properly. I wish they had this one in color pink, that would also been have nice, maybe alleviated the fact that it broke down after .005 of use. I have already placed my name in the damn thing, so I'm guessing I am not able to return it. I am so disappointed. At these economic times you'd expect something that cost $10 would have a little bit more durability than a $5 one. Immediately stopped by a local office depot to a 2013 planner, a cheaper but seems to be more durable. AMAZON, IF YOU CAN READ THIS, I WANT A REFUND-- AND BETTER YET I WANT TO GET SENT A NEW 2012 PLANNER NOTEBOOK THAT IS NOT DEFECTED (since i just went out and bought a new 2013 planner; lets hope my particular purchase was defected and that I will not receive one that also breaks). After this purchase, im really hesitant about moleskine now... Or maybe its better if I had bought it somewhere else?",1.0
Great Journal except the front cover looks nothing like the one pictured here. If you like something plain and black its perfect. I am very disappointed in this purchase.,1.0

Hate it is probably too strong cause it's my mistake. This is NOT the one with the nice thick pages. The pages are super thin such that you can only write on one side. Sure wish moleskin would put a product number or description in the book so when you reorder you can get the one you want.,1.0

Everyone keeps recommending these things, so I thought might give it a shot. I normally use handbooks (much better at taking inks), or cheap assed MUJI books (cheap as s***, flimsy pages, BUT STILL takes inks better than this piece of s***). Since everyone keeps raving about moleskines, I thought I'd get this one since it supposedly takes wet media better. Big mistake. It can't even take dry media much the less wet media...

I've let just text sit on a page for nearly 5 minutes and it still doesn't get absorbed, causing smears all over whenever. There is a reason why it's called a ""sketchbook"", to be able to quickly sketch out ideas and words without waiting forever for the damn ink to dry....

I normally draw with a combination of rapidographs, microns, MUJI gel pens, and pentel pocket brush pens. With the exception of the brush pen, everything else takes almost instantaneously.

With this piece of s***? It's actually been hours since I put ink on the page and when I touch it, it STILL smears... This is NOT a problem with the ink or the pens, because I have used these on multiple other sketchbooks...

Seriously what the hell moleskine, if you're gonna charge a premium on your books, at least make them not be useless piece of trash...",1.0
"I have purchased several of these notebooks over the years.  They were made in Italy with good quality paper that doesn't ""bleed"" (I use a fountain pen).  To my dismay, the label on my recent purchase of this notebook said ""Designed in Italy/Made in China.""  The quality did not seem to be as nice as the older ones, and the paper does bleed, albeit slightly.  I visited Moleskine's website to see if there is any reference to their products being made in China.  There was none, with a reasonable reader being led to believe they are still made in Italy.  This notebook is not low priced (for something to carry in your pocket for notes) and there are many other brands, such as Rhodia (still made in Europe), for less money and of at least equaly quality.

I bought this recently and on the outside everything looked fine, the cover was sturdy and the elastic has well attached. However, when I opened the notebook a few pages fell out; I didn't pull or tug at the page I simply opened it to write and the first two pages fell out. I then opened it up to a few different areas in the notebook and pages thorought the middle and end also fell out. The quality of the paper has also seemed to gone down. Moleskine sheets were never super thick but I could still use gel ink roller ball pens without bleeding through to the other side or leaving strong indents. However in this book it bleeds through to the other side, particularly at the start and end of letters and I use it with a sheet of paper behind the sheet I'm writing on to prevent indents. For a notebook that I purchased in order to be able to jot down notes and random thoughts, this is quite inconvenient.

"I paid $20.00 for this notebook, three times what I pay for the regular spiral bound sketchbooks that I have been using, and thought it would be amazing to use. I was wrong. I filled the first page with writing, using a sakura micron .03 pen. And was appalled when I saw the writing on the other side of the page! Not bleed thru, but so see through as to be practically translucent.
I have a pocket sized moleskine notebook that I have been happy with, so I got that out and found the weight of the paper in the smaller notebook is much heartier. The larger notebook has much too thin paper. So, thinking  I had bought the wrong type of notebook, I looked at the band to see what weight the paper was.  There is NO information on the band about the paper, though that is what their website says.
So...ink didn't work. Maybe pencil would be better? Nope. And crayons too are a wash. In fact, the paper is so thin, not only can you see what is written on the back of the page, you can see what is on the FACING page. Jeez, Louise. I can spend $4.50 for a decent enough sketchbook that doesn't have the ""creative genius"" marketing ploy attached, and get paper that I can use with practically any medium.
I did contact the company. We'll see if they reply, and if their response is good (i.e. ""Free replacement notebook with better paper inside) I might buy moleskine again. Until then, naw. I'll stick with my canson spiral sketchbooks.

Look at the picture I've included of the bleed through with Moleskine's own roller pen designed for use with their notebooks!

Just search Google for Moleskine paper quality and you will see a moutain of complaints about bleed through and show through. I wish I had before I bought this Moleskine. Will not be buying again.

Oh, and don't buy it into the marketing suggesting connections with Chatwin, Picasso, Van Gough and Hemingway. It's all manufactured by Moleskine.[...]",1.0
"Frustrating!

The pen skipped or refused to write from day one. After about 3 1/2 weeks, it stopped completely.

The design is decent, but the execution is pathetic. Especially at this price point. I'm going to try another reviewer's suggestion and put G2 guts in it. Hopefully, that'll fix it.",1.0
"Moleskine notebooks are simply the best, and my expectations for this writing instrument were high. I like the clean, simple look, the size, weight, and square format. I like the click top. I hate the ink.

Ink from gel pens tends to be too heavy in my notebooks, and as a lefty, the ink smudges. Others fine-tip pens tend to be too delicate for my pockets, or I get jabbed when the cap is dislodged. This pen has the pettigree and the looks, but disappoints when it's time to deliver.

Really wanted to like it, but it's terrible.",1.0
"I thought the pen would live up to the quality I expect from Moleskine... I was wrong. The pen is a cheap plastic pen, that does not even work that well. The best feature is that it clips to a moleskine notebook, but that is about it.",1.0
"If you are a Moleskine notebook user like myself, Moleskine pens are an obvious choice.  As good as their notebooks are, their pens are that bad.  They do attach to the notebook nicely, however that's where the love affair ends.  Almost any other rollerball pen you could buy writes and feels better than this Moleskine offering.",1.0
"The material build of the pen is nice, but it has very poor ink flow. I would not purchase it again.",1.0
"Poor quality writes lousy.  I can't believe I spent so much money on a pen that is
no better than a 20 cent Bic.",1.0

"FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENS. I LOVE MOLESKINE PRODUCTS, SPECIALLY THE 0.7MM PEN, BUT THESE GEL REFILLS, THEY ALL CAME DRY, THEY DON'T EVEN WRITE. I'VE BOUGHT SIX OF THESE. ALL DRY.
FOR 4 BUCKS A PIECE, I'VE EXPECTED MUCH BETTER. MOLESKINE SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON QUALITY AND LESS ON OVERDOING THE BRAND/PRODUCT STRECH. A PITY FOR SUCH A LOVELY BRAND.
NEXT TIME, MUJI IT IS.",1.0
"This pencil sucks... It reminds me of a pencil or pen you get when you buy a cheap purse or day planner, no eraser.. For the price of this pen you can buy a set of 3 really nice pencils. Awkward to hold and it is slippery, I took a file and scratched it up just to keep it from slipping.",1.0
Bought this product to use as business journal.  The pages are so thin that the ink bleeds right through.  I wouldn't recommend them.,1.0
NO ERASER!  It's amazing that there's no eraser!  Especially when the idea of a calendar is to be record things and then be able to change them!  What a waste for me.  I want my $15 back.  How do I get a refund without having to send this foolish thing back ?,1.0
"It fell down and never worked again =(
It is the second one I bought, and it happened the same thing to the first one",1.0
"I saw this in a local store and bought it because it looks nice and expected decent quality as it's branded ""Moleskine"".
By comparison you can buy 3 tikky pencils for the same price at a much better quality.

It's cheap plastic, it's unbalanced (the upper side is heavier) and the lead advance is too large.
It also doesn't come with a rubber.
Although I only used it once when I tested it the first time, looking at it the paint on the clip started coming off.

I didn't expect much from a $15 pencil, but I didn't  expect something so crappy from something branded Moleskine either.",1.0
"I don't mind that the pencil is plastic, but the overall build quality is really poor.  Took the pencil out of the package, tried to write with it, and the nib that holds the lead immediately pushed down into the pencil...completely useless.  The whole mechanical portion that holds/extends/retracts the lead isn't firmly glued to the pencil body.  Sending it back.",1.0
"I can't believe I spent so much money for this worthless ""planner"".  Good thing I have no plans!  The only thing I like is the color.  It's just too small for anything.",1.0
"Very disappointed. Two major problems:
1. The led keeps breaking into little pieces inside the pencil which means I'm never able to write when I need to - this is the only function this product is meant to provide and it can not do it.
2. There's no rubber, although this is redundant as a result of point one.
DO NOT BUY.",1.0
"I am not happy with the quality of the pencil after the nib fell out after only two or three months of use. The mechanical lead advancement mechanism has not worked very well for some time now and the finish came off the clip some time ago.  Frankly, for ~$15 it did not live up to the hype.",1.0
"When I receieved my notebook, it had white powder all over it and had a large dent in the back.",1.0

"I was turned on to moleskine recently, and hopped on-board the marketing train. I use several different moleskine products at work, this notebook being my primary. I was dissapointed to find sub-sub-par quality paper inside, allowing feathering and bleed - through even though I use an extra - fine point pen. Cover also scratches easily. I've had this book for about 4 weeks and I've used about 1/3rd of the pages. The only reason I haven't thrown this away is because I spent a decent chunk of change for it and would prefer not to be wasteful. Very dissapointed, this purchase essentially turned me off from any other moleskine products. Previous recommendations to friends will be redacted.",1.0
It is to small for my use. The print on the pages require a magnifying glass to be able to read. I cannot use it at all. It is not what I thought it was.,1.0
I confuse when i select i will prefer large size. The pocket don't let me writr enough. Next time i going to.choose the large,1.0
It was a gift for my brother to journal but he sent it back to me.  I have yet to find a use for it.  It is about pocket size.,1.0
"My last three Moleskines all had manufacturing quality issues. My new one, less than a day in use, just came apart at the binding. On my previous one, the ribbon came out about half way through, and the quality of the outer material was noticeably lower than on previous books. I'm getting the distinct impression that with the rise in popularity the quality is taking a nose-dive, and that what I'm getting now when ordering a Moleskine is no longer worth the price. Based on my recent experience, I was already weary before placing this order, and I'm pretty disappointed by what's happened to what used to be an exceptional item. Time to look elsewhere for high-quality notebooks.",1.0
"I purchased two moleskine blanks to sketch and wash with ink and watercolor. This one and the 'watercolor' version. The later is fine with thick paper made to withstand wet media so no bleed through. This version however is useless if you are sketching and drawing. I tested the paper with Pelikan 4001 brilliant black in my 400 585 fine nib and it marked the page behind it! I moved to my Rotring Rapidographs .35 .25 .18 and only the .35 bled through, but the other two where clearly visible on the back side. Next was the Pilot G-tec, a little worse than the .25 and .18 Rotrings. The Micron 02 was no better.
Next came the lead. A 3mm 4b Caran d Ache and 3 5.6mm leads. A 4b graphite, Gioconda #3 black drawing lead and a Cretacolor sienna lead. The leads fared better but because of the lack of tooth the pressure needed to really lay down some medium embossed the page and left indents on the page behind. Most notably with the 3mm.
Even with a light touch using leads the marks can be seen through the adjacent page. This is essentially a notebook filled with see through vellum. I will have to skip pages and use it for ink and the softer leads as I care little to back up the pages as I move through it.
Even though the watercolor edition is far better I doubt I will buy a moleskine again unless the company steps up and uses a better quality paper. To buy this product just leaves me feeling like an idiot when there are far better paper quality journals on the market. 'Moleskine' may be hip but in the end hip is just an illusion. I'd rather support a company that puts out a quality product",1.0
Bought it for a nice who asked for it from over seas. It is over priced. Do not know why kids want it?,1.0

"The notebook arrived promptly and did not have any thing wrong with it upon arrival.  However, after using it for 4 days (and only two pages worth of notes) there are already two tears in the bottom edge of the cover.

MADE IN CHINA! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! There are plenty of journals of equal or greater quality available that are made in the USA such as the Ecosystem brand of journals.,1.0
cannot return for an exchange - I wanted the larger one . Can nly get a refund then purchase again...Not a good policy .,1.0
Bought this for my wife who is visually challenged. The print is so light that she is unable to see the numbers. This product needs a redo.,1.0
"I have never created a Review here but this Moleskine has disappointed enough to make me do it.

I had a previous one (Same order) and it was the best, i used it for months and filled it entirely using all kinds of media
WaterColors, Ink, BallPoints, Acrylics, etc. Even tho i used all thos mediums i was never able to see the drawing from behind the page, even with black acrylic.

For some reason i ordered another one of the same model and i got some kind of cheap paper Moleskine which is definitely not the reason I loved them. This one has about twice the amount of pages the previous one had and pages are so thin and light i feel like im flipping though Bible pages. I can see the PENCIL drawings bleeding through the pages and if i use watercolors the pages are completely destroyed. To feel the same thickness of 1 page from my other Moleskine i would have to hold 4 pages together.",1.0
"If you are a filmmaker or animator working in professional formats for the 21st century, this notebook offers you no useful tools. The storyboard boxes are ancient 4x3 with small ticks for today's 16x9. This was a very weird design decision by Moleskine and one wonders how it got through design reviews and product testing with real customers. A useful storyboard notebook would have 16x9 boxes with ticks for 4x3. To make it a truly superb storyboarding tool, some of the pages should have a grid superimposed over the boxes and there should be lined areas specifically for notes and shot descriptions.

Buy it if you simply must have the molie brand at your creative sessions and production meetings. Look elsewhere or just draw your own storyboard pages if you need a truly modern and useful tool.

"Quite dissappointed with this product. If you, like me, were under the impression that moleskine products were of supreme quality, disappointment ensues. There are other niche notebook companies out of Japan (Maruman, spelling could be wrong) and Germany (Leucthrum, spelling definitely wrong) that deserved my consideration. I shouldve checked out offerings on jetpens.com. I succumbed to moleskine to take advantage of prime shipping. The paper quality is horrible, its too light and ball-point ink bleeds through, the texture is also not deserving of the $15 price tag. The binding is also quite poor.",1.0

"Since I started using Moleskine journals I've noticed a decline in paper quality with each journal I purchase.  I recently opened a new journal and began writing.  The ink soaked through.  Which surprised me, because the same ink didn't bleed through on the last journal.  The paper on this journal looks and feels different.  I'm disappointed.  Wish they would keep the paper I experienced with the first journal I purchased a couple years ago.",1.0

Never received item. So I can not comment on the quality or performance of it.  I have used other mole skin products that were super.  I suppose this item would be similar.,1.0
"The paper is very thin and the quality of the cover is nowhere near the normal Moleskin standard. This is either defective or fake version. The quality control tag doesn't look real either.

I am very mad at the fact that Amazon itself is the seller. I do value the $6 cheaper in price comparing to buying them from, say, Barnes and Nobles. But I want my trusted Moleskin.",1.0
Bought this notebook to go with a medium leather moleskine cover from Saddleback Leather.  Began using the notebook during the 2nd week of Jan 2017 and by May 2017 the pages have completely separated from the binder.  Very disappointing.  I'm going to look for other options.,1.0

"These are just notebooks, decent in themselves but about 5x the price of similar notebooks for the simple fact that they have appropriated the nonspecific, nonsense name of moleskine, capitalized it to Moleskine, and now pretend like these were the original used by famous people who would all write at Starbucks if they were alive today. They are NOT the original though. The original was no specific company, they were a type of notebook you could buy cheaply at any book stall in Paris (cheap being the operative word; Hemingway couldn't even afford a pencil sharpener when he was using those notebooks!) This particular company learned that the last small business that made those type of notebooks, moleskine with lower case, was going out of business and so they used the name, changing it to capital M as if they were the originators. So go ahead and buy them, fools. I'm sure your ""journaling"" will be much more meaningful in them.",1.0
"After spending many frustrating hours on Amazon's website i thought i had identified the appropriate Moleskine to purchase.  Not until i recieved my selection did i realize it was wrong.

I have since reordered on Moleskines website - i paid a liitle more - but i was secure in knowing my product was correct.  Now i am in the process of trying to send back the wrong Amazon order.

"Absolutely awful pen. $14? Are you serious? It's made of incredibly cheap and flimsy material. Even with this, it might have been worth the money if the pen had actually worked. But it didn't. The pen stops writing all the time, so you have to shake it to get it working again. Then it works for a little while and stops again. This might be the worst rip-off in the history writing instruments. I will never buy another Moleskine product. They are using their cache as a cool company to foist garbage onto an unsuspecting customer base -- a base that has now shrunken by one.",1.0
"Total piece of junk. This pen actually retails for $14.95. i would estimate its true net worth to be about 25 cents. From the cap that is too loose to fit properly and keeps falling off to the limited amount of ink in the cartridge, your Moleskine pen may work as it is supposed to for a day or two. You may be extremely fortunate and get a whole week of perfromance out of it!
If and when you are ready to change the cartridge and happen to purchase the special Moleskine cartridges made exclusively to fit these wonderful writing tools, be prepared for more frustation: the cartridges don't fit. If you try and force things, you will end up with a useless pen and a useless cartridge, Steer away from these pens, folks. They are cheap junk. The notebooks continue to shine but these overpriced pieces of crap are a bad joke (especially at these outrageous prices)!",1.0
"At first I loved this notebook, the paper and hard cover are really nice. After writing in it for five days, the pages are coming out because the binding isn't holding them in. I paid for a nice journal because I thought it would be durable and Im very disappointed it was the opposite of what I heard about the Moleskin brand",1.0
"The one time I don't look at the reviews for a product and I am punished for it.  I have dozens of Moleskine books and will continue to buy them however this is the worst writing device ever made.  I thought that the square design might be useful but I doubt the person responsible for it every tried to take notes for an hour using it.

Slippery, no grip, it feels uncomfortable in your hand - never feeling like you are holding it correctly.  All of the ""cheaply made"" reviews are spot on.  For the price, I expected much better materials and finish.

Horrible...  Moleskine - you should offer a free replacement or refund and take this product off the market.",1.0
"This is one of the few times that I'd recommend reading ALL the reviews before making a purchase. These pens are cheaply made and uncomfortable to write with for any amount of time. The pen feels completely unbalanced when the cap is posted. Therefore, the writer is forced to hold the cap in the other hand or risk losing it when it's put down. Moleskin's retractable pen is worse. There is no solid feel to its use and it will easily break. With both pens I had great difficulty removing empty refills and wound up just throwing these pens away. Please save yourself the time, aggravation, and money. Buy something else instead!",1.0
"I love pen and paper, and I use lots of Moleskine products. However, this is the worst pen I've ever bought that didn't come in a giant multi-pack.  The square shape makes for an incredibly unergonomic fit, but I figured my handwriting is terrible regardless so who cares.  Unfortunately, as others have reported, the pen barely writes at times making it completely unreliable.  For the money you can buy 2 Zebra F-701s, totally different look but a very nice pen for the price.",1.0
Clicker stuck so I took it apart and it worked. Then the tip suddenly would not allow for ink to flow. Too expensive. Would recommend only if it didn't suck.,1.0
"Not recommended. This pen should be so much nicer considering the price. It writes nicely, but I imagine the ink will smear easily if you're not careful. The cap doesn't stay on at all, which sort of counteracts the fact that it clips on your notebook. I'm sure I would lose this pen in a day. I bought it specifically for work and for use with my Moleskine notebook, but it isn't going to work for me. Unfortunate.",1.0
"I really like the look of this pen, just like many others I am a fan of Moleskine but the price vs quality of this pen is ridiculous.
The pen is cheap plastic and the only redeeming factor is that it fits well on top of the notebook, although after extended use it will start to slip off easily.

The ink smudges at the drop of a hat and the inkflow is erratic. The tip of the ballpoint also feels like you're scratching the paper instead of smoothly floating over it while you write (Sorry but a Bic pen has better quality)

I'm replacing the cartridge with a different brands refill as soon as possible, but will probably keep the pen until it breaks or gets lost.
It's a love hate relationship",1.0
"Avoid this pen.  It would be worth the price if the right pieces were made of metal.  Mine broke after 2 weeks.  Moleskine has to assume that if it's going to be clipped to a Moleskine, than it's going to be in bags/pockets/drawers and repeatedly tosses around clipped and re-clipped.  Such a shame for a company that is known for a certain quality notebook.",1.0
"I'll start by saying that I absolutely love Moleskine notebooks, planners, cahiers, etc. and use them whenever I can. I had really high hopes for this pen and therefore ordered both it and every color of ink replacement so I had multiple colors. I thought the shape was cool and loved that it could hook directly on to my Moleskine journal/planner. Wow, was I disappointed. The Moleskine compatibility doesn't do much good when the pen won't write. If I work on it extensively by shaking, heading, and every other method of making pens work I can maybe get a few lines of writing out of it (however broken and inconsistent they may be). Otherwise it is completely useless because it won't write at all. When it does briefly write with full ink I can see that it may have had potential to be a good pen if it functioned. I really can't believe that Moleskine tolerates such a poor quality pen when the rest of their products are greator that they could possibly charge so much for such a mediocre product. For their notebooks I give them five stars...for this useless piece of plastic I'm giving the one because it's not possible to go lower.",1.0
"I'd give it 3 or 4 stars if it weren't for the refills. I can't find a refill that lasts longer than a day or two before it start skipping, and I don't even write a lot. Do a search for the refills on Amazon and read the comments, they're true. It's gonna cost you $5 a week just to keep this writing after the original ink runs out; might as well get a nicer pen. I've always been a fan of Moleskine but this one misses the mark, avoid.",1.0
"it's a Pen.
it writes.
it clips onto things.
it's very much like many other pens i own, with the exception that this one is a  bit more difficult to hold with it's rectangular barrel design.

good for people who hate writing comfortably
but enjoy wasting money.",1.0
"I bought this pen in San Francisco from a small paper shop. I love my Moleskin notebook so I assumed the same care and quality of the name would hold true for this pen.

I opened it up. The barrel is plastic, but light. The ergonomic hold of the pen is good. The barrel fails in quality when you look at the sides. There is some excess ""flash"" on the side where the barrel halves were put together. I would have improved this by at least buffing it down. The pen as a whole is weighted neutrally top to bottom. There is a very fine texturing on the barrel, and this is uneven on different sides.

I naturally wrote some lines with it to test the pen. It worked beautifully. The lines were dark and full, with no uneveness. No smearing was apparent.

The click top failed to work when retracting the pen. Not a deal breaker. You have to use your fingernail on the edge to push it down, then ""click"" your nail off so that the retractor shoots up quickly.

The next day I took it to work. Still wrote great. No more than 10 minutes later I used it again and the roller ball actually pushed into the pen barrel causing the ink to flow freely out. Now my fingers are messy with ink. The pen does not work at this point.

I'm hoping there is something Moleskin can do so I've emailed them through their site and will update this post if they actually respond. Here's to hoping another person doesn't get duped into buying a name.",1.0
"Don't be tricked by the stylishly minimalist design!

Although I thought Moleskin products were overpriced, I appreciated the quality of their notebooks. Expecting the same degree of quality from their writing instruments, I purchased one that almost immediately turned out to be trash. Pen failed to maintain a write line because it skipped similar to a pen that was empty or dry from exposure.  Of course thinking that I got the production anomaly, I purchased another retractable pen.  Another lump of junk.

This product doesn't deserve even one star.  And according to most of the other reviews, Moleskin should be ashamed to distribute this product. This is not a mistake or an oversight in quality control. These pens are JUNK pure and simple.

Finally, I did not make my purchase through Amazon, but I felt obligated to warn other consumers away from this product so no one else waste their money and time on this JUNK.",1.0

"I bought two of these, neither on works unless connected to power source. Can't use on a book.",1.0
"This is one of the worst products on Amazon and I am appalled that they continue to sell it.  I read most of the reviews, but bought it anyway thinking the worst reviews were from 2012/2013 so surely by now Moleskin must have fixed the bugs.  I was woefully wrong.  The product performed just as poorly as everyone stated and I can't believe Amazon continues to sell such a shoddy product.  Worse yet, that Moleskin continues to lend their name to this thing.  The design is fantastic, but it must be FUNCTIONAL.  I had the same problem - it would only turn on when connected to a power source.  The battery never charged.",1.0
"Has not worked since it arrived...
Would never buy it again, nor any other items from this company...
Very sad because it seemed a very nice product.",1.0
"Wanted one for me in orange, one for him in blue, loved the rechargeable idea, no batteries to replace sounded great. However. First blue one was DOA, wouldn't light up or charge. Second blue one, button was all wonky; would charge but the button wouldn't click in and out. I gave up on the blue color and ordered another orange one. First orange one lit up great right out of the package but doesn't seem to be charging now, since I now know the second blue one had a (very bright) blue charging indicator light. Fingers crossed that the new orange one works when it gets here but have a feeling that one is going back too. For this price I really expected an impressive light, but alas, I should have stuck with the cheapies because those are the ones that are still actually working.",1.0
"This is the second moleskine based pen I have purchased.  The pen works well for a time, but the ink runs out before I reach the middle of journal.",1.0
"I was very happy to have this Moleskin pen, at least for the first week.  Soon thereafter I found the ink cartridge oozing ink in the pocket of my sportscoat.  Yes, you can return the pen for a refund, but I'd prefer a higher quality product in the first place (as well as a more responsive company).",1.0
"I have now purchased three of these and every one of them has been defective in some fashion. Moleskine makes great notebooks, but they should get out of the pen business. They are damaging their brand with this cheaply made junk.",1.0
"**Note, I am an avid user of Moleskine notebooks and love to try out their new products. I truly am a fan of the Moleskine line.**

On that note, I was truly dissapointed with this product. It's more expensive than it has any right to be, but I thought ""hey, if it's the same quality as the books..."" No, it's not worth the money. I won't say it's cheap, but it's design is very poor. It's uncomfortable, and incredibly unreliable! Constant patches where the ink stops flowing, won't start, doesn't flow properly when changing the direction of the tip on paper (which pretty much negates flow writing anything other than a straight line, and that's not certain either). The ink smudges easily too. Overall, it is absolutely not worth it. Free pens from banks and hotels trump this product 100% I'm sorry to say. I really wanted to like this pen, but it's just terrible.",1.0
What?? The pen cap has no top. The lid is open at the top and doesn't fit into the metal clip. Slides right out. Expected better quality--maybe it's a manufacturing problem. Love Moleskine so this is a bummer. It has to go back.,1.0
"The tip of the pen moves and it is not a smooth writing pen, I would not recommend this pen or buy it again.",1.0
This is a really terrible pen. The ink flow is either spotty or nonexistent. The tip was immediately pushed into the pen body on the first use. It feels cheap like a disposable bic. Moleskine should be ashamed. If I could rate it less than 1 star I would.,1.0
"I'm stunned by all the positive reviews of this pen. A Moleskine notebook and a quality pen is very important to me for my work. So I thought this would be the perfect pen. Within 3 hours and 3 uses the pen had broken. the piece holding in the ink tube popped off. I picked it up off the ground and put it back in the pen, but could only get the rollerball to stay in place by shoving some paper inside the body of the pen.

It's made of cheap plastic, it's not very sturdy, and writes no better than any roller ball pen from Walmart. It's simply a rollerball stuffed in a square plastic pen body for $13.46. It's a cheap, generic pen to which is attached a clip with Moleskine written in tiny letters.",1.0
"The pen literally broke within 3 minutes of me using it. once you put the top to the back end of the pen, and pull it back, everything will come flying out and the ink will be gone.",1.0
"This pen is made to seem like it goes with your moleskin pad of paper great but it is the biggest piece of crap I've ever written with, it feels cheap and writes like crap. It is maybe a .99 cent pen..What ever you do save your money and buy a different pen. Trust me!",1.0

"The size as published in English metrics (5 x 8.25 inches) is correct, yet for the rest of the world - like myself - that think in the metric system and do not realise 5 inches is little, the title is misleading.

"I have used Moleskin Planners for ten years straight, I was very disappointed to receive my planner, open it, and see that beside every American word is the word in Italian (literally EVERY word).  So I guess I will be learning Italian or wasting a planner.",1.0
don't waste your money.  it only works when being recharged. the off/on switch came non functioning.  thought moleskine would be a quality purchase.  wrong!,1.0
broke after two weeks-couldn't shut it off. Very disappointing as it was the only rechargeable booklight I have found. I bought two and sent them both back.,1.0
"I have purchased many Moleskine books over the years to write with ink based fountain pens. I have loved them! They hold up well to heavy amounts of ink laydown and maintain a nice smooth paper feel.

However, this most recent notebook did NOT. I noticed that when using a fountain pen, the ink bled into the page and feathered heavily which makes it look cheap and sloppy. (see picture) The only difference between the notebook I love and the Blue one I just received was that the Good black one I have was made in China and the new Blue one (this one) was made in Vietnam. The paper feels slightly thinner in the new blue one.

Overall, I am disappointed in the quality of the new one, and am shocked that the quality between different color Moleskine books is so variable.

Note: The pictures were written with the same pen, same ink, and taken with the same camera.",1.0
"I have just received my Moleskine journal and am surprised at the size. This is not what a European would consider to be large. Large is A4, this is A5, therefore small. Very disappointing!",1.0
"I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. I have been a moleskine user for five years and I was excited to buy a new notebook. However, when I received my purchase, the bottom right corner of the notebook was scuffed and scratched, as if someone had dug into it with a knife. The black color looked like it was dug out and you could see the beige inside. The spine was also dented. No where on the product description did it say that this Moleskine used or pre-owned. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a brand new Moleskine notebook, but what I got instead was definitely not new. I am very unpleased.",1.0
"While I love almost everything about this planner, it has one major drawback. The paper is so thin that no matter how lightly you write the ink shows through to the opposite side. I used a variety of pens and even a pencil, still the same result. This basically makes this planner useless. Very disappointed with the quality of the paper.",1.0
"Does not work on Android phones, a fact that I missed in the product description b/c I was looking at a truncated version. Totally worthless purchase and I realized the problem only after I made notes about several meetings and then tried to import. Frustrated.",1.0
Great idea if it only worked. Only works when plugged in to a USB port. It will not turn on if not connected. I bought 2 return 1 and got a replacement.  None of the three work when unplugged from the computer!  Save yourself the money and more importantly the troubles.,1.0
stopped working in 6 months.,1.0
"I had to give it 1 star to proceed.  I have purchased 3 as gifts for my favourite bookworms, and none of the 3 work. Although I see the blue light when I am charging them, they will not recharge.  I tried to charge them overnight - still the book lights will not work.  Save your money!!!",1.0
"It's a great idea and good attempt but a perfect example of a lack of follow through and cheap china parts. The design and function are all there but the back bone of the concept is that it's a battery powered light. When the battery dies it's just a neat looking bulky bookmark. It lasted about 7 months and won't take a charge anymore. It's a standard cheapo foil wrapped lithium battery. It was crammed into a space that was a bit small for it's size and was bent and warped. This most likely isn't good for it.

The lights were a bit too bright too. If you are in a pitch black room this will blind you!",1.0
"This is the first review I have ever taken the time to write (sadly). However I felt compelled to agree with what seems to be a theme for this product. Usually I scan the negative reviews on a product and notice that those people unhappy with whatever they bought seemed to an isolated occurrence, and I sort-of disregard those comments. Yet this time I wanted to throw my comment in because I had the same problem as others and it is clearly a major flaw with this book light. If you read the other comments you'll notice this as well.

The light simply never worked. It works fine when plugged into a USB port. The on-off switch works fine. But as soon as it's unplugged... Nothing. Clearly something wrong from a design standpoint. It's quite disappointing, especially since I am a huge fan of Moleskin Products.",1.0
"I have been a fan of Moleskine notebooks for many years. When the notebooks work as expected, everyone is happy. If you have a quality issue, your questions fall on deaf ears.

After six months of daily use, the binding on this Moleskine notebook peeled away from the cover / pages. I raised two separate support queries with Moleskine including photographs of the issue with no response. This is disappointing for a company that I have trusted and stayed loyal to for over 10 years.

Great products still require great people to create and support them.",1.0
"Was this a resold product? The notebook is great, yet the activation code for the three months of Premium Subscription is not included, and I took the shrink wrap off it myself.

I bought this notebook because it was supposed to include a three month subscription to the premium version of Evernote.  Not sure if this is a Moleskine fail for not including it in the first place, or a Amazon fail for reselling a previously sold product where someone already used the code.",1.0

"The weeks start on Mondays which threw me off since I am used to a Sunday start planner.  Print is a small gray ,hard to read.  I replaced it January 15... just didn't work for me. Nicely made... love their products.",1.0
"I love these notebooks, but why does the manufacturer use toxic chemicals to make them? It is completely unnecessary. Why injure our health and our environment when there are other non toxic chemicals that could be used for the same cost and effect?",1.0
"I bought Moleskine notebooks back in the good old days before the small French quality manufacturer got acquired by the current company (I think it's an Italian mega consortium who doesn't give a fly about notebooks or paper.) That resulted in the company moving their manufacturing to China and marketing the brand to keep high profit margins.

Now, who cares about the brand, when the most important part in a notebook is the paper quality and the binding. I have to agree with most people who complain about the paper quality in the notebook: it's very low and subpart to even a composition book I can get at Office Depot for 1/10 of the price (See high profit margins above.) For a better quality artist notebook, I now use Canson (made in France) and for taking notes I switched a long time ago to Boorum & Pease (Columner books made in USA.)

Sorry Moleskine but your ""legendary notebooks"" (TM) are just plain... legendary.",1.0
"I'm very disappointed. I thank that had much more funcionalities. The only funcionality is some stcks. Very poor. I watched vdeo and I thank evernote erased Grid lines and aligned page, like evernote Helio.

I am very disappointed & should truly return this product  but I needed it. I love these moleskin notebooks. I have so many for bullet Journaling and work notes etc. When I got the blue on there was a thread missing holding the book together. I've had it for 3 days and the entire thing is coming apart. I have had tons of these and they typically are so stronf,1.0

It's not as light colored, not as smooth or thick, and pens that I used previously now bleed through the page.  I thought maybe it was a fluke, but I also bought one in the Kraft color and the paper is the same lower quality as in the blue colored notebook.  Very, very unhappy with this and will look for a replacement brand.",1.0
"Pages are too thin - ink runs onto other side.  I think I also should be rated a 1-star for thinking that in 2013 I should be putting stickers onto a notepad and then taking a picture of it.  I'm an idiot and so is moleskin for marketing this.  Save your money.  If you have to physically write something out, get a good daily planner.",1.0
"Love the pens, but the picture is clearly blue but I received the burgundy/purple color. Minor detail, still disappointed.",1.0
"Not the same paper quality as you get when you buy a Moleskine notebook in a store. Seems like a ""special"" version made to be sold online or something. I've been using Moleskine notebook for years, so trust me - I know the paper when I see it. This was not Moleskine paper!!!",1.0
"I purchased this moleskine journal at Barnes and Noble but unfortunately I can't take it back. Every pen I have bleeds through! I even users like 5 different brands and types of ink. ALL bled through. The paper is practically transparent. If you look at my photos, one of them you can see a 2016 written. That's on the next page, not even on the back side. I could not write on the back pages and I would still see through the pages. I'm severely upset that I paid $20 for a journal that has paper worse that a $1 comp book at Walgreens. Whoever is in charge of Moleskines quality control needs to go. Quality is getting horrible.",1.0
"Don't get me wrong.... I love Moleskine notebooks.  I use one on every trip and am on my eleventh book as we speak.  However, I have spent the best part of a day trying to get smart tags (the little coloured tags that come with the Evernote Moleskine) working.  The information on how to set this up is poor.  You need to go into your devise settings and activate the Smart Notebook tags.  Unfortunately, this setting is not available on my Nexus 7 or my Samsung windows phone.  Therefore it is only a possibility on my Apple iPad.  As the whole point of my using Evernote is to have everything work across the different platforms it fails to deliver.  I have finally given up on this project and have a less than good feeling about Evernote and Moleskine as a result.",1.0
This is actually a NO star product! Would not work unless plugged into USB. Does not hold charge. It never worked properly from arrival. To top it off seller does not have a valid email. Tried to contact and email gets kicked back undelivered. This product is so great looking but it's a piece of junk. I wish they would make one that works properly. Shame on you moleskin. Many other negative reviews for this product but moleskin still sells it. I would be embarrassed if I was the owner of this company. I wish a better company would design the exact same thing but make it work better. Moleskin sucks!!!!'n,1.0
"This is not Amazon's fault. The product is faulty and you need to be very lucky to get one that actually works.. Unfortunately mine didn't :( I had to ask for a refund. Amazon was great at this and the no-questions-asked policy gave me my money back immediately. I sent the booklight back and later bought it again at a retailer to make sure it would work. Having said that, the product is good. Not great. I expected a little bit more punch from the light.",1.0
Evernote now allows you to take a pic of any notebook page and search within the page. Therefore the only real advantage of this product is the smart tag stickers which do not work at all. Rarely does the app recognize these stickers if ever. A very overpriced notebook with no advantage.,1.0
I ordered one for my wife for her Christmas stocking.  It only worked when plugged into the charger.  I ordered a second one and this one also only worked when plugged into the charger.  I am returning both.  Bought one at Best Buy and it works great. Don't waste your time with this company.\\,1.0
"I don't review products normally, but this pen was horrible.  It doesn't fit tightly onto any moleskin notebook or planner I have (and I have a lot!).  It won't secure onto the cover, you have to fit it to the cover and a bunch of pages to make it clip, which bends the pages, and ultimately it just slides off again the moment you make even the slightest movement.

I was really excited about this pen, and was willing to pay the high price, but now I'm just stuck with an expensive, weirdly shaped ballpoint pen.",1.0
"For a 15$ pen I expect to be blown away by the quality. Unfortunately that is not the case with this pen. I purchased this yesterday along with the sketchpad, while thicker and less paper then expected I like the pad. But the pen feels cheap, the shape, the wieght, the material, the way it writes all feel cheep. I feel like its a gimmicky rectangle pen with sticker to rip off parents.",1.0
"Worked great for a week or two, then the ink stopped writing. Replaced the ink several times and still, it won't write.",1.0
"I got one of these for my birthday and I was so excited to have it! But oh my god this is the worst pen I've ever used! Over priced, cheap, and HORRIBLE ink quality! I wrote 8 pages worth in my Moleskine notebook and it already ran out of ink! I think I'll just stick with my $2 Bic pens. Moleskine really knows how to rip off people with their mediocre pens and average quality notebooks. I can find better stuff at the dollar store.",1.0
"I read the other reviews about this pen and really was optimistic about it. However, once I received it and opened it I was very disappointed. It is very cheaply made especially for the amount of money Moleskine is asking for it. I like the shape of it, but the plastic and the clicker are cheap. The one thing it has going for it is the clip on it, but that is even a let down because it has torn my cover on the inside trying to get it hooked on the notebook. I feel like I wasted my money on this pen. I much rather buy the Pilot G-2 0.5 pen that is built much better than this pen, even though it is a gel pen.",1.0
"You do not get what you pay for with this garbage.  $14.95 at Barnes & Noble.

Why the hell do cheap Bics write better than this crap?

"Disclaimer - I purchased this pen at a different retailer; this review is for the product only. The idea of it clipping (sideways with the clip) and being flat and retractable (click) were what I purchased this for. I LOVE moleskine notebooks, so I was hoping this would be a great solution to keep my pen with the planner without stretching out the elastic band on my planner (I used to shove my Sharpie pens into it). The pen has run out of ink (or gummed up) incredibly quickly. It does NOT write nearly as smoothly on the paper as I prefer. THIS is annoying as the day is long. Ever have someone stand in line behind you at the pharmacy while you get your medication, and they stand RIGHT behind you in your personal space bubble? That annoying. They way the pen clip is designed to hold onto the notebook is also a problem; you would have to clip it to the cover and JUST enough of the pages to keep it snug, or it's falling right back off at the first chance it can. This is a fail in my opinion. I'd rather grab a giant rubber band and my favorite pen and get creative on my own.",1.0
"The aesthetic design of this pen is nice, but unfortunately Moleskine has taken a greedy path here and made these pens out of low quality materials. When holding this pen it's immediately obvious that the plastic is cheap and the fixtures of the components are shoddy. The pen didn't survive more than a week with me just from having it in my front pocket. For what it costs it's not worth it.",1.0

- Sunday appears to the right of Saturday, so I frequently enter things in the wrong square; I could get used to the system except that all my other calendars have Sunday to the left of Monday, and see my second point: I can barely read the tiny, pale print to find the correct square;

I can't understand why the books are so popular - the paper is heavy and all that, and doesn't buckle, but I expect more from my paper. I expect a watercolour paper to respond to the beauty of watercolour, and you won't get that with Moleskine. The paint sits on the surface, slides around and absorbs very unevenly, if at all. I am a quite intuitive painter - whatever I know has been through trial and error - and I like to have a sort of dialogue with my paper, the paint being the go-between.

"I bought two of these small sketchbooks and am so disappointed.  I opened them up and the pages are YELLOW, not creme or white in the least. A dirty yellow.

"I've been a fan of Moleskine for years, but this is not remotely worth the amount of money they're charging. The paper is ridiculously thin; there's no way to use both sides unless you're using a pencil. And that's a maybe on the pencil - I haven't tried it. The cover feels cheap too. You're paying for the name on this one...not the quality.",1.0
Pages were thinner and much different than the ones I've bought before. Haven't been able to even use it. Unfortunate since Moleskine is suppose to be more dependent than your average 5 star notebooks,1.0
"I`ve had this notebook for quite some time now. I bought it because it seemed to be the perfect little book to bring with me, small enough to fit in my purse for whenever inspiration struck. I read reviews and decided, ""Why not"" even though it seemed more than a little PRICEY. I received this promptly and packaged well (gotta hand it to Amazon to their amazing service :)

Anyways, I made color swatches in the first page, to see how my paints would appear on the paper (I use Sennelier and Holbein mainly, in addition to a few Winsor and Newton watercolors). I was not amused. The colors did show up vibrant as ever, but the paper warped  more than I was expecting. The colors also ran weird and I didn't get the smooth wash I was aiming for.

I continued on to the next page, a little annoyed that it had acted funny, but I figured it was just a flawed page and that the rest of the book was fine to paint on (all those good reviews still kept me positive)  I tried painting a portrait, working light to dark and in many layers (as that`s the way I normally work) and was shocked to see that the paper unevenly absorbed my washes, if at all! There were ENTIRE spots where I just could not get any watercolor to sit, as if some sort of resist had been applied. I tried spritzing the paper with water, maybe it just needed to soak a bit. That did`t fix my problem, and I tore out that page, more than a little unhappy about the results.

I tried another time, this time painting some foxes. I realized that this paper does not take layers well and stops holding them after about 3...if you can even get around those weird spots that straight up don`t absorb water.

I don`t know if I just got a faulty notebook, but I would NOT recommend this to anyone after this honestly. Strathmore and Fluid watercolor papers have never done this to me, and they cost WAY less. More than a bit disappointing after seeing how finely packaged this came...",1.0

"These were my favorite notebooks to sketch and write in.. But the quality of these are not the same anymore. The paper are extra thin in comparison to my older moleskine I've had for over 10 years ago. I seriously see-thru. I used a 9h derwent graphite pencil to light sketch and it left a indentation on the other side of the page. I used a micron pen to do some line drawings and it bled through the page instantly. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU MOLESKINE?? I was so excited to get this, but it's almost unusable - i can only draw on the cover. From some research, it looked like the company outsource it's manufacturing from Italy to Vietnam, but kept the prices at premium for these books. The quality dropped but price didn't. This generation of notebooks are probably rated as printer paper.",1.0

More importantly, the grid is incorrectly aligned due to poor quality binding. On. Every. Single. Page. If only a few pages were this way, it would be fine, I suppose, but I was planning to use this as my main journal/planner. To notice that more of the top of every page is cut off than the bottom of every page every single day seems like a poor use of anyone's time.",1.0

"I want to add my voice to the other reviewers that have noticed a marked change in the quality of this sketchbook. After purchasing a new one I compared it to my old ones. There is definitely a difference in paper color and quality. Instead of a nice cream tint the pages are more of an acid yellow with a slight greenish tinge. The thickness of the paper has been reduced as well I can feel it when I bend and touch the individual pages, and the older sketchbook is taller when viewed side by side. In addition the older sketchbook paper has a bit more tooth, the new one is very smooth in comparison.

I am saddened by the degradation in quality of a previously nice product. If these sketchbooks are now made in China instead of Italy why are they priced so high? Why are we paying an Italian made price for a Chinese made product? Surely the production costs have decreased significantly? Isn't that why a company chooses to move it's production base to China, for the cheaper labor costs? I will be returning mine and looking for a better alternative.",1.0
"This item used to be the ONLY sketchbook that I worked in from 2005-2012. I saved up, once again to replace my moleskine that I've been using since early 2010. I received my item and realized, without even taking off the wrapping, that something was different. The book is a few millimeters shorter than it was before, so I compared it to my old book. The pages are so lightweight now that it's silly to pay the premium for these sketchbooks. They also took the yellow tinge off the pages that I loved in my work.

So I researched: apparently they outsourced to China, from Italy, and the quality has obviously dropped without a drop in price.

I'm returning this new moleskine to either try to find an older book that isn't like this new junk, or try to find a new sketchbook to work with. I REFUSE to work with pages this flimsy, especially when I'm carrying around this sketchbook for 2-3 years, just to potentially have it deteriorate in a lesser amount of time as compared to before and still pay the high price.

If you used this in the past and are expecting it to be the same, don't buy it. If you're wanting to try this book out for the first time, go find something else. There are better and cheaper sketchbooks out there than this...thing...",1.0
It seems that Moleskine quality is hit and miss these days. I ordered 2 of these notebooks and unfortunately they were both duds. The paper quality is REALLY BAD. It's rough and thin and cheap. Moleskine paper is supposed to be a bit thicker and smooth and silky. It seems the only reliable Moleskine products are there planners. The paper in those always seems to be excellent. (See my review of the softcover ruled pocket size for more details of my bad experiences.)

"I am a graphic designer and I love small sketchbooks as they are easier to carry around with me. Typically, I try to find books with thick, but smooth paper as I do a lot of sketches and handlettering mostly with fine rollerball ink pens and other fine tip pens like microns. Most of the pens I use don't put much ink to the paper (except for the microns as I use those to outline and color in letters), but these papers in this squared notebook are so thin. I bought this squared book so I can take notes and practice straight handlettering on a straight line. I feel like Moleskine literally went to Wal-Mart, bought a 100 sheet pack of squared paper, put it in their notebook and sell it for $12+ bucks each. The paper bleeds horribly when you fill in a sketch. I typically use Uniball Jetsream fine .7 pens and those pens glide on paper, even those you can see through on the other side.

The images I have attached show what happens when you use a fine tipped pen with moderate ink release (with the Uniball Vision Elite .7). You can clearly see what you colored on the other side. You can see my second experiment in the pics. On one side, I colored in a letter. On the flip side, I colored in another letter on the exact same spot on the opposite side of the paper. The result: When coloring in a letter over the same exact spot on the flip side makes the ink transfer on to a blank page.

Therefore, this product is basically useless for me. I don't understand it. I have a small 3x5 blank Moleskine book and those little sheets are fairly thick that the pens I mentioned above do not bleed through at all. If you're simply looking to use this notebook with a pencil or a very fine tipped pen, then that may be its only use.",1.0

"I tried this notebook and was very disappointed.  The paper is really thin, and buckles quite easily.  To use it effectively with watercolor paints, you have to make sure that you don't use too much water, otherwise, there will be so many buckles in the paper that keeping the notebook flat with the elastic, will not help very much.  That sort of defeats the purpose of using a Moleskine.

I use Moleskines for drawing with pencil and Sakura ink pens.  They do not stress the paper and the artwork looks really good.  If I want to use color, I use colored pencils or oil pastels, nothing wet.  If I am using watercolor, I carry the Strathmore watercolor notebooks, (Visual Journals), that come in 90 lb or 140 lb weights, - ""real"" watercolor paper, that delivers results without the buckling.

"I know that Moleskine may be at the top of the market of premium-grade journals, but there's just too much hype.  I've used similar journals from Rhodia, Exacompta, Quo Vadis, Black and Red, etc.

Bottom line...these are made in China.  The paper is from China.  And we all know that can mean mixed quality.  If you use liquid ink pens or fountain pens, forget about using any Moleskine product.  The paper is subject to horrible bleedthrough and feathering.

These would be fine, if you use pencil or a cheap ballpoint.

Sure, they look cool, the cover is nice, the back pocket and elastic closure are nice features, but the paper is really of sub-par quality for a journal at this price point.",1.0
"I was surprised to see how small this was when it arrived at my house.  The dimensions as described are:

I washed my hands a few times after touching the stuff but they kept burning for a couple of hours afterwards.
Typical made in China garbage, not worth getting poisoned, at any price.",1.0

"Zebra claims the highlighters/markers in this kit do not bleed through the thin Bible pages. They must have used a bible which is not available to the rest of us.

"Ah this pen sucks. I've only used it in my bible. I loved it at first because it wrote very thin in my bible and didn't spit out globs of ink. The yellow 'highlighter"" was okay. It was a deep color, not bright like a highlighter. And it is so thin that you have to really scribble to get it to cover a line or word and make it noticeable. The pink and blue are okay and write thin like the black ink, but I just wanted a black pen and highlighter combo. Well after about 2-3 weeks of pretty minimal use they stopped working!

Mine didn't work  right.  The ink was inconsistent and some didn't work at all - sometimes they popped back up into the barrel when I was writing.  The yellow highlighter was orange.  Couldn't really see the colors on the page.  Cheaply made and not very useful - took more time to use this than a pen and a regular highlighter.  Wasn't worth the hassle to return so I donated it to charity.,1.0
No pros but all con.  Does not hi-lite well at all.  The pen went into the trash.  I would not recommend.,1.0

Before putting the pen to my crisp new Bible, I decided to first test them out on my Bible Study notes which I record in a standard Composition Notebook. Though poundage varies from one Bible to another, generally speaking most are thinner-by-page than Composition books. In my experience, the Zebrite blue bleeds through this paper significantly. The Zebrite green is a bit better, but still only marginally better than a standard yellow Papermate Intro highlighter. My search for a good highlighter continues, but thus far the best method for me is still a basic Crayola color pencil.

All-in-all, good for using as standard highlighters (I have put them to great use in my Bible Study notebook) but definitely not no-bleed as advertised.",1.0

"Just bought these today. I was so excited because Zebra is a brand I usually like. Four colors and a nifty little ruler with the books of the Bible, in its own wee pocket.  Que cute! However, I was not in the market for cute, but for markers that do not bleed. Right on the package it states ""No bleed."" As soon as I got home, I gave these puppies a test drive on 2 Peter Chapter 1. Yep, they bleed big time, messing up the back page. These are going back. I don't need another regular highlighter. I wish Zebra would actually produce a product that does what they promise. In this day and age, why is this so difficult?",1.0
"I was really excited to get this Bible marking system, but then was sadly disappointed the first time I used it. Both the highlighters and the fine line pen bleed through the page and the highlighters also wrinkle up the page. I wanted something ""fancy"" -- that will teach me. I wasted 8 bucks and I am just going to use colored pencils I already have. The one thing nice about it is the clear ruler that helps you make a straight underline.",1.0
Wish I had read all the reviews before taking their word for it.  These markers do bleed through on my Bible pages.

What did they do their product research on before putting these on the market?,1.0

"I ordered these because they are sold as highlighters that do not bleed through on bible pages which are really thin. I am using them for textbooks in school which have much thicker pages than a bible and they bleed through really bad.

"This is a fancy little pack that consist simply of four regular highlighters, (not specially designed Bible highlighters that won't bleed through pages) blue, green, pink and yellow, a pen and small ruler that lists the books of the Bible in a cheap plastic pouch.

"I ordered Bible tabs. What I got was Martin Luther's expunged-Bible tabs. The books of the Bible, held to be the Word of God for nearly 1,500 years years by all Christians, were amended by a 16th Century German monk who broke all his vows. His truncated version of the Bible are the Bible tabs sent to me. Thus they are worthless, and also not worth my cost to send them back. I merely trashed them.
When we order ""Bible tabs"" from you, and your supplier intends to send us tabs for only those books of the Bible to which the above-named defrocked, vow-breakling monk has given his ""blessing"", you ought to warn us before we purchase.

"I've been buying this model of Action Day Planner since 2010 and loved everything about it. I have been a loyal customer, until now.

What did they do to them?! I just got my new 2017 version in the mail and the Action Day Planner has been redesigned. It now has such small print that it is hard to read the month, much less the day of the week. They've printed this smaller print in a lighter type and on a gray background, making it virtually illegible. The columns for the days of the week are so narrow there is no space to write anything. Whoever changed this planner obviously never used it before. This new version is useless. Why fix what wasn't broken?

"tl;dr Overpriced pieces of paper bound in leather (probably sourced from McDonalds, Not special!!)
It's very lofty and goal oriented with little space left to make daily notes.

Initially I was looking for that but it's rather rigid. The space to write in the days is EXTREMELY narrow and bound by time. Anywhere you write on any given date is marked by the hours but only by 7 am thru 8 pm. I mean I don't do much outside of those hours, but to be tied down each day to writing activities based on time is not appealing. If I want to spend my Saturday doing Gym, Shopping, Cleaning, Dog Walking I'm not going to plan it hour by hour, but this planner gives you no other option.

Prime Real Estate of each week is given towards goals, and phone calls necessary to make and probably a special spot for feelings. If you have trouble realizing what time of day it is this may help you. Otherwise I'd suggest something a little more free-form, yet structured, such as BlueSky Tabbed Planner Weekly Monthly. No, I'm not affiliated with them (I'm a full time, poor student) and have been using that planner for 3 years now. Looked up new planners to try out, and chose the Action Day one.",1.0

There also is only the tiniest space for notes (I thought that the notes space would continue on the back, but it doesn't), which isn't adequate for any meeting. I was mainly interested in this particular notebook because of the extra space for action items because my other meeting notebook from Cambridge Limited had ample writing space, but only a small action items section.

"Well, bought this back in October.  Thought it was great until now.... THERE'S NO FEBRUARY!!!  Got to January and.... bam... right to march, then april, then march again!!  But no February.  Not doing me a bit of good right now!!  Will contact customer service and see what they do...",1.0
It was too small. I was very dissatisfied,1.0
"I ordered the smaller size and was sent this huge size that I did not want, but nothing else was available.",1.0
"Unhappy about the size of the squares for writing, I have to write very small.",1.0
the book start with 2015 not 2016,1.0
Don't like the set up. Not what I was expecting.,1.0
"Poorly designed and all togeather impractical, basically a waste of $20. The days of the week are so narrow that you can't even write a single word. It has the days plotted out by hour, which is impractical when you need to jot down a list of things that need to be accomplished. As a student Saturday and sunday are extreamly usefull days of the week, but the planner just gives them tiny sections. I threw mine away after I bought a $5 one from my college bookstore, hopefully it can be recycled and provide some use as paper towels.",1.0
the layout was not as helpful as I thought it would be for an academic planner,1.0
way too small text. Need a magnifying glass to read intro pages (at least with my eyes :-) ).,1.0
"(1) no monthly grid before each month to jot down month at a glance items for easy reference.  (2) No tabs to separate the months (really?!)  So if you want to look ahead a few months, start flipping till you find it.  (3) the space for writing items is too small.  Obviously the calendar suits some.  For me it went straight to Good Will.  Stupid me for ordering on line.  Off to an office supply store.",1.0
This is a goal projection journal.  I wanted a place to record appointments and also needed a page of each total month to see overall view.  Won't be using this planner,1.0
"This planner starts with a lengthy section of quotes and stories about men--no women--and mediocre advice about prioritizing. It's what one would find in youth resources and chain e-mails. The hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, annual planning sections weren't quite as good as they looked online. The cover is like heavy cardboard covered in paper and I think it will disintegrate long before the year is over. I really wanted the hourly planning part, so I found something else that offers it: For the last few weeks I've used free sample pages from [...] and I ordered the 2015 planner from passionplanner.com",1.0
"I read all the good reviews about this planner and decided to purchase it.  I was very disappointed.  First of all, it's very, very small.  You can barely read the print.  There is almost no room at all to write in appointments or your To Do List--which is what I wanted it for.  I wished I hadn't written in it because I really wanted to return it.  So, unless you have really, really good eye site and can write very, very tiny this planner is not for you.",1.0
"I understood I was ordering a Spanish Bible, instead I gt tabs",1.0
"I really wanted to like this product, but it definitely didn't meet my needs. When I unwrapped the note pad, I found that it was very loosely bound at the top and that the paper was very low quality. There also is only the tiniest space for notes (I thought that the notes space would continue on the back, but it doesn't), which isn't adequate for any meeting. I was mainly interested in this particular notebook because of the extra space for action items because my other meeting notebook from Cambridge Limited had ample writing space, but only a small action items section. I found I'd prefer to stay with that notebook since it's wirebound, has a more rigid cover and has lines on the back where you can add more notes or actions. This notebook is WAY too expensive for all of its flaws",1.0
There are missing tabs! Already applied and discovered some tabs missing. This is an incomplete set. Is there any way to send a complete set?,1.0
This is the second time I have ordered these. They are not large print,1.0
Too hard to work with so I ended up throwing them away rather than damage my bible.,1.0
useless! the tabs get damaged from pulling from backing!,1.0
I had purchased this same set before and they worked great.  This time not so good -- not sure what went wrong.  But couldn't get the tabs off of the paper know matter how I tried.,1.0
JUST DO NOT PURCHASE VERY POOR QUALITY,1.0
"So bummed! They ripe, are difficult to put on. I only got 4 on before I stopped. I can't take them off, can't keep going because so many have ripped.  What to do?? :-(",1.0
The stickers rip on every one which make them unusable.  Terrible item.,1.0
"Terrible quality! I had some rainbow bible tabs I purchased about 10 years ago and wanted to get some for my new bible. I am unsure of the original brand, but I thought it was these since I couldn't find anything else, if they are the same brand then the quality has gone down hill substantially. Good luck trying to get the tabs off the original adhesive page. They are not cut all the way through and are so flimsy they tear right through. I compared them to tabs on my old bible, and the tabs on my old bible are thicker and larger though the colors are the same. I never had this problem and I had tabbed 4 bibles 10 years ago. I gave up trying to tab my new bible after 5 tabs with these.",1.0
"Absolutely the worst tabs I've ever used. The directions are involved, they don't align easily, they are flimsy, the tape breaks, and the finished product looks terrible. I'm glad I used them on a cheap paperback Bible, because if it was an expensive one, I would have been irate!  Verse-a-Tabs are MUCH better!",1.0
Incomplete.,1.0
I have bought the same type of tabs before from a book store and this is a cheap copy. Beware. The tabs are flimsy and 5-6 of them ripped when peeling them off of the backing. Also the tape side was not cut through and I had to use scissors to get them apart.,1.0
The description of the Bible Tab should specifically state that it's MINI and not regular size print.  I was extremely unsatisfied because I bought the Tabs for my LARGE print Bible.,1.0
"Although it shows the full number of tabs, there are NO tabs for deuterocanonical books- a little deceptive in how it's packaged.  Very disappointed",1.0
perfect  and instructions were wonderful.,1.0
Small writing the only reason I gave it a one,1.0
Returned as they didn't fit my bible,1.0
Hated them. They were so cheap looking and difficult to put on so i didn't. I would never have bought them if picture had not been misleading. Not worth putting on my Bible. Don't buy them get ones that are not so flimsy.,1.0
I ordered these and was disappointed due to the fact that the tabs were not in the package.,1.0
Binding fell apart shortly after I received it. It's in the garbage now.,1.0
Did not like them.,1.0
2014 not 2016. What the heck.,1.0
"The Majestic bible tabs are so much better!! I bought this accidentally thinking it was the Majestic brand. These are so small and flimsy. And you have to be SO careful when folding them over, they are not pre creased. Also if you mess up folding it flat then you are pretty much stuck with how it is. You can't pull it up to reposition it. Will be extra cautious in the Future to make sure I never buy again.",1.0
Were bent when I got them. But I straightened them as much as I could and still owed them. Wish they would've been straight.,1.0
Too hard to use neatly,1.0
Too small to work with and do not adhere to the pages.,1.0
Not the same font on tabs as pictured.,1.0
Flimsy tabs crease and fold =\,1.0
Bien,1.0
"They are so small I need a magnifying glass to read them.... way, way too small. Would not buy again.",1.0
to small of print for me.,1.0
"Read the reviews before you purchase. No where in the description does it say ""mini"". These are way too small. Disappointed in the purchase. I cannot use these.",1.0
Very small and hard to do.,1.0
Definitely NOT what I expected!  Not only are the Bible book names sooo small that you can barely read them but a lot of them were barely readable b/c they looked smeared by a printer!  Definitely do NOT recommend!,1.0
"the lettering was extremely small, too small for me to see...so I wasted my money, I cant use this bible aid",1.0
These are minis.  Not listed as such and could not use them for their intended purpose.  Not enough money involved to bother returning them.  They should have been listed as minis.  Very small and difficult to read,1.0
After three days of using the cover fall a part! I don't recommend this Chinese production of the last Action Day planners. It doesn't worth even the $5.00 dollars paid to the Chinese manufacturer over the $27 plus this item will cost you! Do not buy it anymore until production goes to more serious manufacturers! Very bad Chinese Product!,1.0
"Product was not accurately labeled or described online. We received the ""mini"" tabs instead of the regular sized ones. We now are stuck with a product we can't use and it was supposed to be a gift.",1.0
"Hi, would have really loved this book. Half way through writing in it...the months started intertwining...june suddenly ended on the 5th and July started, but only for 20 days, then May showed up again. All pages are out of whack, and I can not return it because I already have written in it. :-(",1.0
The sections are to small to write in.,1.0
I didn't realize how small these things are...I guess these would be good for a small bible or for someone who can read without their glasses...not happy,1.0
"I had bought the mini bible tabs by mistake the first time and read this product careful to make sure I did not make the same mistake.  So satisfied that these were not the same mini tabs I had mistakenly purchased before, I placed my order.  When I received the item wasn't I surprised to see that it was the same identical MINIS that I did not want!!  What I received is not the same as the product pictured and no where in the product description does it state these are the MINIS!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!",1.0
"When I purchased it I thought they were regular tabs, but they were mini tabs which did not indicate that they were. I really don't have any use for them because they are so small.",1.0
Not enough space for writing on the days. You have to use the side bar to write down the rest of the details for the days.,1.0
The description of the product should say on-line that they are mini tabs.  We shouldn't have to wade through all of the reviews to somehow discover that the tabs are so small.,1.0
These tabs are so small and the lettering is like a 4 size font. Can barely read them! Not happy at all.,1.0
"Really first time I leave a one star for a product I love, but I emailed them several times and I never got anything resolved at the end. Stopped waiting for anything to happen, or for a refund at this point which really sucks! My package never made it to me even though it was notified delivered. I asked my neighbors and all and obviously no-one saw it either. Been ordering from Amazon for long enough without problem, so was wishing for something to be done when I do have a problem and NADA. I really really wanted this product so I re-purchased it again, I love it, it's awesome but the fact no one helped me resolved the previous order that never made it, really really ruined my whole experience. Sucks for me.",1.0
Didn't like these. They are too small. They do not say mini anywhere in the description. Not what I expected.,1.0
The pages inside are not all fully trimmed- so every other page you have to finish sepertating them.... which unless you carry a knife around with you doesn't end with the best results.,1.0
"They changed the font and and type and 2017 version is very hard to read. And it looks like they ran out of ink. Plus they added a whole column for Saturday and Sunday, which shortened the columns for Monday thru Friday, plus added unneeded space in the tasks column. In the past, I loved the BrownlineCB920, but they apparently stopped making it. I switched to ActionDay in 2016, but am very disappointed in the 2017 version. I like this size, as it does not get lost on my desk, and is easier to carry. But I can't believe how hard the 2017 version is to read. I even gave it to a much younger co worker to see if she noticed the difference between 2016 and 2017. At least I know it wasn't just me complaining. I am looking for a substitute that I can work with. I hope I find one so I can return this one.",1.0
"Weekly calander section is WAY to small to write anything on. I thought the goals section was neat, but I just can't deal with the fact that the weekly section is so small that it's not useable. Also, the monthly calendars are located at the front, and are also too small to use. Returning for a refund and purchasing a planner that has sections large enough for me to use practically.",1.0
Horrible,1.0
"I did a search for ""Catholic bible tabs"" and these came up.  My daughter wanted this product for her bible so I purchased them.  However, this is not for a Catholic bible.  This product is missing tabs for many of the books; Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), and Baruch.  I will now need to make seperate tabs for those missing books.  I guess I though 77 tabs  that are included in the Catholic bible tabs and seeing that these tabs also had 77 tabs would not be different despite not having the word ""Catholic"" in the title.",1.0
"These tabs are terrible. They have little sticky pieces that are difficult to get off and they don't fold properly. Get Majestic tabs, they are way better.",1.0
"I ordered the Noah's Ark Animal Rainbow Tabbies and instead got regular tabbies not the Noah's Ark ones. Very disappointed, not at all what I ordered.",1.0
not useful,1.0
It was not what I expected it was not what I wanted or needed,1.0
Disappointed to receive one with a misaligned binding.,1.0
"Accidentally bought this, which is my bad, but why the hell would you list a three year old planner?",1.0
I bought this planner by mistake thinking it was an updated planner  Well... It's not.  My bad.  However it's going to cost me 7 bucks to return the product.  I might as well throw it out!  I am a big fan of Action Day planners.  I will no longer be if they don't make this right.,1.0
"My bad, did not realize it was 2015-2016. Just want to warn others.",1.0
"ugh, I'm an idiot to have ordered this in 2016 without looking to see that it was the PREVIOUS years calendar! I'm sure it would have a made a lovely calendar if I had purchased it in the proper year.",1.0
"If I could give a zero star review, I would. I ordered this at a significantly reduced price because it was only good for the end of an academic year and I wanted to see if it was worth using. The calendar was bound out of order - February comes before January, there's no March, etc. Absolutely makes no sense at all. I would definitely not recommend this planner.",1.0
"It was a one month planner for $5 bucks. Not worth it, though I suppose it is also my fault for not reading the description more accurately.",1.0

"I bought a PalmIIIx about 6 months ago and I have been very dissapointed.  Don't get me wrong... in principle the ability to store and beam addresses & business cards, manage my calander, securely store network passwords  is great!  When the unit was working I loved it.  However, after about  three months of ownership, I began loosing all my data at random  internvals, forcing me to revert back to my last sync with my computer. I  would turn the unit on and all my data was gone... evern with fresh  batteries.  Palm was not able to diaganise the problem... just telling me  to re-set it again... duh.  The last time this happened the unit went  completely dead. It could be that I just had a bad unit.  However, I would  advise other Palm purchacers not to store any critical data on the unit. As  for me, I would not buy another Palm product.",1.0
"I am a first time owner of the Palm IIIx and I am currently searching for an alternative.  I received my Palm IIIx as a gift about 7 months ago, and I have lost all of the data in my organizer 8 times.  I am an active  professional in the television industry and I travel to remote parts of the  world for weeks at a time.  I have been away from my computer (to HotSync  and restore the data) all but one time and have been left without vital  professional and personal contacts as well as lost all new contacts and  production memos and notes.  I have determined the cause of the failure.  If you own a Palm IIIx and have it with you, follow along with me.  Locate  the battery compartment on the back of the unit.  Open it up and look at  the way the compartment is designed to have the batteries installed.  The  top AAA battery slot is designed such that the positive end of the battery  (the one with the 'bump') must maintain contact with a wire coil.  What  happens is this.  Let's say you have your Palm IIIx in your purse,  briefcase, backpack, fannypack or WHEREVER.  If you drop your bag, set it  down a little too hard, or even RUN with it, chances are that the contact  coil will slip off of the positive terminal on the battery and you'll lose  all of the memory in your organizer.  First and foremost, I CANNOT BELIEVE  that 3Com allowed this product to be released with such an incredibly inept  design flaw.  Second, I can't believe that they didn't install a back-up  battery to which the organizer defaults in cases of lost power for ANY  reason (let alone because the inherent design of the product leaves it  prone to losing power and therefore data).  Finally, 3Com Customer Service  has done NOTHING to respond to my repeated attempts to bring this to their  attention and ameliorate the situation.  The Palm IIIx is SUPPOSED to be a  powerful tool for powerful people.  I'd be surprised if the execs at 3Com  would utilize their own product.",1.0
"Does Palm have a problem it's not admitting? My two-day old Palm IIIx lost all its data this morning--garbage on the screen, no response to power button. A soft reset ""restored"" the unit--not the data, of  course, just the factory defaults.
Funny thing is, the Palm IIIx  replaced a Palm III which had lost all its data the day before I bought the  new one. I figured the old Palm III had probably had it, but at least it  had served faithfully for two years. The new Palm IIIx didn't make it  through two days.
Palm tech support says the ""solution"" to  lost data is a reset. Sure it is--that restores the unit to its factory  condition. And then you synchronize it again to restore from your desktop.  And again and again and again? Tonight will be the third attempt to get the  data I depend on every day from my desktop to a Palm III model. All I want  is a Palm IIIx that can hang on to my data for more than a day!",1.0
"Palm 3's are not what they are all cracked up to be. Speaking of cracked up, thats what you feel like when you try to synchronize it with your PC or Mac.  For a little bit more money, the Palm V or Palm VX are a better  choice.",1.0
bad,1.0
This is my second Century II. The first was amazing. This one... not so much. I do not recommend this pen. Something in the quality control has happened. No good.,1.0
Only used the pen twice. Went to use it a 3rd time and had ink all over my hands.,1.0
Pen feels extremely cheap and cap move when put back on. Expected a lot better from Cross at this price range.  I've always like Cross Pens. They've lost a customer for life. Another company lost to profit over quality.  Just disappointed tremendously.,1.0
"It looked fake to me, but I was not quite sure. I went to a store where they have a HUGE selection of Cross pens. The manager told me - that is ABSOLUTELY FAKE - I am very angry about being duped - and I want others to know about their fake products. DO NOT BUY PENS",1.0
not worth the price. feels like cheap plated pen. POOR BUILD QUALITY. when you shake it you'll hear something is loose inside.,1.0
The item came with no ink. I have to go buy some.,1.0
I have hardly used this pen for a few weeks and the refill inside has come lose. This was my second Cross pen I bought and I don't think I am getting another one. Returned the first one for poor finish (despite good reviews online) and this malfunctioned in a few uses.,1.0
Made in china need I say more,1.0
I bought one of these pens years ago and I loved it. I purchased another one recently and it is a piece of garbage. They are now made in China and are nothing like the original Cross pens. Don't waste your money unless you're buying it for somebody you really don't like.,1.0
"If 'Made in China' for a $50 plus pen is okay with you
then buy this pen. Another old American company (based
in Rhode Island) sold out to sweat shop labor. Sad.
Quality not the same. Recommend boycotting Cross pens
until they bring their production back home and restore
quality (wake up America). Don't buy this pen.",1.0
"Following was described for the product at the website:
===============================================================================================
From the Manufacturer
The Cross Century II Medalist Fountain Pen with Polished Chrome and 23 Karat Gold Plated Appointments features a 23 Karat Gold Plated Nib for consistently smooth ink flow. This medium-diameter fountain pen also features the trademark Cross conical tip and a classic silhouette.

What's in the Box
Cross Fountain Pen, 2 Black Fountain Pen Cartridges and 1 Screw-in Style Cartridge/Bottled Ink Converter.
=============================================================================================

The supply DID NOT CONTAIN the ""Screw-in Style Cartridge/Bottled Ink Converter"" AS PROMISED.

I am the biggest fan of amazon.com but am extremely disappointed with the inability to contact the customer service to supply the missing item. I do not buy the item to return but want to use them right away unless they can not be used. The pen with cartridges can be used but it definitely frustrates to receive incomplete supplies. I hope someone listens and takes care of the issue.",1.0
"Shortly after receiving it, I noticed the nib assembly seemed to be loose in the barrel. I was able to hand tighten it, but every now and then I would find it loose again. This proved to be an annoyance, and a flaw which I would not expect from a quality pen such as Cross.

However, today, when I went to use it, I discovered the nib assembly has completely unscrewed from the barrel, and is now lodged inside the cap. I'm sending it back to Cross. Although their guanantee states FREE replacement, their website talks about a ""processing fee"". When a manufacturer produces a faulty product, I don't expect to pay a processing fee to get them to honor their guanantee.",1.0
"The advertised size was misleading. Much, much smaller that expected. Hard to hold due to size.",1.0
I have had Cross pens before and was very happy with them. However I recently got a new pen and have been very disappointed appointed in it. I keep a journal and almost as soon as I got it it began to skip too badly to use. I have a much cheaper pen that works.,1.0
"Not a fan of this pen.  The filings at the bottom for grip are very awkward.  I do not enjoy holding the pen.  Also, the ink is spotty and this new pen writes like an old pen that is about to run out of ink.  A waste of 20 bucks.",1.0
It brakes down mechanically in one month.,1.0
"I bought this pen brand new. Out of the box the pen skipped and had false starts especially when doing something really unusual like putting the pen in your pocket. Normally Cross makes a fine product but this fountain pen is junk. To repair it, Cross wants $10.00 for processing. After adding in shipping fees you are looking at almost $20.00 for the repair of a new pen. No thanks. Box and pen are going in the trash.",1.0
Failed after only three months!  Extremely disappointing for a quality product.,1.0
"My Mum bought for me both the slim chrome cross ballpoint pen and the fountain pen in January 2017 as a treat for a promotion at work.
They are both very nice looking, slim and feminine but only today 21/09/17 (8 months later) was I finally able to find some slim cartridge refills for the fountain pen from a specialist pen shop in Sheffield. The pens didn't come with a product code so I had no idea what to order on-line. On fitting the ink cartridge it doesn't snap into place, so I had to remove it to check it had punctured the top and ink went everywhere. The cartridge doesn't sit nicely at all. After fiddling with it I finally got it working.
The set was so pricey and the pens just don't feel well made or robust. I think they are an expensive waste of money. I'll be using my Waterman pen much more. It is tried and trusted and has lasted me since senior school (many moons ago). Shame on you Cross. My Mum was diddled out of her pension.",1.0
Feels like a cheap knockoff rather than the precision instrument they used to be.,1.0
"I received a Cross Bailey Medalist as a gift to use for my book signing. It looks beautiful in the package, which may mean that the person who gave it to me, didn't actively hate me at the time of purchase. I took it out, and tried to use it. I untwisted everything that I could. It was unusable. I got zero use out of it. I'm sorry I was forced to give it even one star. I took a Staples OptiFlow to the book signing. Beautiful pen. Nice feel with a great look on the page. Staples. The best pen company ever!",1.0
"I bought this pen last week because I wanted a nice pen for official purposes. The package came on time. But I am unable to use it because when I write with it, after every two words, it stops. May be a very bad ink in the tube. I have no idea. I was using this during a conference and kept on stopped writing. I was so embarrassed because I used to shake it hard every now and then to write. Somebody offered a pen then to help me. This is not a good and I am returning this item.",1.0
"It is broken from the inside, so the ink of the pen doesn't hold in place. Lasted 5 months? Thanks",1.0
"I wish I could have read the reviews before. Very cheap pen, nothing like the other cross fountain pens I have. No conversion, functions only on refills.",1.0

"Sad Cross has started to manufacture in China. I've owned several Cross pens over the years and the down grade in quality is astonishing. The pen is light flimsy and does not inspire the belief that it will last. I hope Cross is happy with their decision, they have done a great disservice to a former American icon",1.0
"Admittedly, it's been a few years since I had a Cross pen.  I was shocked at the lack of quality.  The box arrived mangled in a padded envelope.  It was a struggle just to wrestle it open.  Once I was finally inside, I was stunned at the chintzy products.  They look and feel cheap.  Don't waste your time or money.  You'd be better off with a Bic from the local dollar store.",1.0

Now it's sitting in my desk , the ink isn't flowing as it was before, I cleaned the nib several times , with water and alcohol still not working.  I just wish I bought something different that would last longer !",1.0
Rust started showing on the tip of the pen after few weeks.,1.0
"I bought this same pen at office max or depot, cant remember. For a $40 dollar pen it was a complete waste of money.. the tip would sometimes work and mostly not. I loved the way it looked, it just preformed very poor. Each canister of ink would only last me about a day at work too.. and they are not cheap, were talking like 10 bucks a week in ink on a pen that would make your hand hurt because your always messing with different positions to make the stupid thing write. I returned it and got my money back.",1.0
"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my father. It seemed nice enough when it came in, packaging, etc.. Just yesterday 2/2 my father called me to let me know that the pen had fallen apart. I looked at it to see if I could fix it and it appears as though the inside of the pen had actually fallen out. I went to the Cross website to send it back for repair (they offer a lifetime warranty) and they wanted a $10 processing fee just to send it back. What a joke! The pen lasted 2 months.",1.0
"If you have an old Cross set, and you're expecting the quality to be the same, be forewarned: Cross is no longer quality. Comparing these new pens to the old ones, the difference is obvious. They're relying on people like me who recall the quality of their old products to buy this new junk. Their revenues depend on the work and production on others who are long since gone from the Cross product supply (and production) chain.",1.0
"Bought from a couple of different cross pens on amazon, this came with greenish old box vs all other were in modern gift boxes! other pens and sets which had gold on it should a yellowish gold and this one had Pinkish gold which gave it the look of a old rusty piece!

"Far from a $20 pen.  Writing is not smooth. Twisting the pen open and closed certainly isn't smooth.  Pen rattles and flexes at the connection between the top and bottom.

"Cross are now made in China (except for custom made orders like Tiffany) ,  This and others pen/pencil are a cheap knockoff version of what was ""before"" an excellent company.
The company is not what it used to be before.  I'm really sorry about the company direction that has literally brought the brand to the ground.

I personally have 7 cross,  I can see and feel the difference between the old and new versions. I'm really ... really ... really sorry about this.",1.0
"The pen itself is a very nice design, however I ordered it because it said it was a fine point and it does not seem to write any differently then my Medium point fountain pen. Maybe it's the ink I'm using but I have the cross ink cartridge recommended and so I would imagine it should have worked fine. Maybe I need a extra fine pen or one that's a little more dry.",1.0
"The pen was great. It writes very smoothly and it looks absolutely beautiful. My main complaint and the reason why I am giving it a 1 star review is the packaging. This is the kind of pen that you buy as a gift. I would expect that the company knows that and they would try and make such a beautiful pen as this have a beautiful gift box to go along with it. They did not. The box is flimsy and not aesthetically pleasing. If you're trying to wow someone with the pen, go ahead and make your own box. For the price though, you cannot complain too much, but I still would want something more. My box actually came with some tape on it and that lead to the flimsy paper accent on the box to come off. I was very displeased. I spoke to an Amazon representative and they sent me a replacement immediately, and I'm very thankful for that.

Overall, but this pen if you like a quality pen that writes. Do not buy this if you want to try and impress someone with a fancy gift box and pen.",1.0

"Call me crazy, but when I spend $50+ on a pen, I expect it to work. This pen skips. It suddenly stops writing. And when I go back to try to rewrite the skipped spot, often it still refuses to write. It still has ink. I can still write elsewhere. But for reasons known only to the pen, it refuses to leave ink on that 1/4 inch space of paper.

I'll never buy a Cross pen again. I'm now using a pen that my mom bought from Publisher's Clearinghouse in a big bag o' pens. Something like five bucks for 10. It's getting the job done.",1.0
Warning; at some point Cross changed the size of their pens.  I now have refills that fit some of my cross pens but not others.  They are all the same style pen but the refills don't fit them all.  Very disappointing.  Considering how expensive the pens are i'd expect the refills to fit the pens.,1.0

"Cross has a wonderful reputation and over the years I have enjoyed owning their products.  I like the feel of this pen but after you pull the cap off, good luck getting it to fit back on easily or snugly.  I purchased this one and a lustrous chrome one at the same time and am very happy with the later/original model pen. However, I just bought two new lustrous chrome ones and after taking delivery of them today I am returning them.  All of the pens I have gotten that the caps don't fit right are manufactured in the same country unlike the preciously purchased lustrous chrome one I have in my pocket.

"I bought this product because I needed a pen in that category and because of the comments were good, but the ink was a deception.

I used only approximately 2 weeks and already the ink ran out , it's means the ink comes almost empty, because it's not possible that a new pen, which is given a moderate use, the ink ran out so fast.

I understand that marketers should do this warning about the length of the ink because nobody wants to buy a pen that in 2 weeks it will eventually run out of ink, unless they don't want to give that information on purpose to force a new purchase ink or that it is a mistake.",1.0
THEY WERE FAKE. NOT REAL CROSS PENS. i am severely disappointed with everything about this.,1.0
"Having a long relationship with Cross pens and pencils, I have always held them in high esteem as a maker of quality writing instruments.  After they moved their manufacturing facilities to China, I assumed they would maintain this tradition, but upon receiving this particular pen, I was shocked at how shoddy it was.  The barrel was made from a thin piece of metal that felt about as solid as a thin tin can, and when the two halves of the pen screwed together, the metal-against-metal union did not join together smoothly; in fact, it squealed.  The asking price is $56.00, with a supposed original asking price of $70.00.  Are they kidding?  In my opinion, it is not even worth $5.00, so I am sending it back immediately.  Sorry, Cross, but when the quality goes bye-bye, so do I.",1.0

So, the body of this pencil is exactly like the pen, including the gold upper tip with the black dot.  This makes the two indistinguishable on the outside.  The pencil used to be sleeker, lighter-weight, and could easily be told apart from the pen.  I don't like it.  Seems a cheap way for them to save money.

"I used to love getting Cross pens when I was a kid.  I still have them too, the chrome ones, but lost my only gold one.  So I wanted to replace that one after all these years.  I was a bit hesitant after reading these reviews, but thought i'd gamble and hope that after a few years of getting their QC in check, the quality would return.  No such luck. This thing is like a fake Rolex.  All the points the other reviewers warn you about are absolutely correct.  I compared it side by side with my vintage chrome ones.  The cap does not fit right, the overall feel and weight is poorer, the clip feels thinner and weaker, the turning mechanism seems flimsier.  It's sad to see Cross stoop this low.  This is the reason ""Made in China"" has the stigma it has.  I'm going to have to switch to the Fisher Space Pens, made right here in the USA.  Do me a personal favor, and take the pen!!",1.0
I purchased two pens as gifts for important clients.  Both pens lacked smoothness in operation. The tops of each had a jag guard edge......poor finishing.  The barrels were slightly small than my older pen.  Both were made in China. It is a shame the fine name of Cross Pens is no longer.,1.0
"The quality of a Cross Pen was at one time unquestioned.  Today, since they have ""off-shored"" manufacturing to China the quality is poor.  The barrel does not fint snugly nor is the action of opening the pen smooth and flawless.  The quality was so poor we did not give the pen(s) away to our more important clients.
Too bad Cross is not more conscious of its good name and reputation.  The quality control people at Cross need to change their glasses.
J. O'Brien/CT",1.0
"Hmmm, How to say this, I have own the 0.5mm pencil for years, the time for replacement came and I wanted it back, after some research, checking the Cross main website, I noticed certain irregularities as a result of a change in the mechanism and other characteristics as being 0.7mm one of them. Having known that, I wanted to find the 0.5mm that I had, I found this sale from Shoplet, with the image of the 0.5mm pencil, the delivered product is for 0.7mm, with a black dot at the top of it, as the Pen from the previous version.... The pencil didn't have such dot in the past... Recomendation, if you want to buy the 0.5mm like me, keep searching or give up already... If you don't mind all this about the previous Cross and the New Cross designed in USA but made in China, then buy a plastic Pen and Pencil Set, you might get a better product...

But overall, Cross have thrown out of the window the quality which had gained through years.... A shame...",1.0
"The design of the pencil's mechanism has been changed from the previous model, much for the worse. It is not easy to use now, the actions aren't intuitive and difficult to manage. The eraser has been downsized and its material is very crumbly, much too small for regular usage. Cross used to mean quality writing instruments, if this is where they are headed it is sad that we have lost another American company to inferior design and engineering as well as cheap construction.",1.0
"The pencil didn't work, and my husband decided he wanted me to return the set.  Since this was a present, I was late returning the set and got only a partial refund.  My fault for not thinking ahead about the return policy, but a big disappointment.  It made a special time a big let down.",1.0
It slips from my fingers. The graphite keep changing position due to the way that you must hold the pencil (that is the same way that you reposition the graphite).,1.0
"I prefer refil pencils, pens, etc., and thought, maybe new, innovated ways - why not try it out.  Well first, you need specific cartridges and not just the lead refill.  And then the fairly complicated mechanism stopped working effectively after two months.  Sometimes you were able to write and at other times there was nothing, and you had to take the thing apart. So, stick with the regular & simple  refill pens.  It's too much aggregation.  Very disappointing.",1.0
"Let me get one thing straight. I LOVE old, made in the USA, cross pens. This is the biggest piece of crap pen I owned, I sold it for $20 to a friend and i even feel bad about that. I used to own the exact same pen years ago when they were still made in the US. If you like the style and look of this pen go to ebay and purchase a ""MADE IN USA"" one. This difference is substantial and you will not regret it. Even if its used its 100x better than this pen you will mistakenly purchase.",1.0
is of the worst quality is poor finish I buy pen cross and sent me an imitation made in China I feel cheated would like the return of my money,1.0
First of all when you buy a product and paid the high price for a specific brand you deserve the best. But in this case it is not. The Cross pen set is made with low quality the same quality that you expect for a 5 dollars pen sent but no for Cross set. My best advise Don't buy it.,1.0
"Impulse buy at Staples. Fifty four and change.  First thing I noticed is the lightness, and the different feel, as I am feeling it, I felt sharp edges at the joint. Could not even get the cap back on until I read a reviewer that said you need to put it back with the ink cartridge extended.  It still does not align correctly.  The metal is paper thin, looking dangerously sharp, no weight, but the balance is o.k., the ink seems good.  Check the reviews before you buy, this is not the Cross pen you remember, I just returned a defective (and more expensive) fountain pen for warranty repair after just a few months.  What has happened to Cross?  I have nothing much against Chinese manufacturing, but this feels like a knock-off, I bet the knock-offs are of better quality.  Do not buy this product.  The cap and the barrel don't fit.  I mean, how much manufacturing knowledge do you need to align two pieces of metal to fit right, you would have to purposefully make it not align, the diameters must not be the same, off by at least half a millimeter.  No quality, no quality control. I feel very bad because I have had many Century Classics, and they are my fondest memories, and my first good pens, since high-school.  I wanted a gold Cross pen, and all the ones, even the 14 carat ones have the same problems.  I don't know what to do.  Take it back for sure.  Get a different brand, after I research some more.  But Cross is a name you never had to doubt.  This is bad for them, and me.

UPDATE: I actually kept the pen, and got used to it.  I could not find another gold pen to get, and wanted a gold one.  It is not perfect, as Cross used to be, but for the price, it is acceptable.",1.0

"I had a Cross pen & pencil set back in the day, so I remember the quality from the past. I was excited to receive my new set, but not anymore. I'm returning this idem for refund.

"I owned an original of this Cross pen and pencil set since 1986 until this year but after 25 years of daily use managed to lose them within a week of each other. I ordered a replacement this August, 2012, in the hope that the reported bad quality since the shift of production to China could be something I could live with. A big mistake...

Unfortunately the quality is awful and I have returned them. The pencil mechanism has changed yet again (I had my original pencil repaired and the 'innards' were changed from the 0.8mm to the then 0.5mm 'new' one) and the characteristics of the pencil have completely changed. You wouldn't want to open the pencil to use the now tiny eraser and to expose the cheap plastic mechanism.

The pen doesn't feel as well constructed and the refill end protrudes too far out compared to my original. Also both the pen and pencil have the same top, with the gold 'blob' on the end, whereas only one should have it so you can tell them apart easily.

If I could find an original set I would be happy to buy it but will certainly make sure I handle them first.",1.0

"I own a couple usa made 1964 Cross pen and pencil sets which are the vintage version of this new set. This new set is NOT usa made like the old ones. Its chinese made, light and flimsy, and does not have the rose gold look. It looks more like 10kt gold filled. The inner barrel edges are not smooth, the two pieces of the pen don't sit evenly and required some sanding to fit right. The two pieces of the pen require careful manipulation to sit right. On the vintahe sets, the two parts always sit right together.

Have been using Cross pens for over 30 yrs and noticed that the pens in the last five years do not last. Checked and found out that they have moved the factory to China and the quality has been severely compromised. Now their warrenty is only for 30 days instead of lifetime. Would not recommend their pens anymore as they are nothing but cheap ball pens,1.0

The quality is not there anymore (I guess it's been this way from the time they started manufacturing the pens in china!
The pens don't have the same sturdiness and feel like they used to. The weight they used to have is also not there anymore. Cross should be ashamed. This isn't an American product anymore but a low quality cheap Chinese one. Congratulations Cross.",1.0
"I thoroughly agree with D.S. Bornus.  I have a collection of Cross pens, most dating from the 1960's and 1970's  They are wonderful, smooth, balanced and a real joy to write with.  I wanted another to carry with me, (my earlier collection stays at home). I ordered a  later model  Cross classic 2502 on E- baymuch and much to my chagrin the barrel had some slippage at the end of its' travel both ways.  And yet this one was made in the USA which means it was made prior to 2007 when unfortunately Cross shipped their production to China.  I then purchase a brand new one from Staples and was extremely disappointed at the fall from grace of the Rhode Island based Co,once manufacturer of very fine pens.  The China version is anything but a true Cross pen of old.  The balance is off.  The taper at the point is broader and far from the slim look of the USA models.  The graphic CROSS logo is much less sophisticated, in bold and deep type.  And yes, the barrel slips noticeably.  Richard and Alonzo Cross would be horrified at what the Boss family has done to their reputation.  The early Cross pens if you can find them are the best.  Even the later USA models are not made to the crucial standards that were once assured by A.T. Cross.  I lament the loss of that once respected Lincoln, Rhode Island manufacturer.",1.0
"I ordered this pen by mistake .. I really meant to order the rolling pen, but bought this without trying it, and I HATE IT!  It's truly the worst pen i've ever owned.  I've tried the fine refill, the medium and now the broad, and they're all bad as far as I'm concerned.
Funny thing is, is that I consider myself a 'pen snob' and this was a big mistake.
I ordered a Parker not long afterwards and that is a far superior pen, but I'm stuck with this Cross pen that I'm TRYING to like, just because of the money wasted.
I don't know where I've gone wrong other than getting the ball point instead of the roller ball.

"As other reviewers have noted, Cross has switched the pencil in this set from their classic 0.5 mm to a new 0.7 mm model, but for some mysterious reason, they have kept the old model number, which causes a lot of confusion.

"The manufacturer is distributing a different pen/pencil set than the one illustrated and described. Cosmetically the pens are a flat black -- could be mistaken for grey; but more importantly the ""pencil"" is not the typical cross .05mm pencil.  It is a pen/pencil combo -- you can put either an ink cartridge in it (for 2 pens, who knows why) or a special .07mm lead cartridge -- not individual leads, but a self contained cartridge physically similar to an ink cartrdige -- to use it as a pencil. Of course, you can't tell them apart when you pull one out of your pocket.  One has to twist it and see what comes out - the pen or the pencil (or other pen if you go that way).

This happened to me at another large retailer (large web, lots of physical stores) so it looks like Cross is doing a number on people.  Major, major disappointment.

Good luck!",1.0

"This model has Cross' ""satin chrome"", not the normal bright polished chrome.  You can look at it hanging on the wall of any major office supply store instead of ordering it blindly online.

""Satin"" is a nice excuse for what might otherwise be called frosted or sand-blasted.  It's that cheap-looking finish often used in low-priced products to avoid having to brush or polish the metal carefully, and when you see it in front of you, it looks like junk.

The Classic Century model (in all forms), sadly, is now a little rougher to operate than the old one my Grandfather had.  It's OK, but the two halves of the pen don't fit together solidly, and wiggle too much.  The polished model looks nicer with its brighter finish and neat grooves, but also costs twice as much.  This bottom-rung model doesn't even look nice, which is normally a major quality for expensive Cross products.

The Classic Century uses a standard ballpoint cartridge (not a smooth roller or gel), so writing with it isn't especially great either.

Being a cheaply-made Chinese product, this ugly ballpoint probably shouldn't cost any more than a couple dollars.  Thanks to this new entry in their lineup, we can see what fraction of Cross' income they expect to get just for their name.",1.0

"The standalone answering machine had its heyday in the 1990s. Digital recording, an exotic and imperfect technology, transformed it from a complicated tape-based machine into a flexible voice-mail system.

The technology has stagnated since miniaturization made it possible to incorporate answering systems into wireless telephone base stations. This GE-branded machine seems to represent a sad backslide.

The one good point is that it can provide four separate voicemail boxes. This is more than offset by several drawbacks:

--An almost-unintelligible voice-prompt system. The designer of that feature seemed to be aiming for ""robotic strict female voice,"" and did not build appropriate ""shoulders"" into each voice segment. The comical result is a herky-jerky delivery of voice prompts. It is further hampered by a low sampling rate; thus it is very hard to comprehend during a remote retrieval session.

--A computer-centric coding system for days of the week. The voice-driven time stamp system can tell you which day of the week a message arrived. But to SET the date, you have to know that the days of the week are numbered from 1 to 7, starting with Monday.

--A data-retention system that doesn't work. In theory, unplugging the machine from the wall (or experiencing a power failure) should not affect the system programming or received messages, as they should be retained in Flash ROM. Unplugging the power connector from the machine itself is designed to reset the machine--a desirable feature in the event that ownership is transferred to another person. In practice, forget retaining your messages when the transformer is unplugged, because the machine certainly will.

In sum, this is old technology, and it appears to have been realized by resource-starved wannabes who had little more than ancient parts, old designs, and a GE logo with which to work. There are almost no choices remaining for this kind of answering machine, but don't conclude that this one is still on the market because it deserves to be.

You would be better served to invest in a wireless base station that includes a mailbox-based answering system--and ignore the wireless handset if you don't need it.

"I purchased this machine because it has the most recording time and most mailboxes of all the consumer systems out there--I need these features for my business.  I also need the recording quality to be good, like your run-of-the-mill commercial voicemail system (or the old cassette-type machines) because I need to capture and edit these voice messages on my computer.  On the recommendation of a couple of reviewers in this forum who stated that the voice quality was great, I decided to give this model a try.

Well, this system does deliver the capacity, but I'm sorry to say that the voice quality is one of the worst I've ever heard on a digital answering machine.  It's the same problem that plagues all digital answerers: it sounds like you're hearing the message through water.  I have a puny, 4-year-old digital Radio Shack answerer at home that blows this item away in terms of voice quality.  (Unfortunately Radio Shack no longer makes answerers.)  In terms of the outgoing message, I tried recording it remotely by calling in (which results in a much better sounding announcement than doing it in the same room), but even that sounds crummy.

Sorry to be a downer here.  Don't get me wrong:  this unit may suit you for home purposes, but the quality--which I find to be at or slightly below par for digital answerers--is not at all acceptable for a business.

I am really disappointed with the state of affairs in the digital answering machine world (and regular telephones for that matter, but that's a whole other story).  Tape-based machines, which have far superior fidelity compared to these digital pieces of junk, are no longer made.  I am truly perplexed why we can't get the quality of commercial voicemail servers in a small package.  Are the makers of commercial servers are in cahoots with the folks who make consumer models to keep the quality down?

So, the bottom line is that I thought I could get away with not paying my local phone company $10/month for voicemail service, but alas, I have finally decided I cannot.  Just what this world needs--someone giving more easy money to AT&T for voicemail service.",1.0

times to re-insert the cartridge being careful to insert it correctly, but with no success in getting a readable copy.  I re-
inserted by old cartridge and was able to get good copies. At this point I am not sure what the problem is and so I have the new cartridge sitting on the table beside my printer.  The cartridges are exactly the same.

Thank you for inquiring.

"The product was misrepresented by the photograph of the original HP newest packaging. When opening the shipping box, the HP box was not the same as pictured. It could have been a much older product than the one I thought I had ordered. The product was damaged; the cartridge had a flawed piece on the underside and when inserted into the printer it made flapping noises. I tried several times to reinsert the cartridge with the same results. The cartridge would not print as well. The reseller refunded my purchase. If the photo had been the same as the box I opened, I probably would not have ordered the item.",1.0

"Someone must have had these in storage for over 15 years.  As soon as I opened them, the ink poured out the side making a mess everywhere.

This laserjet 5 toner cartridge puts black smudge marks on every page it prints. The smudges are about 1/4 inch thick and occur on every page printed - even the internal print test for the printer. I will try to get a replacement from the seller. Problem occurred on first page printed after install and continued to do so on each page of the 50 I printed. Another toner cartridge was placed in the printer and works fine. Re-installed this cartridge and problem came back.,1.0
The cartridge leaked all over the printer. It messed it up big time.  BUT they refunded money without me having to return it.,1.0
"Hope this performs as well as the last HP toner, and lasts as llong. And they added a compatible as well - I guess to try as a replacement product. - update to review --
I know it has been over a year since I bought this toner but I have printed fewer than 250 pages and the cartridge keeps getting the roller coated with toner - the wipers are all clogged with toner and the pages are all coming out with black shading covering almost the whole page. Wiping the roller with an optical cleaning cloth and turning the roller to wipe additional areas only causes the clogged wipers to add toner film back on the roller - terrible quality - I will be notifying other people on my review. I would avoid this dealer - this is not a quality product.",1.0

The item was defective. I called to complain about it but the replacement was defective as well. But I have to give credit to immediate response to replace the item but its just that it did not work as well.,1.0
When I opened the cartridge it spilled toner all over my over my office and floors. Not easy to clean-up. (I have installed many cartridges over the years). When  I put it in the printer it spilled toner throughout the interior of the printer and would not make clear copies. I have returned the cartridge. My printer is so full of toner I think it is un-functional and I may have to have it professionally cleaned or have to replace it.,1.0
Defective cartridge.  Upon removing the strip that keeps the toner in the cartridge the toner leaked ouf of the cartridge.  When a print was attempted large blobs of toner were on the page.,1.0
"I was eager to install this cartridge because my old cartridge was creating streaky pages. I was really disappointed to find that when I installed this one, I got faded-looking pages with a streak (from top to bottom, about an inch in from the left side of the pages). It looks like I'm using the tail end of a cartridge, instead of a fresh one. I am NOT happy!",1.0

"This was supposed to be a NEW cartridge, on the outside label it states Made from RECYCLED parts.
When installed, It leaked toner all over the paper on EVERY sheet, from the 1st to the 12th, when I packed it up and returned.",1.0
Cartridge only printed four pages of clear print then the next 30 pages were all grey ghosts - letter weren't legible.,1.0

"This was in an old HP box, and was obviously a remanufactured cartridge.  Would have been fine, but toner leaked everywhere constantly.  I even got some on my coach purse.. Thanks a lot.  Will not buy from again.",1.0
"IF I could give this seller ZERO stars, I would.  This print cartridge made a horrible screeching noise when it was first installed, then proceeded to paper-jam every page.  When I finally got it to print without jamming, it only printed about 200 pages, making a ""rubbing on paper"" sound every page and then jammed again.  After I removed the paper jam this last time and resumed printing, it only printed BLANK PAGES!!!  I contacted Eric Strong with Supply Link, LLC and he pushed me off onto HP for a replacement of this clearly defective print cartridge.  WOW, what a disappointment.",1.0
"1. Poorly made HP cartridge clone.
2. Broke along paper feed edge producing thin sharp plastic shards.
3. Ink no longer sealed in cartridge.
4. Plastic shards jammed into printer.
5. HP box was not a retail box, a clone box.
6. A very bad experience, do not recommend this company for any product or service.",1.0
"If this is a ""compatible HP"" cartridge, as the title admits, why is a picture shown of an ACTUAL  HP-manufactured cartridge. That is deceptive, and makes me think this is a company to avoid.

Don't try to fool people here on Amazon - we all watch out for each other and point out deceptive discrepancies like this. If you're trying to deceive me, then I don't want what you're selling, no matter how good the price seems.",1.0
Was dried out when I got it.,1.0
"not real ribbons, or old and dried ink....  They come in a box that although have a laser label, is not quite the same as other oki ribbons that I had bought.
Of the 4 I bought...  3 didn't last a full run of printing and the fourth... I am just going to return...",1.0
These are not genuine Oki ribbons.  They don't have Oki logo on ribbon and no Oki boxes.  They are just in individual plastic bags.  Not sure how they perform.,1.0

"After only a month-and-a-half of relatively light use (about 4 faxes received per day), this ink cartridge is already running out of ink.  The faxes are faint and hard to read.  I expect more from a $34 cartridge.",1.0
"This has been a total rip off.  The cartriges were defective.  The ""company"" I bought them from wanted nothing to do with warranty and refunding my money.  Canon wanted nothing to do with it.  And Amazon has been no help at all, and useless to work with.  It's been a bad deal, bad experience, and all parties involved are at fault.",1.0
"I am not at all a satisfied customer.  This item, a refill in a generic package, which would be OK with me if it worked, is a mistake which found me.  I installed the cartridge in the fax, could see the ink rolling around in the clear side of the cartridge, but could not get it to print AT ALL, not even a smudge.  I must have cleaned the head two dozen times, trying to unstop what I imagined were plugged orifices.  After an hour of tinkering, I finally got faint lines of scanned material to print with lines of skip through lines of type.  I had no alternative but to resort to a more expensive cartridge from a famous bbox having learned my lesson with refills.  I have already paid Amazon for the thing but it was a useless expense.  I think I should be reimbursed for my expense but I don't know where to find the fine print.  Cartridge came from RAVI.",1.0
We had purchased these through 3Peer and when we opened them to use them the ink only lasted 1 day so I wrote to them and they told me it was my problem and they wouldn't replace the ones that I hadn't used yet. So there for I wasn't happy with that company.,1.0
This is a rip off. All prints came out black plus it is obviously a refilled cartridge - and at an exorbitant price. Disgraceful. I've wasted my money and had to throw it away. I'm sure I'm not the only one taken by this product. Amazon should not associate themselves with so called suppliers like this.,1.0
"I had a lot of trouble with this item.  When I tried to insert the new toner in place of the old one, something didn't fit correctly and it would not seat in place.  I have compared the old and the new toner and can't see the problem.  They appear identical, but something is off.  I am still working on it, but so far it doesn't fit..",1.0
"I bought my printer/copier less than a month ago and it came with a BCI-21 Black and BCI-21 Color ink tank.  I have not been using the machine that much yet and while I was copying a few pages which required black ink,  suddenly the black prints just were not showing.  I have not even printed  more than 100 pages since I got my printer.  I still have color ink coming  out but black is missing in my pages.",1.0
"Stay clear of this machine....it is not user friendly (you even need a screwdriver to change the battery), the buttons are not easy to use and many of them need to be operated in a way that, at first glance, doesn't  make sense and is not consistent with other machines out there.  Forget  about trying to use the remote answering feature without the owner's manual  handy.  I got so frustrated that I threw mine in the garbage after a couple  of weeks and bought another machine.",1.0
"The OKI Ink ribbon cartridges were just what I ordered at a good price $1.99 each, but the shipping and handling was $39.96 and I guarantee the cost to ship to us was not more than $5.00.  The OKI Ink Cartridges are little ribbon boxes and may weight a 1/4 pound at most, it was shipped in a plastic sleeve envelope with no packaging protection via U.S. Postal Service.  I am very disappointed in the way this company does business by gouging the customer for shipping and handling charges.  Will not buy from them again.",1.0

"I HAVE PURCHASED MANY OF YOUR BC-20 CARTRIDGES FOR USE IN MY CANON C2500 PRINTER AND CALCOMP TECHJET 720C PLOTTER WHICH I USE IN MY SURVEYING BUSINESS.

I CUT OPEN THE LAST BRAND-NEW CARTRIDGE I BOUGHT AFTER IT WOULD NOT WORK IN THE CANON PRINTER, AND THERE WAS NO INK IN IT (JUST A LOT OF SPONGE).

"This Canon BC-20 cartridge arrived a day earlier than predicted possible, but whien I installed it in my printer, it acted like some of my expired cartridges:  it was accepted by the printer and went through the motions as if it were new, but failed on many attempts to leave any ink on the page.  I suspect that it is clogged or dried out to to age beyond its shelf life.",1.0
"Can't print with it. The printer accepted the cartridge and tried to print, but the output was almost invisible. Many attempts to print were to no avail.",1.0
I got the cartridge fast but I have no inkput from the cartridge. I will order from another company and then say whether it is the cartridge or the printer. If it is the cartridge that was dry then I would not order from this company again.,1.0
"My Canon printer is about 8 years old,BJC 2100. The cartridge is no longer in any retail store. Can get refurbished on line. In general not worth the problems.

"I ordered this cartridge from Printers and Toners in November, and the product came to me with water-damaged packaging, and the cartridge didn't work to boot. Got a replacement, and it was just as bad. I would steer clear of this cartridge since they are not made by Canon anymore. Don't know what it says about the Seller since they sent me a defective product twice, but I would give them only one star as well.

"I don't know if the cartridges were just old or what, but the film wrapped around the plastic and wouldn't wind on the roll. I ordered three. Two of the three were bad. Because we opened two of the cartridges after 30 days of receipt, we could NOT return them or receive credit.",1.0
"Cartridge did not work properly; did not wind properly, cartridge carbon paper stuck to copy paper. Have returned it expecting credit.",1.0
"I bought this and the ad said it was new and in the box.  Well, it was used and essentially worn out.  It was in the manufacturer's box, however.  It was taped in the internal foil bag and the cardboard packaging around it was partially torn.  I figured that someone probably bought the wrong one, returned it, and I bought the returned item.  No such luck.  It works, but has poor print quality -- prints too light, drum is scratched so there is toner ""fogging"" on printed sheets, spotting, etc.  I'm not one to send things back -- because I don't want to waste my time or endure the hassle.  Instead, I just never use the seller again and I recommend that others not use them either.  This company was supposedly highly/well-rated and I bought the drum around September 2010.  Maybe they have gotten worse sine the earlier ratings.  Good luck.",1.0
"My product was defective. Infinite Surplus ignored my email asking for assistance. They ignored it, presumably in the hope that the 30 day refund deadline would expire. Amazon stepped in to save the day. Amazon should kick Infinite Surplus out of its webspace. NEVER BUY FROM Infinite Surplus.",1.0
"While the price is as good as it gets, save your money and buy a new machine.  I bought this drum unit, and it solved the problem I was having with the original unit, but gave me a whole new problem -- poor print quality.  I then purchased a new cartridge, but that didn't improve the quality.  So, after spending a little over $150, I've concluded that I wasted my money and I'm back to square one.  Not good!",1.0
I've only had one problem with this machine but its a big one. It's cuts callers off in the middle of their message...no where near the 4 minute mark.  I've had hang ups on friends and business customers.,1.0
Got a second one after the first one stopped recording after less than a year.  The second one didn't work from the start.  Will try something else.,1.0
"I bought this printer a couple years ago with an iMac. It initially worked fine, and I was quite happy with it. I guess for the time period when I bought it, that it was a high quality printer. But as the months wore on, it started being finicky with printing, sometimes not following commands. When I turned it on, it took about 5 minutes of deafening screeching sounds to prepare for printing, then printed very slowly. Black text was okay, but color was very bad. The only way to get a halfway decent print out of it was to put it on the highest quality mode of printing, which ATE ink. Furthermore, the color printouts were very grainy, and fuzzy at times.
When I upgraded to a Gateway PC with Windows ME, I hooked up the printer to it, and it worked fine. Once. Then it just stopped printing! I reinstalled all the drives, got new ones from the epson website, emailed tech support, and nothing worked. Eventually I brought it, along with the computer, to the Gateway store to have them fix it. It came back and printed only one time. Afterward, it died again. It has been sitting dormant still hooked up to my computer, and once in awhile, just for the heck of it, I'll try to print something. It will make all the normal printing sounds, but still produce only a blank sheet of paper.
Ink cartridges were very expensive..., so now I won't even consider getting a printer with the ink tanks in one cartridge. I've just ordered a Canon S520, with the individual ink tank system, and I suspect I'll be very pleased with it.
Overall, this printer's life span is an embarrassment, and when it works, it's a waste of your money. Spend your money on something else, just not this printer.",1.0
"we purchased this printer in Feb.-within 2 weeks the print quality deteriorated significantly! They also would not honor the $50. rebate coupon, although all required info was there. We have an HP printer of comparable price that has lasted 2 years and counting. We'll NEVER buy  another epson product EVER!  Don't get suckered like we were.",1.0
"I bought the epson 740 thinking it was the best alternative to the imac computer, but after a few months it broke down. I used it for papers and It is not that I used it a lot, anyways the service at epson was very  efficient they send me a new printer in a matter of days, but after a  couple of months the new printer was dead I paid extra 50 dollars to have  it repaired and just before a midterm paper print out it died on me again.  Epson products are cheap and they die after the warranty expires SHAME ON  YOU EPSON, SHAME ON YOU",1.0

"This is a warning to all Macintosh users considering buying this printer!
The hardware for this printer is excellent for the money, but is backed by TERRIBLE software.  After installing the driver software, and after being disappointed that it did NOT support desktop printing, and barely worked with the Chooser, I found that the driver software would constantly cause the computer to crash, even with only the base extension set for MacOS 9 loaded.  After contacting Brother tech support on multiple occasions, they were unable to explain why this was happening.
Disgusted by the fact that their software was so poorly tested as to crash with only MacOS extensions loaded, and the lack of any kind of software tech support, I had no choice but to return the printer.
Shortly after, I purchased a comparable replacement which has been nothing but a pleasure to use, and has very good software to back it up: the NEC SuperScript 1400.
I highly recommend the NEC SuperScript 1400 as an alternative to any Mac users considering buying the Brother HL-1240.  If you do buy the HL-1240, you will be in for nothing but trouble.",1.0
"I foolishly bought two of these phones -- one for my business line and one for my personal line.
The reception is terrible. Even if I am sitting right next to the base unit I find that the quality is hit or miss.
Many times I'll start a call and the reception will be find. Fifteen minutes into the call I'll start getting this terrible buzzing sound that continues and only gets worse. I am not positive but I think for some reason the phone starts to lose its security code with the base unit.
The phone also claims you can change ""channels"" if your reception gets fuzzy. This has never helped me.
I've been across the room -- less than 20 feet -- and tried to use the phone and I've sporadically gotten the ""No Signal"" sign -- meaning the unit couldn't communicate with the base.
I'm not sure what the problem is , but since I have two of these units (and both behave just as poorly) I am nearly 100% positive it is some type of design flaw. I'd avoid these expensive units as the extra money spent surely hasn't bought me anything extra in terms of clarity or distance.
The range is nothing spectacular. Don't be fooled by the two antennas or any of the advertising gimmickry -- this phone is sub-par.",1.0
I purchased this phone and it stopped working within the 1 year warranty.  I mailed it to Panasonic over 2 months ago and still haven't gotten my phone back.  The repair center does not return my calls.  I will never buy another Panasonic product again.,1.0
"As another reader wrote, I, too, am now receiving ""Out of Range"" messages on my phone.  That means that the handset is unable to communicate with the base, thus rendering the phone useless: you can't make calls, you  can't receive calls, you can't check voicemail status.
I purchased one  phone which lasted 7 months.  The 2nd one lasted 5 months.
There is no  help on the Panasonic website, so I had to return the phones to the  Panasonic repair facility.
For the time that these phones worked, they  were great.  But unless you are happy to get new phones every 6 months or  so, spend your money on something else.",1.0
"I really liked this phone out of the box.  The reception was great, range good, caller ID good, solid feel and good looks. (note; had this phone but the model with the caller ID)  After 9-10 months of use, however, the phone  is useless.  The reception is pathetic (can't understand the caller even  when right beside the base), calls don't go through to the handset even  when in the charger and I'm always getting the 'Out of Range' message  (again, even when right beside the base).  May have been a dud but I expect  to get more than 1 year out of even the cheapest phone.  Am shopping for a  replacement right now and would not even consider this phone, even at a  fraction of the price!",1.0
"For quarter-fold cards, these are completely adequate.  In fact, Amazon's price and low shipping cost means that you'll come out ahead over buying at most retail outlets.
The product's major flaw is precisely that they  _are_ quarter-fold cards.  You'll rarely find a quarter-fold at a card  shop--especially not made out of heavy card stock--because they're bulky  and impermanent.  They're twice as thick as the more standard two-fold  cards.  And if you can fold them, your recipient can unfold them.  This  destructability fairly screams ""I was made on a computer in someone's  home office.""
So why do so many people buy this product?  I guess  because the sheets are the same size as North American letter paper, they  ""feel"" familiar.  Maybe, as well, the format is a hold-over from  the 1980s, when dot matrix printers reigned, and there was no other  convenient way to make cards but by quad-folding.  Or perhaps it's because  a two-fold card in the small invitation size is rarely (if ever) available  at most retail locations.
Whatever the reasons, your end results with  this product will look as cheap as the card stock costs.",1.0

"The picture in the ad is a real HP toner cartridge box, and the description says it is from Hewlet Packard.  However many of the items for sale are NOT genuine HP cartridges, and others are genuine, but refilled cartridges with ""NEW"" as the condition.

Let the buyer beware, Amazon is allowing clone sellers and refillers pretend to sell new HP cartridges with no clear indication of what you are buying from some of the merchants.  Kudos to the merchants clearly stating what they are selling, but shame on Amazon for allowing some merchants to make it look like they are selling the real thing when they aren't.  The picture is of a genuine HP product, this should NOT be allowed if some or all of the items are from third party manufacturers or are refills.

Let the buyer beware!

I use refills all the time, but the quality is not the same as new.  I have my cartridges refilled locally, and when they wear out (and they do wear out) I tell the refiller to keep them, and I buy new replacements (and refill those till they wear out).

Only HP manufactured new cartridges should be sold under this item listing as new.  A second listing for clone cartridges made by third parties should allow third party cartridges that are new to be sold as new, and all refills should be sold as used.",1.0

I bought this for convinience, but has only been a problem and a waste  of my time. I am not giving up yet though, I have asked Amazon to replace  the unit. Will see what happens!",1.0
"No mention of this being an open box item from Books and Stuff.  Cut the tape to find that the plastic bag was open and the sealing strip had been pulled as well.  Definitely not satisfied with purchase and am putting in for a return/exchange.

This cartridge was defective and ran out of toner in one month. The last cartridge last over 6 months with no change to my printing volume.,1.0
"total crap.  didn't last at all in my fax machine, which doesn't print much.  save your $$$ and buy generic toner for like $18.  It will be the same crap but much cheaper.",1.0
"My Cartridge squeaked and was empty of ink. My hp4050 said after I installed it, to replace it. It was low on toner. The box was sealed completely, so it must have been a factory screw up. Now my printer is down for another 2 weeks. We had to buy a replacement printer to handle our printing needs.

 Maybe buying from HP would the best choice even paying 2/3's more for it.",1.0
"I must agree with the other reviewers here.  I'd had my Panasonic phone for about two months when it started giving me an ""Out of range"" message whenever I tried to make a call, even when I was just inches from the base!  After a few days, it started working normally, but then it started with the ""Out of range"" nonsense again, and it has been erratic ever since.  It's not a bad phone otherwise; I haven't had as many problems with static as the others have.  I have noticed that it starts ringing (if it rings at all!) a few seconds after the other phone I have in my house, which is a Brother phone/fax with digital answering machine.  Still, for the $169.99 I paid for this phone (not from Amazon.com), I expect better a performance.  Pass on this one.",1.0
"I have had great success with Panasonic phones in the past.  I bought the 2.4 GHz hoping to have the same quality I've had with previous versions.  And initially I was very satisfied with the phone.
It is a very attractive unit and has many very nice features.  I love the phone number book.  It's so easy to store names and numbers in the phone's memory.  You can cycle through the names by pressing the up and down arrow.  Once you find the name you're looking for it will dial the number by pressing the talk button.  Very slick.  The conversations I had were very clear and crisp.  I had unbelievable range and clarity.  I also bought a headset so I could clip the phone to my belt and talk ""hands free"".  It was wonderful.  The only thing I didn't like about it at first was the fact that the base unit isn't wall mountable.
After about a month my luck changed.  After talking on the phone for about 10 minutes the conversation would be filled with static and I'd have to switch phones.  The person I was talking to wouldn't notice the noise. A month or so after that I would get the ""Out of Range"" message when trying to get a dial tone.  I noticed other reviewers reporting the same fact.  As time went on it got worse and worse.
Today, maybe three four months after I bought it, I cannot use it.  I can't get a dial tone.  It is always out of range.  I've gone through every suggestion in the trouble shooter's guide but can't fix it.  I would call the help line, but I honestly don't think it is worth my time or trouble.
My advice to you is to avoid this phone.  From reading other reviews it appears that the design has major flaws in it that cannot be fixed.  Perhaps the next line of ""high tech"" phones will be of better quality.",1.0
"I purchased this phone in March,00 to replace a Sony that worked well but  was large. From the beginning I noticed too much ststic for a  state-of-the-art cordless phone. Also, rather than set my answering machine  to answer after three rings I had to set it to 5 rings because the phone  will ring 2 to 3 times before the handset on this cordless rings. In july I  started getting ""Out of range"" message when I use the phone close  (anywhere inside my small wood frame house) to the base. I will send the  phone in for repair but am not hopeful because I was told by Panasonic that  this is a design problem with this phone.",1.0

This is not a genuine retail packaging. The item description and the photos that I see online are not what was shipped to me. Very disappointing.,1.0
"This was supposed to be a new toner cartridge, in retail packaging.

It wasn't.

It was just a cartridge in a plastic bag.  no retail box, no instructions.
I'm not even sure that it's a new cartridge.  It looked like it had marks on it like it had been in another printer before I got it.

It did have the plastic strip protecting the drum, but that's the only indication that they hadn't just pulled it out of an old printer and shipped it to me.

So yeah,  I'm not impressed, and won't be buying from them again.",1.0

"Not sure why anyone is allowed to advertise new toners, and ship something different, but this seems to be the new norm with Amazon.  If I wanted re-filled toners, I would have ordered one of the other cheaper items listed.  This was shown in the HP box, but my order is in a plain brown box with a label that said it was shipped that way for safety.  I opened one of the boxes and inside there is just the toner in bubblewrap and another black bag.  I'm hesitant to open that, because I intend to return this shipment.  Why isn't this considered FALSE advertising?",1.0
"I purchased a HP27X Toner from Dealathon.  I was very careful checking the wording to make sure it was not a remanufactured product.  It came in an original HP box that was beat up.  When we installed the toner it completely messed up our printer.  From the first copy it was definitely lighter in quality and it left black lines all over our copies.  When I tried to get it replaced, all I was told is that it is past the alotted time for returns.  No one from dealathon ever contacted me and I consider this poor customer service. Apparently they are not willing to stand behing their product.  We had to remove this cartridge and now we are having problems with our printer.  It definitely was not a new cartridge and they are using false advertising.  This looks bad for both Amazon and Dealathon.",1.0

"The title of this review is harsh but, at the time that I purchased this cartridge, it was listed as ""new"" and the word ""re-manufactured"" did not appear anywhere in the description.  I was careful to order this one particularly because it was listed as ""new.""  When it arrived and I opened the bag, the cartridge was covered with toner.  I cleaned it up and installed it in the printer.  From the outset it left toner ""skid marks"" on every page.  Since it was a ""new"" HP cartridge, I called HP to tell them of the problem.  They asked me to confirm that the drum in the cartridge was green.  ""Yes,"" I said.  HP: ""It doesn't have a blueish cast to it does it?""  ""No,""  I said ""it does not.""  That is when they informed me the green drum indicates that the cartridge is not theirs.  I have purchased reloaded cartridges before and they are far better and less expensive than this piece of junk.  In reading other reviews, this appears to be a problem with Amazon and, while Amazon gave  me an immediate refund and paid for the return shipping, I am still disappointed.  The reviews indicate that most make the same discovery, but decide to keep the cartridge because it works alright, apparently not minding that they paid way too much for it in light of the fact that it is re-manufactured.  Someone is making a lot of money dishonestly selling these things as new and, since Amazon has the power to police this, I hold Amazon.com responsible.  So, Amazon, are you going to police this nor not?  By the way, I now have a new, genuine HP toner cartridge purchased elsewhere...",1.0

"I purchased this item through Amazon and received it from an Amazon vendor the next day.  That is the only thing I can say positive about the product.  I am not sure if it is old and has been laying around for years or not, but since I have an older model laser printer HP 5P, these cartridges are not easily found at good prices anywhere. My old cartridge was running out of toner ink and my copies were getting lighter. This new cartridge is great for dark black tones, but there are 4 stripes that run across the page. I tried cleaning the cartridge and cleaning my printer, but to no avail.  Since I use this all the time for my work, I am very unhappy with this product. I think that Amazon should make sure that their vendors are not selling old and/or defective products.  When I print an envelope, there are 4 black stripes across the front and it looks terrible. Since I threw out the box and the purchase details, I did not know where to send it for replacement! I hope other people do not have this same problem.",1.0

But when the cartridges arrived (yes, like a fool I bought two), they are literally a NO NAME BRAND - there is no name of any company, any website, any address or phone number anywhere on the box! I don't dare put these things in my printer - I have not even opened the black bags. I am going to return them and demand a refund. THESE ARE NOT ""Original HP LaserJet 03A Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging"" - a complete FRAUD.

If these are HP Toner cartridges they have refilled, they are still committing a fraud by not saying so in the Amazon product description. Any why be so shy about not putting their name on the box?

Got on Amazon and got a return authorization but needed to print the return label and forgot I still had the bad cart in the printer and it screwed that up as well, put in the old cart and it printed fine. HP ships these out in the HP box as pictured but this company does not, it comes in a black plastic bag with no HP box. When purchased directly from HP you place the old used cart in the HP box with a prepaid label and ship it back to them where they either reuse them, dispose of them in and environmentally safe way, or maybe they sell them to outfits like this one to refill with lousy toner.  If you are ordering this to use later I suggest you test it so it is still within the Amazon return policy. I should have known better. I shop at Amazon because of the return policy for prime members and lately I have been happy for that. If the day comes when they refuse a return that will be the end for me. I love shopping on Amazon but some of the vendors stink.  As soon as Amazon sees that you have received the shipment they ask you to rate the seller and ask if you receive it on time and all that and no way to say the seller is selling defective products.

HP Bright White 24 LB (NOT)

I used to LOVE this paper. Nice weight and brightness and smooooooth. So I purchased a BOX of 5 reams and it is all different from my past purchases. The paper is VERY thin feeling; if I print text and images on both sides, the paper comes out feeling WET and is saturated with ink (360 dpi setting), tends to fold at corners when on duplex mode and is, in point of fact, rough to the touch as compared to the same ream I had left from a much older purchase;  I recently printed a two-sided print with my older paper and the new paper and the new paper is lousy in comparison.

I have gone back to Epson (more expensive but worth it) paper. Hewlett Packard has done what candy makers do, offer a lesser quality product (or smaller candy bar) with the same wrapper, same price and hope no one notices. I noticed.

Buyer beware! It is NOT what it used to be.",1.0
"First I bought an HP C4096A from Ahlee Store here on Amazon, but it arrived in rather beatup condition, the cartridge was very old and was defective, printing ghost images of the text every 40mm. Next I bought an HP C4096A from Toner Buzz here on Amazon, but it too was very old, and it too was defective, printing black smears all over the page. So I gave up on these ""bargain"" priced HP cartridges, and ordered the Verbatim refurbished cartridge from Amazon. The Verbatim cartridge works flawlessly and has print quality every bit as good, if not better than, my best HP cartridge.",1.0
"Completely defective. Only prints 4 dark lines instead of text, printer still works fine with old cartridge. No way to contact seller for a replacement, have to return & reorder, another waste of time...",1.0
"horrible.. the cartridge didn't survive installation.. while installing, a spring popped off the left side, and when I withdrew the cartridge, a tab snapped off.  The guard covering the roller is obviously bent, perhaps the cause of stress on the other parts.  What a sterling example of poor quality control.  I'm surprised that there are so many positive reviews for this product, I expected better.",1.0
Must be a refurbished product but it was done so poorly. Didn't work properly and made a constant clicking sound while printing.,1.0
"This toner cart does not work. It prints dark splotches all over every single page. It may be defective, or it may be counterfeit, or it may be some kind of ""remanufactured"" thing.  All I know is that is really, really doesn't work. Seller was ""Second Chance Industries"". Price was 1/2 to 1/3 what HP would charge. I guess I should have know better....",1.0
We have used this toner for years and never had a problem. don't know why this particular one left wide smear stripes all over the printed paper.,1.0

Defective cartridge or possibly damaged in transit. Printed vertical or horizontal lines on pages immediately upon installation. Had to be returned.,1.0

"I bought this at the end of August but did not put in my printer until September - past the 30 day return policy.  I had problems from the beginning.  It said it was in original packaging but it must not have come from the factory.  Lines showed up on all my pages.  All attempts to clean (used the original manual suggestions, online suggestions and even bought a cleaning kit) failed.  Huge waste of my time and money and now I need to find another source as I have purchased this from Amazon before and can no longer trust them.",1.0

"I thought I was getting an HP toner cartridge. What I got was a knock-off generic toner cartridge. I paid $84 for this item, and the price dropped to about $26 after I had ordered it. The image of the item looks like an HP toner package, and the manufacturer is listed as ""by HP,"" but this is not the item pictured and it is not from HP. I returned this cartridge, but I've now wasted a week waiting for it, getting it, returning it, ordering an actual HP toner cartridge, and now waiting for the real one to arrive. To be fair, the Product Description does say this is a generic cartridge, but that's a one-sentence entry and it doesn't really stand out on the webpage.",1.0
This is not the right printer cartridge for the HP 2300d.  The Amazon website is incorrect.,1.0
The cartridge is faulty. It leaves a ghost image that transfers to the paper. I called to request a refund or exchange. They said they would send return instructions within 24 to 48 hours. I'm still waiting 3 days later.,1.0

"... I bought the phone in May, 2001, when I had just moved into an apartment next to a municipal airport in Indianapolis. I thought the interference was possibly caused by a RADAR station nearby, but once I moved into a house in 2002 I realized the phone itself was faulty. I called Panasonic and they said they'd never heard of the ""out of range"" problem ...",1.0
"This is the worst phone I've even owned.  After a few months of use, it's impossible to use ever again.  Can't erase old numbers from the handset.  Constantly beeps OUT OF RANGE message when trying to erase.  Can't hear the person on the other end. Because of this bad purchase, I bacame weary of other Panasonic phones.",1.0
"I thought this phone worked pretty well when we first got it, but the longer we had it, the less we liked it.  The reception is good, but that's just about the only positive thing about it. First of all, we lost the manual when we moved and it's just about impossible to figure out how to use any of the features, even just setting the time and date is difficult.  Secondly, when you listen to your messages and you want to return a phone call, the answerer shuts off as soon as you turn the phone on.  So if someone left a number to return their call, you need to write it down first and then turn the phone on to call.  And thirdly, after a year of use, we're getting this ""out of range"" message almost every time we try to make a call, even then we're right next to the phone.  I've had Panasonic phones in the past that have lasted over 5 years, but this one is a big disappointment, especially for the price.  We're changing to Uniden phones which tend to work well and get good ratings.",1.0
"I was happy at first with this Panasonic product because of its great clarity...it was indistinguishable from a corded phone.  However certain problems arose such as the counter intuitive control buttons requiring two steps to redial, the silver paint peeling off, and the large heavy handset becoming quite warm after a few minutes.  I got adjusted to these idiosyncrasies, but in about a year and a half after the warranty had expired, my Panasonic phone began developing a strong, pulsing static noise after ten minutes which would completely obliterate the reception forcing me to use my old 900mhz phone.  After reading all the other reviews of this product I decided not to repair it because of the numerous horror stories of Panasonic customer service with  this model phone.  I bought a Uniden with the same features instead; it was smaller, lighter, functionally easier to use, and doesn't roast my right ear.",1.0
This product is way over priced.  It can be purchased at local stores for less than the total cost here.,1.0
"This is the worst phone I have ever bought.
It was great to hear people with the same problems.
The first several months the phone was the best, then static started creeping in.  Panasonic would not do anything.
I have become very soured on their products because of their lack of support on this issue.
Don't Buy this phone, it is a waste of money.",1.0
"This has got to be the worst performing phone ever.  I will never again buy a Panasonic product.  Constantly having to push numbers twice to get them to register, out of range messages within two feet of the transmitter, glitchy headphone receptor, you name it there's something wrong with it.  Best of luck winning me back as a customer.",1.0
"I had problems within a week of buying this product. When the phone rings, the answering machine mysteriously loses power. The in use button goes off and the machine refuses to answer calls. I checked the documentation and this scenerio is not covered. I would avoid this answering machine at all costs.",1.0
"I LOVED this phone at first then within 6 months there was so much static on the handset that we can't use it.  I am glad I read that this is a common problem here before we went and bought the... replacement battery.
Also, you really have to keep the manual because nothing is simple.",1.0
Great price but didn't print in my machine. Returned. Received credit in timely manner. Thank you,1.0
"It worked fine for about year, and as soon as its warranty is over, static has come into the handset! The manual says to push a button to choose a different channel, but it does not work!",1.0
"Like most other reviewers, it was incredulous to me that Panasonic would do such a poor job with one of their top of the line products.  If I had paid $40 for a cordless phone, I could understand the problems I've had.  But when I pay [this amount of money] for a phone, I expect a certain level of quality and service.
I would rate this phone at a 0 because if its constant buzzing after a few minutes.  I paid $25 to buy a replacement battery thinking that the battery was the source of my problems.  The buzzing is actaully worse, and now I get ""out of range"" errors that prohibit the use of the phone.  Also, it's hidden redial feature amazes me.  I searched and searched for the quick redial feature and the one touch dialing which I just knew would be there.  I wish I had the time to pursue this with the BBB.",1.0
"Produced so much static that we could not hear caller, just after one year use.  Sent off to the Panasonic Service Center, after 2 months, I called and they said it was repaired and in the mail back to me.  The phone had not been repaired and when I called them about it, was treated indifferently and then they disconnected me. I wrote the company and never received a reply.  So cancelled the credit card charge and will never buy Panasonic again.",1.0
"Shortly after one year the phone developed such load static that we could not hear the callers.  Sent to Panasonic Service which proved to be inept, indifferent, and discourteous.  Took the Service Center two months to charge me a $25 service fee, neglected to do anything to the phone, then sent it back to me.  When questioned, the Service people were rude and when asked to explain, hung-up on me.  I cancelled the $25 credit card charge, wrote the company giving the sequence of events and stating that I will never purchase a Panasonic product again. Never heard back from them. Their loss!",1.0
Like others my phone went dead after a few months. Out of range messages appeared all of a sudden. This phone works great for a while then it dies. I had two of these and the same thing happened with each one! JUNK.,1.0
"I have been a loyal customer for Panasonic phones for over 10 years.  I bought this phone about a year ago, and have only one piece of advice:  avoid purchasing this phone.  I was suckered into buying this as a replacement for a perfectly good 900 mhz phone because of the idea that 2.4 would be more secure and offer greater range.  This really hasn't proven to be true with this phone.

I often can't hear callers because of static in the headset speaker, which has forced me to use the speakerphone more than I'd like to because the headset is virtually unusable.  I might be willing to believe that my phone is a lemon, but too many other reviewers have voiced similar complaints to be ignored.

Also, as the editorial review states, the design of this phone doesn't make much sense.  Programming the phone is confusing.  It is missing simple features.  NO MUTE BUTTON.  NO SIMPLE WAY TO REDIAL.  NO simple way to access stored numbers, or to store them.  Overall, this phone is an embarrassing piece of junk.  The engineers who designed this phone should be ashamed.  Panasonic has let its customers down with this phone.  :(",1.0
"This phone worked great for almost a year.  Then as I talked, I would hear a crackling noise.  Finally, the crackling noise became unbearable.  Now when I search on the caller id, I get the message 'out of range'.  I thought it was the battery going bad (it has a re-chargeable battery); however, when I replaced the battery, it did not improve.  Don't buy this phone.  The service is poor too.  I left a voice mail and they never returned my call.  I bet I have cost Panasonic at least 6 phone sales by word of mouth.  I proud of it too.  It would be morally reprehensible to let people enter into a buying decision on this phone without letting them know it is a terrible contraption.",1.0

For that price (& refurbished) it was a waste of my money and time. I ended up taking some old ones I had to a local ""printer ink refil"" place and had to pay $40 for the both of them. Guess I shouldn't (and I will never again) buy an ink cartridge on amazon! Still out the $15 I spent for the broken cartridge...",1.0

"If you see a pattern in the reviews of this machine, believe it.
I own this unit and the reviews of it here are accurate.  After a year of ownership, my ""out of range"" problem occurs in about 1 of every 10 uses.  In addition, the phone does generate more static over time, rendering a normal conversation quite difficult.  Further, a large majority of people I talk with claim that my phone makes my voice sound very quiet.  Finally, the phone is awkward to hold during a long conversation.
There are good points.  The answering machine is nice and relatively easy to use.  That's pretty much it.
Conclusion:  I got suckered by the good looks of this machine.  Believe me and everybody else here when we tell you that no matter how good it looks, the unit is not reliable.",1.0
"I bought this phone just about one year ago and over the last month and a half have been experiencing heavy static and ""out of range messages"".  I currently have the phone away from all electronic componets and have moved it around my place several times but the results have been the same. My last phone was a Sony cordless and I had it for over 3 years with no problems except for my roomate spilling water on it- bad luck. I'm shocked to see all of the similar issues with this phone and believe that Panasonic should be liable for a full refund- I will not waste my time on another Panasonic phone.  Someone mentioned a class action lawsuit..it might be time to look into that option....",1.0
"I was duped into thinking Panasonic manufactured quality phones as well.  6 months later it was completely dead - out of range messages, and extreme static/buzzing.  After numerous calls to Panasonic and angry letters, the best they could offer was a new model I could purchase for $50 in return for my silence (to which I obviously declined).  With the number of horrible complaints they've received, I'm surprised that no one has threatened a class action lawsuit.  Any lawyers out there interested?",1.0
"I had a simple objective when purchasing my last cordless phone: clear and reliable operation. Unfortunately, I was lured by the good reputation of Panasonic and assumed their top-of-the-line model would fit the bill, especially given the high price.
I was terribly disapointed. The phone is only 6 months old, and it is now totally useless. I usally can not create a connection between the handset and the base, and if I can, the audio is so bad the phone is useless. I REALLY feel ripped off.
Panasonic has really done itself a great disservice to its brand reputation. I would strongly recommend against this purchase.",1.0
"You know, I thought perhaps it was just *my* phone that started this incessent buzzing noise about 10 minutes into every single call (incoming and outgoing), forcing me to disconnect and call back on another phone! I was incredulous when, after sending this piece of junk back to the factory, they actually sent me back a new completely different broken phone that buzzes with every call. And no paperwork. No info telling me that the repair had a 90 day warrantee, which I found out later when speaking to a very unsympathetic Panasonic supervisor on the phone (not this one).
 I initially bought this phone, thinking it was higher quality, to do radio interviews. I paid a lot of money for it. I've always owned Panasonic phones. Am now contacting the better business bureau as I refuse to let Panasonic get away with this. Even just on principle. It's one thing for a few customers to have problems with a certain model, but it's quite another when the company is obviously aware of a flawed product and yet chooses to ignore the complaints.
P.S. The very few who praise this phone after reading so many similar negative reviews should have their heads examined. I will never buy another phone without researching others consumer comments.",1.0
"For the amount of money that I spent on this phone when it just came out, I am extremely disappointed. It worked well the first couple of months then the coating on the earpiece began to peel; but I could somehow deal with that. But then, the static noises started appearing and became more and more frequent. A cousin who had bought the same model about three months before I bought mine warned me that his phone had began doing the same thing and that it would actually get worse. And guess what? worse it certainly got!!! I could not believe it. All I could hear when I was on the phone were loud bangs almost similar to a dialup via modem. Both my cousin and I contacted Panasonic since we were having similar problems (and were still under ""warranty"")but their handling of our complaints were horrible even though they themselves acknowledged that they had received numerous complaints about this model. They pretty much said that they would not help out unless we were willing to purchase a new phone. YEAH RIGHT! At this point I have sworn off Panasonic for their substandard products and services. Do yourselves a favor and spend your money elsewhere. I understand that their other model KXTG2583 is getting rave reviews but I remain skeptical about Panasonic technology PERIOD.",1.0
"Always thinks its out of range, doesnt hold a charge, and it was very difficult to use until the display on the handset died this week. Now it is completely usesless. [money] down the drain and less than a year later i'm in the market for a phone again. The new models are supposed to be better, but don't waste your time ....",1.0
"I made the mistake of thinking that an expensive phone would automatically have very good sound quality.  I was wrong.  The first day I purchased this phone I noticed that the sound fell short of crystal clear.  On many occasions I found that the volume couldn't be adjusted loud enough for me to hear the person I was talking to.  After owning this phone for a few months the sound quality worsened to the point that, now, I must buy another phone due to severe interference.  My handset says ""out of range"" even when it is right next to its base (I did do my best to make sure that the phone was on the correct channel by pressing the ""EXIT/CH"" button as prescribed in the troubleshooting section of the manual). I also tried moving my phone to different areas of the house and even shut off all other electronic devices (computers, stereos, etc.), but nothing worked.  In my opinion, a phone that sells for (price) should sound just as good as my cell phone (my cell phone sounds far better). My cell phone works just fine in my house with  all of my computers running away.  And, I'd like to point out that a phone priced toward the high end market should be virtually trouble free, but this wasn't the case.  I've had to go through a lot of trouble trying to resolve the issues with this phone. The reason why I spent more money was to avoid the very trouble I've experienced with this phone. Also, the menu system of this phone was poorly designed. Comparing the Panasonic's menu system to my Nokia (cell phone) menu system is like night and day.  The menu system of my Nokia5165 is laid out thoughtfully so that the user really doesn't need a user's manual to use features.  The Panasonic's menu system is quite bad. I would not recommend this phone to anyone. This is a horrible phone.",1.0
"I have only had this phone for 6 months and it is constantly giving me out of range errors even when I am at my desk and the base is only 1 foot away!
Also, the handset is very noisy, so much so that I have to switch to the intercom to understand anything. At first I thought it was my phone line, but I tried my phone line with other phones and it sounded fine.
Bad phone. I am very dissappointed with Panasonic. I am usually a fan of theirs with 3 TVs and a DVD player by them that I love, but I will be hesitant to buy another phone from them.",1.0
"I used Panasonic phones for last 5 years. However this is last Panasonic i ever buy.
Ok, everything was perfect when i just got it. Slick design, cool looks, useful belt clip, etc.  Then i started to notice a number of small drawbacks comparing to *older* Panasonic models i still have. Like i used to dial a number when listening to recorded message. Can't do it now - either you use the phone or listen to messages, can't be done in same time. ??!!. Biggest hit come with summer when it got slightly warmer in the room. Apparently this phone can't disperse heat well enough. If you put it on solid surface the base bottom overheats very quickly and you start to hear annoying repeating buzz in the line. Ok, then we started to keep it upside down, so the back can properly cool down. But if you talk long enough from distance, base gets even hotter. As result in hot day you can get this maddeing buzz out of nowhere in middle of conference call. Horrible.
Disposing of this model at first opportunity and buying any other non-Panasonic phone. Keep away from that one.",1.0
"Just like many reviews here, I am stuck with a phone that I can't use. After just about 11 months, the reception between the handset and base was so bad I couldn't use it. Customer service told me to try removing the battery from the handset for 1/2 hour. That seemed to fix it for a few days, then the 'out of range' and noise started again. The next cust. service operator told me to also unplug the base unit and the handset from all power, this time for several hours. Then I recharged and tried to use the phone again, but found the same problem. At that point it was 12months and 4 days from the time I received the phone (I have proof) and customer service says that I have to pay a minimum of $100 to fix it! They told me on the first call that since my problem was reported within the 1 year warranty period, that they would take care of it if their 'reset' procedures didn't work. I've spoken to managers, and higher ups, to no avail. Avoid like plague! Anyone know what this problem is and how to fix it? Should be recalled! Any lawyers interested?",1.0
"I was one of the first to breathlessly purchase this phone about a year ago.  What a mistake!  So many features that made Panasonics early cordless phones the best are gone and instead are replaced with confusing, ridiculous new ones.  You can't do ANYTHING without the handset and good luck firguring out how to set the time.  It is non-intuitive, you have to rinky-dink the phone in place so it can actually re-charge and it's range it questionable.
With so many 2.4Ghz on the market now, there is no reason to buy this inferior product.  My home just experienced an major power surge (blow-up the transformer).  The Panasonic KXTG2570 was on the same surpe protector as my computer.  The Mac is fine, the Panasonic KXTG2570 is FRIED and DEAD.  I'm happy though -- now I have the opportunity to buy a decent 2.4Ghz phone.
I love Panasonic; I own their VCR and DVD players and they are excellent.  Their early cordless phones were excllent -- they sadly dropped the ball in this one.",1.0
"I owned this phone. After three months the silver coating all over the phone started to peel and the printing on the face of the phone began to wear off. When I contacted Panasonic, they said this was caused by chemicals from my skin, i.e., makeup. I remarked there was not warning about using the phone while using makeup or having the phone come in touch with my skin. Ultimately, I am getting my full refund.
The phone has other problems. Sometimes the screen doesn't work; I would get a message saying it was too far from the base when it was only 6"" away; the phone wouldn't work in front of my house when they claim it will work up to a mile away.
It's difficult to hold and overall just a pain in the neck to use. It is clear and without interference, but that's a small plus considering all the minuses. Don't buy it!",1.0
"Unfortunately, I didn't read these reviews until after I bought this phone.  My experience is the same as most of the reviewers.  The phone is really bad.  It has wonderful features and a great look, but it just doesn't work.  After about 5 minutes on the phone I get this buzz that is so loud I can't hear the person I'm talking to.  The buzz starts low and gradually gets worse.  I've tried moving the base unit, unplugging appliances, messing with the antenna, and switching channels.  All to no avail.  I don't have a problem with the user interface, but that doesn't matter since the phone doesn't work.",1.0
"I purchased this phone a little over a year ago and, like other reviewers, as time went on the range dropped SIGNIFICANTLY. I've replaced the batteries multiple times and no luck. The problem appears to be signaling from the base to handset since everyone can hear me clearly but I can't understand a thing they are saying. Because of this problem, the caller ID only works 1/3 of the time (which makes me wonder why I'm paying $10/mo. for the feature). Also, you can't play messages from the answering machine while the handset is in use - very annoying.
I got this phone to replace a Sony 900MHz DSS model that kept cooking the batteries. 3 years, two phones, and $400 down the drain. Don't get this phone.",1.0
"after a year i can tell u, its not workin and never worked like it have to.",1.0
"I have had many cordless phones (including Panasonic - my last one did well), and this one is by far the worst. I was looking forward to long range and clear reception, but it falls far short of any expectations the cost should imply, and all the other problems render the phone almost useless. We had a lot of difficulty hearing anyone because the mic picked up every noise in the house while talking and fed it back in your ear. We had a problem with out-of range cut-outs when standing right next to the base unit. You can not program any function without the manual right there to read the codes. Even the layout of the buttons was poorly thought out. I think Panasonic came up with a big loser on this one. I wish I would have returned it shortly after I got it.  It has since completely died - just quit working, a very expensive addition to the trash heap.",1.0
"This phone is great in theory.  After a couple of months, everything falls apart.  I've read the other reviews and all complaints are consistent with my experience.  I've owned my phone for less than a year and I'm throwing it in the trash.  The range deteriorates with time and I often receive ""out of range"" warnings, even when standing next to the base.  The sound is distorted and at times I hear nothing but static.
I don't have time to go into detail, but this is the WORST phone I have ever purchased.  You'd be better of with the $10 special from Radio Shack.",1.0
"By far the worst phone I have ever purchased, for a number of reasons.
1.  The talk time/standby time stated by the OEM is just plain not true.  After 2-3 hours talk time, the phone dies, most of the time while I'm within 10 feet of the base unit.
2.  Uneven performance.  I am, many times, standing right next to the unit, pick up the handset to make a call, and the phone beeps and goes static and says I'm out of range (2 feet from the handset)
3.  It gets very hot after talking on it for a while.
4.  The answering machine cuts people off for no reason, despite programming the unit to let message-leaving callers go on for as long as they want.  Messages also disappear - too many people have sworn to leaving messages that were never received.
5.  Last week, my programmed numbers suddenly disappeared without explanation.
6.  Every time I talk on the phone people say they can't hear me, despite talking directly into the mouthpiece.
I must say, I debated a long time about this purchase....  But, I've always had excellent experiences with Panasonic phones, so I went for it.  Big mistake - and too late to take it back.  Keep shopping, or buy one of their lower-end phones with much better performance.",1.0
"I have owned several cordless phones and, in the long run, this was the worst.  Performance was not much different than a 900MHz for the first couple of months, though there was an odd ""muted"" quality to the sound; range however dropped quickly.  I was soon unable to go from one room to another without getting unbearable static.  Not much later, the charging contacts got tempramental and the phone needed serious jiggling to juice up.  Finally, after about four or five months of ownership, the phone died altogether.
If there was just one problem, I might be tempted to blame a faulty unit; with nothing but problems, I have to blame the model.  Over on the cnet site, you will find hundreds of similar complaints about the panasonic gigaphones.
Don't waste your money on this one.",1.0
"This phone seems to be hypersensitive to outside interference.  To its credit, there is not a problem when the unit is in use and the clarity and sound quality are excellent.  However, when the unit sits or is charging, 'Out of Range' conditions have occured requiring a complete power disconnect to fix.  According to Panasonic customer service, something is interrupting the phone- to-base signal.  My unit is currently at the repair center and its less than 90 days old.",1.0
"ok, so i'm a telephone phreak. i buy a new phone every few months like clockwork.
i saw this one at fry's and thought, hey, a 2.4gig phone, that should have incredible range and every feature i want!
i was only partially right.
1. the phone gets a LOT of interference from other sources, especially if you have it too close to a cell phone while talking. it doesn't automatically switch channels to find the clearest one, and sometimes when you manually switch, it doesn't get any better.
2. the battery doesn't last long, and after a few long conversations, it's off to the recharger.
3. there is NO mute button, the way you have to mute it is to hit the intercom button, and basically put the call old hold while the intercom is active between handset and base.
4. the base does have a speakerphone option which is nice to answer the phone if you can't find the handset, though you MUST use the handset to program it, and you have to remember which codes to use or you can't do it. it's not user friendly in that regard.
5. the phone looks slick, it has two antenna for sending and receiving which is supposed to help the range...i've found the phone cuts out even when i walk into my back yard, much less down the street.
6. the phone gets really hot if you talk on it a while and will make your ear VERY warm
7. the belt clip thing? don't bother putting it on the phone unless you really intend to use it.
8. the antenna on the hand set is not flexible and gets in the way if you want to talk in bed and put your head on a pillow
9. after a period of time, the phone became so dysfunctional that i could no longer delete messages from the answering machine, and could not get the phone to be in range even when standing right beside it
for the cost of this phone/answering machine combo, i expected more, and would have returned it and gotten something different if i'd had the time.
after the phone failed to function any more, i purchased the panasonic 900mhz phone and have been happy ever since. while 900mhz may seem like a step down, the quality is still there, and it will not interfere with things such as cell phones or wireless network like the 2.4ghz phones will.",1.0
"I have one of these things I bought about 12 years ago for around twenty bucks and I liked it while it worked.
I would buy another one for around twenty bucks again, but over three hundred? What kind of jackass would pay such a ludicrous price for that thing?",1.0
"I bought three of these and the newest one was manufacured in 2003.  Needless to say, they didn't work because the ink had thickened.  A complete waste of money.  How does someone even have ten year old ink cartridges?  The boxes they were in looked like they had been in storage for many many years.  Will never buy from this seller again.",1.0
"If you liked to be cheated buy this item. It is a white box special ""compatible"" cartridge. It is NOT a genuine HP cartridge.",1.0
"Defective product, can't get the ink to keep flowing for even one print.  This could be new old stock that the seller failed to disclose.  Amazon does not provide a way to contact the original seller for warranty work.  Further inquires with this subject has revealed that the product I recieved has a warranty that expired May 15, 2013.  I purchased a new product that is already 3 years old!!  The company and HP, and Amazon has been extremely useless.  I would not buy from this company.",1.0
"The cartridge did not work.  A waste of time and money.  I guess that I got ""too good"" of a deal.",1.0
It wasn't the correct cartridge.  The sender gave me credit to my account. Thank goodness!,1.0
"CARTRIDGES APPEAR TO BE GENUINE ""HP"" CARTRIDGES, BUT THEY DEFINITELY DO NOT WORK!  THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE TRIED TO MAKE THEM FUNCTION TO NO AVAIL.  I WILL BE RETURNING THESE TO THE SELLER.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1.0
"I have ask for # 40 Ink Cartridges and I got # 41's and those do not work on my plotter, I try to return it but the seller ask me to keep them, I got my money refund it instantly, no problems what so ever, just that I don't think I'll ever try to get ink on line. Sorry.",1.0
Ink is only good if it is not old. Old ink dries up and makes bad prints. It is nice to offer a good price but bad when you pay a good price for an old package of ink. I probably won't buy ink from Amazon again. The box was old and crumpled. Looked like it had been around the block several times.,1.0
"I would not recommend this globe.  I bought this for my 3rd grader and on the first day of using it, the equator peeled off!!  I thought of keeping it anyway but decided to deal with the hassle and plan on returning it.  It also feels too flimsy and can fall over easily.",1.0
Poor qaulity. Expensive globe but the colors faded .,1.0
"Very flimsy and easily breakable.  Base is ALL plastic and very light.  If you have kids under 10 around, it will get broken.  And if you have kids over 10, then you probably need a better / more detailed globe anyway.  I might have been happy if I paid $10 for it.  Even then, I probably would have saved my money and just picked a better quality model.",1.0
