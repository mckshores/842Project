"Husband loves this thing, very heavy duty",5.0
I love all the versatile exercises that can be done with this resistance rope. I have done many of the exercises provided in the booklet and they can be interchanged and you can mix up hour you work. The added attachment to use it with a door is a great addition and I really like the exercises using a doorway. Great Product!!,5.0
Works great.,5.0
Bought this for my Aunt who needed a band with a door mount. It's great durable and comes with instructions that were handy,5.0
Fantastic Item and seller . Thanks for a great product !,5.0
"These have been the only bands I've ever bought. With that in mind, they meet my expectations but wish they'ed last a little longer. My most used band developed nicks after about 18 months. After tempting fate I decided to heed the manufacturers warning and get a new one. They come in any weight range you can imagine. I initially bought a pack of 5 or 6 but since replaced and bought individuals. I don't have the space for weights and I understand they'll never be the same but I love the portability and flexibility to do just about any weight lifting exercise.",5.0
perfect amount of resistance!,5.0
Great product for the price,5.0
Good,5.0
There well made and have not broken on me yet. I have gotten used to them and need more tension. I will buy this product again as my fear of breaking on my face or other  has gone away.,5.0
I bought it for my office to help out between workouts when I get bogged down.,5.0
"Excellent quality, as perfect as I expected.",5.0
I strongly recomand.,5.0
"I like these better than the SPRI, they are a little more durable. I've been using them in a core class, we stand on the bands a lot and they're holding up well.",5.0
"Great Resistance Band, My arms are exploding after 10 reps.  I really get a great workout, and its made of good quality.  Highly Recommend!",5.0
"I purchased the blue resistance band (4-6lbs) because I'm somewhat of a resistance band newbie. I chose this band because of the great reviews about their customer service and the price. It has worked well for me and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Once I get too comfortable working out with this resistance band, my next purchase will be the green resistance band (10-12lbs) for sure!",5.0
"Black Mountain makes quality products and this is one of them. When I'm pulling on resistance bands, I want to know that nothing is going to pop off and hit me in the face. These bands are tough!

Previously, I bought a set of these bands that came with removable hand grips. I discovered that I got tired of moving them around when I wanted a different size. These bands come with the hand grip attached. I like that better. Yes, you can save money with the set, but trust me, you'll get tired of moving them around!",5.0
"Great resistance. sturdy and durable, overall good product. Fully satisfied.",5.0
"Very good quality, it is very strong and the handle is very comfortable to hold. Definitely recommended.",5.0
Great!,5.0
Perfecto,5.0
"Got a set of bands, but they turned out to be overkill. This one does everything! My husband and I use it when we do our home workouts. Well made and user friendlythe handle grips roll so you can make fluid motions, and the door anchor rocks. The black one is the perfect level of resistance for both of us. At the gym I used to use about 30 lbs resistance for bicep curls, around 45 for seated presses and maybe 80 lbs for pull-downs. Husband just stands a little further out for more resistance.",5.0
"High quality, great product!",5.0
very sturdy band. I love the door strap and the booklet they provided. The booklet has a lot of good exercise with pictures and is  very easy to follow. I might buy more bands from them.,5.0
"Very well made, strong. This product seems like it will last a long time, it has given me tons of good workouts. I would not hesitate on buying another band from this company.",5.0
"It was ordered for granddaughter, she loves it.",5.0
"As always, great product and a great purchasing experience, fantastic on both accounts !",5.0
Works greats,5.0
Good for a child to use for workout or stretching. If you are an adult it's resistance is too little for workouts.,5.0
"good quality, just the tension that wanted",5.0
Excellent tool to have.,5.0
I love it!,5.0
"I read another review of an older man saying he got the second to the heaviest and wasn't satisfied with the weight. When they say 45-50lbs I think they mean all together, not on each hand. So if you get that one, be thinking more like 25lbs of resistance for each hand, unless you grab both handles and do exercises which isn't really hard. Or just buy two of them. But exercising like that is a little harder unless you weigh a lot, because unlike say using dumbells on a bench you aren't anchored against the weight, so 90lbs up high can pull you back, so you have to lean forward against it. Military presses can be done just sitting on the middle of it, hooking both thumbs under it and pushing up. No, they aren't long enough to do them standing up but you can do them like that and they are pretty effective. I wouldn't bother with anything less than the purple one unless you are a woman who just wants to lose weight. For men, a single purple band is good for toning, and if you want more resistance to try to build more strength get two of them. Unless you are really tall you shouldn't have a problem doing curls, shoulder shrugs, rows and things like that standing on them.",5.0
GREAT PRODUCT,5.0
Excellent product for pull downs and rows,5.0
"A great replacement for lighter weights. I originally bought this to use instead of rowing machine, but it ended up replacing a lot of my free weights.

I've planning on buying a few more.",5.0
Great,5.0
As expected.,5.0
"Tough band, but it you want to get the best out of a workout, you gotta put in the work. It does accommodate for easier tension, but its also brutal for the heavy workouts.",5.0
Works,5.0
"Great, strong tube!  Very well made.",5.0
"Cool, very useful product! It is the quality you would expect.",5.0
excelente,5.0
"The handle bars are very comfortable and thick. The band itself is heavy duty , and the guide that comes along with the product to teach you different exercise was helpful.",5.0
"One of the main reasons why I ordered this product was because it was elligible for Amazon Prime and it had good reviews. When the product was delivered it came in a small rectangle box and inside the box was the resistance band and the door anchor with a note from the company as well as a mini instruction book. I usually buy products from sellers who have a good customer service reputation and I read from several reviews that this company had good service so that was another reason why I bought this product. Anyways, I bought this product so I could use it for shoulder workouts, they provided a small book with workouts that you could do. I've been using the resistance band for a day and you could easily tell that these bands are made with good material and are not cheap :). I am a 5'6 female and I weigh 120 lb. so I don't really have any problems with it going too far or being too long for me to use but I thought the door anchor could have been made with a better material. That didn't really matter to me because it is still effective, though I am planning on buying a separate door anchor just to be safe! Overall this product is good and I am planning on updating this review after a month of use.",5.0
best darn band ever....  i believe this will last me for quite a while,5.0
I travel a ton and am not always near a gym.  this is so much better than toting around weights.,5.0
I use this for exercising at my desk at the office. I love it.,5.0
Love using this and is very effective,5.0
"Delivered on time and in excellent condition. The band works quite well, and I'm getting a very satisfying workout. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.",5.0
This is the second red version I purchased; fantastically well made. Have now ordered the orange one as well. Great product: takes a beating!,5.0
EXELENT,5.0
Great product! I use it at work all the time!,5.0
"the best resistance bands highest quality, love them",5.0
"I love this product. You can fit a great variety of workout with it, especially with the door anchor. The only downside is that I can't do a standing shoulder press as it feels too short and afraid the band will snap. I'd have to do a sitting or kneeling. Otherwise, such a great piece of workout equipment!",5.0
I own several of these and keep them in my weight room and also at my second home and travel pack. They work well and are a great value. They allowed me to rehab two shoulders.,5.0
Great for latex allergy users. So far no issues.,5.0
"I just don't have the space to store dumbbells/weights, so resistance bands were a good alternative for me.  I found this item easy to store and very easy to bring to the office or on vacation.  The handles are cushioned, so workouts are easy on the hands.  The actual resistance band is well made and still looks like new (even after becoming part of my routine for several weeks).  I am amazed at what you can do with just a single resistance band, the product comes with an instruction booklet showing some exercises, but there are many more exercises posted on the internet, and you could also get creative and make your own workout.
I do have one gripe, the resistance band should have been clipped on to the handle, instead of permanently attached, this would have allowed for easy attachment of greater resistance (more bands) for when a person is ready for more.

I purchased this resistance band to help tone up my arms and can happily say, I am seeing results.

-In Short-
Pros:
Easy to store and carry around
Cushioned handles
Durable/well made resistance band
Provides an excellent, varied workout

Cons:
Cannot clip on more bands to the handle to increase resistance

Perfect!,5.0
good purchase...I bought a blue one...Its not too tough & not too easy...its as expected.....Its been 2 yrs and its good still..,5.0
"This is a good, sturdy band.  The door anchor holds very well.  I plan on getting more of this brand.",5.0
"Great workout resistance band, definitely worth the price!!",5.0
Item arrived on time and is exactly what I expected.,5.0
Great quality and a strong band!  I will probably buy more,5.0
Great quality band! I bought this to have at home and to take on vacation and is the same quality as what my trainer uses,5.0
combined it with a Ball Chair and Ive got a work out station at my desk.,5.0
This resistance band is a great  quality product. My elderly dad has been using it for physical therapy and he's enjoyed it a lot. Its enough for him to start regaining his muscle before going onto much stronger bands. I would recommend this item to anyone needing a band to build up their muscle.,5.0
"I worked out once back in '08. I picked up some 40 lb weights and was like - ""too easy"". So then I grabbed some resistance bands and almost broke them. Now I've been recommended Black Mountain products because they are very durable. I've had a set of the 25 lb red resistance bands for 3 months now and they look as good as when I first got them after an hour of use every day except Sunday.",5.0
"I love these bands, they are versatile In the many different ways you can use them, great for upper arm strength as well as for your legs, made of good quality, I use them all the time and it shows.",5.0
My trainer recommended that I get a resistance band for my house and I got this one. I am really happy with it because it looked great and works extremely well for what I need it to do.,5.0
These bands are great for working out in the house/apartment. They have a convenient door attachment to create the appropriate angles of resistance. Would def recommend them.,5.0
Bought for my shoulder rehab.  Very happy with the product.  I probably should have bought one with less resistance but this has worked well.,5.0
"Works just as advertised. Great, soft, but rugged spongy handles. Great tension. Seems well built. The locking device for the door works perfectly.",5.0
I have been using this as an assistance band when doing pull ups and they are very strong and durable.,5.0
"I ordered a number of these bands in varying resistance levels for folks in my class.  I teach group fitness, and we use the bands regularly.  They have held up well, and the varying resistance levels make it easy to meet everyone's skill level.  Highly recommend these bands!",5.0
These work as expected. You don't need to keep looking they work just right and are very helpful with their chart allowing for you to choose higher and lower resistance before buying.,5.0
"Along with a 65"" Black Mountain Anti Burst Exercise Stability Ball, I have a Black Mountain resistance band (black = heavy = 15-20 lbs). Both are very well made and very useful. The foam-covered handles on the resistance band are very comfortable, and the foot/door anchor works quite well. The resistance of the black model is perfect for me. I highly recommend both the exercise ball and the resistance bands!",5.0
"I have recently started the P90x system, and required these resistance bands for the program. I have shopped around and priced these things all over, and these are the  least expensive by far... especially considering the quality and the included door anchor, leg strap, and the fact that these bands are stackable meaning it will be a long time before you max out on these things. The materials are of high quality. The metal rings are of good construction and the metal clips are thick sturdy metal. the handles are made of high grade nylon webbing and are very strong, the handles have foam grips that are very comfortable to use. The included bag makes taking your stretchy gym everywhere you go very convenient.",5.0
"Love the bands, it is the weight I wanted, the door clamp works perfectly and it comes with a guide to various kinds of workouts with the bands. Awesome!",5.0
you know why/it help work out the distress i had when i see that doll and that big box it came in.,5.0
this resistance band feels like you are lifting the actual weights but with more comfort and easier to use and carry around,5.0
"These particular bands do exactly what they said...The resistance is definitely a challenge, but all at the same time, you get results...I purchased the highest weights because I wanted more out of my workouts...These bands definitely deliver.",5.0
"I have the whole set and I had given one resistance band to a friend while traveling and wanted to buy a replacement. I recieved this one with an offer for a free orange band so I gave them a call and they asked me to write an honest review of their product, which I had no problem with because their product speaks for itself and has met my expectations for as long as I've used it.

Here comes the best part, after asking for my shipping address the representative that I was on the phone with reminded me that if I were to see any wear and tear or signs of breakage in the product to call them to have replacements sent out for FREE. He continues by saying they do that to keep their customers safe from breaking bands from extensive wear and tear. That is what I call customer service!",5.0
"I just this in the mail to use for my insanity asylum and i must say im loving the resistance on it, i been using everlast and man was that easy but this is problem the best choice for getting lean muscle, if you wanna look good and not spend a lot on weights this is for you! I will bee a bmp customer for a long time if they keep making these :)",5.0
"My girlfriend is disabled and cant do high impact workouts. This band is great because she can go at her own pace, in any position and any retention she needs. A lifesaver for low impact needs.",5.0
"Have had no issue with my resistance band. Works great, no problems, no surprises. I'd recommend this for someone looking for a quick, portable way to work out.",5.0
Great for my at-home exercise routine. They are the same as the ones at the Y gym. They will last.,5.0
"Seems to be a sturdy, reliable product so far. I've been using it about every day and I like it!",5.0
"Love it, only thing that bothers me is that it feels kind of short.  I'm 5`11 and it can be a little tough doing certain things with it. I probably should have got the black band though so it's my fault. Overall  it's a great product.",5.0
I bought the green bands and they feel like they are about medium resistance. These are my introductory bands to get started working  out again. They are very durable. Exactly what I wanted.,5.0
"I bought the purple one to add to my Strong Man Set of 6 to make it a Super Strong Man Set of 7. This is one tough band. Great for high intensity bicep curls and door anchor exercises, such as back rows and standing chest press. But too difficult for tricep kick backs. It came with a door anchor and an instruction pamphlet. There's no BMP logo on either handle just like their orange band. Overall I'm glad Black Mountain is going the direction of making their systems better and stronger. Keep up the good work.",5.0
"Came as described, quickly. I love the door anchor and that I can bring this anywhere, even to the park and wrap it around a thin tree!",5.0
"The supplier, BMP, is awesome to deal with and I'm happy with the product!  I had an issue with my bands upon delivery and had no problems getting them replaced!",5.0
I have been surprised at how many ways I can use this thing.  It is particularly good for shoulder exercises,5.0
Well I have had this band for about a month and its as good as when I got it so yeah I will be ordering another if this one snaps.,5.0
"Comparatively speaking, it's a good product for a great price.  I purchased them because I am going to be in Europe for a few months and was in need of a product that I can easily transport between countries.  These bands fit the bill.  However, I am not entirely convinced that the resistance corresponds directly with the suggested weight.  Nevertheless, they do offer a great workout when dumbbells are not an option.

As of yet, I have had no problem with the product's durability.",5.0
"This was my first purchase and use of resistance bands.  I have limited mobility due to my health, weight and age and my doctor recommended I try these for low impact exercising to start with.  I have been able to find a number of workout routines online even some I can do sitting in a sturdy chair.  With diet and the use of these bands for at least 30 minutes a day I have already lost 10 pounds.  I am sure my doctor will be as happy as I am.",5.0
"I previously had purchased a much cheaper band and it was not good quality. This was still incredibly affordable but it is good quality. The handles are comfortable, the band has exactly the resistance I would expect and having used it several times now I am tempted to go back and buy the multi set they sell. I haven't used the door hook at all, but it seems good quality as well. I definitely recommend this band, if anything I would recommend just getting the multi pack right away.",5.0
"Very good resistance band.  I would definitely buy others of the same brand. Would have been nice to have a sheet with recommended exercises, but it is pretty easy to figure out.",5.0
Great for my older students to use in fitness stations.  Kids love them.  I will definitely get more and recommend them to other teachers.,5.0
ripped it in 2 days is fun plus you working out at the same dam time feel me is cool,5.0
I work out with a group of ladies and our other bands were worn and breaking.  These are definitely NEW!!  They are making our work out tougher for sure!!,5.0
"Literally a home gym, except portable. I got the black band, and it works perfectly. These are great because you can take them in your suitcase if you travel a lot, and in my case I do. Thanks for delivering it in good condition, and for the price!",5.0
"This band works well, and has lasted a long time despite heavy use 3x a week. The company was a joy to work with during communication over questions I had. Have already ordered another band in a lighter pull weight for my wife.",5.0
"Haven't had the chance to fully use this yet, but after inspection and testing, it seems in good shape and appears it will hold up. I'm already waist deep in my workout program, so it wil be used shortly.",5.0
"I have had 3 sets of resistance bands made by others, and the ones I have from BMP are simply the best by far. They are stronger, more durable and, most importantly, so much smoother is use. When I first got them (this one is just the strongest one that did not come with the 5 band set I bought last year), I noticed that they were shorter than any others I had used and was quite concerned. But, once I used them, I found the range of motion was the same and the smoothness of the motion was so superior that I can feel I am getting a much better workout.",5.0
Got this in the mail pretty fast. I'm not sure why amazon had to use a 2 ft long box to ship this but they did! It's a bit long for me but I have short arms >.< I do wish they had an actual person for the exercises that come with it and not a cartoon haha,5.0
"For the price it works great. Bands are not heavy by any means and I'm decently big and they provide that ""just right"" resistance. It really depends on how you use them. But all in all great band came with the attachment which does the job so long as you shut that door. Buy these if your looking for price nd quality.",5.0
"Bands work perfect for what I need them for.... If I experienced any hand rubbing, I usually turned the bands around and it went away.",5.0
These bands are great. So many possible exercises and completely portable. I love them.,5.0
great,5.0
"I have used these bands with clients for over a year now as a personal trainer and I keep coming back for replacements! They are the best for the price. No competition. I've tried many brands, but these are still the best. You may ask why I needed replacements in year, but that is because my bands are used by 5+ clients a day 6 days a week!",5.0
These bands are perfect.  You can do so many exercises with them. Great quality!,5.0
We just received this and it's a very impressive array of equipment at an excellent price. It looks terrific and we are looking forward to using it.,5.0
"This is my 2nd set of black mountain resistance bands, they are very durable, the only reason for the 2nd set is to make my workouts quicker. My daughter and I both use them and love them. Thank you for the quality product.",5.0
"Been wanting to get a set of these for long time, looked at several products, decided on Black Mountain after reading their reviews.
Made the right choice. Quality is outstanding, included bands give wide range to cover all possible workout desires, door anchor works great on even a lightweight closet door.
Highly recommend this product.",5.0
These provide a great option to free weights and are very convenient to use.  The bands are sturdy and durable and very easy to switch out or stack.  Highly recommend.,5.0
Exactly what i was working for for at home workouts!!!,5.0
Great service from Amazon and from Black Mountain Products. Bands are of high quality and the customer service at BMP is outstanding. I bought one set for myself and two as gifts - all are happy with the bands. I will definitely purchase from Amazon and from Black Mountain Products again - their products are excellent while at a very reasonable price.,5.0
A complete game changer for me as I am always traveling for work. The ease of transporting my BMP bands and being able to get a workout in wherever I am is fantastic! Great quality and product construction. Looking forward to future purchases with this brand!,5.0
Great product.  Easy to setup and use.,5.0
"Great alternative to the bulky dumbbells, and good quality",5.0
"Really simple, but well-made set. Very happy with the accessories that come standard with the product. Great value, and durable too.",5.0
"These bands are the best. I used to work out in a group of people all with their own brands of bands. We found that the B.M.P. bands were definitely the preferred brand. The clips are very durable. The band thickness feels the most secure. The handles are padded and comfortable. All around a great product.

PS. I recently purchased a second set and it came with a promotion to call in for a new heavy duty orange band! I called and an actual human answered the phone!? It sure is nice to not have to deal with the automatic call service nightmare. Thanks, B.M.P.",5.0
I love these! Great for travelling! It has so many options of weights. You can get creative with your work out in any hotel room. Would highly recommend it.,5.0
The bands and handles are very high quality. I typically hook them around my squat rack but there is also a piece that allows you to perform exercises using a closed door. I use the bands for shoulder strengthening exercises prescribed by my physical therapist. I highly recommend this product!,5.0
"These are great, very easy to use, and definitely effective for starting to workout at home without taking up a ton of space",5.0
"Very good value. I'm doing rehab work on my knee and bought a band from my PT for $6 (one band) that was supposed to be a strong, high quality band. I'm big and a pretty strong guy and I broke that band after only 4 days. This set has 5 bands (I tend to use the red and black bands) and is at least as good (likely better) quality than the band I bought at my PT's office. I would definitely recommend this set, especially for the price. Set also comes with instruction booklet with exercises illustrated, an ankle strap, two hand-grips, and a band designed to insert into the hinge side of a door to act as an anchor. I didn't use ankle strap but did use everything else and worked very well. One caveat - the door strap has pretty thick strap (heavy duty) around which you clip carabiner clip but carabiner clips at end of bands are rather small, so not easy to get clip around strap. For my PT, I'm clipping 2 carabiner clips to strap, so I used a larger heavy duty carabiner to the strap and then clip the band carabiners to my larger carabiner and this works great (you can buy the larger carabiner on Amazon or any sporting goods store).  As full disclaimer, box comes with card from company offering free orange (even stronger) band incl. free shipping if customer writes a review anywhere online (fact that you write a review is on honor system, they don't check your review or how you rated product). Once you write review, you call them back and let them know that you wrote a review and they send you free orange band.  I'm going to give them a call once I post this review, but again incentive is completely on honor system so I'm not expecting to have to tell them what I said about their product (if they do get nosy about what I said here, I will revisit my review accordingly and let y'all know.",5.0
"Have been using other resistance bands for years...needed a more vesital set and bought this one...like the varied resistance bands in the set gives a good workout and can add more as I go along...easy hook up and a varied picture manual for exercises...can go to company website for more exercises, for the price a nice set.",5.0
"I recently ordered these resistance bands/tubes, and am very pleased with the product. They are durable and versatile, and their customer service department was easy to work with and courteous. I would definitely consider their products for future purchases.",5.0
"I just worked out for the first time with my new resistance bands and LOVE them!  I have had chronic wrist problems for years and have been limited to lifting free weights because of the pain.  After today's workout, I can't believe how much impact was taken out of lifting, thanks to the bands.  I was hesitant to order, but now glad I did.  I see many more pain-free workouts ahead!!",5.0
These come in handy for trips to places that don't have gyms. It works really great to combine them for more resistance.,5.0
I had the previous version of these Black Mountain bands and they were good enough to cause me to re-order them after a year's use.  When I received the current version of these Black Mountain bands I was very pleasantly surprised.  Everything about this new version is more heavy-duty than the previous version and the price is still a bargain!,5.0
I use these bands as a finisher for each muscle group in my weight lifting routine and they are excellent for the final fatigue! Ive had them for about two months now and they still feel like new. Theyre an excellent value for the money and are very well made.,5.0
Great home work out system and even to take on the Go,5.0
Awesome drive a semi truck made a hook for my step so I can work out when I'm idle loading unloading off duty  highly recommend,5.0
Excellent product.  Good quality.,5.0
"I bough these to use with good ol' P90X (Yup, still rocking it) and to do physical therapy exercises.  They arrived promptly.  I had never used bands before, and have been pleasantly surprised with how, after a little learning curve, you can get a nice workout with a different flavor than free weights.  These BMP bands seem be to of high quality.  I'll bet I can strangle Tony without breaking a band :)",5.0
These bands are an excellent product.  They should appeal to all levels of fitness.  I am full time care giver for my Mom and Dad in their late 80's.  I found I was not able to get to the gym very often and needed some equipment to work out at home.  I have been using these bands for several weeks.  I can tell my core is getting stronger.  Also comes with a nice little instruction booklet. Would recommend.,5.0
"Nicely complete set.  I use it for travel where I don't know what to expect at a hotel fitness center.  It seems like a pain to have so many options and one set of handles, but it isn't too bad.  It also makes it easy to combine them if needed.",5.0
The band set works as youd expect. Comes with an instruction book that includes some basic exercises and a list of the estimated band resistances. The set comes with a storage bag and appears to be well built. It functions better than I would expect from a set at this price. Extremely happy with this purchase.,5.0
So far this set has been great and the bands have worked well. We hope they will not snap anytime soon.,5.0
"Great product, easy to use.",5.0
Great company to buy from! We love the resistance workout bands we bought! so easy to use and versatile.,5.0
"Well made, long lasting.  Work as advertised.",5.0
"Bought these bands which are of a great quality.  Once received, there was an offer inside to call the number to get a stronger band for free.  Just called the telephone number is received it within 4 days.  Can't beat that.",5.0
I purchased these bands about 4 months ago to help with some shoulder strengthening and rehab. They have helped tremendously and my shoulder is better than ever. I love the accessory that you can put in a door to aid in pulling motions.,5.0
"I purchased the Black Mountain Products Resistance Bands last Christmas as a gift for my husband.  At the beginning of my Amazon search for resistance bands I was overwhelmed by all the choices so it really helped me that Amazon noted that the Black Mountain set was an Amazons Choice item!  My husband is very pleased with the results he has seen from working out with these resistance bands.  They are also easy to pack and enable him to keep up his fitness routine when he travels.  In addition, I recently underwent stem cell injections into my arthritic hip and my physical therapist is incorporating these bands into my rehab routine.  This is a great product backed by very accessible customer service!",5.0
Just received these and they are made really well. I love the way they can be changed out so quickly. Called the company for my free band and the customer service was awesome. Ordered a set for my sister also ! We plan on doing some before and after photos. Great product!,5.0

"These resistance bands are well made and essential to a balanced work routine. I purchased for use during P90X2 workouts, but once I started using them I realized that would be a great alternative for my wife and daughter to use during their workouts because they provide strength training without the need of heavy weights.  I will recommend them to anyone who has a similar goal in mind.",5.0
These work great. Surprisingly intense resistance. Takes a while to get used to the different exercises but is worth the effort.,5.0
Works well for those of us needing to do Physical therapy at home...,5.0
"Durable and well designed. Been using it for bout a week now and absolutely love it. One of my main concerns with these products are the handles where they keep rubbing against my hands and irritating the sides, but these have plenty of room to where that does not happen. Would definitely recommend",5.0
Great product at an excellent price. Your entire gym in a small bag without the outrageous membership fees!,5.0
"I received my bands yesterday and they are great!  The bands are well built, the hooks are high quality, and the nylon attachments are very strong.  I love the door attachment.  If used properly, there is no worry of it slipping out.  I wish the handles were a little bigger, or that maybe a rope handle was included, but these are easy to get.  The carrying case makes the bands easy to pack and take on trips.  This setup is a great addition for anyone looking for great equipment to use at home where space is limited, for someone who travels, or for anyone looking to add an edge to their workout.",5.0
The bands are well made and easy to use. I would recommend them if you are interested in using bands during your workout.,5.0
The  resistance bands are excellent to do workout at home.,5.0
I've had these resistance bands for a couple days now and they are great! I love that it comes with a door jam for getting different types of workouts. I bought them specifically for use in p90x and so far I haven't had any issues what so ever.,5.0
I am loving these bands.  They are super light to carry and don't tear up your hands like dumbbells do.,5.0

Works as Advertised!,5.0
"Bought these for my in home gym and I'm very pleased with the product. Good quality, easy to clip on and off any handle. The weight range is perfect for beginners all the way to someone who's advanced. I recommend this product for anyone who's looking for resistance cables.",5.0
This is a fantastic product. For once pretty much what it says on the tin. Tried and tested for two months and much more resistant than other bands I have bought in the past from other vendors. BMP really live up to their name.  In short: highly recommended!,5.0
"I'm always traveling around, so this is perfect to carry with me. You can use for many exercises, including legs! I lost 7kg using this product at home!",5.0
"Great set of bands. I have three sets. One for home, and two for my chiropractic office. Love the leg attachment and the door attachment, easy to do many exercises.",5.0
"I bought these bands as a convenient way to work out when I am traveling, and to supplement my other weight training.  The have proven to be very useful and well made.  I have been using them daily for the last 2 months and they work quite well.  They seem to work muscles differently than free weights which, as is well known, changing how a muscle works and how you work out promotes growth.  I like them enough I bought an extra set that just stays in my suitcase.",5.0
"I bought these resistance bands for my husband a month ago.
He had old resistance bands with handles on each band.
He loves the fact that you can use certain bands simultaneously
with each other to increase or decrease resistance. All bands are
right there with you so you just adjust the resistance for your next
exercise. It allows you to go from one exercise into another quickly.
It does save time. He just has begun using the door hanger and the
 ankle strap. He needs to give that a little more time but at this point
he prefers using the resistance bands only for his workouts.
I began using them too but prefer using the door hanger for a majority of
my workout.",5.0
"My doctor first recommeded that I try resistance for a low impact exercise as an alternative to weights. Then my son suggested the same thing and that his orthopedic surgion recommended resistance bands as an alternative to surgery. What a game changer! My shoulders have stoped popping and grinding much less than they have in many years. Old sports injuries and just from sleeping on my side create acking pain, but just afer a few short weeks of regular use of the bands many of the symptomes have all but gone. More tone and strength have resulted. An endless number of exersices you can do anywhere. What a great product,I recommend it to anyone. Thank you Black Mountain Products",5.0

"Love the set, I really should be using it more though!",5.0
"I love resistance tubes.  I take them along with me when I travel and Black Mountain makes it easy because they provide a storage bag.  The tubes are very sturdy and there are enough of then in the set so that I can move to the next level easily.  There are also ankle straps provided in this kit.  Resistance tubes seem to give me the same basic toning benefits as the cables in a gym but in the cable station, there are also weights attached whereas here there are no weights, just body weight.  But, I can do many of the same exercises.  The resistance tubes are also a great way to change up the routine.  I would recommend the Black Mountain set because it comes with everything you will need.",5.0

"These resistance bands have an extremely durable construction quality to them. I have been using these for about the last month or so, and I could not be happier. The kit comes complete with everything you need. I have been using these to rehabilitate my shoulders (as recommended by my D.C), and now I wonder how I never considered these before as a viable tool to improve and strengthen my upper body. It's great even for daily/weekly maintenance of strength too!

These bands are great! They are exactly what I wanted and need to use them for. I love how you can double or triple the bands to make the resistance tighter. I don't have any problems with stretching or breaking.,5.0
"Nice quality, quick service.",5.0
"These bands are not only beneficial for everyday physical fitness, but they're also very helpful when trying to rehab from an injury. I'm currently rehabbing knee surgery and I can get my rehab done while sneaking in some upper body workouts. The flexibility to switch between the strap or handle to any color
 band when you need to increase or decrease resistance is really nice.",5.0
good workout,5.0
"I was going to be at sea for three weeks without access to a gym, so I bought these resistance bands without ever having used bands for exercise.  They worked great - I was able to replicate all of my standard weight lifting exercises, and produce the same amount of resistance using different combinations of the bands.  These are well made, easy to use, and pack up into a small, lightweight package.  The user guide walks you through how to use them for many common exercises.  I will definitely be taking these with me on the road in the future, and will recommend them to my friends.",5.0
Best band that i could find on the net at a good price.  Well constructed and love the heavy bands and you can add them all at the same time for even more resistance.,5.0
"Easy to use, best for the money",5.0
The quality of this product is outstanding.,5.0
"I have a home gym with adjustable dumbbells, but needed some other equipment to do pulling exercises, so I bought this band set.  They are solidly constructed and fit my needs perfectly.  I also purchased the purple 50 lb. band so I  can use heavier weights.  The best thing is that you can stack the bands to make whatever resistance you need.  I would definitely buy these again.",5.0
"I've used other bands, but this was the most flexible. I actually bought 2 sets so I don't have to use my feet as the anchor (I prefer wall-based anchors). These are also the best constructed that I've used. The ability to stack the bands is a huge plus, but the quality of the product is better than what I've used in the past. My wife uses them, as well, and is equally impressed.",5.0
Just received bands. The quality was better then I thought. All the bands came in a very durable black bag. Also the hand grips and band connections are very high quality. Would highly recommend this product.,5.0

I received this as a gift for Christmas and am thrilled! The door set-up is extremely easy and it holds in the frame well. The instructions for use are simple and easy to follow also.

"This is actually the 2nd time I purchased this set having lost the first set at a hotel. Evidently, it's hard to resist these bands (see what I did there?). Very well made and capable of withstanding your herculean efforts.",5.0
Great product and supplier. Exactly as listed and what I need.  Very well constructed and will last a long time. Comes with pouch to keep all items together when not in use or packing to travel.,5.0
"High quality bands and attachments.  I also found that the handle attaching closely to the elastic band is a big advantage when trying to workout at a specific angle.  For instance attaching the fixed point of the band to near the top or bottom of the anchor wall so as to pull up or down .  The bands I bought at Walmart have an additional 14"" of length between the band and the handle, which means I don't get as steep of an angle when fixing the anchor at the top or bottom of the wall.  With these the handle is about 4"" from the elastic.",5.0
"Bought this product for my family to use, and we absolutely love the bands. Very easy to use, and many exercises to do with them. My wife and I use them for additional Bootcamp exercises we can do at home, and my daughter uses them to help her for softball. She is a pitcher and they do great for warm-up exercises for her arms and core. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to get in shape.",5.0
"These bands are great. Weights are accurate, and materials seem to very durable and I could see these bands lasting several months. They are also highly portable and fit nicely into the provided bag.",5.0
I really like using this for my workouts. It is compact and easy to set up.,5.0
"Im a frequent traveler so I was looking for something to supplement the small or even non existent gyms at various hotels. This product fits the bill! Provides countless exercises I can do easily anywhere. Plus with it being tension its easier on my joints! Highly recommend this for anyone who has limited gym access or just wants an easy, affordable new work out routine!",5.0
Became my preferred way to exercise,5.0
"Had been considering for quite a while getting some home exercise equipment, dumbells or other machines. Thought I would try this out since it was priced so reasonably.  The quality is fantastic, and the booklet with some basic exercises was quite easy to read.  I am mid-50s, and I just need to do some light strength training, and this is perfect, takes up little space and the quality of the product is amazing for less than $30.  You cant lose by purchasing this. My wife had purchased another competing product awhile back, but she remarked that what I purchased was of higher quality and looked easier to use (i.e the clips and handles).",5.0
This is a great set if you're just starting to workout and get in shape. The hardware and the bands are made well. If the bands seem too light just either move back from where you're standing or step on the band to create a shorter length. The handles are easily switchable to the other bands when needed. Great product for the price.,5.0
Received quickly. Good quality and looking forward to using the equipment!,5.0
Great bands. I use them at the gym and then ordered some for home.,5.0
I bought these bands to use at home and when traveling. I used to have a large dumbbell set and was going to purchase another set but saw these and thought I would give them a try. I have had used these bands for a couple of weeks and can duplicate my workout at the gym plus do a lot more. I was having minor shoulder pain but that has just about gone away.  These bands are working great for me!,5.0
The quality of these bands is great and the consistent weigh resistance is exactly what I was looking for. I bought less expensive bands and regretted it immediately. These are perfect for a home gym set up or for someone like me who travels and lot and wants to carry his workout with him. They'd be worth double the money. Thanks Black Mountain Products.,5.0
Simple and compact. They make a great addition to my home gym. Easy to setup and the shipping was quick!,5.0
"These are built really well and seem durable. My husband has been using a set of the BMP resistance bands for over a year now, and we just bought a second set so he has two of each band (there were a few exercises he wanted to do that required two bands of the same resistance). We have a few products from BMP and are very pleased with both the quality and price.",5.0
Great bands and are better constructed than previous bands Ive used. Overall very happy with the purchase.,5.0
These things work great and exactly as advertised. They can combine for weight of up to about 70 pounds or so which is good for pretty much any of the exercises I normally do.  I like the versatility of being able to hang them up high or down low and do a lot of the same exercises that I would get at the gym in the comfort of my own home.,5.0
"I got these for shoulder physical therapy and they have been amazing. I got this little goodie bag of bands that tucks away nicely when not being used, a necessity in my small apartment. Nicely designed and reasonably priced this set of bands does all I need and more... and so easy to use I have transitioned into using the set for a variety of exercises beyond my rehab sets.",5.0
"Excellent quality. I particularly like the stackable feature because it allows me to make small jumps as I increase the weight.
I'm 70 years old and need the flexibility to adjust the resistance by small steps.  The set comes with everything you need to get
started.  Again, highly recommended.",5.0
the problem is getting to use it.. too lazy,5.0
I travel a lot and these bands are a high quality and lightweight solution to bring with me to stay in shape. I only wish that they were marked by weight class. The price is great and they have lasted me a year so far with no issues. Highly recommend.,5.0
The Black Mountain resistance bands deliver what they promised.  The various bands allow for a variety of exercises and weights.  The enclosed booklet has good descriptions of recommended exercises and pictures that help explain.,5.0

much better quality than other bands and clip approach is much more convenient.  handles are comfortable and flexible.  very pleased!,5.0
I purchased these resistance bands for my husband and I to use.  They are great and work really well.  You can work most muscle groups and BMP website has several suggestions for exercises that you can do using the bands.  Highly recommend.,5.0
"I have a home gym consisting of barbells, dumbbells, and other equipment. I've been wanting a nice resistance band set to use in my home gym in order to switch things up. I like that there is a nice array of light-medium-heavy bands. I can use the lighter ones to warm up and get loose, and use the heavier ones to workout, and you can even stack multiple bands together to increase the overall resistance. This morning was my first time using this set, and I was thoroughly impressed. Right out of the box, it is apparent that these bands are made of quality materials. I have had other bands before that broke the first time using them, but not this set. This set is very sturdy and I was able to do a full workout with these bands without any problems or any fear of the bands snapping during use, which I consider important because if I have to worry about whether or not the band will snap, it negatively affects my workout.

All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product.",5.0

You can really get a good workout at home or especially when travelling and there is no gym convenient.  Lots of exercises can be found on the internet.  High quality.  Very pleased with the purchase.,5.0
"I'm 58 years old, haven't worked out for while, my wife and decided time to back in shape.  These bands have been great for both of us.  We YouTube a work out in comfort of our own house.  We also didn't want weights felt more comfortable with bands.  Give these 5 star rating everything we expected",5.0
Worked about what you would expect. No complaints. I used them while doing P90X until my dumbbell collection was built up.,5.0
"I've used these bands a few days now and I'm in love. Super high quality, versatile, and durable. I especially love the band handles, so comfortable in the hands. This purchase far exceeded my expectations. Black Mountain Products are the real deal and will be a returning customer for additional products.",5.0
"These bands have been perfect for my Cross fit style workouts.  The bag makes it easy to transport and use in a gymnasium, track or field.  I also really like having the weight (colored band) options.  I think it's rare to have so many weight options for the cost of the set...super affordable!  The clips that attach to the handles make it extremely easy to change out too.  I very happy with the fast shipping.  I did call  Black Mountain to ask about  their sleeves to cover the bands, which were not in stock and on order.  The company was easy to reach and I talked to a real person...who provided solid information!  Great product, solid company!",5.0

I got one set for Christmas and ordered another. I am using them as a more economical Crossover Symmetry option as well as cable crossover.

Loving this new addition to the home gym!,5.0

I ordered an extra set of handles and I took the top two higher tensions and my wife uses the others. Extremely pleased.",5.0

very useful,5.0
As someone he just got back into fitness these resistance bands make working out a much more fluid experience.  Rather than dealing with having to swap weights out on a dumbbell which is time consuming these bands allow you to add or remove weight in a few seconds so you don't lose momentum in your workout.  I would recommend these bands to anyone from a beginner just getting into fitness or someone who has been working out for years.,5.0
Used it for a couple of weeks. Works great! Love that you can manage the resistance by combining bands together.,5.0

The instruction manual provides an excellent 20 posture routine .  I would order again.  Very satisfied  Pat",5.0
Extremely well made product!,5.0
I bought these a while ago and finally making a review for them. They work great and give the right amount of resistance with each color band. Better than any dead weight dumbell. I don't use them all the time because ive not had the time for a dedicated workout routine due to a lot of work travel. When I do use them I got the muscle burn in all the right areas and the areas you would never get from lifting & shifting dead weights. I have recommended these many times to other people I meet that travel a lot and don't have much time to go work out simply due to the fact you can bring these with you anywhere and youll have a mini gym with you at all times essentially. They also work great with the many excersize videos like P90 & PIYO. Just be safe and don't try to push your limits with them because they can make all your muscles tense and sore the next few day easily.,5.0
"I was surprised by the level of workout I could achieve with these. I typically go to the gym, but these are great for when you are traveling/on vacation.",5.0
Well Made Product.,5.0
"I ordered the BMP Resistance Band Kit for a three week trip to Japan that I will be taking in January, as I won't have access to a gym. Looking over everything included, these are exactly what I need, and will get the job done in my AirBnB.

All of the items included were in perfect condition upon opening. Just from using the various bands several times I can tell they're made well and the included metal clips are very durable. I find them comparable to the dumbbells and weight machines I use at my gym and I feel like Im working just as hard. Its great that several bands can also be used at once for extra resistance.

The carrying bag is great and comes with a zip closure - will fit nicely in my suitcase. My only thought is that it would be nice if a protective sleeve for the bands (to stand on) would be included to prevent damage to the bands themselves, but I saw the BMP site sells one for a reasonable price or one can be bought elsewhere. Wearing just socks while using these could be an alternative.

Overall, Im satisfied with my purchase and the combination of these bands and my Limm Resistance Loop Bands will be great for my overseas trip to ensure I get my workout in. Ive also talked to BMP customer service, and they ensured me that I would be able to receive the orange band (30-35 lbs.) for free for leaving a review - awesome!

On a side note, I saw on the front of the user guide that it say All bands include a NO QUESTIONS ASKED 60-day warranty, while on the back of the guide under warranty it states All bands are FULLY warrantied for life (shipping and handle charges may apply.) CS from BMP let me know that the 60 day warranty is commercial only, and assured me the bands are warrantied for life.

UPDATE: 12/31/17, I received the orange band (30-35 pounds) promptly after calling BMP. Great company, appreciate the addition to my kit!",5.0
"I wanted these because I wanted to increase strength and flexibility.  I like how easy it was to set this up and get started.  I mostly wanted to use these for lower body workouts like squats, lunches,  hamstrings, calf raises, adductor and glutes.  They worked perfectly.  I especially like how you can work through a greater range of motion than you can do on a weight machine.  I would highly reccommend these. -- Ron",5.0

"I love the bands! I have been using the bands for about a month and they work great. The starter guide provides an array of exercises which I found very helpful. Additionally, BMP offers a free orange band if you provide a review which I think is a nice touch. Lastly, customer service is extremely polite and friendly. Definitely recommend the bands and will purchase BMP products in the future!",5.0

"I've been using these 3x a week for about 2 years. Yes, some reached their lifetime within that time, and then I called the number and let's say it all worked out.  I expect to get another couple years out of them, after which I'll be very happy to buy a new set.  Highly recommended.
Coordinates great with my small set of dumbbells, my swiss ball, and some other apartment-appropriate gear.",5.0
"These in the stores range from $20-$30. So thankful I could find them here at an extremely discounted price. Kids love them. One is fraying after daily use for 6+ months. At the price though, I think they are still well worth it.",5.0
My son is 14 years old and fit very nice in him. It is very cute. Estaba bien hecha. Vale la pena,5.0
"I ordered these for my sons birthday party and they loved them.  They are good quality.  The clasps come apart if pulled on hard to prevent choking, which I loved.  They were a great purchase and we are very happy.  More importantly, I needed some assistance from customer service and they were wonderful.  They went out of their way to help me.  I will definitely do business with them again.",5.0

"Great looking necklace. In 5'9"" 140lbs average sized guy and this necklace fits nice. Sits about a inch and half from my neck which is great for a ""sports"" necklace in my opinion. I didn't get it for its ""healing"" effects, but I do feel alittle better.",5.0

"Yeah, these are the ones to get.  I purchased some from another company on Amazon and they snapped so hard in my face that I was going to switch to free weights.  After finding Saber bands on Amazon and reading the excellent reviews, I decided to give it one more shot.

Immediately, upon opening the package, you notice the high quality of both the bands themselves and the harness handles.  Very well made and obviously sturdy enough for the rigors they will have to go through.  In their paperwork, the company makes you feel as they will proudly stand by the product and help with any problems that may arise.

So far, the rubber seems very strong and and gives excellent resistance.  The only issue I see is the use of multiple bands on the harness takes some getting used to since the connections are doubled-meaning, if you are working in a tank top, be careful of chaffing on your arms for overhead use.  This too, can be overcome with technique. Other than that, these bands seem like the way to go.",5.0
"Nicest and most versatile band system I've seen in over 10 years. My only suggestion would be to increase the thickness of material under the foam in the handles.
I fear repeated use at the combined higher multiple band tensions will cause the handles to deteriorate. Otherwise a well conceived product!",5.0
Awesome quality set of bands. It's really useful that you can stack them on top of each other for more resistance. Serious body builders will find these weak but for 99% of people these are perfect.,5.0
"After i ordered the item for the P90X program, i found out that they were not too comfortable so i gave them a call and they send me a different set of bands which work great. THx guys.",5.0
"Great for the exercise room. Purchased 3 sets so I would not need to waste time changing the handles. Perfect for my wife; and, the set does have great variety of resistance.",5.0

"I have purchased many of these necklaces at the mall and at sporting goods stores for at least $25 each. I found these and for the price I decided to get my kids one of each color for Christmas. They are Awesome and the kids love them and have no idea that I got them so cheap. Other children at school are ""jealous"" that my kids have so many of these ""Titanium"" necklaces.",5.0
Our son wears this almost every day.  The clasp was a bit tough to undo at first but it has gotten a bit easier over time for him to maneuver. Appears to be very good quality too and the price was great!,5.0
"I bought these bands to avoid having to buy multiple dumbbells or an adjustable dumbbells.  I'm using them for P90X and they have been wonderful.  I really like that the actual bands aren't attached to the handles so you can switch out the amount of resistance quickly and easily, rather than having to hold multiple handles in your hand at the same time.  These are also great since the handles can rotate around so they stay in a comfortable position in your hand and are easy on the wrists.  For the price you can't pass them up and there's a lifetime warranty.",5.0
"I had no problem with them, unless your really weak you won't need to use the other bands unless your adding weight to them. I use the red and black most of the time.",5.0
"I received the full set of Saber Bands as a Christmas gift and started using them with the P90X system after the New Year.  They come with a sheet of exercises that you can perform if you are not involved in any sort of official workout program.  So far they are just what I needed and are much less expensive and more convenient  than purchasing a full set of weights.  They are extremely easy to use and switch from band to band during the course of a workout.  If you are a beginner, there really isn't a better option. I've seen other bands by other companies and these are the best value and quality for the price.  I also love their customer service and from time to time they offer promotions for free products.  It's a great company to support, and the product is top notch.  If you have been wanting to start working out but can't afford a gym or a weight set, this is the purchase for you.  Buy them now and get in shape!  They are especially good for those that want to continue their workouts despite a heavy travel schedule for work and our perfect to use just about anywhere.",5.0
The saber bands are rock solid!  Construction seems top notch.  You can't beat the quality and at a reasonable price.  I definitley recommend these to anyone looking at resistance bands.,5.0
I just got these Saber bands about a week ago and I have been using them with the P90 workout program. So far they seem great. The handles are comfortable and there's more than enough resistance for me as a beginner.,5.0
"I needed a set of resistance bands for P90X, and purchased this set of Saber bands based both on reviews I'd read as well as on the price--price being the major factor in my decision.  I paid about $20 for my bands--a seemingly excellent price when compared with what other companies charge for their bands.  I must admit that, despite the glowing reviews, I didn't expect to be blown away by the quality of the bands because I had paid so little for them.  They do, however, seem to be of very good quality, and have held up well thus far in my P90X workouts.  That said, I have only had them for a couple weeks, so I can't officially say I'm ""blown away"" by the quality yet, but it looks promising!  I may submit a follow-up review in a month or two to let people know how the bands have held up.  Even if one breaks, however, I should be OK because the bands come with a lifetime warranty.

In closing, I want to mention that Saber's customer service is very good.  I've contacted them twice and they really do what they can to make sure everything is right.",5.0
"I am a young, fit person who does not like to lift in the gym environment and buying a set of weights would be too expensive.  These Saber Bands are durable, tough and well designed.  The hooks make adding and taking off weight super easy (very much like a bowflex, which I also recommend for home owners).  The grips are comfortable to use and the color coding of weights makes the chords that much easier to use.
A very quality product and I would recommend this to everyone I know!!!",5.0
"These are some great bands for a very low price. They were shipped extremely fast, I think they arrived within three days. So far the bands are better than what I expected. I like that they stack with strong metal hooks. They offer resistance from as little as 2-4 lbs to as much as 50-62 lbs. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these bands to everyone.",5.0
I am a certified personal trainer and I purchased the bands to add variety work outs for my clients. I am very impressed with the quality and workmanship of Saber Bands. I use them several times a day and they get quite a beating and they are holding up GREAT! There are other brands out there that are quite a bit more expensive but do not offer a better product. Saber Bands are a fantastic and a great value for the money. I highly recommend them!,5.0
Great bands for my cross-training. I don't like to lift at the gym because of the douchebags so this is great to be able to do it at my own time at my house.,5.0
Great product for people who don't want to go to the gym.,5.0
The variety of bands offers the opportunity for both my wife and I to exercise at our own pace. And being able to do so in our home versus driving to a gym and waiting for others to use a particular piece of equipment is a real plus. In addition in a short time each day we can get our routines done. So far the bands and equipment have really held up and it is good to know that the company stands behind their products.,5.0
"I purchased these bands, they arrived quickly, they were packed in an orderly manner, and all items were included. Very high quality bands, I've used them inside (70 degrees) and outside (50 degrees) and they've held up in both places. All of the handles, clips, nylon straps, and other parts of the band are in excellent condition. Further, even though these bands are automotive-grade, they rubber is virtually odor free, and this isn't the case with all exercise bands.

It's a nice plus to these bands that the handles detach. It adds more variability and flexibility as to what one can do with the bands. Also, the bands are indeed the resistance weights that are advertised, and I have found that they offer plenty of resistance. I'm an avid athlete who is just a year out of playing at the collegiate level, I know my way around a gym,  and I use free weights, 5lb-45lb. These bands completely cover that, they are very light-weight and easily transportable, and if you want to start using bands or are looking for a durable set, these are the ones. (Note: resistance bands are known for providing strength training that increases muscle tone, range of motion, and flexibility. They are great for providing functional workouts, and they can be used for building some muscle size, but if you're a bigger guy wanting to get bulked, resistance bands may not be for you. For anyone else, they do the trick and can't be beat for convenience.)

Saber is a good company, they're a family-owned business, and when you call them, you don't get an answering machine, automatic response, or a customer service rep who doesn't care, you get the owner. These people are legit, the price is fantastic for the quality, and in comparison to the other bands I have, these are the best. I highly recommend them.",5.0
"This is a high qualitiy product with good connectors, handles & attachment points. I purchased 2 complete sets so that I can use a full length band with each arm or leg at the same time although one set would've functioned just fine & still offered adaptability. The resistive material is good quality & the set is offered at a good price.",5.0
"Theses bands get the job done. I've used them for about 10 days so far, and haven't run into any problems. They're also extremely comfortable.",5.0
"After reading many reviews and comparing with other bands, it seemed that Saber Bands would be the best buy. I have to admit, for the price I was expecting something of not so great a quality, but I was definitely wrong! The design of the bands is awesome! With so many different joints the tension is spaced out very well throughout the bands. The entire system seems very durable and makes a lot of sense. I love how there are so many different combinations of weight, I have been able to get the desired resistance for every workout! I am very happy with this purchase and very happy with the product's quality! This was definitely a good buy all around!",5.0
This product arrived quickly and I was very impressed with the quality. I used them right away and they performed great. The metal clips were sturdy and the resistence seemed strong and accurate. I workout regularly and the black and red bands were a good starting point for me for most exercises. I tried to curl all 5 bands and could not get close. Overall a great value.,5.0
"I've only used these bands for a week, but they seem to be holding up well.  I bought these bands because I wanted a resistance band that I could quickly adjust (which equates to quicker/efficient workouts!).  The clips are strong and the nylon that bridges the band with the clip is durable.  The bands themselves are infinitely better quality than anything you'll find in a local store, yet at a fraction of the price.  I do own a pair of the Lifeline TNT cables, so as an unbiased customer, I owe it to the community to make comparisons.  The main difference between the Lifeline TNT cables and the Saber Bands is the quality of the band itself.  In terms of durability, the Lifeline TNT cables are ""available by prescription only"" while the Saber Bands are the ""extra strength over-the-counter medication"".  If you are a gym-rat meathead that bench presses 300 lbs as a warm-up set, then the Saber Cables doesn't provide the 100-pound cable that you would need.  If you are anyone else, the Saber Bands will be more than enough.  I think the Saber Bands beat out the TNT cables on many levels: (1) you aren't limited by only 3 cables, (2) adjusting the resistance is a cinch (if you have 1 cable on the TNT handles and want to add one more, you have to detach the 1 cable then re-attach 2 cables), (3) it's much lighter and less bulky, making it ideal for travel/outdoor training, and (4) it is more than decently priced (I feel like I'm ripping off the seller for once!).  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for anyone looking for a home gym option.",5.0
"I, well really my wife, recently ordered a set of Sabre Bands. Let me say that after using for 1 week, twice a day, this is an awsome product. I bought a set of exercise bands at a large sporting goods store & paid twice as much for them and they weren't made as well as the Sabre Bands. What impressed me most with the Sabre bands was that the clips are made of metal, as opposed to the cheap plastic ones that are available in major sporting good stores. Also the handles seem to be of good quality, no bending when your putting resistance to them. I would highly recommend these and I would also not hesistate to buy another set of Sabre Bands. well made product.",5.0
"I have been looking for something that I can utilize during quick workouts with the ability to increase and decrease weight quickly.  This product lets me hook on extra weight or take it off easily.  I also needed something that had some serious resistance as I have been lifting for 13 years now.  These bands really get up there with the resistance, especially with all of the bands attached.  I haven't had any problem with wear and tear either, and I'm pretty rough on them.  I recommend this product for someone who wants to increase resistace, change up their workout, or need something for a quick workout.",5.0
"I got it before the prices, it is a solid product.",5.0
"Bought the larger set of bands as well. Yes saw the 90 day use period. I use them for myself and clients in my clinic. They are used lightly and to help train correct movement patterns. I like them and all the features included with the bands. And using them correctly has not caused any wear that I can see after inspecting the bands. Again, I must stress I use them to help clients with proper movement patterns after treatment and to help them with at home ""homework"" after treatments to help with their pain problems.
I do tend to read manuals, follow instructions and am aware of limitations of the equipment. No much different from therabands which are also light stretchy materail not made for hard use types of workouts. Bearing this in mind I am pleased with the bands and the handles, ankle straps, and door anchors.",5.0
These stretch bands are great for a work out.,5.0
Perfect for working out at home. Absolutely love the door attachment.,5.0

"I bought this to complement my bodyweight exercises. Backgrounder: I work from home and want to be able to do quick sets in between meetings. I wanted to add core stability and pull exercises into my routines. I am not a hard-core body builder, just looking for a simple way to keep fit. This product helps me achieve it. Its stackable bands helps in increased loads. It doesn't mess up the living room where I do my quick sets during the day. As with other exercises, maintaining strict form is a must.  It is less expensive than going to a gym or accumulating gym weights, e.g. dumbbells. I went on a trip and brought this along. Not heavy and doesn't take space like other exercise stuffs like rollers. Very convenient to use in hotel rooms. At the end of my work day and done with the exercises, put in its small pouch. Voila! clutter free living room before the missus get home.",5.0

"As a former collegiate athlete who performed all kinds of weightlifting in school, I was looking for an alternative workout that would be less abrasive on the joints. These were the first bands from any company that I've ordered for that reason, and so far, I'm satisfied with their quality and construction. They're quickly proving to be an effective weightlifting alternative to old workout regiments.",5.0
I was looking for a way to add some strength training to my workout without weights. Never having used bands before I thought I would give these a shot. I have been very pleased so far with band exercises and especially the Black Mountain Product. The equipment comes in a nice portable bag - so portable that I brought them with me on a recent business trip overseas. All the components appear to be of good quality and BMP provides instructions for a slew of exercises. The hand grips have a nice feel to them and I really like the convenience of rapidly changing resistance levels. My biggest issue is deciding which exercises to do. Probably the best bang for the buck exercise gear I have purchased.,5.0
Been using a friends and finally bought my own. Great especially when traveling or camping. Top notch service and quick delivery too.,5.0

I really like this set of resistance bands because they are very versatile and easy to change the amount of resistance you want. The handles are padded and offer a lot of comfort. Not only can you use the bands singularly but you can also add as many bands as you want to increase the resistance. It also comes with at door anchor so you can do pulling exercises and an ankle strap so you can do leg exercises. Comes with a carry bag so you can take your workout with you. Highly recommend.,5.0
Very good,5.0
I've never used or learned about resistance training using a band before but a few months ago decided to turn one of my small rooms in to a workout place. I figured this would take up the least amount of space. After using it over the last two months it's something that I would highly recommend for somebody who is  just trying to maintain a simple and effective workout. I do a lot of business travel and I seem to always take at least one band with me so I can make sure I get at least a small workout before my meetings begin. Great product and very easy to use.,5.0

I can say that they have performed well for many months, andI will stick with this brand/manufacturer for all future purchases of resistance band products.",5.0

"Excellent product.  You can easily vary the intensity of the workout by merely switching the color coded resistance bands.  I do caution you to make sure the band anchor is securely in place.

They are thoughtfully designed, durable and offer a wide range of resistances. The bag included is great for packing them up quickly and hitting the road. I've used other bands and the thing that stands out most with these is how easy it is to switch and/or stack your bands to get the resistance you want. The door anchor and ankle strap are great extras to be included in this bundle as well. I'm highly satisfied and have had many of my clients purchase their own set.",5.0
"Arrived quickly in a practical yet attractive organizing bag.  With 2 sets of these bands I can really tune my workouts.  So now it goes like this:
1.  Do as many unassisted pull ups as possible
2.  Cheat on a lot more pull ups and then stop before damaging shoulder and neck
3.  Use bands to get to 100% failure without a medical emergency

I have had these for a while now and use them so much for so many different workouts.

They are high-quality and a good price!,5.0
"(Yeah, cheesy review title, I know!) I purchased this band set after I had the unfortunate experience of previous bands SNAPPING while I was mid-workout. Ouch! When the second old band snapped, I nearly lost an eye! These bands feel very strong and, after a while of regular use, don't show signs of breaking. It's so easy and quick to swap out bands or to combine bands to increase resistance (even when mid-workout--you don't need LONG breaks that kill your rhythm). The color-coding makes it easy to find the right band, too. Also, I love that they come in a zipped bag, which helps me keep the bands organized at home and makes it easy for me to pack them when I bringing them along on trips (they aren't the most compact, but don't take up a lot of space in my luggage and aren't terribly heavy, either).

"I had shoulder surgery the beginning of the year and needed strength training equipment, I didn't want to have weights hanging around the house. The resistance bands are great! I had the  physical therapist work with me using the bands and he thought they were just Perfect for my needs. Easy to use, I can take them on trips, they store in a small bag and with the weight going up to 75lbs I am good to go. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to tone and strengthen muscles.",5.0
Looks great,5.0
Great get a full workout or a more focused exercise routine.  They are bands so just about any exercise is possible anywhere.  Couldn't justify hundreds or thousands for home exercise machines but this fills all my needs wherever I need.,5.0
"Black Mountain Products makes the best Resistance Bands around. They also have the best life time guarantee, and awesome customer service. I've been using the bands, and over time the years the bands are starting to get worn and splitting, and one email to Black Mountain and they sent me FREE of charge, FREE shipping, replacements on the blue, yellow, and green bands that I use the most. THEY ARE AWESOME FOLKS at BLACK MOUNTAIN!!! You can't go wrong, and they are always there!!!",5.0
"I've been using the band's for close to two months in between or in place of gym workouts. The bands' build quality is above average in this price range, easy set up and quick resistance change system.

"These bands are great. This is my second set, gave one to my brother as a gift. Really versatile, can use them for arm workouts, to help with core exercises and legs. I don't have the time I used to in order to get to the gym, and being able to do quick workouts at the house are a huge benefit! High quality, no issues. And you can stack the weights!",5.0

"I bought these to round out my home gym.  I have adjustable dumbbells, but arthritis has made it painful to have heavier weights on my fingers and knuckles.  These resistance bands have been a great solution.  After several uses, they seem sturdy and anchor in the door well.  Greatly expands available exercises, I dug the price point, and customer service was immediately responsive to send me a new manual due to a printing error.  Highly recommend",5.0
I have had these bands for over 4 years. They traveled with me around the world and have endured many workouts. These bands are very high quality and give me good resistance when I stack multiple together. These go down as one of my best purchases on Amazon. Thabks BMP!,5.0

perfect for a variety of exercises with a range of resistance!,5.0
Great set of workout bands. My old bands were wore out and these appear to be of high quality. I have had no issues with the door wedge and it has worked great. The interchangeable handles are nice as I travel with these and it cuts down on the size for packing. The carrying case works great. I have had no issues with these and have been using them multiple times a day for a couple of months now.,5.0
This resistance band set is AWESOME.  Super happy with the purchase.  Very well made and easy to change out bands.  The accompanying black bag is great to throw everything in to and keep together and for traveling.  Definitely a great easy pack-along for work trips.  If you stay at a hotel or somewhere with a less than desirable exercise facility or it's crowded.  This allows for a great workout in your room.  May buy a second set to keep at work for short workouts throughout the day in my cubicle.  Definitely recommend this product.  The high reviews speak for themselves.,5.0
"Bought these based on the recommendation of a friend who is a personal trainer and uses them a lot. They are perfect for when I don't have time to make it in to the gym and for when I'm traveling and staying in places that don't have a fitness room. The lighter bands are the right resistance for my shoulder rehab following surgery and the heavier bands in combination allow for a good workout of the larger muscle groups. I screwed a few large anchor points into the walls of our garage in order to hit more angles. I haven't tried the door wedge yet, the all of the clips and handles work just like they should.",5.0

"A far, far greater value than purchasing each band on its own at a health and fitness store.  Pleasantly surprised with the functionality and versatility as you can easily attach more than one band to the handles for increased resistance if desired.  As a person accustomed to lifting with heavy free-weights, I prefer to use these for warm-ups and for extra reps immediately after a heavy set.  But for people who aren't looking for barbells and dumbbells, this product will do just fine if you want sore muscles.  I've tried a couple full workouts using just this product and an exercise ball - once you know what resistances to use, it does the job.  Highly recommended whether you are a hardcore gym-rat or cold beginner.  Can't go wrong with this.",5.0
Very nice quality product and it even came with a pair of protective glasses!,5.0
"This is my review of the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set with Door Anchor, Ankle Strap, Exercise Chart and Resistant Band.

I decided to purchase the Band set because I needed something lightweight that I can do resistance training when at the office or traveling.  I chose this set which comes with 5 bands with various degrees of resistance. Each band does not come with the handles. There is only one handle set. One or more bands can be clipped to the handle which allows you to add resistance as needed. I prefer it this way. They also made a set where each band has handle attached permanently already (I think).

The materials and quality of workmanship is very good. It's not cheaply made or fragile at all. The stitches, metal clips and the actual handle are solid.

With the band, you can do so many exercises from so many positions. I love it. I can be at work and exercise at the same time throughout the day.",5.0
The resistant bands are great quality and do the job for keeping toned and strong!,5.0
"We bought these bands for our son who uses them for strength training.  He pitches in baseball and in the beginning of each season his arm gets very sore.  These bands help him alot.  He uses them a couple times a week.  I definitely recommend these bands, great price and quality.",5.0
I love it,5.0
"I am not sure what to say really. For me, these bands work exactly like they're supposed to. The only trouble is I have to do all the work, and I have to be motivated enough to work it at least 3-4 times a week. If I don't use it, I won't get or see any benefits whatsoever. I can blame the product and say it doesn't work correctly or because it feels cheap, or the texture is not to my liking, or the color choices are wrong or I can stretch it enough to break it. What's important to me is, do they work as advertised if I work out with them (or anything else for that matter). I don't expect them to give me a Schwarzenegger like body, and if your anything like me, just getting the motivation to work out at all is where I usually fail.
 I've belonged to two different fitness center, I also have a multi set of dumbbells, hand grips (the squeezy things), and tennis balls. I also had one of those all in one rubber band bench press, leg lift multi use things. It was great. I kept it in the living room so I would always use it. My 9 year old daughter ended up using it more than I did for her dolls. So my point is for 20 bucks you get a product that I think is built well and will last a lifetime if you don't abuse it. BTW, I bought mine in January 2017 and only today I opened it and used it for for the first time. I am happy with this purchase and there is some YouTube videos that can help guide and motivate you. Use it or lose it.",5.0

I'm amazed how much I can do with these bands!  They're wonderfully constructed and all of the attachments work really well and they give me a great workout.  I also called the customer service folks to get a free orange band (strongest resistance level).  I'd highly recommend!,5.0

Bought set after major shoulder surgery for rehabilitation to strengthen my rotator cuff. Use it daily for for both shoulders to prevent further shoulder injuries. Also use it for hip strengthening for my power Vinyasa yoga practice. Quality product.,5.0
"These bands are a steal for the price.

Over the past 5 years I've done many different workouts: powerlifting, weightlifting, crossfit, calisthenics, you name it. These bands are the ultimate addition for anyone who is looking to get into working out or just wants to do something different.

1) They are great for stretching, mobility work, and rehabilitating any injuries
2) The tension created throughout the whole range of motion is ideal for both learning movements properly and high rep bodybuilding exercises
3) Huge selling points: you can combine bands to increase weight, door mount comes included, exercise book with enough suggested exercises to target your entire body.
4) Novices to experts can benefit from these bands - start with the lightest (yellow) band and work your way up to the heaviest (red) band. looping the band on itself increases (maybe doubles) the tension.
5) The bands actually seem to be great quality, I feel very comfortable stretching them 2-3x their static length throughout an exercise. They have a smooth controlled give.

Would highly recommend, about to buy another set for my younger brother.",5.0

"These are great. We use the SPRI Xertube bands at my gym and I was looking for an affordable alternative for home when I miss a resistance class. These bands are great. I am 5'2"" so the handles make them a little longer than the SPRI Xertube bands making some of my normal routines a little different but if I band up I can accomplish my workout. I tried some of the flat bands as a cheap alternative but I really like the tube resistance bands for their consistency and the handles for the versatility. I am very pleased with this purchase.",5.0

"I was having some shoulder pain and had it diagnosed as a torn rotator cuff.  I went for physical therapy and started with stretching exercises, isometric exercises, then stretch bands and then light weights.  Since I had only a few stretch bands laying around, I decided to buy this kit.  I am extremely please with the products' quality and construction.  I would highly recommend these bands to anyone serious about physical therapy, flexibility and strength.",5.0
"Just received these and I have to say that while I certainly prefer free weight workouts, traveling for months at a time makes sticking to a lifting regimen impossible. These resistance bands are perfect for doing workouts on the go at hotels, and I was legitimately surprised at how much resistance they give when you use all bands simultaneously. A great set of customizable bands that would be great for someone looking to buy a starter set that will work for a long time.",5.0

"These do the trick. I'm the typical gym bro. 5-6 days a week. Bench. Triceps. Rows. Squats. Biceps. Shoulders, ETC. These save a lot of time so you can warm up, work out, recover, whatever. I personally only use them for triceps, biceps, and shoulders. I start from the lightest and obviously work my way up to the heaviest. I find that trying to do back and chest with these are hard unless you have a professional set up with a bench (if you have a bench might as well have plates and a barbell), or a rod bolted to a wall for back workouts (rows). Again, bicep curls and tricep pull downs are A1 with this.",5.0
It's exactly what you'd expect. I love the door anchor,5.0
"Love love love these resistance bands. I hate going to the gym. I never know what I am doing and always feel out of place. Using these resistance bands for 1 hour, 3 x a week, I lost 10 lbs.

"Very well made. Love the flexible options. Black Mountain speared no expense here, these are made with quality components. I used a silver sharpie and numbered my bands from 1 to 5 on each side/end to help me understand the resistance from easy to hard. There is a chart included but its not convent to pull it out and figure it each time. Would be great if they were labeled better. Colored bands does not tell me how much resistance each is. The silver sharpie was an easy fix, otherwise I really enjoy using these.

"I ordered this product primarily to rehab a shoulder injury and to supplement my existing weight workouts. I'm a swimmer and I see a lot of other athletes using resistance bands as a warm up or for physical therapy, so I was curious to see if this product would work for me. This product is super easy to use and you can set up an exercise routine within minutes after unpacking the parts. All you need is door that closes to attach the anchor (or you can use your foot for simple arm raise routines). The instructions are very clear, and has the weight tensions clearly outlined by color on the front page. There are many other exercises you do besides the ones they show in the booklet -- just ask around or search YouTube. I've been using it daily for a couple weeks now and plan to use it consistently to strengthen my shoulder to full recovery.",5.0

It came with attachments for the door so we could use that as an anchor along with leg attachments and a handbook with exercise ideas. We did not want to have to get a week pass at a gym or anything like that while we were on vacation so these bands were incredibly helpful as we were able to still get a workout in without access to a gym.

"UPDATE: I bought a second set as a gift and when I went to inform them of the problems with the leg strap, I noticed that the stitching was improved, almost like a seat belt stitching pattern, much better so keep that in mind when reading the rest of this review. With this update I raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

Check the stitching on the leg strap before using it. Mine attaches the D ring to the strap with a single stitched piece of fabric that ripped right off during my first use with 20lbs. I advise the company to create a better leg strap because this can be dangerous under pressure. When my strap broke, the bands shot back and hit the wall with all the clips attached and ended up knocking paint off my wall and leaving a small dent. If your leg strap only has 1 row of stitching holding it down then don't use it, it will rip.

Safety issue aside, I am currently enjoying this kit. I bought this in the effort to lift from home without having to spend loads of money on dumbells. I use the door harness which as of right now, after 2 days of use seems secure. However I don't think I will ever shake the feeling that any second part of my door could break and I'll have parts flying at me. As I said, I said I bought this with the intention of replacing dumbells, it can be difficult to get a complete workout because you always have to find sturdy locations to anchor it, but I did notice that after workout I felt that i had worked muscles that dumbells alone would never hit. Resistance training feels like its more beneficial to take your time with your reps as the tension builds as you stretch the bands. In conclusion, I am happy with this as a inexpensive alternative to dumbbells and will continue using it, but watch out for that ankle strap.",5.0
Very nice!,5.0

"I've purchased a few sets of resistance bands over the years and these are the best by far.

The resistance bands are a great alternative to free weights. I often use free weights but they get expensive after a few dumbbells and workout bench. The resistance bands still give you the freedom to perform a variety of exercises that you would do with free weights and more when you factor in the door anchor. I like the diversity it brings to your workout every time I take the bands out of the travel bag that is included. I look forward to discovery new work outs I can perform with these strong resistance bands.,5.0

They are of good quality, actually a higher quality than I had expected. Easy to use and change tubes, and the combination of tubing to create more resistance is great, too. Door attachment works well and the quality of the ankle strap and hand grips is also very nice. It is great to get resistance training without having to have a big peice of equipment...something I just don't have room for.

"I purchased this product several months ago as a way to regain some muscle mass after pacemaker surgery.  I used to weight lift at the gym, but my cardiologist says that I should not be doing that type of exercise anymore.  As a result, my muscles have been turning to mush.  The resistance bands provide a way to regain some of it in a gentle, pacemaker safe manner.  I have been very pleased with the product!  It is well made and appears to be very durable.  The variety of bands provides an easy way to combine them to achieve a good weight for each exercise, and I especially like the feature that allows me to attach to a door for some of the exercises, such as the hamstring curl.

"Nice set of starting resistance bands, good variety of 'resistances' - well-constructed and sturdy. The package arrived quickly, and nicely packaged.  :-) Everything fits in the zippered pouch. The only comment I would have is that the photos in the user's guide could be a little larger and clearer (better contrast).  I'm not familiar with the resistance band exercises, so it would be very helpful to see the photos more clearly, and for each exercise to list the muscles worked.  I had to ask my personal trainer about the right technique to use because I couldn't always tell from photos.  However, I am very pleased with the resistance bands, I did the ""lateral walk"" and it definitely worked my glutes!",5.0
Bought a bar separate to use with and these do all we need them to!,5.0
"WARNING!!! This works better than advertised.
When I was searching for resistance bands on Amazon, I normally go for the highly rated ones, holding that other customers could steer me one way or another. With such great feedback on the Black Mountain branded bands I was certain I was getting a good product. What I wasn't expecting was an great one. I have these bands set up in my garage and work out 4-5 times a week and they stood up to my workouts. But I also have a group here twice a week and they have nothing but positive things to say about them.
My wife isn't a huge fan of free weights because she's afraid she drop on her toes. With these these super sturdy and super deceiving on how durable they are.
I'd highly recommend them to anyone, particularly those who has limited space.",5.0

"I bought this set of resistance bands instead of a chin-up bar. ( I didn't want to be that guy who fell.) I have been using these for about 3 weeks now... they have been working out great! I'm using the door attachment ( Which was scary at first. Didn't want it to snap me in the face?!) without any issues. Adding more than one band onto the grips is no issue at all, in fact its super simple. The bands feel and look very secure. Also it's made with quality materials. I would definitely buy them again and recommend this set to anyone.",5.0

As a brand new dad I wanted to have something to keep my fitness level up while still being able to spend time with my little one. This set has allowed me to get a full body workout in without having to leave the comforts of home. It has been a great physical and mental tool to keep me active during a very busy time!,5.0
"Really love the full set! Handles are comfy, wide range of resistance weights adds nice variety to workouts. The door piece is a nice addition that allows any door to be used for any type of exercise that you might do on a cable machine at the gym. Really looking forward to using these at my bodybuilding competition in a few weeks for pumping up/getting ready for the stage- great addition to the gym bag!",5.0
I had been using my standalone black BMP band for years and needed to step up resistance. This set is perfect since you can mix-match to get the perfect amount of resistance for whatever level of training. I will only buy BMP bands because of the high quality and the way they present themselves as a company.,5.0

"As a mom of two toddlers it's very difficult to find time to go to the gym. Finding someone to watch them, getting them dressed
and then driving to the gym, working out- is a 3 hour ordeal. I knew I had to find something that I can do at home and I finally have.

The bands are very sturdy and well constructed. I also like that you do not have to worry about wearing gloves because the handles are
soft. I have been using these bands to strengthen my core and lose that belly fat. I use them for sit ups, and impact cardio workouts. The results
have been amazing!

I love that it doesn't take up space like a treadmill or other workout equiptment does. The bag is great and everything fits nicely and zips up.

I recommend this product to anyone who thinks they don't have time to work out. The weight is coming off and I am feeling so much stronger. I can
easily carry laundry down the stairs and groceries inside without being out of breath. I can't wait to continue to use this product because the results
speak for themselves! GREAT PRODUCT!!",5.0
I love packing these with me when I travel.  No need for a gym!  Also comes with a super handy exercise manual!,5.0
"I am new to the whole band as exercise thing, and therefore do not have a lot of experience using them; however, I can say that these bands are extremely well constructed, and easy to use. Switching them out is simple and fast, and the quality of construction is tremendous. I can see these lasting for a very long time. It's also a very good deal, for as much as you get in the package. Finally, being able to break everything down and store them in such a compact bag - or, being able to easily take them on vacation, or work travel - make these extremely space-friendly. I have a whole gym tucked in the space between my clothes dresser and wall!",5.0
The bag is great. Keeps everything organised. The bands work wonderfully (too wonderfully).,5.0

"I've been a happy user of these bands for four years now. A week ago, I noticed that one of the bands (my yellow band) had a tear in it. I've used them for several years, so I wasn't particularly surprised or upset (hey, stuff wears out over time).. So, seeing the lifetime warranty, I took a picture of the ripped band and emailed customer service. The VERY NEXT day, they had shipped a replacement band to me, no questions asked. Terrific customer service.

For me, these bands aren't a replacement for gym equipment and actual weights, but for traveling, they are a perfect solution. Lightweight, convenient to use and they keep me in shape during my travels from the comfort of my hotel room.",5.0
"My wife and I do a workout that requires us to change the resistance of the bands we are using. The clips and construction of the bands are super easy to move during the cues of the routine. The bands are well constructed, and you can't beat the price!",5.0
Great product for daily exercise using door for resistance.,5.0
"I've bought this product a few times and use it when I teach my classes to seniors. They are outstanding bands that are strong enough to withstand any type of exercise. Since I worry about resistance bands ""snapping"", especially with a senior crowd, I have no fear that this will happen with these bands. The quality is second to none!

My hope is that the price will come down, perhaps when Black Mountain offers more bands at one time and makes the door anchor, ankle strap and exercise chart ""optional,"" since I don't need to keep receiving them every time I order the bands. That may reduce the overall cost of the bands.",5.0
I like,5.0
"really awesome product, wished i would've ordered the one with more handles, I use it almost daily and have no problems with it at all. very sturdy",5.0
"I received these bands a few months ago, and have been impressed by the quality of the bands and the responsiveness of the service. I have purchased a number of resistance bands before while rehabbing my rotary cuffs. While the prices were comparable, the quality of the BMP bands is in a whole different league. Each of the details has been attended to, from the very good quality handles with a padded insert and strong nylon, to the metal links to the ankle strap and carrying bag. These things have withstood my rigorous workouts and should last for a very long time. . The resistance bands are hooked up via latches that connect to a D-ring on the handle, making the latching action very smooth and quick.

The accessories included are a storage bag (very convenient), a door anchor, and a leg strap (both worked very well). I was impressed by the comfort of the leg strap. There is also a convenient chart of the band resistance and common band combinations which comes in handy.

I have greatly enjoyed using this product and am very pleased with it. This is a great product at an even better price. Don't waste your money on the other overpriced options on amazon.",5.0
These were the perfect addition for my exercise and fitness needs. The door anchor works perfectly with my door and I am able to use my bands safely and securely. Would recommend them to anyone looking to mix it up!,5.0
"The best set of resistance bands out there. It's amazing the amount of items you get with this purchase. The bag, the handles to attach to each band, the bands themselves, the door hook and ankle hook. High grade materials and colorful. They feel very strong and well made. Love them",5.0
"It's like my own portable gym!! Instead of carrying 45lb plates around, i've got this!",5.0
I'm happy with this purchase. The band's are thick and also the straps are rugged. I've used this set several times and have also used it to demonstrate new exercises to beginners.,5.0

Great design on the handles and door anchor.,5.0
These bands are amazing! I am using them daily. I love all of the exercises I can accomplish with the bands. They are easy to use and durable.,5.0
"Im very impressed with the quality of these bands. I was in physical therapy for a muscle injury and their flat bands kept breaking. I bought these to continue the routine they used and built a simple hook eye board, screwed to the wall with carabiners at different levels from the floor up to hook the center of the bands into. If I had one issue it would be to have handles for each band instead of having to switch each time but the cost would triple.",5.0
Great product! Perfect for at home or on the go. It even comes with a variety of different workouts. I'd definitely recommend!,5.0
This is An amazing product. Just had neck surgery and bought this to begin therapy on healing my neck without injuring it again and it's awesome and worked really good and was stable sturdy and strong.  Definitely recommend ...,5.0

"I do a lot of computer work for my occupation, and it has been vital for me to take breaks and either stretch out or get exercise.  This purchase, along with an exercise ball and a yoga mat, have been absolutely essential for me to maintain my flexibility, strength, and overall health. These resistance bands are key for convenient strength exercises.  They seem to be built with high quality standards.  And the door anchor works great to add new dimensions to the exercises.  Highly recommend bringing this set into your home or office, or both.",5.0
"I have tried a lot of different resistance bands over the years but these are by far the best. I love the hooks so I don't have to worry about handles and it allows me to double or even triple up the bands for extra resistance. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good, high quality set of resistance bands!! You won't be disappointed.",5.0
Bands are very durable and seem they will last for awhile.  You can perform many different excercises along with the attachments.  Also very portable where you can take anywhere without taking up a lot of room.,5.0
"I ordered this set after doing physical therapy.  I was given the standard band used by physical therapists.  They don't last very long before they snap in two.  So as I wanted to continue strengthening my shoulders, I ordered this set.  It works great!!!  Very good quality.  I would highly recommend this product.",5.0
"These bands last. They may not look like much on first go, but my first set purchased in 2012 finally gave way afer constant use (sometimes for un-recommended activity, I'll admit) over 5 years after my initial purchase. On the improved price point and feedback from a friend for whom I bought a 2nd set in 2014, my re-order was a no-brainer.

The add-ons and exercise guide really increase what you can achieve with an at-home workout and I have the benefit of retaining the handles, door and ankle-straps from my prior purchase for even more possibilities. There is a slight amount of friction-exposure to your wrists that I feel while doing bicep curls, but easily remedied by a solid pair of exercise gloves.

See you again in 5 years BMP!",5.0
"First I'm a 68 yr old male that had rotator cuff surgery. I've been using light free weights and the medical bands that I got from therapy. This is my 3rd week using the black mt. product and I really like them less stress on the joints and tendons. Wish I ordered a extra set of handles with my set, would have come in handy. Over all very pleased with my purchase, Will update later on how the bands are holding up from use.",5.0
This is quality system that gives many options.,5.0
"Loving my new Black Mountain resistance bands! I've had them for about a month now and couldn't be happier. They are such a solid product - no fear of the band breaking down or ripping mid-exercise.  I use them almost everyday and they still look brand new. I appreciate the new design, too, with the one set of grips interchangeable on the different strength bands - they take up far less room this way.  Great carrying bag makes it easy to keep them all neatly together - perfect for travel. Also comes with a User and Exercise guide with great tips and easy to follow instructions.  Very friendly customer service reps available for any questions. Great product!",5.0
Wife used for rehabbing shoulder injury. Saved time (and money) from having to do exercises at orthopedist's office. Seemed to be high quality.,5.0
had ordered this so that i can keep my muscles toned and not miss out on workout even during travel. this set is just perfect to cover that and is compact to fit in a small nap-sack.  the quality of the tubes provided is very good and the excercise charts provided with the kit covers all the muscle groups.,5.0

"I got these bands a bit ago and so far they have been great. I have rotator cuff tendonitis right now and these have been very helpful for getting back into working out. They are exactly what I've been looking for to do my physical therapy workouts at home, plus the door anchor keeps it from coming off a door handle or something and slapping you, which is the worst. I'd definitely recommend this and other Black Mountain products to anyone who is looking for good bands to work with. Plus they are easy to pack and take your workout anywhere, I've already taken them on a weekend trip and didn't have to miss any workouts.",5.0

I've had no issues with the quality of the product. Received exactly what I ordered and expected. It's perfect for that workout at home when you don't feel like going to the gym or to take on a business trip for a quick and easy workout at the hotel after you stuff your face at the breakfast buffet (true story).,5.0
"We have these at my apartment complex and they are AMAZING! Super strong and they actually have handles that don't make your hands hurt afterwards. You can use these for everything and I'm glad I don't have to use free weights anymore because of these. It's actually hard to get to them because everyone at the gym wants to use these for themselves. Overall, great product!!",5.0

These bands are great especially for when my set of weights are not heavy enough for the team beachbody workouts I am doing.  They are very sturdy and the colors make it easy to switch between the desired resistance.  I recommend this set!,5.0

"I am on the road quite a bit for work, and this was the PERFECT solution to working out in my hotel room. Does not add any weight to my luggage, and I'm no longer dependent on what equipment happens to be in the hotel ""fitness center."" I bought some black mountain bands many years ago, but this new design is superior. The handle/carabiner system is much better for me because the resistance is much more customizable, and it's less bulky in my bag. The included velcro loop and door jamb strap are also a great addition to the kit. Would definitely recommend this product!",5.0
I've ordered several of their sets of bands and they're great!,5.0
Very easy to use. We have 4 people using these in our household. My mom call company to find out about their products more and spoke to a young man named Levi who was very helpful. We will be ordering some more sets as we only have one now.,5.0

"I am extremely pleased with this set. I have seen one of my friends playing with a resistance band at home, and being the lazy me who usually skips the gym for different reasons, I figured having a resistant band is very convenient in the days where I do not go to the gym.

I bought this one and oh my I was blown away from what I can do with it!

Pros.
1-The piece that allows you to attach the bands to a door is super amazing allowing me to do almost all kind of exercises.
2-The exercises pamphlet explaining all the exercises that you can do for each muscle group. They have much more on their website as well.
3-The handles are pretty comfortable.
4-The bag is a good addition for storing it without causing a mess.

Cons.
1-I wished if the weight of each band is printed on it somewhere.

This has probably been the best purchase it have made as far as fitness equipment.",5.0
Love these bands! They are both strong and well engineered!,5.0
"These bands are awesome! I have been using these for 30 minutes on my lunch break at work in my cubical to do some arm exercise and shoulder exercise to supplement my free weight training. Additionally, when I can't make it to the gym due to my busier schedule from being a parent now I use these at home to do exercises for my back, shoulders, chest, legs, and abs. This is also a great quality product that has for the past few weeks been everything I expected when I ordered it. I recommend these to all my coworkers who see me using them during my lunch hour.",5.0
These are awesome work great.,5.0
"So far, so good. I will keep an eye on the black piece that goes in between a door crack that you loop the band into. The concern is that the black loop may dig into the resistance band when applying a large amount of force and might cause damage. Nothing has happened yet, but I will keep an eye on this.",5.0
"Just noticed I did not review this item. WOW, I thought resistance training and Bands might have been a gimick. It was the price that got me to get them and test them. Im a believer now. I slam these bad boys into a door, and I get going and don't want to stop. I use them without a door, and entangled in all areas, and have fun with them. They seem very strong, and I do not fear they will snap on me. The threading on the Door jam thingy is coming unraveled a little, but, that would be expected, as I am using them a great deal. Will likely just double stitch them later. All in all, for the price, and how many exercised can be done with these things, I am more than happy. Excellent product.",5.0
"Very happy with these! Got them for Christmas and have been using them since. They pack up nicely, are sturdy/well-made/ and exactly what I needed for my work out. Thanks!",5.0
"This set of bands and cords works great!  There is a wide variety of resistance, and the handles and door connector work fine.  Resistance cord and band training is useful for gaining and maintaining strength and flexibility, while avoiding injury.",5.0

Great product a must have for travel and at home,5.0
"i bought these bands so my teenage sons could begin training without using weights and developing poor form. While teaching them different exercises, I discovered that these bands allowed me to isolate specific muscles and develop better mind-muscle coordination than with dumbbells and barbells. By combining combining bands of different resistances, I could attain just the right tension to challenge a particular muscle group using good form, without falling into the old habit of recruiting other muscles. As a result, I'm able to build and tone the exact muscles I want hit. After three months now, the bands are proving to be very durable and versatile. And they store readily in the pouch for quick cleanup or travel.",5.0
"This is a really nice set for the money.  I do a lot of Beachbody workouts and these are awesome for taking on travel when I don't have access to weights.  Less than half of what the Beachbody resistance bands cost, nicer, and comes with more accessories.  Can't go wrong!",5.0
"I have just recovered from my second shoulder surgery, so both shoulders are repaired. I needed to work out, but weights were out of the question. My wife purchased the basic resistance band package from black mountain products for my Christmas present and that has ended up being my favorite present of all. This product has helped me with my recovery and strengthening my whole body, so that I can function normally with everyday activities. A Big Thanks to BMC for creating this product, so I can get back to enjoying life and not just living. I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends and relatives. Thanks again for making a quality product.",5.0
"I've been using these for several weeks.  There is no sign of them breaking yet.  I got them primarily for travel, and they serve that function - they are light (I only bring one or two bands) and work as they are supposed to.  I wish that there was a ""heavier"" weight strap, but otherwise am happy with the purchase",5.0
"These bands are great!  I use them with the workouts they recommended, along with my p90x videos, and with other workouts I find online.  Its great that you can adjust the weight you are working with by switching out the band.  They come in a small bag too so easy storage!  I highly recommend them.",5.0
"Excellent quality.  Everything you need to get going is in the bag, including an attachment that allows you to hook the straps to an anchor you can move to any door. Very satisfied.",5.0
"I got these bands for the office. Now that I got a new desk job, needed something to stretch a little. These are awesome. First off the packaging nice and compact perfect to carry with you to the office and back home. I use transit for my commuting. Next, complete set. I can do anything I want in my office. Just lock the door and get my 10 minute physical break on the days I cannot go for a long walk due to weather. It comes with detailed instructions and workouts so you can start right. Definitely recommend these.",5.0
"Got this set for my home gym.  Came exactly as described, high quality, fits my needs.  I read a review online that said you may want to get a second set of attachable handles if you switch between high and low weight frequently for different exercise, and I agree with that, though it only takes a 30 second recovery breathe to switch anyway - depends on your preference and set up.",5.0
"I really like this product, it helps me warm up before I do a heavy set, such as bicep curls or squats or I use them to do supersede, would recommend.",5.0
Great product! Will recommend to others.,5.0
"I'm a disabled vet.  Due to my spinal injuries, I can't due traditional wight training.  I've been using these bands for a few months now and they have really helped with my recovery.  One of the bands started to break down, and when I contacted BMP, they replaced it right away.  Great customer service!",5.0
"We received this last week and have used it several times already. The set feels heavy duty and well-made, and the attachments are pretty intuitive to use. I love the latches on each side  so I can watch the bands to each other or to the attachments. It makes shortening the bands for the crabwalk much easier. This replaces a previous band I had where the handles did not come off, making it much less versatile. I will update this review if anything changes once we use it more often.",5.0
"I've now purchased three sets of these, two for others and one for myself. From recovering after surgery by continuing therapy to just working out these can really get the job done. Excellent construction and very durable. The included accessories are all you need and there is even a small booklet with some workouts. You can really hit a lot of muscle groups if you practice some posture.",5.0
"FABULOUS,,AWESOME,,PERFECT,,THANKS,, AAAA++++",5.0
Great product; well made!,5.0
"Really solid products, feel solid and well built.  I like how I can throw one or two in a bag for when I travel",5.0
"Great quality and really solid construction.  I don't see how anyone could break these.  The tubes are really solidly attached to the clips and everything looks and feels like high quality.  I find that I use all the bands pretty regularly so none are really too light or hard.  The door anchor is really nicely constructed and solid.  Only thing I wish it came with was a full torso strap, but I knew that wasn't part of the kit ahead of time.  The workout instruction booklet you get is grainy black and white photos but that's hardly an issue.",5.0
Finally got these out of the bag and started using them!  I like the fact there is a strap that fits through a closed door and significantly increases the exercise options.  I would have liked one more band with more resistance but found that combining two does the job just as well.,5.0
Well worth the price and working just as expected. I use them daily. No problems.,5.0
I bought these a few weeks ago and love them.  I use them as a little extra workout on days I don't make it to the gym.  They even come with a handy storage bag.,5.0

amazingly easy to use.  The door inserter is the best and takes 2 seconds.  Great product.,5.0
"I really like the bands, and anything I can get to help my wife exercise is a bonus.  Good variety of resistance and I really like the metal hooks and rings. Seems like they are solidly put together.",5.0
"I just pulled these out for my first work out with them.  These are so much better than free weights:
1.  I love that you can use more than one at once to really customize the resistance. Both my husband and I can use these and get the right work out.  He could double, triple, quadruple up for more challenge.
2. Free weights are for arms,  these can be used for arms and legs.
3.  The cost of the variety of weights this can equal would be way more than these.
4.  And take up way more space.
5.  Movements feel more gentle and fluid, while still feeling the exercise.  (Like swimming compared to running.)",5.0
Got these bands to do some lightweight exercise without taking up so much space.  These bands are easy to use and are stack-able so you have a lot of resistance choice.  Bands are easy to use and easy to setup so you can quickly get to exercising.  These bands have met my expectations even though I am still working my way up to full resistance.,5.0
"Great bands, very pleased to add them to my home gym.",5.0
"Working great, haven't used them too much, but enough to say they are durable and will give you a workout.",5.0
"Have been using these for several months now. Just like using weights only much more light, plus they're portable. I can take them anywhere! Helps me build muscle & stay toned.",5.0
"These are perfect for efficient workouts at home. Easy to assemble, awesome to use. I have very little time to actually go to the gym so this is perfect for quick and effective resistance training (along with other tools I have). Perfect for compact home gyms/workouts",5.0
I love these bands! They are incredibly high quality and they really bolster my workout. You can't go wrong with these!,5.0
Excellent set of exercise bands. The ability to set them up for such a range of resistances is awesome.,5.0
"I bought these bands as a recommendation from my personal trainer. I use them on my ""off-days"" and have been pleased with their performance so far. I especially like the handles - they are soft and comfortable, and do not dig into my wrists when doing flys like some other bands I have used in the past. The adapter to use on a doorway is also very helpful as I like to use them at home, and the carrying case keeps everything tidy.",5.0
"I had lost overall body strength due a painful hip injury that really hampered my mobility and limited my ability to exercise. I've recovered from surgery and I'm now catching up on recovering strength using this product.  I feel that the continual and steady resistance the bands provide through the entire exercise motion is more efficient in strengthening the targeted muscles than free weights. Steady resistance is much harder to maintain with free weights.  Even at light resistance, these bands provide that steady pressure that can be increased as the muscles strengthen, plus you can hold the pressure at any point during the motion simply by stopping for a count of 3 or 5, etc. This works great, for example, on bicep curls if you hold on the return motion when your elbows are at 90 degrees; makes you feel the burn! This system is allowing me to regain strength slowly, easily and steadily. The bands, the couplings, the handles, etc., are all well-designed and made of high quality materials.  Very well-satisfied with the quality of the product and the efficiency of the system. A big plus is that the set and the system travel very well!",5.0
"Great set of bands.
These are professional quality for a great price, especially with all the extras you get thrown in for free.",5.0
very handy and will allow me to advance in my levels of fitness,5.0
"Bands seem to be pretty sturdy, I love the accessories (carrying case, handles, ankle strap, etc).  Only thing I will say is to be aware that you will need at least one door with ample space in front of it in which to do your workouts.  The set is great, really enjoying it so far.",5.0
wonderful!,5.0
"My husband hurt his shoulder and had to go to physical therapy. His physical therapist recommended the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set.

The bands are well made and he highly recommends them.",5.0

"I love these Bands....

I needed something to help me get my strength back.. I had lost the ability to walk and to do most things we take for granted I did have a Therapist come to my house 2 times a week...I know she was doing one great job as I had never gotten that far ever... I saw these Bands on Amazon one day and I knew they would help me out a lot I know I should of asked the therapist first but I had a good feeling that she would be ok with this purchase i was right she got a set for herself as well...these bands have helped me in so many ways get stronger and to be able to walk on my own again..which I never thought I would get there this fast..I love the lighter Bands as they are the ones that I can use for now.....I am not strong enough for the darker cords yet the door connector is a great idea... I really love that one I just leave it up as there is no small kids here just me and the hubby and our 3 4 legged kitties..I use my bands on the days that my therapist does not come...so she come 2 times a week and I do use the Bands 5 days a week I have to make sure I really use these other wise one can get lazy and then the work you have done to get to the amazing point you have gotten to is just tossed out the window...is my option only...I am so glad that I did buy this sets of Resistance Bands. i know I have  said it before but they really have helped me out so much its amazing what you can do with these bands i have seen others use these bands and I had no idea what it was doing now I know the power behind each cord and to me its Truly Amazing...Thank You Black Mountain Products for putting your product out there for us to try and to get stronger I know I will be using these for the rest of my life I feel so good after I am done I have the total gym...I do love that its a wonderful machine but when I don't have a spotter I go the the bands and I can work out for as long as I choose to with no spotter",5.0

"LOVE the Black Mountain resistance bands kit. Super quality for the money. They seem to be well made. Been using these for almost a month and everything is as expected. My only caveat is the bag; it a little bulky but then, I have a really small carry on! Would definitely recommend this kit.",5.0
"I used resistance bands for Physical therapy. I thought that this product was a good replacement for going to therapy 3 times a week, since I am able to use them at home. I think that this is very durable and gets the job done. Would recommend it for others to purchase.",5.0

"Excellent!  This had been on my wishlist for awhile and finally bought it as a gold box deal from Gizmodo.  Bands, handles, and straps are well constructed.  Easily fits into a carry-on bag when traveling to destinations without a gym.  Makes a nice addition to my home prison-yard gym.",5.0

"The best bands on Amazon at a great price! My trainer recommended the detachable handles and they work great. You can combine multiple weight bands to increase resistance or simply go with one. Carrying case is a nice touch and convenient. I've had these bands for 1.5 months and they're in great shape. After getting them the first week, I bought another set for my 70 year old mom to rehab and rebuild her strength after a few injuries. I reached out to claim my free orange band and Customer Service was impeccable! Thank you Black Mountain Products!",5.0
"I'm very pleased with these resistance bands. The gym I belong to is onsite at my employer, however, I work from home a couple days a week. Living in a smaller apartment, I don't have a lot of room for fitness equipment. These have been a perfect solution to make sure I can get in my workouts at home. I've also traveled with these bands and they are easy to transport in the included bag. Highly recommended.",5.0
This product was recommended to me by my personal trainer. I love working out with these bands which make it easier for me to take them on and off and work out in them. Carrying bag works great as well since I don't have to carry them in and out of gym or home individually. Great product!,5.0

"Very glad I bought them.  I had been in archery in my younger days.  I didn't pick up a bow for about 15 years.  I've gotten back into shooting a bow again and this has done a lot for my arms, shoulders, and back muscles to help draw and hold my bow.",5.0
Great bands for general exercise or physical therapy.,5.0
I purchased these band to help with a shoulder problem that is somewhat chronic. Since I've had the band's my pain has been noticeably reduced. One thing about PT is that you have to stay with it. Since I've had these band I've been able to do just that. The design makes them work much better than the strips of elastic I got at therapy. Taking one along on trips is quite easy also. They really don't take up any room. All in all I am quite happy with my purchase.,5.0
Love it,5.0
"In our personal training business, we have athletes from many sports.  The resistance bands increase strength through range of motion, and they really help our hand speed -- essential for our tennis players, paddlers, swimmers, triathletes and golfers.  They are easy to use and the sets are short and sweet!

"This was the neatest product I've probably ever purchased in the fitness realm. It's extremely well made. Sturdy. And most of all, effective! I love that I don't have to buy multiple things to get these exercises (like a chin up bar and a set of these bands) or a more pricey system. This is perfectly priced. I HIGHLY recommend!",5.0
"This is a well made and versatile band set. You can stack the bands to make them more challenging and they work great in a door jamb for many exercises. This can replace many exercises you would normally have to go to a gym for. It is a Bowflex type of workout which is a nice complement to free weights. If you want to save time and money by skipping the gym membership and bulky home equipment, this band set is a great space, time and money saver.",5.0
Bought this resistance band set to help increase variety of exercises to support tennis strength and joint mobility. Range of bands is excellent. Quality of equipment is excellent too. Found many YouTube videos to supplement the booklet that comes with the package. Would definitely recommend this package.,5.0
"Purchased this band set so that they could be used on the road.  With a heavy travel schedule, these are perfect.  They are excellent quality and have been holding up great.  They take up little room to store and come in a durable bag.  These bands are also great for a young person not ready for weights!  Would suggest to anyone who does not have a gym membership or wants to supplement one.  Great price for the results!",5.0
"The gym where I was a member closed down recently, so I thought I would try working out at home for a while.

I recently tore my rotator cuff, so I needed some resistance bands to do the ongoing strength and physical therapy exercises. I found the Black Mountain band set online here at Amazon and decided to give them a try. So far, so good.

They seem to high quality and they work as expected. No surprises. I went online to the Black Mountain website and found other exercises I can to with the bands that will help round out my home workouts.

Im a happy customer.",5.0
"These bands have been incredible for me over the past 6 months. I have had two kids and can no longer make it to the gym. These add such great variety to my at home workouts that I never get bored. I do beach body workouts now (P90x, 21 Day Fix, Total Hard Corps, etc). There is a wide range of resistance that both my husband and I can both benefit from these. He is getting to the point where maybe a higher resistance one could benefit him a bit more, but overall this is an amazing value starter set and I'd totally recommend! They are used at least 3x a week and have held up great! Do yourself a favor and order these :)",5.0
good quality product,5.0
"This is the 1st time I order / use resistance bands.

Like most people I was hesitant towards swapping my iron weights for bands, but this set of bands give me an amazing work out without having to lug around 300lbs of steel!

I'm really happy with this product and the workouts I'm getting from them.

If you're on the fence about them, just order them already. You won't regret it.",5.0

I've been using these resistance bands for a year now and they're great.  The quality is high and have stood up well over time.  I started using these bands after getting tendinitis and having problems lifting traditional weights.  I was also told that traditional weights can exacerbate my injury and as a result I will only be using resistance bands going forward.,5.0
Great Quality.,5.0
I've used these bands near daily for the last month or so and can say they are a great. They are solidly built and the 'stacking' is very useful. Very easy to change the bands. They arrived quickly and exactly as described. I am very happy with these bands,5.0
Awesome product for greater price!! For those who want to keep fit and don't want big gym machines at home,5.0
These bands are great for at home workouts and for taking with you when you travel. Very easy to use and the suggested moves are really easy to understand. I have likes these bands so far and expect them to last a long time.,5.0
"Love these bands.  Toning and working legs for the first time in many years.  I use a simple weight bench which I place against the door jamb and stack the bands totaling  a fair amount of resistance. I can then do forward and reverse leg curls. Legs feel great. I get a very good range of motion from these bands. Would definitely buy again and will soon be purchasing additional bands to add resistance to my workouts.

Have added cable/band routine to now workout and isolate the outside pectoral muscle (flys), abdominal  crunches and twists for the oblique muscle.  Research weight cable machine workouts and most can be adapted for band workouts.  Love them.",5.0
"Solid product! Solid customer service! Overall, solid company! Truly remarkable customer service experience! As far as product itself, like I said is top notch! As I age, pumping iron becomes like a chore when you're battling with body aches. These bands have been a whole lot easier on my joints and my back. They're very versatile and convenient! Above all, it is quite a spacesaver! I no longer hesitate to incorporate a good workout while my young kids are around. Truly fits in every busy lifestyle!",5.0

The resistance bands work great. I've used bands for the past 5 years and finally needed replacements. These fit the bill perfectly with sturdy metal hooks. The bag is convenient for storage. I haven't used the straps yet but the quality seems sturdy. Great product overall.,5.0
I bought two sets and hooked them to my power cage to pull for butterfly press. They are working nicely. The included straps are right for hooking them to the cage. The weight is right for flys and maybe even ab pull downs.,5.0
"I've been going to a gym for over 20 years on a regular basis and consider myself in very good shape. A situation came up where I no longer had the time to go to the gym but insisted on continuing my workouts. I heard about band workouts but couldn't imagine them better than being in a gym with all the equipment available. None-the-less, due to time restraints I thought a band workout on a temporary basis would at least keep me in good condition. After researching every product I decided to give Black Mountain Resistance Bands a chance. WOW!!! Is all I could say. I was only expecting them to keep me toned but never actually increase my muscle strength. Well I was in for a shock. I did have to buy a few more bands after about a month because they kept increasing my strength. Now I just gave notice to my gym that I am no longer a member. I can get not only the same workout, but a much better one and it's from the comfort of my own home. It saves me about an hour a day between the commute to the gym and then waiting for the proper machines. I consider Black Mountain Bands the best investment in fitness I ever made. Sincerely, Peter Kay",5.0

I injured my lower lumbar pretty bad and it has seemed like any workouts I did with with dumbells would just cause more pain.  With these I am able to do upper body front/back workouts, some core and legs work outs without putting strain on my lower back. I am now on my way to getting back in shape. Thanks Black Mountain",5.0
Really great quality  Buy it,5.0
"This is the first ever resistance-band product I ever bought. I didn't want to spend too much and to be honest didn't do much research.  Having said that, for 20 bucks, this product is a really nice deal.

I have been using it for 2 weeks now and it has worked out pretty good so far.

Pros:
1) well designed - there are bunch of exercises involving various musles I can do with this in safe manner. The convinient handles you see in the picture is a nice bonus. I also liked the ability to exercise
2) good quality bands - band quality is pretty descent and doesn't feel like it will break in between the exercise.

Cons:
1) Documentation - Manuals could be better refined. At this point, they just look like a photocopy of some original documentation. It doesn't go nice with the overall packaging.

Other Observations:
Durability - It's been only 2 weeks so I can't say much on that. It's not really a con, just that I don't have enough data to comment.",5.0

"Beyond happy with these bands. Able to do all my gym workouts without having giant machines and stacks of weights all over my house! I didn't get any sort of kickback for this review I'm just honestly so super happy with them! BONUS... you get a leg strap and a door strap to do any ""cable"" style routines!",5.0
I like these bands for exercising sine I seldom can go to the fitness center because of compressed disks and sciatica. Has been a great way to exercise.,5.0
"I absolutely LOVE these resistance bands. I bought these along with the resistance loops and am totally obsessed! The company shipped super fast and the package even came with a nice little guide that showed the pounds of resistance each band offers. The bands themselves are not flimsy or weak like some others I've tried. These guys are super sturdy, well made, and  really pack A LOT of resistance. After testing them out for 2 weeks I can say I am super happy with my purchase and would recommend Black Mountain Products to anyone who is considering purchasing.",5.0
"I travel 5 days week for work, and was struggling to find a gym each night. These bands are a great supplement when you lack access to gym, or if your in a rush, and need a quick workout at home.

The quality is good. The rubber bands seem durable, and haven't made me nervous about failing under load. The metal carabiners securely lock the bands to the handle, and the handles themselves are comfortable.

The included ankle strap and door loop, for attaching the bands to the hinge of a door, increase the function of the bands, and allow you to recreate many of the exercises performed at a full gym.

Is this a full replacement for a gym membership?  No. However, these are high quality, and are your best bet for breaking a sweat when you're in a hotel or tight on time.",5.0
"I ordered two sets of these.  One for my Wife and one for me.  We both work from home, and we wanted something that we could use while sitting at our desks and or on breaks.  These are great.  Amazing the mini workouts you can do, so glad I got them.  I have come up with all kind of new workouts while working at my desk.  These Bands allow for you to be creative in the way you workout.

I was very impressed with the quality of the bands set.  I was expecting something of less quality for the price, but very surprised.  I would recommend these to anyone.",5.0

"Im super ripped.

kidding. I use this at home when I cant get to the gym that day or at work when I remember to take them.",5.0
"Looks and functions exactly as promised, and appears to be a heavy-duty quality piece of equipment.

For my purposes, I only add or subtract bands between sessions and keep one resistance throughout a single workout. While it's simple to combine bands, it's still more trouble than it is worth for me. During a particular exercise, if I need a little extra resistance, I just stand a little further from the anchor, or for exercise in which I stand on the bands, I just spread my feet further apart.

And if I could handle upwards of 80 pounds I think I would prefer a single band over a stackable set like this. Resistance bands do rub up against you during certain exercises, and when you stack five there's five times as much to rub.",5.0
"Works well with P90X as an option to weights.  Works well for travel when weights would not be available.  Can use more than one band at a time, can use individual bands without the handles for some exercises.  The price was right.  May purchase again to get another set of handles to decrease changeover time when following P90X.",5.0
"The Black Mountain resistance bands are well made and have a great resistance stretch that really forces my muscles to work out and lets me easily vary the strengths with each movement. I have not had any problems with the hooks nor the nylon fabric. I love the 2-4 lb resistance band because I am able to gradually increase the resistance bands weight to stronger resistance bands. They did smell like rubber the first week but not a strong smell, which is wonderful because I am sensitive to smells. My only complaint is that it only has one ankle strap and I have to move it from leg to leg instead of working out both legs at the same time. I love the door anchor, it is so easy to move to the height I need. I also love the handles. They make it so easy to do dynamic moves without having to let go and move my hands to a new position.  Once in a while they will slip into a position where I do not want them but I have not had that problem in the last week.

I am loving my resistance bands. My goal is to increase strength and endurance so I am able to do everything I have been dreaming of the last few years. I was going from being ill for 5 years to stubbornly fighting with determination to get my health, strength and endurance back. The changes were to slow with light weights I was able to use and I was getting frustrated at my little progress of 5 months when I found these resistance bands. I love that they are light weight and very portable yet strong.  The only problem I have had, is when it slipped from under my heel the first day and flew around my head and smacked my forehead. It hit pretty hard and left a huge red welt above my eyebrows but amazingly no bruising or damage. Laughing took a bit of courage to finish the work out but I did it! So now every time I use them I make sure it is secured well and not aimed for my face. In the last three weeks since starting it, to my complete shock and surprise I have gradually moved from the 2-4 lbs to the 2-4 lb and 10-12 lb combined and am ready to move to the black 15-20 lb band on my next work out. Since I started using it each day, I am now able to do 200 oar rows total with it in 30 minutes with 5 minute rest in between each set. I am just astounded what I am now capable of doing. I am able to lift 16lb cat food bags and carry them inside the house. So I know I am getting stronger. I am gaining muscle weight and am finding my clothing is getting looser. I am so impressed with my improvement. It has been hard work but it is so worth it! Three weeks and I am lifting 16 lbs and cannot wait to see what I am able to do in 3 more weeks! Black mountain thank you so very much for creating such a wonderful product that I am able to use every day. It has really helped me improve my life.",5.0
"fantastic system, so flexible, easy to use and you get results. also portable and economical, you can't beat it.",5.0
"I picked up this set of bands because I wanted to be able to work out at home without the expense and clutter of buying a bunch of gym equipment. I'm pretty happy with my choice because I'm getting good workouts and when I'm done it all packs up in the small bag that comes with the kit. Nice and tidy and I'll be able to take it with me when I travel to get the same workouts no matter where I am.

I really like the carabiners on the bands, it makes switching bands quick and easy. The handles are nice and comfortable and feel sturdy in your hands. So far I'm very pleased and I'd recommend these to anyone looking to get a good workout at home or on the road without a bunch of clutter.",5.0
"Exactly what I was looking for. High quality, excellent directions and all in a neat small case that is great for home or travel. Well done Black Mountain Products!",5.0
"I purchased two sets of these bands several weeks ago and have used them 5x per week, twice daily since and they've been nothing but fantastic for what I need & have held up perfectly. I have had shoulder discomfort for the last year from CrossFit and wanted to try out the Crossover Symmetry protocol to rehabilitate my shoulder and already I'm feeling major improvements thanks to these bands.  (One side note, I did purchase a separate door attachment on Amazon so that I could perform the CS exercises as prescribed.)

What really makes these from Black Mountain in particular a great purchase is the wide variety of resistance you get.  Each set comes with five different resistance weights with clasps that easily attach / detach to hand grips, a door attachment (or otherwise) and resistence weights can further be diversified by pairing bands together on the same clasp.  This means as you become stronger with your exercises, you can continue to adjust your resistance accordingly (given this, it's fair to say you won't outgrow the resistance weights).  The included bag is also a nice extra for storing unused accessories or taking bands with you on the go.

Overall, I highly recommended these over more costly alternatives, plus you get far more options!",5.0
I've had these resistance bands for about three weeks now and you definitely get the bang for your buck. Use of the bands is simple and the company gives you a booklet on the numerous exercises one can use with these bands. The best feature is its portability.,5.0
"OMG - This product is terrrrrrrrifffffic. - I get a great workout when I am on the road. I hook it behind the door

"We have been very pleased with our set of exercise bands!
They came in a nice zippered pouch with a hanging loop which makes transportation and storage simple.
The bands themselves are pretty thick, and so far during use seem durable and of good quality.
It's nice that the grip handles are larger so that they accommodate all members of our family for use. Changing the bands has been easy also with a quick carabiner clip!
So far they are a solid product!",5.0

I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now as a part of a daily routine to strengthen my rotator cuff. These resistance bands have worked very well. It is simple to configure between the bands and handles, and there is an overall 'solid' feel to the products.

now that i have seen progress using these for my shoulders, i am looking into expanding my daily routine to include exercises to help my knees.

i am not sure which part of me is going to break next, but i hope it can be helped by these bands!  : )",5.0
"Everything about this was nicer than I expected. The bands are well made with high quality clips, even the bag is nicely made. The door strap is ingenious. Very simple yet effective to hold at the top of the door. My door has a little too much gap at the bottom for it to work there. I had a door gym in the past and found it difficult to put up and take down, because of this the gym stayed up all the time. With this kit it is simple to put up and take down only when I am using it. Very convenient.",5.0

In comparison, this product has much larger and stronger grommets, thicker tubing, and an excellent door attachment strap. Not only is it an excellent product, it is reasonably priced. I highly recommend it.",5.0

The handles are very comfortable and the resistance bands clip on and off easily to add or decrease resistance. I commend your company for producing a quality product that is exceptional and reasonably priced. I hope to enjoy this exercise equipment for many years to come. Thank you Black Mountain Products!,5.0
"The bands have been very good. The quality send very good so far. The handles switch easily between bands, which is nice compared to other bands.",5.0
Quality product.,5.0
"I just bought these for Christmas, and they work very well.  What I like most about this set, is the the quick attach carabiners to easily add or take away resistance bands for quick transitions.  My previous two bands did not have this, and I would have to thread the handles through the loops of all the resistance bands in order to change it, which was a huge hassle.  It comes pretty standard with most attachments to give you a wide range of workout positions and they provide a helpful guide as well.  Note, that I am on the shorter side in terms of height (5'3"") and these bands still work great for me, just a few where I have to hold a bit lower on the handle.  I cannot say in terms of how long they will last, because my previous two bands cracked and became useless, but these bands seem very solid and secure.  I hope they will last a lot longer than my old ones! =)",5.0
"Great resistance bands! I bought these a couple of weeks ago so I could fulfill my new year's resolution to get in better shape. My order arrived in 2 days in perfect condition, and included everything in the product photos. The material quality is obvious -- much higher quality rubber/elastic than a set of medical/therapy bands I used to use. I predict these will last a long time, and after a couple weeks of using them they are still like new. The handles are comfortable and greatly reduce the amount of hand pinching that can occur when using resistance bands. The included exercise booklet/pamphlet is more a collection of photocopies, but it gets the job done with directions and photos for doing leg/arm/chest/core exercises correctly. Each colored band provides a different amount of resistance so it's easy to find an appropriate one for shoulder exercises versus bicep curls. Highly recommended.",5.0
Great product for at home workouts.,5.0
I have used resistance bands as a supplement to weight training for years. These are by far the best quality I have used.,5.0
"Very happy with these resistance bands so far. I am an advanced weightlifter who is working on rehabbing my left arm (triceps/chest) after a herniated cervical disk & nerve injury. The muscle imbalance/nerve injury makes it difficult to control free weights. These bands provide tons of workout variations & the perfect amount of resistance for rebuilding my left arm/chest area. The door anchor is great, I'm 6' 200lbs & have tested its reliability thoroughly. It has not failed one time. The quality of the bands is great & I really like being able to adjust resistance by adding or subtracting a band to the handles. They also work great for those days you can't make it to the gym. You can hit almost all of your major muscle groups, you're only limited by your creativity. The bag it comes with holds everything nicely, so you can take it with you to the gym or while you're traveling easily. Great value for $20, highly recommend.",5.0
These are great and work well on multiple doors. The anchor is sturdy and provides peace of mind that it won't come through the door cracks. Highly recommend,5.0
First started working with resistance bands with my personal trainer.  Had to get a set for myself because I loved it so much. I totally recommend this set to any beginner or intermediate user.  Simple to use and highly effective.  You can get a whole body workout with just this one set!,5.0
Everything came as expected and works great!,5.0
"I'm using this on the road as part of my fitness training. It packs up into a small bag, and I can stow it basically anywhere in my camper van.",5.0
"I receive this 5 band set from my son as a gift.  Let me tell you this is a high quality product unlike some of the cheaply made one I got in the past.  I feel secure and strong yet very effective.  The resistance band is a lot safer to use than free weights for seniors like myself as there is nothing you have to grip and drop and that is the reason why my son bought this for me, ""safer for my dad"".

The set is so convenient to use and very portable.  I usually have it lay around the family room where I normally watch TV and instead of just sitting down I found myself using the band so all is good, exercise while watching TV.

Thanks my son and Black Mountain Products for the outstanding product I am looking forward to receive the promotional orange band.",5.0
"I bought this band set for my husband, and he was very impressed by their quality and ease of use.  We plan to be on Maui for three weeks, and this set fits nicely in the included travel bag which will be packed in our luggage without taking up too much room.  My husband couldn't believe I paid so little for the set, and he's been using it a lot here at home.  The bands look familiar to me insomuch as the colors are used to distinguish weight (or tension) equivalence for each band you use.  (Note: the way it works on Amazon is that only the purchaser can be authenticated so this Review is coming from me, although my husband did most of the testing.)  In any case, these bands are worth buying!",5.0
Work as expected. The elastic bands seem thick and durable. Provides decent weight for casual resistance workout at home.,5.0
"I purchased this resistance band set for two reasons.  First I travel often and do not have access to gyms and needed something to supplement days away from the gym and keeping muscles engaged.  Second, I need a product that was quality.

I just finished a 10 day trip to Latvia and across the entire country this resistance band exceeded my expectations both in functionality and quality.  I leave in 2 weeks for another trip and I am confident this resistance band set will be with me all along the way.

Fully recommend!",5.0
Perfect package of resistance bands.  I love that you can easily attach them to any door and the little booklet of exercises comes in handy.,5.0
"The band quality and design is top notch. The bands have a nice resistance range and the handle carabiners allow you to mix and match the bands to up the resistance as you get stronger.
The best part is the inclusion of the door attachment which easy and fast to use and does not harm the door at all. I use it for ab exercises. Very effective!",5.0
"Fast shipping, and great product!",5.0
"Good bands,  appears durable.  Pleased with my purchased",5.0
Really like these bands. They are great for workouts of various levels,5.0
my personal trainer introduced me to these bands and I wanted a set for home. they're very solidly put together. I'm happy with my purchase and would absolutely buy them again.,5.0
These are great to use as home physical therapy. I recently tore my meniscus. You have to maintain the muscle around your knee  your healed enough for weights again. These did the job. Highly recommend.,5.0
"I workout regularly and have always used dumbbells, but recently learned about the benefits of resistance bands.

I saw the good reviews for this product and the many different resistances so gave it a try. Everything is included to easily use the bands anywhere.

I will now use them with each muscle group to supplement my regular weight training. I use them for burnouts at the end and also injury prevention. This product is great for weightlifters and even can be the sole exercise for others.

Black Mountain Products also has a promotion that agrees to give an additional resistance band with more tension to the customer. I will be sure to update if they actually do or not.",5.0
"I have MS and just recently had hip replacement surgery.  Bought these to do rehab exercises at home.  Find them to be an excellent choice, very helpful.  Worth the purchase",5.0
"This Resistance Band Set is well made and certainly a bargain on Amazon at this price.  My wife bought me the set as a gift through her Amazon account, and I'm very pleased she did.  The handles, resistance tubes and clips are nicely machined, and work easily.  I wanted this primarily for traveling, since everything fits in the included bag.  We are scheduled for three weeks on Maui this year, and the bands will be added to our suitcase to give us an exercise option right in the condo, before we go out to the pool or sightseeing. I'm really pleased with the purchase.",5.0
"I bought one set last Fall, liked it so much, I just bought another one for travel. I do Senior Athletics, and these bands are excellent for pre-competition stretches and warmups, as well as for light workouts while in my hotel room. Hotels often charge $10-$30 for a single spa/workout session. Really cost-effective way to keep toned while travelling and competing. The travel bag is sturdy, zips, and stores almost flat, perfect for suitcase or daypack. Range of motion is virtually unlimited when stretching and strengthening, as are the levels of resistance through combinations of bands. I have used them, literally, in planes, trains, and automobile, as well. My only suggestion to Black Mountain would be to slightly increase the size and shape of the D-rings so the fiber wraps seat flush on the inside edge of the rings, which gives not just a more even wear over time, but re-assures the user that it won't give way during strenous use. An excellent product, used almost daily, both at home and on the road. Highly recommended for seniors for stretches/ strengthening/ workouts.",5.0
These work perfect! I have them hung on the back of my gym room door and I love them!,5.0
"They came as promised very professionally packaged and with all that I got, I feel that it is very good value for the cost.  The bands are very well made with good connection points and I think that they will stand up to the test of time.",5.0
"Great product and exactly what was needed.

I have had bands before and they weren't nearly as nicely made and sturdy as the bands from Black Mountain Products.

It is awesome you can link them to get more weight.

I have used them for a couple weeks and I use them to warm up the rotator cuffs. Some leg work as well.

My wife uses them daily and loves them.

The door stop hasn't failed and seems to be very sturdy too. Great job guys!",5.0
"I love these things. I live in a small New York apartment, and so it's perfect for a small place. I can get the weight I want but also simulate a number of different machines. I work long hours too, and I find it a drag to go to the gym. The bands are high quality, and the set comes with everything you'd need. A steal, for sure.",5.0
"Bought the band and a few other items to build my home gym.

The resistance bands comes in a shoe box size box.  In my hand, it feels a bit like a thick rubber band.  The quality does not feel cheaply made, but there is still a little bit of the factory smell that takes a few days for it to go away.

My initial worry is if I will damage my door.  But so far one month in, I don't see too much damage to the door.  The band hugs the door near the hinge area and holds quite well.  I don't see any issue so far with the band with one month worth of nearly daily usage.",5.0
"The metal clip system works wonderfully, giving me confidence to give the bands a solid stretch without fear. (For comparison, my wife has a much flimsier band that came with a workout DVD. The band is only held in place by a plastic grommet. The first time I tried hers, it came right out of the handle and almost snapped me in the face.)  Also, it's easy to stack the bands to customize the amount of resistance you want for different exercises. The door anchor and leg strap work well together. The only minor complaint I might mention is that a few of the clips do show a bit of superficial rust, but it doesn't affect their function at all.  Very solid set, especially at this price.",5.0
I have used exercise bands in the past and was skeptical at first given the low price of these bands.  My wife and I like them so much that we bought a second set so we don't have to modify when doing our fitness program together.  The quality is high and the handles are super fast and easy to move from one band to another.  The door attachment is also very secure when used at the top or sides of a closed door.  We love the zip up bag that comes with the set as well--really good for stowing everything neatly.  Comes with an ankle band but have not used it yet.  It also appears to be high quality and looks comfortable.,5.0
Good product that is sturdy.,5.0
"Working out very good. Easy to use, many different bands to make it easy for both of us to use (at different times of course). May look for additional pieces in the future.",5.0
Great Quality Product in Neat Package! So easy to set up and use. Packs in very little space. Youtube videos offer a variety of workout options. I highly recommend the Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set.,5.0
"I purchased this product through an Amazon deal of the day and couldn't be happier. All the gear is constructed as described. (very sturdy and strong) My wife and I are both using this at home. It is great because you can take it to any room and work out. It comes with some great exercise diagrams, easy to understand and operate. It contains a surprisingly large amount of resistant weight. And similar to free weights the resistant bands and handles force you to use many other muscles to keep balanced and pull or push the resistance. A great product for anyone at any level of fitness.",5.0
"Loving this band set. I started P90x about a month ago and these are perfect as an alternative to the pull up bar. I would have liked to install a pull up bar, however I rent and am not a big fan of installing things I will need to patch when moving. The door attachment allowed me to still get a great back workout, I just sit on the ground to get a good range of motion and follow along with the video. I am very pleased.",5.0
"In the past I have used other resistant bands, but found the Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set to be the VERY best!  Love the quality of the bands/handles, level of band strengths, and I'm seeing a difference in my muscle tone.  I bought a set for my office and a set for home.  Also found the ""exercise user guide"" helpful.",5.0
"Excersise bands arrived in two days and in great condition. The bands seem to be built very well, but with a lifetime warranty who's worrying. These will allow me to take the gym on the road. Booklet that comes with set has a number of excersices in it and YouTube has many more. The tension of the bands provides resistance at all aspects of each excersise. I would definitely buy again!",5.0
"These are excellent quality resistance bands that work very well.  The included bag makes it handy to store or carry these, and to ensure they all remain together.  The variation in tension among the several bands included is awesome.  It's quick and easy to setup the anchor on any door in the house.  After a quick skim of the instructions to help identify what was what, I was able to attach the anchor to the door in my office and begin working out.  I am looking forward to making these bands a part of my regular exercise routine!",5.0
Absolutely great product. The door anchor and attachments work very well. The bands themselves are also of good quality.,5.0
"These things are great, really high quality for a great price.  I've always had a tough time figuring out solid back exercises at home without the lat pulldown and row machines, these bands make it super easy and convenient.  I also love how you can combine them, my big concern when buying was that I wouldn't be able to get the exact weight I'm looking for but it's easy to mix and match to get it just right.",5.0
"Love the bands, but the manual is of poor quality.",5.0

"I just worked out for the first time using the Black Mountain resistance bands set. The clips were easy to use to change the bands out and the handles were very well made, high quality and comfortable. I'm so impressed with the value! I could have spent 10 times this on the weights I would need to have this kind of versatility. And it all comes in a cute little carrying bag. Will be super easy to take along traveling.",5.0
Great resistance band set! Does what I need it to do and will be great for when I travel. Has many options to get the desired weight.,5.0
Nice product.,5.0
"Been using this for our T25 workouts and it performs great. Definite upgrade over the standard resistance band that came with the workout program. The ease of adding/subtracting weights means that this product is great for multiple users' requirements. Also love that it takes up minimal storage room. We just throw them under the couch after the workout... out of sight, out of mind! These have held up great so far with no loss in resistance or tube breaks.",5.0
Incredibly useful for the business trip to set up and use in your hotel room (or anywhere with a door). Tips/exercise guide was a real help.,5.0
So far so good. Have used them for almost 10 months. They are starting to show some signs of wear. I wish they were thicker for more resistance. I use them on average 4 days a week.,5.0
High quality material for both the bands and hardware. Ecco friendly packaging.,5.0
This is the second time I have purchased these bands so I can have them in multiple locations. They are an excellent value. They are well built and the grips are very comfortable.  I appreciated the pamphlet / guide which denotes each bands resistance. The storage bag keeps everything together so you won't spend time looking for pieces.  I highly recommend them.,5.0
They are going to be getting all my business in the future...they are the best in this business,5.0
I have never had resistance bands before.  They seem to be great quality.  I didn't know what to expect.  I would buy these again if I ever needed to.,5.0
We love these. Just jold our home gym. These do all and more!!!  Thank you.,5.0
Very sturdy. Work well.,5.0
"Quality product and responsive customer service. I would highly recommend to anyone. I have a new baby on the way and wanted to get some basic exercise equipment at home without spending a ton. This resistance band set comes with an easy and secure anchor point that works in any hinge-side doorway. Various strengths too, so you can use them for multiple purposes. I might spring for another set of handles and maybe an extra anchor point.",5.0
This is my second time purchasing resistance bands from Black Mountain Products. They are very versatile for a range of workouts. The set is also perfect for fitting in exercise at home on busy days when it is difficult to get to the gym. I would highly recommend them to anyone!,5.0
"I have had these for about 2 weeks and, overall, I really like them.  I am a long time weight-lifter who was having a hard time getting to the gym recently.  I decided to try resistance bands as a way to work out at home without buying lots of equipment.  The bands and accessories are very high quality and I've really enjoyed using them.  It does take a little while to get used to them from using free weights or machines - but just give it some time and you'll get the hang of it.

 The only negatives are:
-the included booklet of exercises is not great and very low quality.  It's  just a stapled together stack of hard-to-read, photo-copied pages.  I really didn't need the booklet though.  YouTube has hundreds of videos that demonstrate various resistance band workouts.
- the metal clips used to attach the bands to the handles have some very sharp areas.  In fact, I received a  cut while clipping a band on the handle last week.

Despite these negatives, I'm overall very happy with the bands.  Highly recommended.",5.0
"I've been using the resistance band set for several years now and am thoroughly impressed with the quality of the product and the amazing customer service of Black Mountain Products.  You'll be amazed at the workout you can achieve with this simple product--and it takes up practically no space.  In fact, I've taken the bands with me on vacation and was able to keep fit regardless of the adequacy of hotel ""fitness rooms.""  After several years of regular use, 2 of the bands (those I use most frequently) began to fray where they contact the black nylon accessory.  I contacted the company and the representatives were kind and responsive.  Within 2 days, I had replacements bands.  Amazing product.  Amazing Price.  Remarkable customer service!",5.0
"I had never used resistance bands before I purchased these, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I am pleased with the quality and value of this product. I have used all of the bands over the last month. I'm enjoying the variety they add to my fitness routine. My favorite feature is that they are portable so I can take them when I travel. I'm very happy with my purchase and continue to use these several times a week.",5.0

These are great for home and for travel.  They offer lots of resistance options.  They are light and durable.  Highly recommended.,5.0
"This is my second time buying this product.  This a really useful package of bands, especially for the price point.  The packaging seems to have only improved since the previous purchase a few years ago.  I had one band (red) break on me since my original purchase a few years ago, but I put in substantial use with it and it broke where I would step on the bands.  It might have lasted longer if I did not step on them.  The accessories are really nice, allowing you to work out areas you couldn't as well otherwise.  There is a circular cuff you can attach to your leg and a piece you can use to stretch the bands from a door jam.  These are all really helpful; but the door jam accessory might slip out if you are using it on a door where there is greater space/flexibility.  All together, I am really happy with this product -- it has helped me get good workouts in while being compact.",5.0
What an awesome product. I kinda wished I knew about this sooner. The workout guide has plenty to work all areas. Highly recommended,5.0
"What a simple and effective way to work out. The bands are so easy to clip on and off-- And being able to double them made it easy to find the exact amount of resistance I wanted for my workouts. I have a gym membership but with kids it's hard to get there, so these bands have made finding time to workout at home very easy. I even took them on vacation with me over the holidays. Highly recommend!",5.0
"I ordered this for my husband to assist him with stretching and exercise. While he uses it primarily for his stretching, he is very enthusiastic about this product. It is good quality, durable, the handles are strong and give him confidence while he stresses the bands. He highly recommends this very helpful aid to exercise.",5.0
Works well with stretching and with resistance. Really enjoy my work outs.,5.0

The overall packaging and way this set is put together is pretty nice. The band's are solid and connections are very secure. The adjustability is very nice by just clipping bands together for different resistance combinations. The bag it comes in is very handy to keep all the parts together. I only wish the under-door anchor was a little wider. It slipped out but only on one door in the house. My wife has had much more success than I have with this. It is nice for an intense workout and can be used for a huge range of exercises. We will most likely be buying another set.,5.0
Best product ever! I usually sit and waste time at work waiting for customers but now I waste time toning my body. The bands are super sturdy and they give a ton of resistance.,5.0

"This is a comprehensive kit to get started with resistance bands, including the door anchor and ankle strap for attaching the bands to. The soft handle detachable grips are nice and comfortable. Some kits I had considered before finding these had handles permanently attached to each colored band - initially seemed a benefit to have more handles but I quickly realized the detachable handles give you far more flexibility to combine resistance bands for more than the 5 individual resistance levels and attach the bands to different anchoring options.",5.0

I just received these a couple days ago.  I am doing physical therapy and was using the bands that they sent home with me which were a pain.

Used nearly every day.  At 72 yrs old it doesn't over stress old and tired muscles.  Can choose the band that meets your needs.  Worth the price.,5.0
"Great value, easy to adjust.  If these last for 3 or more years, I'll be very well pleased.",5.0
"What I really liked when I first got the set is that I realized how easy it was going to be to store all of it, and it wasn't going to take up much space.  I wouldn't think you could use just these and become the next Dwayne Johnson, but I think it is a good set to supplement what you already do, and you can always take it to work with you.  They seem to be decently made, only time will tell if they hold up and keep their tension.  I bought these because my son is into sports, and a guy giving him lessons in baseball showed how using a resistance band really builds up shoulder and arm muscles, so that he can get more velocity with his pitches...not to mention it makes your arm stronger to help avoid injuries.  If you are looking for a set to just get in a workout wherever you are (work, travel/business trip, etc), these should do the trick.",5.0
This is a great product for the price.  Can combine bands to make heavier resistance.  Good strong hardware snaps are easy to use.  Everything fits in the bag too.,5.0

Sure I could use the hotel gyms, but sometimes they are pretty busy. I usually take this with me in my checked bag, but have been able to fit this in to my carry on with 7 days worth of clothing. Everything fits nicely into the bag it comes with. If you don't need all the bands, then you can leave some of them at home and clear up a little more space in your bag. I had been eyeing this set for awhile now and I'm glad I finally made the choice to purchase it.",5.0
"Awesome bands, great quality items.  Door Anchor is great and you can get all excersise done with these bands. The only reason I ordered these bands are because i used them at a gym at work, I saw the Black Mountain name brand and searched on Amazon after using it for few weeks and loving them.  Comes with a nice travel bag so you can always take it with you wherever you go.  With these bands I am now able to perform full body workout at home and saving driving time and saving tons of space for equipments. I have tried few different brand bands, but the quality and the workmanship is by far much much better on these bands then any other bands.  The door anchor is pretty easy to setup, and from what it looks like so far, it is very safe and will not  cause any damage to door frames. Comes with all the possible excersise chart with easy to follow instructions.  Great product. I would highly recommend it to all.",5.0
I was impressed with the quality and ease of use with this product. It came with everything you would need for a home gym exercise. Since I don't have much space to work with this kit is perfect. It is easy to setup and offer a wide degree of effective work out.  I am very satisfied with this product thus far.,5.0
"Absolutely Amazing Product 10/10

"I keep them in my workout area.  They are super easy to swap out, tuck into the door or pull off of the door for independent use.  I love that it came with a strap to use with a door.  I keep the instructions with the colors/weights close at hand.",5.0

My physical therapist recommended these to me after he bought them. These are the best bands out there at the best price! They come with everything you need.  High quality!,5.0
I wanted to add a core & strength workout a few times a week and did not want to store a full weight set or go to the gym.  These have been great.  They come with handles that easily clip to the bands and have and ankle strap and door stopper piece.,5.0
"These bands are great! I needed some to do my physical therapy exercises since the cheap bands they let you keep from the physical therapy place break pretty quickly. These are more than enough. Plenty of different resistances to choose from. I especially love the door anchor. It's quick and easy to anchor the bands at any height.

I've also started using them in my weight training routine. It's easy to add multiple bands together to gets lots of resistance. I really like the system they employ here with the detachable handles and the door anchor and ankle attachments. You can get a ton of different uses out of these bands for every exercise you need.

The only bad thing I can say about them is that they can be too long for some exercises if you don't have a lot of space. But there are ways around that like looping the band through the door anchor extra times.",5.0
Terrific product for physical therapy treatment from the comforts of your own home.,5.0
"Great price for a great set of bands, perfect for traveling workouts on the go!  Lightweight but durable, will update if any of the bands break but so far so good!",5.0
Bought for my son for Christmas. He has been using it regularly for his work outs and I can already notice more definition in his shoulders. He said the bands change easily and he likes the carry pouch. He can throw it in his backpack and take it to school to use in the weight room. A great find and a great buy.,5.0
Great product.  Use for stretching and warming up.  Had a shoulder injury so used it as a scale to push presses.  They worked great!,5.0
Excellent product and quality. well worth the price. Multiple resistance bands are perfect for any workout. Very easy to move from one exercise to the other,5.0
Need basic knowledge of exercises but this is excellent workout for the money.  I prefer to TRX!,5.0
"I have purchased several sets of workout bands throughout the years and at some point all of them have either frayed to the point where I no longer felt safe using them or simply snapped. The BMP bands on the other hand seem very sturdy from my experience with them thus far. I have tested their elasticity by putting them through a range of workouts including the P90X system (which they work fantastically for).

I really appreciate the design that allows you to easily utilize multiple bands at once so that you can vary the weight/resistance based on the exercise and intensity level that you are looking for. Overall I have been using these for about a month now and can say that they have performed admirably in that time. I look forward to continuing to use them and hope that these will last longer than my last set of bands.

Pros: Quality material, multiple bands/resistance levels for customization, reasonable price, good customer service
Cons: N/A, TBD",5.0
"I got these to be able to perform a full-body workout without having to get a full dumbbell set or one of those expensive adjustable dumbbell sets. These really work well for that use. These are definitely the most well-made exercise bands I've ever used. Usually when using exercise bands, I have this fear that the thing will break and smack me in the face. Not with these! They have big grommets and carabiners holding them together. Also, the door anchor is well designed, easy to setup, and won't cause any damage to door frames. Great product.",5.0
Great to have when traveling or doing at home workouts. You have everything you need. Great quality.,5.0
My wife bought this for me for Christmas.  These are high-quality bands and attachments.  I am using them every day.,5.0

Great for my shoulder rehab,5.0
I have been using the bands for about three weeks now. A great purchase. Very versatile!,5.0
"Great Set of Resistance Bands.  I did my homework on various bands, and these bands are, bar none, the very best.  My initial concerns, before my purchase, was durability.  With reports of unfortunate accidents from a band snapping and causing injury, I wanted to reduce that occurrence by looking for quality over price.  In my opinion, the construction of the bands is great.  The interchangeable handle set is comfortable and the door frame anchor works well.  Beyond the bands, customer service is unbelievable.  This company takes pride in its product and, most importantly, customer satisfaction.  I highly recommend the product.",5.0
"The set includes bands of 6 different strengths. The weakest strength is perfect for therapy for someone who is dealing with a tear in the biceps tendon in the rotator cuff area (the reason I bought the set). The weakest band, however, is too weak to be of much use for a male that is uninjured and physically fit. The bands step up in strength gradually so that the strongest (red) band can really give you a work out.

The soft grip handles are well constructed, comfortable and can easily be clipped and unclipped from the bands. The door anchor works fine as well. All the parts are solidly constructed.",5.0
I brought them with me to my session with my personal trainer. He was impressed with the quality of the product. We worked on some different things we could incorporate into my workout.,5.0

This is the second set of bands purchased for my son as his workouts now require two bands that have the same weight. These bands are very well-made and my son says they're very comfortable to use with the provided handles. He says the handles easily clip to the bands making it very convenient to either add another band for extra weight or completely change weight to a different color band. We are both very pleased with this product.,5.0

"Use the bands for all kinds of exercises. Daughter bought an additional set for traveling  and use in  hotels without a gym,",5.0
Love this set of resistance bands.  Easy and fun to use.  Had back issues from time to time especially on golf trips.  Have been using these to strenghten and tighten my core.  There are literally hundreds of exercises you can do with these or I sometimes just improvise.  Best features are the ability to easily swap bands and the door anchor point which is simple to use.,5.0
"I received these as a Christmas gift.  I work in the medical field 7 days on, so I was looking for something  to supplement my workouts when I can't get to the gym.  I am really impressed with the quality of these bands. I have incorporated them into my regular workout even when I can get to the gym. You can't go wrong with these bands, they are very high quality and very sturdy.  I am super pleased with the bands.  They sure have come a long way.  Enjoy!",5.0
"Great Product. The bands are high quality as are the attachment ends. Simple to use, extremely portable, stackable weight resistance, numerous ways to attach the non gripping end to doors, poles, etc. Can't really ask for more than that. Buy with confidence.",5.0
"There are cheaper bands out there, but I'm glad I splurged a little with these. High quality. I love these bands and all of the accessories it comes with, makes it easier to get a variety of workouts in. I would like them to be labeled of which band is what weight, so I don't have to read the guide every time. But I took a sharpie pen and wrote the weight on each band.",5.0
I really like this item.  I bought it to just tone up some and do some basic strength work.  Before I bought these I was not able to do any pull ups.  Now I am able to do 5 in a set LOL.  I know that's not a lot but it does show these work in helping progress strength.  It is easy to use and comfortable.  I would recommend them and would buy again.,5.0
"LOVE THEM! I am very satisfied with this set. I thought it was going to be easy to use them but they are harder than they look. I use them in combination with free weights to ass resistance without having to go super heavy because I workout at home and the floor isn't made for extreme heavy weights. These work perfectly for home gym Interval training and Functional training. I'm still trying to figure out a way to attach them to my T-Bar rower. Gears are turning, I'll figure it out. ;)
Good stuff Black Mountain Products! Excellent product and made well.

1/7/2017 update
I figured out a way to use them with my T-bar rower. I connect the Bands to themselves then loop around the bar wrap a towel around the bar to keep the RB from sliding then step on the RB on the floor.
I tested two 15 lb. dumbbells with the green band (10-12 lbs) and I could barely get 3 reps! I am going to enjoy these RBs wholeheartedly!
Thank you again, Black Mountain!
Oh yeah, there is an orange band promotion that I can call and get a FREE orange (35-40) band to add to the set! Calling in the Morning. :)
Very happy with this product!

update 1/9/17
I have my FREE orange RB coming from Black Mountain and I also bought the Purple RB (45-50 lbs.) as well. I now have plenty of resistance for using them for my functional training home gym.
I actually want to buy one more complete set and the few additional RBs so I can do even more with them as well as combining them with free weights.
The gentleman on the phone when I ordered my free orange RB was awesome. Great customer service!

Update 10/09/2017
I bought a second set along with two atomic green (70-75) bands. Fantastic training tool. I found several videos for using RBs and I love it! I now have four handles, two ankle straps, and two door anchors so I can double up on stuff like ""heel to hand"" for hamstrings or I can set up to do more than one exercise without having to change everything in between sets. Now I just need one more Orange and one more Purple to complete the second set. Later I want to also buy the Loop Resistance band set.
Amazing products and amazing company. ten stars

Update 1014/2017
Bought the last of the two RBs I needed to complete my second set. (the Orange and Purple RBs). Very Happy about this product and their additional RBs.",5.0
Very versatile workout kit and packs in a nice small kit. Great for traveling and stores in small areas.,5.0
These bands are perfect for me to use for home or at work.  The case makes it easy to transport and keep it organized.  I'm even getting my coworkers to buy them too.,5.0
I have just started using this product but love them so far. I especially like the bag to keep them organized in when I'm alternating workouts. I'm not new to strength training but can tell these are working by the tenderness my muscles feel from working new areas and different ways.,5.0
"This set of resistance bands are very useful for working out at home. I purchased this product trying to establish a routine of working out in the morning to get ready for the day, since I usually feel sluggish in the morning after waking up and I cannot be productive for a long time. This set is great because I can adjust the tension level to fit different parts of the muscle I want to work on and the door anchor is extremely useful. I can slid it in my walk in closet door right in my bedroom and the process takes less than 5 seconds to insert the door anchor. I think the product is great for the price.",5.0
"I am  a triathlete. I have worked out with the bands and love them. The price is great too. I can do a multitude of exercises with them. I like this type of equipment because the more you stretch the band, the higher the resistance which give a different workout than free weights. I would recommend these to anyone.",5.0
"great set, well constructed",5.0
"I feel the quality of this product is top notch.  Over many years I have used other brands of Resistance Bands and have had them snap on me during a workout.  I feel the materials and build quality of this product is better than the other bands that I have purchased from the Big Box stores.  I am very impressed with the accessories that come with this kit.  The hardware used for attachment feels and looks rugged and of good quality.  You can use a door attachment to anchor, this allows you to work so many more muscle groups and perform moments I didn't think were possible with resistance bands.  Its like a the Total Gym in a bag.  There is an instruction booklet that explains the use of the product and adapters.",5.0
These are wonderful!,5.0
i ordered for my son he is 14 and he loves it. it was not messed up like other comments. it was all in perfect condition. and he got a good workout. he LOVES the door loop,5.0
"I wanted to added resistance bands to my workout routine (as I age, I seem to need more variety). I have been using these for about two weeks--so far they seem to be of excellent quality with no indication of wear (but it has been only two weeks). It is easy to switch the bands/handles and the attachment alternatives are simple and functional. Not a ton a bells and whistles--but then I'm not certain how bells and whistles would help what is supposed to be a simple product. Good value especially for the price.",5.0

Band and grommet construction is very solid.  I got these to travel with and keep in the RV for trips.  Plenty of weight to get a workout in.  Not a bad purchase.  I was lucky that I got them as a lightning deal.,5.0
Received in good packaging in timely manner.  Every band works great. The elastic band workout is awesome and helps muscles to retain it's elasticity.,5.0
"This is a great product, very similar to those found in a professional gym.  The bands and fasteners are sturdy.  The grip attachments snap on and off easily.  I have used it a few weeks now and the range of resistances seems to be a good fit for keeping a conditioning routine going after physical therapy.",5.0
I have had this product for over a year now and love it! I use this with my clients training in their homes all the time. The door mount is very easy to use and works great. The handles are easy to change and nothing is really showing any wear and tare. If you are looking for resistant bands with multiple uses either for yourself or to use as a pro this is the product to get!,5.0
I have used the resistance band set now for about a month and I love it. I bring it with me when I make overnight traveling at work. Some hotels do not have exercise rooms so the resistance bands help me work out when I am away from my gym.  They are easy to fit into my luggage.  The variability in resistance of the bands make them very versatile to use.  The product is well designed for it's purpose and I expect it to last for a long time.,5.0
"Love these, so easy to use and to the handles change out quickly to allow you to keep up with your workouts without long interruptions.  One improvement would be to add the weight resistance onto the bands so you don't have to keep checking the reference guide.  Other than that love these!",5.0
"Must have for home workouts, multi types of exercises can be done with either using the door or exercising freely with the resistance bands.",5.0
"I've been wanting to get into better shape.  And due to my schedule, I cannot do it in a gym.  I need to be able to carry my equipment and be mobile.  Free weights are great, but your tied to your house because it would be cost prohibitive to load them into a carry on luggage.  I'd seen glowing reviews for the resistance bands, so I took the plunge.  I selected BMP, because of the quality most people were talking about.  Though I see most resistance products have fairly high marks as well.

I'm using these mostly for curls, and I can feel the resistance.  It's not a gimme set, your having to work for it like if you were doing dumbbell curls.

So, now my regime includes push ups, crunches, squats, and these resistance bands for my curls.  All exercises I can take with me anywhere that I go, and it's not cumbersome to carry.",5.0
Wonderful Set! Very great construction and I use them every day! Would recommend these to everyone who wants to work out. Amazing set for an amazing price!,5.0
Bought these for use in our home gym.  I use them daily and I've had them for a little over a month.  N quality issues.  It's a great product and similar to the bands I used at physical therapy just a lot cheaper.  One band did arrive to me damaged.  Called the company and it was swiftly replaced free of charge.,5.0
this comes in handy especially for a baseball player,5.0

This is a really nice set of resistance bands with comfortable handles.  They change out quickly with easy snap attachments.  I'm impressed with the material use and the range of weight resistance.  A good buy.,5.0
"Item arrived today and I used it right away.  It shipped very nicely and everything arrived in perfect working order.  The bands seem to be of good quality when I used them and the door anchor worked great.  You need to put the anchor on the hinge side of the door (explained in instructions).  Although if you were on the side where the door opens away from you I guess it would work anywhere.

I am very happy with this product as it gives me a way to exercise without carrying weights (I live in an RV travelling full time).  The carrying bag makes storage simple and I can just pull out the set already assembled, put it in the door, and be up and running in just a minute.",5.0
"Recently received the resistance bands as a gift for Christmas.  I will admit I was a bit hesitant on the resistance bands not being as strong as they claimed to be.  I was wrong! I can definitely feel the resistance.  Stacking with multiple resistance bands, I have experienced a few challenging upper body workout experience. Great product for anyone looking for variety in the workout routine.",5.0
Product came as described and works well at home using the door attachment. I researched a few brands before buying and this was the best for the $$!,5.0
"As a frequent traveler, I spend a lot of time in hotels. Most of the time, the fitness centers are pretty good. Some, however, don't quite deliver. I have used these bands in the tightest of rooms and there is not much I cant do with them.

I purchased these bands based on colleagues suggestions to get fitness bands. Although no one recommended a particular band, I bought these based on reviews on Amazon.

The kit comes with 5 bands of different intensities, 2 handles, one door anchor, one ankle strap and a carrying bag. Each band can be linked together to make varying weight between 2 lbs. to 75 lbs.

The bag dimensions are approximately 12x6, but leaves ample room for additional bands or straps if desired. The bag takes up 1/8th the size of a carry-on piece of luggage.

The included directions aren't very clear, as they are photocopies. Clearer and much more varied exercises are posted on the companys website [...]. I would highly recommend checking that out and printing them off from the site.

Like any exercise, you should be familiar with what you are doing. Although resistance bands are great, the exercises using these bands are kind of Jerry-rigged. Not knowing what you are doing can lead to serious injuries. If you are new to weight lifting or resistance training, I would recommend using stationary machines first so you know what a certain exercises feels like. Then when it comes to using these bands you know what you should be feeling.

Using these bands, the natural feeling is that these bands are going to snap in my face. After doing a few intensive workouts, stretching these bands out pretty hard gave me confidence that these bands are in fact very durable. I would inspect them before each workout to make sure there are no tears, just in case.

I highly recommend these bands, as they are very versatile with an endless amount of exercises. The fact you can travel with these without adding much weight is a huge plus for the road warrior.",5.0
"I bought this set for my Dad as a gift, he really likes them so far! Says he feels like he gets a pretty good workout, thinks they help with flexibility, and he doesn't feel like he is at risk of an injury when using them (history of shoulder/elbow problems from years of sports). All and all, bands have been a good purchase so far!",5.0
"These are very well-made. I needed something easier to transport than dumbbells, and these fit the bill perfectly. They provide a low impact workout that's perfect for rehabilitating my shoulder  it's been out of commission for several months and these have been great for building up my strength again. The detachable hand grip is a great addition too; makes it easier for storage and for working out. I always hated the bands without a grip (the ones you might get from the doctors office... they felt cheap and it was harder to utilize). I love these bands. I use them every day.",5.0
"LOVE these resistance bands!  We recently remodeled our basement, turning half of it into a home gym.  While my husband is highly into working out, I'm not the most eager but I know it is important as we age to keep as strong & healthy as possible.  I have a stationary bike, treadmill, 5-30 lb weights, weight bench, kettle bells, bosu ball...you name it we have it either inside the finished basement or outside garage (his space).  Until I received my resistance bands, I was just going through the motions of working out & hoping it was over fast.  I love the bands come in a variety of strengths, colors, workout guide with photos, all needed accessories & handy bag.  My husband installed hooks to hang them in order, making it easier to quickly grab & use so my workout time flows smoothly.  Let me say, they work!  The day after my first use, I was sore in places I thought I was working out but apparently was not.  I love I can install the door anchor at any height, to accomplish different goals.  These are actually fun, yes FUN to use.  When you travel, you can take them with you so no excuses there.  There are so many ways to use them & you are not limited to standing by a door frame either.  My husband has one resistance band & has said many times, mine are VERY nice.  One exercise I have the most difficulty with is squats (with weights).  My left knee wants to tweak.  I can do squats with the bands, placing the door anchor at top of doorframe & have no trouble doing squats plus it feels like I'm working areas out I wasn't before.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase.",5.0

The included ""door anchor"" makes it easy to do chest, arm, back, shoulder, core, or leg exercises.  Also light and portable enough for me to take with me when I travel. Highly recommended, thanks!",5.0
"These resistance bands are perfect for anyone because they come with bands of all different ""weights"". Set up is easy and the bands are all very durable. One thing that would be nice is if the weight of each band was written somewhere on the band so you could easily pick it out without checking the instructions.",5.0
"I have been working out for a few weeks with these bands and they are fantastic. They are super high quality, Thick rubber, and comfortable handles. Stop looking and just buy these, there top notch and reasonably priced. ***** plus if you have a problem and call there customer service number, a person picks up the phone!!! And they English clearly!",5.0
"Thanks for a great product.  Simple, compact and drop dead simple to use.  I bought these resistance bands so I could work out when traveling.  I discovered that they are perfect for a solid, low impact workout while camping.  You can get really creative with them and connect them to almost anything.  A quick trip to the hardware store gave me even more options for connecting them.  I really worked up a sweat and being able to attach and remove the number of bands used, provided me with ability to use the bands as a cardio tool as well as for strength training.  I was able to increase my heart rate by incorporating them into my workout as a circuit training tool, switching from resistance training to cardio quickly. Not only will I use these while traveling to maintain my fitness training, I plan on using them at home to add variety to my workouts.",5.0
"Just recently started working out home since I can't find time to hit the gym. I have trained with resistance bands before as part of fitness program, so was quite aware of my how a product needs to stand up to the rigor of full body exercises. After I received Black Mountain resistance bands just in a few days, I was completely impressed by it. It holds up well, the construction is solid, especially love the grips. The bands hold form well, no cracks or any such deformity. Overall love the product and so happy that I'm able to hit various muscle groups working at home. Would have loved if the company also sold something like a laminated workout sheet that is very handy for home workout sessions. Great job, Black Mountain on a quality product!",5.0
Nice product for home use.,5.0

"We just received these bungees and they work really well, are very reasonably priced, and have a lifetime warranty--what's not to like?!  If I ever need another set of these I will definitely be purchasing them from Black Mountain!",5.0
"Very well made, and the travel bag and exercises are an added benefit.  I had only one problem, which I assume any band set would have, wasthe odor from the rubber, which was exceptionally strong for a week or so.  It is better now, but still smells a bit.  I do have a strong sensitivity to all types of odors, so it is possible the odor is not as bad as I have experienced.",5.0

Super convenient and easy to carry, pack, unpack, etc. Takes up very little room in my bag and at home. Would definitely recommend these.",5.0
somehow my set of these got tossed and i cant even describe to you how much i miss these things! its winter and theres no where to go and nothing to do so i need to do something in the house and these really helped to keep me busy and build strength at the same time. I've dropped a dress size. I will be buying these again the moment i get some money again!,5.0

Like the length of the bands.  It makes doing curls and other exercises where you step on the band easier.  The ability to combine bands makes it easier to get the desired resistance.  This helps me with my physical therapy on my shoulder.  I have a set I bought several years ago and I like this set better.  The bands are longer by several inches and the bands are easier to combine with the new handle/band connection.,5.0

"I have  several sets of band, I like the Black Mountain bands the best. They really  strong  resistance. I have used them with the  illustrations it came with.
And with the Beach Body  program, Black Mountain bands work the best.
You won't go wrong  purchasing  this set.
They are by far the best set of bands I own!",5.0

"I've used these a few times now and have still yet to discover their full potential, but so far I am very pleased. I mainly purchased these as an assist to increase my reps on my home pull-up bar and they have helped tremendously. Back exercises are one of the few workouts that I have not been able to truly unlock with my home system, but these have been the saving grace. Not sure if this assist method is even an intended use, but it works well for my exercise routine. I've also found them useful for replacing dumbbells and barbells to switch up my routine and provide some needed variety to my workouts.",5.0
"Excellent quality and value for the price, provides a surprisingly good workout, highly recommend.",5.0
"Great product , very helpful to rehab shoulders .",5.0
"everything about the product is great. it easy to switch the different bands, the door accessory its an incredible and simple bonus. band all hold great and easy to store everything back inside the bag. the only thing that i could say they can improve on is the locks for the bands. because when you are pulling on them if they move near the lock they can actually pop open the lock and come out. has only happen once so far. have been using them for over a month now.",5.0
"I love these.  Bundle them all for good resistance.  I mean yeah it's not a bench press with 300+lbs of resistance but super
great to get there if you want it.  Good quality and well packaged.",5.0
These are exactly what I was looking for. I use them with a closed bathroom door. Love that you can stack them to get even more use out of them. I kept forgetting which color meant what so a  label of some sort wouldn't have been a bad idea from the manufacturer. Arrived on time and was well packaged in a little carrying drawstring bag.,5.0
I have had these bands for a while now and I love them they will give you the workout of a lifetime also I love how u can take them with you anywhere u go I recommend for everyone who loves a good workout to buy them !!,5.0

"I purchased one of these several months ago and it still looks and works like it did when it was new. I had to order another one so two of us could work out at the same time, and I could increase the resistance more when needed.",5.0
"On the road again, but this time with a bad tennis elbow. My PT specialist recommended that I purchase bands to take to the hotel. Guess what? These are the perfect travel companions. Hooked up on the closet door making them accessible all the time. Just the right amount of strength for all people. A must for travel folks!",5.0
Good product and a great value! I was about to buy some very expensive bands until a friend referred these to me. I am happy with this product and I hope they can help me on my road to shoulder recovery!,5.0

"They've been able to do it.  Quality product, right combination, and a great price.  I've been looking to change up my workout and I thought my next step was going to require a gym membership.  However, after finding this product, I've brought the gym with me.  The high quality equipment allows me to increase and add additional types of resistance training to my routine because of the products options.  The carabiner  style clasps allow me to add a number of bands to the handles without having to hold everything separately. The included ""door anchor"" gives me the option to do chest, arm, back, shoulder, core, or leg exercises which previously would require gym equipment to engage. This is also light and portable enough for me to take with me when I travel.  Highly recommended.",5.0
"This is the third set of these I have purchased, not because they do not last, but because I travel a lot overseas, and I leave a set in two places I travel to often. They are well constructed, comfortable, strong and versatile. You can not beat the value... you get a great set of resistance bands at a good price.",5.0
already used a lot. innovative positioning required. Works,5.0
Liked the product. Fits perfectly on the door. There are so many permutations and combinations it can be used for different types of exercises. The product is perfect but the buyer should know to use it as well,5.0
"Easily portable, now I can take 50+ lbs of weights anywhere, and store them in my desk drawer when not in use. This set is sturdy and well made, the colors make for quick identification. It comes with a booklet that shows some common exercises to get started. All-in-all, it's the most versatile and convenient weight training apparatus I can think of.",5.0

"I've had a set of these and recently purchased a 2nd set.  They're great.  They're not perfect, but as far as other band products in this range go, these are probably as good as it gets.  The ability to stack the weight on these bands really makes these stand out from other bands out there.  Here is how I use these:

==Cardio==

-Resistance for doing punching movements, over the head movements, etc - greatly increases core, shoulder, & tricep/bicep activation(depending on how its held).  I recommend checking out Tapout XT & Tapout XT2 for many movements and how to do this.

-Anchor the bands under your feet and hold the bands over your head while doing squats

-Several other creative ways to incorporate bands to increase cardio & muscle activatio

==Muscle Building & Hypertrophy==

That's right, you can really build muscle with these!  If you have no weights and want to work on building muscle, then these are a great replacement to start using.  Have weights and don't think you need these?  Think again.

-You can use the bands themselves like you would for regular weights for most muscle building exercises.  The big difference is that resistance bands have a different strength curve than weights, so you work your muscles in different ways  (at the end of the rep, the resistance will be the greatest, whereas regular weights will either be constant or decrease)

-You can combine weights and bands together in a single movement (holding the band & weight, or have the band anchored on the weight) to increase the resistance and difficulty of an exercise (ex. regular dumbell curls are hardest when your arm is at 90 degrees, band curls are hardest at the top of the curl, holding a dumbell and band together with the band anchored in front of you makes the whole thing hard from beginning to end).

-With the door & pole anchors, you can use these bands like you would any cable machine at the gym.  I recommend buying 2 sets of bands, or getting a different option that includes 2 pole anchors and matching pairs of bands to get the most out of this option.

I've used Athlean X/X2 for a lot of tricks on using bands in my weight lifting routine (check him out on youtube)

These bands are super quick to stack on, just clip the carabiner to the handle.  It takes seconds to add/remove bands.  To fine tune how much resistance you want, you can also step closer/farther away from the anchor point.

The included pole anchor works great and is very handy.  Having 2 of these (from the 2 orders of the product) makes for a good cable machine substitute since I will anchor these to the poles on my squat rack (I have the base of the squat rack weighed down by a couple of 70 lb dumbbells to make sure it doesn't move).

The handles work great.  They have hard plastic handles with soft foam on the outside to make them nice to grip.

The only downside to this package is the door anchor.  It doesn't seem to be very forgiving if there is a tiny gap in the door.  Other bands that I've used with a door anchor have a larger, harder foam piece about 1"" square so that if there is a gap in the door, it won't easily slid through.

The only thing I wish about these bands is that they would build in a fail safe.  I've seen other bands that have either a nylon sleeve on the outside (expensive bands), or some sort of rope on the inside so that if a band happens to break, it won't come snapping back at your face.

PSA: always check your bands to see if there are any cuts/fraying.  When they fail, they fail quickly and it hurts!",5.0
"I've started to use the bands and find them easy to use, most of all they so adjustable as to how much resistance you want. I like that I can take them out and exercise whenever I want to. I don't sleep much due to a medical condition so it is easy for me to open the bag at 2Am 3 Am in the morning and do a quick set of  the exercises, or I can set a time each week where I can go ingo a almost unlimited number of exercises with this set of exercise bands from Black Mountain Products.
They had a promotion where the customer could get a free band to add to the set, I didn't get mine and I didn't hear back from Black Mountain Products. I continued to contact them and it was a simple problem, they never received my original email.

They didn't waste one second they simply asked for my mailing address and sent me out the free band. I highly recommend these exercise bands from Black Mountain Products.  I will be buying more accessories to add to my current set, I can't express enough the quality of the bands as well as the support you get Black Mountain Products.

They also have a great website that has help on what exercises to do and how to do them, to me that is a big plus. They don't sell you exercise bands and then disappear, they are there 24/7 to help with examples of which exercises you can do and how to do them. You can chose from upper body, lower body or muscles groups. They also give you help if you are using the bands for Yoga or Abs.",5.0
"These bands work very well for resistance training.  I use them for P90x, have one of them attached to a chin-up bar connected to floor joists in my basement for pull-up type resistance, and use combinations of other bands rather than weight sets.  I find the variation of the different colors perfect for whatever type of exercise I'm trying to do, and can even combine different colors for even more resistance.",5.0

"I've had a set for over a year. Use them 3-4 times a week. They wore down, but since they're relatively inexpensive I got a new set. Both sets are great quality. Not sure why they went with fat handles though on the second set?",5.0
These bands are very well made. Being able to attach different bands together allows you to use a variety of resistance which works great when working different muscle groups.

"This is a great product.  I have a rotator cuff problem in both shoulders.  So, I was looking for a set of resistance bands that would give me a mild to moderate work out.  The yellow and blue bands are perfect for my needs.  They are just the right tension.  Furthermore, changing the bands is a snap.  The grips are great, too, and the entire set can be packed in the zippered bag that is included with the purchase.  There are many band sets available.  I think I made the best choice!",5.0

Just what I wanted.  Just got out of physical therapy and therapist recommended that I get these bands.  Very good quality and easy to use.,5.0
"As a person who was looking for new work outs to challenge themselves, I had a personal training session and we used bands similar to these. After my session I knew immediately that I wanted my own set so I could do the work outs at home. These bands have been amazing, great to use for work outs whether it's arms or abs or anything, I'm always sore the next day. I look forward to getting to continue to use these great resistance bands and see what other work outs I can incorporate them into.

"Oh man I should've gotten these bands whenever I started working out. They are great alternative for pulls up, especially if you have wrist issues. The quality of the bands are 100 percent. I love how the handles hook on the bands, other bands don't have that option like the resistance bands from beach body. I will purchase other products from Black Mountain again. I feel so strong!",5.0
"I was suspicious when I first opened the package because they were on the lighter side (in terms of actual weight) but you definitely get the resistance you need with them.

The grips are strong the foam lets you get a great grip on them even without gloves. Highly recommended!",5.0
"I suffer from degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis, among other back problems.  I've always worked out and kept in shape.  Since my back condition has worsened, my dr recommend that I stop lifting heavy weights and try using different exercise bands.  I've been using these BMP resistance bands for several weeks.  I absolutely love them.  They are very convenient to use, especially if you travel.  I can adjust the amount of weight or resistance by the color of the bands .  I use the bands to do a variety of exercises, in place of swinging my heavier iron.  Great for building strength by doing more reps with less weight.  I highly recommend this company, as well as, these bands.",5.0
Great for home workouts.,5.0
I started going to a trainer and after a few weeks I wanted to do some resistance work at home. I bought these and they have been working great. The quality has been very good. I travel fairly regularly and they pack up and travel well. I will be needing to get some additional bands as I am pulling 55+ for some exersizes. I am sure they will clip on and keep the training going.,5.0
"I purchased this product in May and have had no issues with it. I didn't want to drill a hole in my wall so I just put one of the handles around a door knob, easy peasy. Easy to change straps and find different levels of resistance. I've also used the ankle strap which is very comfortable. Overall happy with this product and glad my massage therapist recommended this to me for exercises between sessions.",5.0
Good.,5.0
"Ordered this on recommendation of my physical therapist for a shoulder rehab.  Have always used free weights, so did not know what to expect and was worried about the quality of the bands.  I have used them every day for over a week now and I am very impressed.  I even ordered another set of bands so I can use them after rehab is complete.

The quality of the bands and how they attach to the handles made me feel comfortable ""pushing"" their limits while lifting.  I do not get the sense they will separate or snap away from the handles.  Again, very impressed and please with my investment.

More economical than buying free weights at $1+ per pound.",5.0
Love these.,5.0
These work great - the variety of ways that you can attach this makes it easy to use anywhere. Being able to combine bands to customize the resistance of the bands is really easy and allows for a variety of people to utilize them. Easy to switch between different exercises so you are not spending time in your workout simply switching back and forth between different bands.  These bands do exactly what they're supposed to do. Great alternative to using free weights.,5.0
"I'd been looking for resistance bands and found these on sale, and I'm glad I got them! They're a little stiff for the first couple of uses, but they soon loosen up and work well. They're also compatible with other resistance band handles, so more than one person can use the bands at once (just keep in mind that every band has a different amount of resistance). These are now a permanent part of my workout routine.",5.0
"I made this purchase to help a minor shoulder injury. I am still in the process of healing but I do think it is helping. On a side not I used the black one to tie my wife up, she hasn't gotten out yet, it's been the quietest two weeks of my life.  Thank You!!!",5.0

"I recently started working out. I needed equipment that would allow me to safely, and efficiently get myself on track. The Black Mountain Products New Resistance Bands were just what I needed. I've been using them for about 3 weeks now, and these have more than exceeded my expectations. There are so many ways to use them. I get a great quality workout with these. They are made of superior materials that won't crack or lose their integrity with heavy use. If your just starting to work out then this is the product for you. Builds strength, and get your body & muscles stretched before you go to the gym to lift heavy so you can be the next Mr. Olympia, because your not going to achieve much if your injured! Not to mention BMP'S Excellent Customer Service.",5.0

"I got this band set in July, and they've been perfect for me. Way better than having to find space for a bunch of dumbbells. I've used these 3-4 times a week since buying them, and I've had no issues so far. I've been using these to go through P90X, which I'm almost done with this round. I know these are good products, because I never have to think about them. I just clasp the band(s) I need to the handles and go at it. The one thing I have noticed is the red band (the one I use the most) has a few nicks in it. If you're looking for some resistance bands to get started, pick up this set.",5.0

"These bands are great for strength training!  They are easy to use, and the included exercise booklet (while limited) gives you a solid starting point to using resistance bands.  They are much smaller and easier to store than bulky strength-training machines.  Everything fits neatly into the travel bag, making it really simple to take along on trips to keep up your exercise routine while away from home.",5.0
"My first set had some rusty carabiners that prevented them from easily opening and closing. Amazon is shipping me a replacement set. The rest of the items looked really nice and probably deserve a 4 or maybe even a 5 star rating.

Edit: Having received my 2nd set in 2 days (thanks Amazon!) I am changing from 3 stars to 5. I also spoke to customer support regarding an ""Orange"" band promotion they are currently running.  They answered on the first ring and were super polite.  This seems like a small business with a great product.  Am guessing my first set had just sat around a bit too long in the Amazon warehouse or were just a fluke. I've only used them a couple of times now but am really enjoying the whole resistance band workout... especially as I recover from a broken clavicle.  My only complaint is the grips have some imprints from other parts due to tight packaging but I believe over time it won't be too huge of an issue.",5.0
Great for hotel workouts. You get what you put in. Very nice selection of tubes and attachment for hotel doors.,5.0
"I only give 5 stars for products that deserve it. You get more than you pay for with this band system. I found this product searching for Crossover Symmetry bands. While they are not the same quality of Symmetry bands, they are only a fraction of the cost. You would need a second set of bands to perform crossover exercises, but that still is a way better value than the expensive Crossover Symmetry bands. I'm very happy with my purchase.",5.0

"I got these a few weeks ago and have loved them! They are very well made, and very durable.

Great and resistance product. I really recommend it.,5.0
"This set comes with 5 resistant bands allowing you to create a resistance of up to 75lbs. This is perfect for high rep workouts and especially ""on the go"". I will be buying some other bands that BMP sells since I would like more of a resistance for certain activities, but this set is perfect to start with.

The door jam is perfect and works on all doors, even tested it out on my closet folding doors and they held up! The ankle/leg strap is of very high quality and so are the handles. The bands come with a carabiner attached to each end and it makes switching bands quick and easy!

These resistance bands IMO are as described  in the four and five star reviews.  They are made of high-quality materials and are working out great for me. I traditionally have hated lifting weights gone for aerobic activities.  But the fact that I can use these in my small house without going to the gym has given me no excuse. I love the fact that there are an enormous number of combinations of weight resistance with the five bands.,5.0
Fast and convenient weight changes. Much better than the previous ones I had. Don't seem to have the tension they claim though.,5.0
"The Resistance Band Set is just what I have been looking for instead of continuing my gym membership.  I really like the fact that I can get a great workout with using my body strength and these resistance bands.  The bands are of high quality, very durable, and the set gives you a variety of numerous exercises you can achieve.  As traveling is my forte, this set works perfectly in the hotel room, and sets up quickly on the door; it is very compact and doesn't overload my luggage. A helpful exercise chart is included, which I always find handy when purchasing home equipment.

IMO, this set is all a person really needs to enhance their strength training.  And, knowing it came from a very reputable company who knows what works for a person, is a huge bonus!

"I bought 2 sets of these, one for my wife and one for myself. We are both older and can use these almost anywhere. We used to lift free weights but as we got older using them became more difficult unless we got dressed and went to the gym. We have found that we can use these at home in our spare time and while watching tv. We can attach more than one band to the handles th increase the tension and get a harder workout. The round tubing used in these bands seems much stronger than the flat bands and they really add no extra weight to the bands. The sets also came with a nice bag to put all the bands, handles and door attachment in. That makes it very easy to travel with. The sets also came with a small instruction booklet that showed some exercises and uses for the bands, this gives you somewhere to start from, then you can make up your own exercises as you need them and become more experienced on the use of the bands. We are very pleased with these and would recommend them especially for older citizens or someone who wants some strength training without having to go to the gym or deal with free weights. Really great option for taking on vacation.",5.0

"Fully met expectations. Great product - high quality for a good price. The bands' versatility and portability makes them ideal for workouts while traveling, but I've taken to using them for workouts at home too.

They're not a perfect replacement for weights in either form or function, but you would be surprised at how much you can do with them.",5.0

The rubber (or whatever material it is) looks new and in good shape, the caribeener attachments are solid and easily interchangable, and the length feels just right. I'm confident they won't snap apart and hurt me, and the resistances are pretty much ideal for me to do all the different exercises and leave room to grow stronger. That said, I am a petite woman, so big guys might find these all too light.

So overall, I have no complaints. For context, I got these because the resistance bands that came with P90 and then P90X3 DID snap apart occasionally at the attachment points to the handles and I was not pleased, so these are a happy upgrade.",5.0
"Love these bands!! They are durable and sturdy and not to mention, compactable. I was able to take these on travel. I love the interchangeable bands and the door mount that comes with it. Amazing product. I would definitely recommend this product!!",5.0
I've used these bands for years and I'm on my second set now. I love these things. What's even better than these bands....their customer service! A+ for their service. They are very informative and helpful if there are any issues (like the time I had a handle crack; they replaced it immediately and as of yet I have not had another one crack again).,5.0
Excellent--love the bag too.,5.0
"Great Quality product, excellent service! Two thumbs up!",5.0
"This set is exactly what I was looking for. You can do so many exercises on this and the set will grow with you. Comes with a pouch, although I with it had more of a drawstring closure or longer handle (just personal preference for me). When I head out, I just toss the band of choice in with the regular band set I purchased and I am good to go. I highly recommend this set for band exercises.",5.0
Just received and used for only one workout so far. The bands and hardware appear to be good quality. I ordered additional door anchors so I don't have to keep changing positions. So far happy with product and I will try to post later on after good amount of useage.,5.0
Definitely worth the money if you don't have room for actual free weights.,5.0
High quality bands at a good price.  You can't beat these.,5.0
"I don't excercise with these, I use them for walking my huge dogs along with ropes. Shipping was fast and they were exactly what I needed. They work great!",5.0
Excellent bands. They do what I expect them to do. I like that you can group them together to create a stronger resistance. Great price too.,5.0
"After mulling over the marketplace, I decided to give this a try. Glad I did. Shipped fast, very well built, been using it daily for some time now without a single problem. I would recommend this to anyone, and I don't review many products either. Great job guys!!!",5.0
This is a really nice product. Everything is very well made. I'm sure I will get a lot of use out of it before I start to see any wear. Being able to compound the resistance is a really nice option for strength training.,5.0
Terrific value. High quality product. Great versatility. Delivered ahead of schedule. Packaging and product documentation also very nice. My husband and I use this product 3x a week and have even taken the bands on vacation with us.,5.0

"I was surprised with how great the hooks latched in this set.  Also, the equipment is good quality.",5.0
"Really like this set, works as described.  Obviously portable, so can use anywhere.",5.0
"Great exercise band set, especially for the price. It has five different strengths and colors of tubing, handles, an ankle-strap, and a well-made attachment for doors, a brief but useful instruction manual, and a convenient carrying bag. It's not a full-blown 'gym in a bag', but with some creativity and motivation, you can use this to fill in the gaps that most 'push only' calisthenics routines have.

At first, I thought it was going to be too lightweight, but then I realized that the bands can be 'stacked' or combined. Boom, problem solved.

This now has a permanent place in my carry-on bag, and I can keep up with my rehab and workouts on the road. I may buy a second one for my office.",5.0
I use these to complement my weight lifting training and they are great to take the muscles further even after they are tired!,5.0
"So. I am well not as in shape as I want to be.  And well I am busy..kids..job..house..all taking time out of my day.  I wanted a solution where I could do a workout in my house whenever I have some time.  These resistance bands are working great.  I have not used the door mounting function as of yet.  Where I have them setup I have some unfinished walls and I bought an anchor that I could just screw into the wall.  These bands are comfortable on my hands and provide enough resistance to get me ""pumped.""  My 5 year old son has even used some of the lower weight ones to ""workout.""  I have no reservations about suggesting these to other people.  Also I had a question and called the seller and that were polite and responsive.",5.0
"Nice simple set of resistance bands and grips. The door grip is great and effect - no snap-backs to date after a couple of months of use in different doors while traveling. Resistance range is nice and bands can be combined to increase easily. Handgrips are solid and comfortable, nicer than the ones that came with my bowflex machine",5.0
Not a gym junkie by any means but you gotta have these in your bag! Great for travel or a quick work out at the office. No reason not to use these bands. They are easy use and resistance is great. Love the colors for each weight resistance. BUY THIS SET!,5.0
great product,5.0
The quality of these resistance bands is quite a bit better than I expected. I have been enjoying all of the different excersizes that they have recommended with them. Probably the best bands that I have seen (especially for the money).,5.0
Excellent . It is gym you can carry everywhere  and safe no injuries.,5.0
Ordered 2 sets for my personal training studio to use normally and for a homemade functional training rig! They are awesome! I like the metal clips on the end. It allows you to change handles and you can buy other types of handles to use with the bands!,5.0
Glad I found these. So much cheaper than in stores a. Durable and comes in a nice bag to keep everything together !,5.0
Great value.  Good quality product and a very reasonable price.,5.0
Bought this to use with my P90X DVDs. These work great and are super sturdy with very comfortable handles. Reccommended them to a few friends who bought as well.,5.0
"I bought theses bands for myself, my mom, and my grandparents. We all use them for exercising at our homes and these do an excellent job of assisting with that. Their durable, and you can hook them onto a door at any height so they're good for people of all sizes. Another cool part is that once your strength increases you can adjust the tension by simply adding a another band. I showed my grandparents how to exercise their legs, upper body and core with these, so all in all, they're worth the money and pretty sick! Also very easy to travel with.",5.0
"I love these bands. I owned a gym for 24 years, sold 10 years ago, and circumstances only allow me to work out at home now. These bands give me a great, quick, home workout. I would recommend to anyone!",5.0
If is well made and fits my needs in a resistance band excercise device.,5.0
very nice,5.0
"Bought these bands for myself at same time I purchased a set of workout DVDs. I don't want to put a pull-up bar in a doorway of my house, so I thought these would be a worthy substitute. And they are.

The bands can be used against a closed door, where they are ""mounted"" by simply shutting the door. This set has five bands, all of which approximate various weights. You can attach all of them to the handles or put them on one handle or change it up in a variety of different ways.

For my purposes, these bands have been a worthy purchase. I suppose the only drawback is not the bands' fault: the door used to secure the bands must close tightly and not have too much space been the door and wall. Otherwise it may slip out. That is a problem on my end, not the bands.

In all I would recommend these to others who prefer to not have weights all over their homes, or want to be able to workout while traveling, as these bands also come in a goodsized bag small enough to easily pack.",5.0

Good stuff,5.0
"WOW, what a deal here. The bands, handles, bag as well as the straps to attach to a post or other vertical object as well as on a door are all top quality. I like the color coded bands and will use these regularly for my workouts.",5.0
Great set that is definitely worth the money. Fantastic travel supplement to a gym. I also use it for rehab for my shoulder. Tons of different workouts one can do with this set. Quality seams good so far.,5.0
"Great set! Includes everything you need to get a good workout anywhere. Multiple bands, handles that you can attach more than one band to, ankle strap, exercise instructions, door anchor, and carry bag. Small, lightweight, packable. But effective! Highly recommend as an option for those who travel a lot and want to do weight training, for those who don't have a lot of space for weights, and for those who need to do a gentler form of weight training due musculoskeletal or joint issues that require a gentler, lighter approach. Completely customizable to your needs.",5.0
"I purchased this resistance band set a little over a month ago and have been using them pretty regularly. The materials with which these are built seem to be good quality, and in the time that I have been using them they have not developed any problems. The design is pretty good, specially considering it is so easy to switch back and forth between the different bands, or to stack them together. The set I bought included 5 resistance bands, two soft grip handles, one ancle strap, and one door anchor. All of the materials are sturdily built, and tho I wouldn't change the design on most components in the set, I believe the door anchor can be improved. Even considering this, I still give this product 5 stars since it is such a good deal.
The set included a brief guide with some exercise postures that can be used, it can be useful if you are just beginning and want to mess around with the resistance bands, but there are ample resources online that you can explore to find additional postures and exercise routines. There are plenty of free videos on youtube, as well as forums and websites where you can learn these from.
At it's price point, this set of bands is a very good deal and I recommend them completely.",5.0
"These work perfectly, and love how easily they connect into the door.",5.0
"Although I have used resistance bands with the Physical Therapist and also with my Bowflex, this is the the first set of Bands that I have purchased.  I really enjoy these resistance bands, they are a safe way to perform practical, strength building exercises and they can be taken anywhere.  The resistance bands have helped me recover from Knee Surgery and also from Tendonitis. This is a great set for a great price and I recommend it to people of all body types!",5.0
I am very impressed by the extremely strong connections of the bands. They are locked in place and my mind is at ease when using them knowing they will not fail.,5.0
I love how it came with the door stopper so I can work out in any room! The different weight resistance give an advantage. It comes with a little black bag so you can store all it away nicely without leaving a mess of bands around. It even comes with a booklet of exercises to do!,5.0
Awesome product. Told all my friends about it.,5.0
Great high quality product. Thanks again!,5.0
Great product and customer service.  Loving how easily they change positions and resistance.  Super easy to get a great routine going.,5.0
"These resistance bands are great! They are very versatile and durable. I love that they come with a carrying case, so that you can easily bring them with when traveling to fit in a workout.",5.0
"Great workout bands. I like the metal carabiners used to hook the bands to the handle. You are able to add more bands to the link which is great if you want more resistance. I got this during Prime day and it was originally incomplete. The handles were missing, but I had called the number provided in the package and they gladly sent me the handles as well as their promotional orange band. The bands seems sturdy and strong, except for the door latch door mush be closed for it to lock in place but the stopper and latch is too short for my door. Otherwise, I am happy with the product.",5.0
"Solid bands, and what makes this 5 stars is the piece that fits in the door. Anywhere that's roughly like a regular door frame (e.g. sliding doors) will hold it, which allows for way more flexibility than just the set of bands themselves.",5.0
Affordable and durable set of 5 resistance bands with everything you need to start getting stronger. 5/5,5.0
Very good quality and exactly what I was looking for.,5.0
"I bought these to rehab after rotator cuff surgery. This is a very well made set of resistance bands that looks like it will last for many years. The band connection is robust and the small carabiners at each end make it easy to move the grips between bands. There are a couple different straps to attach your bands to. The wrap around velcro strap works great on my exercise bike handle bar, very secure yet easily removed, I haven't used other strap which works with a door frame. An instruction manual with a pictorial of suggested exercises and a carry bag complete this set. They'll pack up compactly so I can take them on the road in our RV. When I'm done the rehab I'll keep using these for a varied upper body work out. I got a great Amazon Prime Day deal but now that I've used this set I would not have been disappointed paying the regular price.",5.0
I love everything about these bands. We'll be having quite some fun on this fitness journey. I will update on durability as time goes by.,5.0
Works just as good as any others.. Not sure how long they will last since I've only had them a month or two and don't use them every day.. But it comes with an awesome guide!,5.0

Great set of Resistant Bands! They hold up very well and feel solid unlike another brand I tried before. Very happy with my purchase!,5.0
These are a nice set of bands. I had shoulder surgery and they work great for rehab.  You can add more bands to increase resistance. I have used some other brands before but this is a nice set and the bands don't lose their resistance like some of the others I have used. The door anchor works great and the metal clips are nice compared to other brands.  I was always a free weight only guy but I can get a good workout with these bands and now supplement my free weights with them. Hopefully I will not have to use their warranty but from what I have read and seen Black Mountain stands behind their products.,5.0
"WOW! fantastic product. I love the versatility of clip on handles, they allow me to easily add multiple bands together to increase resistance.",5.0
"I've used these for a few months now and they're great. The metal clips are easy to work with, and the variety of tube ""weights"" is really useful. The door anchor in particular is essential. It's great to have the entire kit in one bag! I'm glad I have these and I use them almost every day.",5.0

I am super pleased with this product. easy to use and provides a lot of different resistance weight. I use this set 6 days a week.

I really like the attachment that allows you to put it in your door to do additional exercises. I would recommend this product.,5.0
I have a crazy busy life and sometimes I need to get a workout in to relieve some stress at work. I love using free weights at the gym but there isn't space nor does it look aesthetic in my office. I bought these resistance bands due to friend's recommendation. It's been a month am I'm loving them. I actually work up a nice sweat and get the muscle sorenesss that I usually get from free weights. I still go to the gym but this is great for my in between days. I was hesitant when putting them through some stress tests but they are holding up. They feel great and they fit well in the black travel bag so that I can just slip them into my desk drawer. So far so good ,5.0
"I found is band set listed for sale on Amazon Prime Day and my entire exercise routine changed for the better. They let me do so much more than I would have ever been able to do without either a full gym membership or lots of expensive equipment in my very limited space at home. This is the best money I have spent in my efforts to get in shape. After having used them for a month I am already seeing results both in the amount of resistance I am using and my physical appearance becoming more defined.

Truly the only limits to the exercises you can do and muscle groups you target are your imagination and google. I personally have been using them for everything from exercises that used to be impossible for me to perform in my house (lat pull-downs, squats with resistance, and even deadlifts) to basic things like bicep curls. I cannot recommend these bands highly enough!",5.0
These bands are constructed so much better than any others we have purchased in stores before. We find the different sizes and weights are perfect for our home gym. We have used them for rehab purposes and overall strength training.  Highly recommend!,5.0

"These bands are honestly amazing. I bought these when I didn't have time to go to the gym, and they are great for squeezing in a few workouts. Of course it's not a replacement for the gym, but nonetheless great. Amazing product!",5.0
Used these bands at least a dozen times already and have had no issues,5.0
I like the door attachment. Great set!,5.0
"These have been great! I've used many bands in the past, to have them snap or break within a few weeks of daily use, but these are well made and seem solid. My one complaint are the clips, as the fabric gets bunched up, and makes it hard to close or open at times. Other than this one engineering flaw, they have no signs of wear. The door attachment is good and solid, but be sure to use the hinge side of the door, and the velcro strap can take a lot of force exerted by the bands without coming apart. Overall, I'm very happy with the bands and will update if I get any failure.",5.0
"This an essential tool for home workout. These resistance bands exceeded my expectations.  There so many workouts with use of this product. I also love the fact that I can also travel with the bands and workout while on vacation.  I would highly recommend, you will not be disappointed.",5.0

"Perfect for Rotator Cuff rehab.

Went to the orthopedist and he recommended I work on strengthening my rotator cuffs for my shoulder pain.

I have already recommended these bands to multiple friends.",5.0

"Pretty simple and great work out product. I bought these resistance bands at the recommendation of my personal trainer so that I had an easy way to do simple strength training at home without the space for a full weight bench. This is a smartly designed set that allows for many different upper and lower body workouts. I particularly like the creativity of the door anchor design and the ability to combine multiple straps to increase the weight setting. Set also comes in a great little carrying pouch, with a guide book for exercises, which is also handy. That means this kit can get great use at home and it's small enough that I can toss it in a bag when I travel.  Highly recommended!",5.0
"very good product, reliable, durable, price is reasonable.",5.0
"Very high quality and easy to use straps.  They have greatly improved the range of motion in my shoulder.  They won't make you incredibly strong or ""ripped"" but do provide great resistance for light training.",5.0

"These resistance bands are great! My wife has always had some cheap kind of resistance band, and when I start to use them, they tend to break. After being snapped in the face several times, I decided I would start to look for something better.

These bands are great in that they link together, so you can go from very little resistance to more than the average person would ever need. It is easy and fast to link the bands together using the carabiner clip. If you put more than 2 bands together, you have to be a little more careful as the carabiner is pretty small and space is limited. There is a few inch nylon segment at the end of each band, but it really hasn't interfered with any of my workouts yet.

This set comes with an attachment that you can use to lock the band in a door way, and another attachment for you foot/leg. I thought the door attachment would be great, but I would rather secure the bands to my weight bench instead. When I put it in the door frame, I felt like there was too much pressure on the door and it could possibly cause some damage (think directing 75+ lbs of force on the top of a door, the side further from the hinges bulges out). The bands are sticky, so I am usually able to just wrap it around a leg of the weight bench and clip it and it will be very secure. I will be getting a weight rack soon and this will provide a better overhead attachment point.

Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this set and would highly recommend them to everyone, except maybe those meatheads that tend to curve barbells during their normal workouts.",5.0
Awesome,5.0
"I got them in the mail and used them right away, and the bands are very high quality and the way you can mix and match to get the exact resistance you need is very useful for me who does more compared to my wife who does uses it with less weight.  It also comes with excellent instructions on how to work almost every muscle group using just what you get in the package, and a door.",5.0
"This resistance band set is probably the best set that i have tried. The interchangeable handles are pretty cool, and to me, more effective instead of having the older bands that are unable to change and require the ball/washer stopper. Totally recommend for anybody wanting to use these.",5.0
Bought this as a gift. She loved it!! Delivered next day first thing in the morning. Thank you!,5.0
"I love these. Resistance bands are like having a portable cable tower at a tiny fraction of the price, though most are difficult to stack, thus making adjustments to resistance difficult. This set solves that problem. Switching out bands is very easy and there's room for additional ones, as I found out already, since I bought and added the purple stackable band to mine. I'll likely be adding the orange and atomic green, for a total of about 230 pounds of resistance. Which is not much lower than most cable weight stacks go up to, and for a total investment of like $75. Versus hundreds (or even thousands) for a cable tower. Bands have received an unfortunate reputation by their association with light-resistance high-rep use in trendy women's fitness programs, but I assure you that has nothing to do with their inherent nature.",5.0
These bands are great.  Exactly as advertised.  Seem to be made well and love the bag for carrying them with you.  Planning on using these while on vacation.,5.0

With all of the sizes and weights to choose from, I can easily mix and create pretty much any weight I need.",5.0
I've been using my set for over a week now and they seem to be a quality product. Makes working out easy and safe. No heavy weights to lug around or drop. I love that they come with a door holder so I can place the band I'm going to use at any height. I can also take them wherever I go.,5.0

This product was bought on an impulse and I had second thoughts about my little splurge till the product arrived. This is a very nice set of bands. The weight of the bands is accurate and after a week of heavy use they are still firm and measure out the same length as new so they are not stretching out or tearing. The instructions give you plenty of different exercises so your not limited to figuring it out for yourself and the bag holds everything easily so there is no need to jam it in or be a packing expert. I'm very happy with my purchase and the quality of the product. I will be looking for more products from this manufacturer.,5.0

The quality is very high, the materials used are something you would expect to see in much more expensive sets. I feel that you also get a lot of bang for your buck. You can do a lot with this set by using the different bands together and adding more resistance, or using one at a time for a lighter workout. It is very versatile. He recently traveled to my house on vacation and was able to pack up all the materials needed in the black bag that comes with the set and he was ready to go. This resistance band set is one gift I am so glad I purchased.",5.0
Great quality and good buy for the price. I recommend this product.,5.0
"These bands are nice and seem to be very good quality. I like how it comes with a bag so I can store them all together, along with ankle strap and door anchor.",5.0
Much stronger than expected and sturdy. Easy to attach/detach the bands and allows for a huge range of resistance as you can use multiple bands together. The door anchor and ankle strap also work great and they exercise chart is very helpful,5.0

Seriously high quality.... Surprisingly effective and great for travel. Highly recommended.,5.0
"This is a good product and the company seems to sell only quality. The bands can be stretch by 400% their original size without breaking.  the handles and the elastic plastic feel nice and are not flimsy.  My only complaint is that i needed bands with higher tension, but the red tension band at thirty pound lets me train my muscles, but the yellow and blue band are very low weight. I don't know what i would do with those",5.0
"This is a very simple way to add a little extra 'oooph' to a workout. Because the bands don't take up much room and are light, for me they are perfect as I travel a lot.
If you are looking for an easy workout companion, this is for you!
Enjoy - Pablo",5.0
"I use these daily in my workouts since I workout at home. I use them in place of any cable exercises and for increased resistance for some body weight exercises. I've used some with plastic clasps before and it was a huge mistake, they snapped on me. These are very strong and you can tell they are well reinforced. The handles are soft to use.",5.0
Great for times when you can't get to the gym or while traveling.,5.0

"I purchase these with my bench, these are osome they work great and I am amazed how well they are built and they are strong you get a great work out and you don't have to go to a gym.",5.0
My husband bought me this set because I had a different brand and the handle kept braking off the end of the rubber tubing.  I have had this for about a year (I currently only use one color) and I use it every other day.  It is holding up great for all of the exercises I use it for.,5.0

"I compete Nationally in Olympic style weightlifting, and purchased these for home use for myself and my mother for general fitness use.

The tubing for each band is a very high quality, and I do not have to worry about them breaking. They each come with their own carabiners, which makes changing resistance band very simple and easy. The doorstop is a must for any serious use of the resistance bands, and the inclusion of this speaks about the seriousness and quality of Black Mountain Products. No shortcuts were attempted when making this product.

The starter guide is a nice inclusion, but of no real use for me, as is the ankle strap.

I use this resistance bands for specific purposes, and do not condone their use as a sole fitness instrument. However, that being said, for the purposes I use them, they are absolutely fantastic and could not be improved.

I am very happy with these resistance bands. Of all bands I have used, none can compare to these quality.",5.0
"Easy to learn to use, durable, and very convenient for working out at home. High-quality product.",5.0
Excellent product. The wife and I really enjoy working out together and being able to use different strengths of bands. Well built and would recommend this all day long.,5.0
"You can take this thing anywhere and work out. Sometimes i pull it out at the office and start doing bicep curls. The great part is that you can double, triple,etc. stack the bands and get a lot of resistance.",5.0
Nice,5.0
I'm really enjoying this Black Mountain resistance band set. The suggested exercises are very helpful and the ability to customize resistance with various bands is a big plus. Very good as another tool for my home workouts and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality resistance band set.,5.0
"I purchased these a while back as I wanted to get some use in before reviewing. That's done now. And while I don't use them daily I've used them quite enough to know that the quality is top notch... and at the end of the day quality, not price, is all that matters. Don't hesitate to purchase these. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
These band are easy to use and set up.  I travel quite a bit and can hardly take my free weights on the plane. I like that they let you know the poundage so you can mark your improvement.  So much better than the elastic bands used by P.T.s.  They come with a fairly good instruction booklet which I scanned and put on my IPad.  It would be nice if they could recommend a thorough or complete book on the use of bands in a complete exercise program tailored to individual age and needs. There are books out there but I don't know which one works best with BlackMontain bands. No need for bulky equipment that is hard to store.,5.0
I've had these for years and I love the versatility of them. They are strong and convenient. I have come across some qorkout programs that seem to require longer ones. But these have worked for most.,5.0
Perfect! Came in just in time. Easy to use,5.0
"I've had skinny arms my entire life.  Except when I got fat in my 30's.  Then I had medium-sized flabby arms.  After changing my life in my mid-40's by eating healthy, and getting more active, I got thin again, as did my arms.  Now, I'm not one to work out at the gym, and in fact, other than biking and hiking, I hate most forms of exercise.  But I've always wanted nice arms...  I don't have room in my budget (or my house) for some gigantic home gym system.  And the truth is, after owning one for a month or two, it would probably end up on Craigslist anyway.

While searching Amazon for arm exercise equipment, I came across this highly rated 'Black Mountain Products' resistance bands kit.  I decided to buy it, and I'm glad I did.  For two weeks, I did the standard 'X' number reps of 'Y' number of set (standing arm curls) 4-5 times a week.  After two weeks, I noticed my arms were firmer, but there was no noticeable or measurable change in my arm size.  That was very discouraging.  I went online in search of answers, and was about to give up, since nearly every message board about body building has postings about how 'you can't build muscle using resistance bands', 'need to use free weights', etc.  But then I found a video of Blake Kassel demonstrating ""4 minute muscle"" curls.  And that routine has been a game changer for me.  In the weeks since, I have added almost 1/4-inch per week to my arm circumference (bicep/tricep) doing the 4-minute muscle approach in curls and tricep extensions.  I don't know how long that growth rate will continue - but it has brought about a change in my attitude and motivation - I actually look forward to my arm exercises now.

Now, my arms aren't 'big' yet, but they're they nicest arms I've had in my entire life.  If they continue to grow, I'll have to start incorporating lower body exercises, to have a matching set of legs. :-)  These bands are an awesome investment.  They are lightweight, quality bands, with a nice carrying case for travel/storage.  And a lifetime warranty ?!?! - you can't beat that.  I really don't have any complaints, other than I would have liked a more detailed exercise manual.  Their website (BMP) offers a bit more exercise info, but the pictures are still on the small side, with not a lot of text description (about breathing, proper form, etc).

I can't speak to all the different exercises that can be done with these bands, as I only do curls and tricep extensions.  But I can testify that with regular use, and the proper approach, these bands have brought shape, definition and mass to my arms.",5.0
I bought this set and have been very happy with it.  I am a 6'1 male and weigh 165 lbs and wanted a portable and small space option for exercise - these bands seem to be of high quality and they stack together for increased resistance which I really like.,5.0
Excellent fitness product you can do anywhere.,5.0
I really like this set. It includes everything you need to do exercises using resistance bands with a door.  I like that I can take these with me if I am traveling.  I think this is a good product for those working from home with limited equipment.  I use the bands for back exercises mostly but I know you can use it for other exercises (I just haven't tried out).  This equipment is useful to use with strength training DVDs for people who work out at home and don't have heavier weights.,5.0
"I am just getting into exercising, and I wanted something I could use at home and when traveling for strength training. I checked out a lot of products, and a number were less expensive than this product. But invariably, the reviewers complained about them breaking after use",5.0
"High quality resistance bands, the handles especially are useful along with the anchoring attachment. Other bands are not easy to use in comparison.",5.0
"I have been using the bands for a few days now and really enjoy the variety of exercises that can be done with them. The resistance in the bands is on point for a great workout! They are very durable. Well worth the purchase for an ""at home"" workout!",5.0

Great work out and easy to pack to bring on trips.,5.0
"I have never used resistance bands so I can't compare them with other brands but I really like using these. I mostly only lift but I am limited at home because weights and benches are expensive. When I need to get in my workout but the gym is not an option these are a good substitute. I love that they come with a door holder so I can place the band I'm going to use at any height. The ankle strap and hand pulls are very good quality, actually this entire set is good quality and I can tell it's made well and made to last. I didn't think that using bands would ever compare to lifting but if I'm creative enough with the workouts I'm definitely sore the next two days. It also comes with a huge list of exercises to help you get started.",5.0
"I love this set and would definitely recommend it. It's a very comprehensive set that is easy to set-up. The varying bands definitely provide increased intensity which I like from other sets. They can easily transition between arm sets and leg sets using your body weight or a door jam. You simply slide the band into the included door wedge and close the door on the wedge. The comfort handles are easily attached with a carabiner styled system. The handles are very comfortable to use. The system seems secure and of a solid quality for long use. As a woman without a lot of existing upper body strength, these are a great solution instead of using free weights. I love the travel bag, which means I can take my set wherever I go so I don't miss work out days. The included training steps are well pictured and easy to follow for an initial routine.",5.0
High quality bands and very comfortable grips. Easily changes with carabiner clip attachments.,5.0

"I purchased these looking for an alternative to free weights and weight machines altogether.  As a retired and disabled veteran, my body aches at the thought of weightlifting.  So I decided to go with resistance conditioning for the purpose of general overall health maintenance and conditioning.  This kit is the perfect beginners kit, plus as your strength and balance improves, additional band(s) can be purchased with varying weight resistances.  I love the fact that it's portable and can be taken along with you on vacations, weekend getaways, etc.  The resistance bands have a life time warranty, and from what I've read, hassle free.  Pricing, lifetime warranty, convenience and practicality; this is a no brainer, especially for those like me who have physical disabilities and limitations, (physical therapy); and for those without such limitations and just want a blast of a work out, this is the way to go.  As with any exercise equipment or the starting of a new workout routine, always consult with your physician and not your neighbor or best bud!!!!",5.0

"This is a high-quality set and an amazing value for the price. The interchangeable hardware provides with many options to configure the bands for more or less tension. The hardware clips are sturdy, the bands are made from thick, heavy material and the clips are easy to open and close. This set is comprehensive, from light to heavy tension, which creates a lot of variety to keep you motivated to stay with your program. My husband uses these at night and I use them in the morning. We both sport strong, toned arms and sculpted shoulders.  We are a happy family.",5.0
"I love the Black Mountain Resistance Bands!  I've had these for about 6 months now.  They provide a very convenient and space saving method to work out at home.  But even more important to me as someone who travels frequently is the fact that the set takes up very little space in luggage and can easily be taken along on trips.  Many hotels offer ""workout rooms"" that consist of very little usable equipment.  With the Black Mountain Resistance bands I can work out in the convenience of my room, and they allow me to do any exercise I need or want!  I highly recommend this product to others who are worried about staying fit as they age.",5.0

I purchased these bands in August of 2015 and used the sporadically since then.  But this past winter I injured my shoulder skiing and was referred for physical therapy.  With these bands I was able to recreate much of the therapeutic exercise given to me.  I was offered elastic flat bands for home use but I refused as these are infinitely better. The grips and other attachments are easy to use and interchange quite readily.  I recommend this highly.,5.0

"I got these resistance bands primarily for my shoulder dislocation physical therapy. I'm currently on the blue band for my shoulders, but for everything else I'm on the red band. I use it primarily sitting in a chair when I have downtime at work. It's a lot of fun to do a couple of reps of chests and shoulders in my cubicle while waiting for stuff to finish.

The set comes with a nice nylon bag that you can fit everything into. It comes with an instruction booklet and various workouts that can be achieved with the bands. Looking at the customer service, it looks like they have an actual physical human being on the phone taking support calls for their products. None of my bands have any rust, the carabiner looks sturdy and rigid, and the bands feel smooth and even. I think this is going to be a great productive product for my shoulders and body.",5.0
Love them! Exactly what I had hoped for,5.0
"I've been using these bands for about a month and a half now, and they've worked great! The bands are nice and solid and are connected to a solid clip ending. The clip makes it easy to connect to the handles or to the leg band. The door jam does a great job when put into use, it has stayed solid and snug with no slippage. Also, I like the ability to stack the bands on one another (connect more than one band at a time). This allows me to use any combination of resistance that I need.",5.0
These bands arived today and I worked out with them and they are better than I expected! The handles are soft without being hollow and cardboard. They feel more expensive than you would think. I forgot that it comes with so many resistance bands. I have seen three banded models at Target and the extra variety is a major pro. Haven't tried the anchors yet but the way the band's attach to the clips looks very secure and substantial. The bag fiys everything perfectly. Gosh. I wish I ordered these months ago!,5.0

Packaging: Unboxing this was a pleasure. Everything comes nicely enclosed in a carry pouch which makes traveling with it really easy.

First Impression: The material that the bands as well as the attachments is made to last. So far I have not found a single area where poor decisions were made on design or implementation. I have been using this product 3-4x a week for the past few months in parallel to a normal weight lifting routine. I have found that in doing so, my overall strength has increased as well as the rehab on my elbow and shoulder complete. Since starting to use this product, I have purchased a second one to keep in my office at work for days where I am unable to get out or when my elbow/shoulder are feeling blah.",5.0

"I purchased this set on Amazon's sister site, Woot. There appear to be two primary construction types used in making this sort of resistance band. Cheaper sets often use smaller hardware, with spring-gate carabiners, On those, the bands are secured by folding them through a swivel ring at the bottom of the carabiner, and securing them with zip ties.

The more robust construction, such as these, uses bigger, stronger carabiners and the rubber tubing is secured with a wedge inserted in the tubing. This seems to be more secure and durable. I have had sets of both types, and can say these are well made and offer a good value.

Disclaimer: BMP has provided me product for this review.",5.0
"This product is everything as advertised. The quality is excellent, the manual that came with it is a  great way for beginers.",5.0
"I purchased this set to assist with my shoulder rehab. I have been reluctant to go back to the gym for fear of injuring my shoulder again so these bands are a great alternative. The provide continuous resistance and you can really do many of the traditional weightlifting exercises using them (check out the Black Mountain website for a list of exercises and pictures).

The quality of the bands is also very good so I expect they will last a very long time. Highly recommended!",5.0
"This is a high-quality resistance band set that is well-made, compact, and excellently-priced.  I've used this set while traveling, and it makes it super easy to stay in shape while on the road.  I'd definitely recommend Black Mountain to anyone looking for a new type of workout, and/or anyone who doesn't like or can't get to a traditional gym.",5.0
"I love these bands. They are made nice and sturdy, unlike some that i have broken within a week of buying. I have no complaints! great product and great service!",5.0
"Better quality than the single band I had before, seem to be very well made, I would recommend them",5.0
bueno,5.0
"I love how you can really customize the resistance levels using multiple bands. These bands are constructed very well and I do not anticipate any failure. I also like the added bonus of the ""door adapter"" piece that allows you to safely secure your band in the door.",5.0
"Using for rehab of shoulder at home in between visits. Working great,",5.0
I would recommend this product to anyone. The quality and the strength of these bands are great. I use them with personal training clients and they love them. Great way to exercise.,5.0
"Yep, it does what it says.",5.0
"Works great, good quality and great that there are different levels of resistance.",5.0
"I have had these bands for over 3 years, and use them all regularly. So far they have worked great. I only wished I could buy an extra set of handles, that way there is no need to stop to and reattach them every time I need to switch bands.",5.0

So probably like me, you're a very busy person and don't have a lot of time each day to work out like you should.  I'm just as guilty when it comes to making excuses for why I don't exercise regularly.  I'll start with a good routine, do it for a few months, and then something happens to throw me off course.  Getting back into things is the hardest part.

So recently I had a tough conversation with myself and really didn't like what I heard.  My gut is flabby, I get winded just walking to get the mail, I feel like crap a lot of the time, and I'm definitely in the worst shape of my life.  I want to live a long healthy life, and I realized that I haven't been doing the things necessary to achieve that goal.

I decided that the first step among many , was to start exercising more regularly.  I dusted off the treadmill and started walking, at least 30 minutes each time.  I also dusted off my pull up bar and for the first few weeks, honestly , the only thing I did was hang there and just try not to let go.

Since I really don't have time to go the actual gym, I work out at home.  Without the benefits of all the expensive equipment you have access to at the gym, I felt that my workouts were getting old and boring.  You can only do so many pushups and situps each day.  So I looked online and came across this set of resistance bands.  They sell them at the local sporting goods store as well.  The first thing that struck me was all the positive reviews that the product had.  That's always a good start.

After reading many reviews, I decided that this was the set I wanted to get.  With prime , my set arrived in 2 days and I was super excited to open it up and get working.  I'm happy to report that I agree with the positive reviews given to this product and I have added my 5 stars to it as well.

The first thing that I liked about these bands are quality with which they are made.  The hand grips are very comfortable and nicely padded.  The bands themselves do have a rubbery smell that I don't particularly enjoy but its what you would expect from that type of material.  The bands feel strong and I'm not a bit concerned that they will snap or break.  The caribeaners that are included to attach the bands to various attachments are of good quality as well.

The set comes with a short instructional booklet which I think they can make better with more detailed explanations of the different exercises that can be done.  They could also make it of higher quality with color photos as well.  To make it even better, including a DVD or links to YouTube videos with demos of the exercises would be great as well.

Overall, I would recommend this product and would purchase again!",5.0
I've been so excited with the Resistance Band Set.  The best thing about it is the anchor.  It's so easy to use and it won't scrape the paint off your door like the metal anchors.  I am very please and would definitely recommend it to others.,5.0
Simple and works well with door anchor.,5.0
Awesome!! Love these!!,5.0
"I needed something to occupy myself while I wasted away at my desk every day.  A co-worker recommended resistance bands to me so I figured I'd give them a try.  I did a bit of research and decided on these beauties.

I was impressed with the package that was delivered (the carrying case is a very nice touch) and the overall sturdiness of the carbineers that hooked onto the attachments.

My job requires me to spend several hours per day talking to clients on the phone/Skype, and not doing much else.  I've enjoyed experimenting and researching different exercises that are easy and intuitive to do while sitting on a swivel chair or standing near a computer screen.  Bicep curls, leg extensions, and seated rows are my go-to movements, but there are hundreds of others that I haven't tried yet.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend these bands to anyone who is looking into starting out with resistance training, or if you're like me and looking for a way to casually burn calories while technically still working at a desk.",5.0
Strong durable and work great in with my morning workout routine,5.0
They get the job done and definitely give the resistance needed to achieve what is required during my workout. I use them in place of a pull up bar and they work well and are sturdy.,5.0
"Very good product at a fairly priced entry point. I considered two brands, BMP and Bodylastics. Went for the BMP because of the higher resistance ratings at this price point. Was drawn to this item because the carabiner attachment with capability for multiple bands piqued my interest. I own some spri bands and loops which work well, but wanted to play with this product and see what it has to offer. I really like the product and the ability to add multiple bands to the handle. It is like adding or removing weights.

For me, bands work well for quick/explosive, high rep training with varying degrees of ROM. Bands are just another tool to provide a different type of resistance.

My main application for this set has been shoulder work as in seated presses, bent over raise, front raise, lateral raise. Again, I see these as an adjunct to training; just an accessory. However, in theory heavier bands coupled with controlled movement should be able to produce strength and mass gains when accompanied by the right diet and good sleep.

I own a functional trainer, Smith Machine, kettlebells and dumbbells, which make up the lions share of my resistance training.

This is a worthwhile tool for improved physique; it can be used as part of a program in productive applications.",5.0
I use these every morning for exercises to strengthen a bad back.  The handles are large enough to fit my big hands.  The padding makes them very comfortable to use.  The lanyard style connectors make it are quick and easy to change cables.  The bag holds the squiggly mass of extra cables very effectively.,5.0
"I love these bands and the ability to change the pounds, but just adding an additional band.  The number 1 thing is that the bands do not pop off the handle during use.  I've been using these with P90X3 and can tell the difference in my workout.",5.0
"One of the best I've ever had, my wife use it alot more than I",5.0
"I've added these to my home workout equipment and I love how they're stackable, but also fit in the bag to be neatly put out of the way. Very durable. Input quite a beating on them daily and have been using them for almost 90 days and haven't experienceseen any tears or snags. The handles are comfortable as well.",5.0
Love this set! It has a door attachment and everything clips together for neat storage.,5.0
"I purchased 2 sets... My husband works from home and he uses when he is sitting or standing listening to conference calls.  They are ideal for traveling.  I feel safer exercising with the resistance bands than going to the hotel gym.  The varied resistance is excellent.  I wish the product had more exercises without using a door hinge and maybe a laminated front/back card with recommendations on targeted areas (upper body, lower body, abs...).  I was able to find excellent YouTube resistance exercises I can use.  GREAT product!",5.0
Love this product.  I use it a lot.  I actually wish I had bought more handles so I didn't have to switch all the time.  I have been using for a year with no issues.,5.0
"I bought these for my husband and he is super happy with them. He really likes that he can switch the bands and ""customize"" the weight of the bands by changing and pairing up different resistances. Like that is comes with the door anchor and the travel bag is a nice addition.",5.0
"Many bands with different resistances, great for workout at home. i use them at my dorm. no problems so far.

You can stack up many bands if you're looking for that extra. comes with a manual with suggested workouts.

Very happy with it overall",5.0
Great product,5.0
These are a must for workouts.  Bought a chin up bar and my arms are to week. Got the resistance bands as a modification for chin ups.  Love the variety of sizes and all fit in a bag for travel. Great Product !!,5.0
Good set for the money!!!!!!,5.0
"Solid construction. Still learning how to use them, but way cheaper than buying free weights.",5.0
"I have been using these resistance bands several times per week for the past three months, and I have been very pleased with the quality of the product, and the workout that I have been getting with the items.  I am petite, just 5'2"", and I was worried that the bands would be too long for me to use with the handles for a workout - but with proper resistance, the set gives a solid workout and is not too long at my height.  My husband is 6-feet tall and also uses these bands occasionally, so I would that these bands work people with a wide range of heights.  The lighter resistance bands (yellow and blue) are too light on their own for a decent workout, but when doubled up with others, they add extra resistance to other bands.  The foam handles are comfortable to hold.  I do wish that the grommets/handle would not twist and swivel during the workout, but this is a minor issue.  Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.",5.0
Fast shipment and quality product.  Will recommend to my friends!,5.0
"Bands arrived as promised along with a ""door attachment"" and a nice zippered bag. My wife and I have been exercising with them, and the door attachment works real good. It's like having a gym at home for strength work. We plan on taking it on our trip and using it in motel rooms. So far, no negatives.",5.0
"Second set i bought.  I wore the first set out over at least 6 years.
They are so helpful as i cannot always get to the gym for my exercise.
they truly replicate the exercises i do at the gym.

I am very pleased with the quality and ease of use to of this product.  Both my husband and I are using them.  Bought a workout book as well.  It's a great way to get in shape and stay there.,5.0
"These are great. After years of putting myself through physical competitive sports abuse, my doctor has told me no more weight lifting.  I use these in a body weight / bands routine that rivals anything I have ever done. My wife and I use them every day at home and I feel better than I have in years.",5.0
"These things are STURDY. We always check for safety before use, and we have never had any issues with using these while working out. The bands have different strengths which is good for us because my husband is much stronger than I am so it is nice to have bands that work for us both.",5.0
Great band set that we use in our office - attached to a support for a warehouse rack.  Great for golfers working on core strength.,5.0
This item shipped quickly. I love that it comes with its own storage.,5.0
Good quality and great portability for folks who may travel. Google resistance band workouts and these will come in very handy.,5.0
I've been using these for 6 workouts now and after figuring out how to use them I feel completely comfortable using these as an almost total replacement to the gym. I'm able to do all of my Push/Pull exercises as well as core with these!,5.0
The bands are really good!  I work with bands for therapy all the time and they seem like they will hold up for a while and are a really good price for what all you get!  The door attachment will really help as well!,5.0
Easy to use on bad weather days,5.0
I love using these bands!  My husband wanted his own set of handles to use them also.  I definitely recommend them as they are easy to use and portable.,5.0
I love these bands! They work great!,5.0
"As someone who travels frequently both for work and leisure this product is *excellent*.  It packs easy in any suitcase and is a great alternative for those 'here today, gone tomorrow' hotel stays where a gym is neither non-existent or consists of only a stair stepper and treadmill.

The ease of adding additional bands is where this product really shines for those looking to curl and ""lift"" moderate weights at higher frequency reps.

The anchor is so-so compared to other products and really depends on the door and door jamb it's used. This won't be an issue for most but is noticeable on poorly (cheaper) constructed entrances.

One potentially bothersome feature is the size of the grip when performing exercises requiring palms face down as the grip tends to dig into the skin.  However the trade of is safety in my opinion.  I've found these are much less likely to slip as opposed to some competitors products.  The enlarged grip size is also almost a must for many of the exercises involving the anchor especially when using multiple bands.

This particular purchase replaced an identical set owned over 2+ years that were lost while traveling and neither those nor these have had any durability issues such as breakage or warping.

Whether you're always on the go and need a light to moderate weight substitute or prefer the privacy of your own room to exercise, I highly recommend these!",5.0
I have been using this product as part of the P90X3 program. I absolutely love the strength and endurance of this product compared to other brands I have tried. This has the durability to survive the toughest workouts for many years to come.,5.0

Perfect product for the people want Gym at their home.",5.0
I got this product to keep fit as truck driver and it has exceeded my expectations. All materials seem durable and precisely machined.

Love this product. My husband and I considered buying fancy gym equipment but we just don't have the room for it. This set has everything that you need and instructions on how to use them.

My husband and I recently purchased the Black Mountain resistance bands.  We wanted a change up from lifting with weights occasionally.  We have found that we both are able to get a great  work out and we have been able to hit different muscles that our weights were not able to work. The bands came in a bag that enables us to take the bands anywhere we go.  We have also easily hooked them to any door jam to continue our workout program when we our away from home.  My husband and I have been very satisfied with the quality and usage of the resistance bands from Black Mountain Products.,5.0

"I bought these bands to replace the cheap ones that come with BeachBody Power 90.  These are worth every penny.  The only down side is the door connection is a bit small.  When it comes to taking it out to do a different workout where the door connection is not needed, and then putting it back in in a hurry.  I use the longer one that I already had.  Still a five star quality product though.  Thank you  Black Mountain.",5.0
Love it working out has never been so easy,5.0
dad likes it.,5.0
"These adjustable bands are great for supplementing my normal weight lifting routine. You can set them up pretty much anywhere where you have a door frame and door. It's nice that there are five different bands that allow you increase resistance, for things such as pyramid sets.

I've been using these bands for about 6 months now, and have not noticed any signs of where and tear or reduction in elasticity. I would definitely recommend these bands for travel, men, women, light to heavy lifters, pretty much anyone who exercises.",5.0
"I decided to start exercising at home since it was more convenient than going to the gym.  I didn't have the money or space to purchase a set of free weights, so I read about these resistance bands.  I assumed I wouldn't get the same kind of workout than I could from using all the different machines at the gym...but I was wrong.  I can do almost anything with these resistance bands, and I can really feel the workout.  I used pretty heavy weights at the gym so I thought I might end up needing more resistance but I typically use at most two bands and not even the ""heaviest"" ones.  The manual that comes with the bands has pages of different exercises and I haven't event gotten to every one of them.",5.0
"Great product, fast shipping!",5.0
This is a great set up for easy exercising. The handles swivel and that makes a big difference. I would recommend this to any person that wants a workout with the ease of bands instead of the hassle of weights. Great booklet comes with it too.,5.0

Really good and helpful.,5.0
"These bands are awesome. I have been using them for all types of workouts. The door anchor works great and allows for varying heights and points of anchor for pull. These bands are great, in particular, because you can hook them together to create an even higher resistance. I would recommend these to anyone wanting bands. The fact that you get five different resistances and the door anchor, ankle strap, and the handles for this price is outstanding. They are a high quality band.",5.0

It's very light weight and all fits in a case that you can easily take with you anywhere.",5.0

These are amazing. I'm an over the road truck driver and excersise can be difficult. These are so compact and sturdy it makes it much easier to get out and connect these to different parts of my truck to get a workout!  Highly recommend.  Only thing I wish is the weight would be on the strap.,5.0
High quality comprehensive set. Good instructions.,5.0
"Good quality for the price. I bought these to use with fitness videos at home. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to use the door attachment, but when I did it worked well.

These bands are the BEST! I'm a personal trainer and I use them at home and with clients. I highly recommend this set.,5.0
"So far so good... having purchased and owned a number of other brand bands over the years, the construction on these seems very durable. The only note of minor fault (not really) is that the bands seem somewhat short if you are a taller person (I am over 6'). This may partially be down to my having gotten used to an old, very stretched out set though, and depending on your height, it may not be an issue. And/or I would anticipate that the bands may stretch out a little as you use them. Used every day since purchase so all in all a solid product so far!",5.0
"Great, sturdy, and easy to use. Clips catch on a little rough though so it a little difficult to change out cables swiftly.",5.0

"I've been using the bands for a while now and they are heavy duty top quality. The bands are very easy to swap out quickly durning workouts. The band also comes with a door anchor (which is very durable). Also included is a ankle strap for leg workouts. A nice bag is included which will fit all your bands and equipment for traveling. Another great thing about Black Mountain is when i opened my package I had a promo flyer which said that they would give me a free Orange band (35-40) just for purchasing their products. Black Mountain is a family ran business that puts alot of thought and care into their products. The customer service is great as well and the bands come with lifetime warranties. Don't wait, just buy, you won't regret it!.",5.0
"I haven't been using these for long, but so far I think this is a great set of resistance tubes. They are better quality than the ones I've used in physical therapy. I love being able to clip one or more bands onto the handles in order to increase the tension/resistance. Not that I'm at that level yet, but it's great to know I can go beyond just these five bands. It also comes with an ankle strap, a door anchor, and a nice, nylon zipper bag.

I went ahead and got the resistance band workout book to go with this set, and together I think it will be easy to get a good workout at home or if/when travelling. I would definitely look to this company again for further accessories for this set when it comes time to build on it or if anything starts to wear out.",5.0
"I've gotten cheaper versions of these over the years. The Black Mountain bands are excellent quality. The handles swivel smoothly and have a good grip. Lots of range in band resistance, and you can double up on bands to customize the resistance. Black Mountain will probably be my go-to vendor for workout equipment from now on.",5.0

I have had the bands for three weeks now and they work well. The variable resistance makes it easy for my wife and I to both use the bands without it taking long. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a quick and easy way to workout at home or anywhere they have a door.,5.0
"This is a great product.  I use it regularly, I've recommended it to clients, and I've also utilized it as part of the employee wellness programs I'm affiliated with.  They have great customer service as well; the stitching on one of my handles came undone and they replaced it no questions asked.",5.0
"I've had these bands for over a year. They are still in great shape after being used about 5 times a week. I love the option to ""stack"" them which allows you to increase your resistance as you get stronger. The ease in using these in the door make this a perfect option for anyone with out a large room to exercise in and ideal for someone traveling. They are easy to use and come with a guide that tells you how much weight each band equals in case you forget. Definitely worth the purchase price!",5.0

"I have a son who is a gamer.  Yes, he sits all day staring at his monitor, thrilled to be racking up new scores or acheiving trophies.  Gaming does nothing in the department of young male strength development.  Purchased this set and arranged it on his chair so he can celebrate with ""exercise"".  Them biceps will be bulging in no time.  Well at least that is a fathers hope before I resort to cutting the electricity and sending him outdoors.",5.0

"I bought these for physical therapy since I had a health problem and lost all of my endurance, muscle etc and could not jump into weights right away..  I've been using them for a 2 weeks now and already seeing a difference.  There are hundreds of different exercises you can do with these and yes you will feel the burn even on the lowest weight unless you are already built.  High quality good price",5.0

"I like how exercise bands offer exercises that would otherwise take up a lot of space in a home if using weight benches, dumbbells, etc. So far so good as far as durability goes. Haven't used them all that much so I'll probably update at a later time.

Has anyone tried using a tricep rope, hand bars, etc attached to the bands on a door? I'm wondering if the triceps rope, bars would damage the bands.

A suggestion for the company Black Mountain would be to make a longer booklet of exercises you can do with these bands or a DVD.",5.0

I received these band as a Christmas present and I have had to travel for business several times since I've received them.  They are not a staple when I'm packing up.  Some of the hotel fitness centers do not have weights or if I don't feel like leaving my room I have what I need.  Also eliminates the excuses not to get a workout in.  I also use them at home.  Very nice bands and the attachments are great to have and easy to use.,5.0

"Love these bands! I used the Gold Gym bands before and the ends tend to wear easily and appear to almost snap.

Not these though. I used them for 8 months now and they are still strong.  It comes with a ankle strap, exercise chart, and a door anchor. All of this in a near and tiny bag.  A definite must for resistance bands.",5.0
"I recently purchased these bands along with a RiversEdge Wall mount exercise station for rehab in my chiropractic office.  These bands are high quality, thick and flexible with strong grommets.  The handgrips and straps are quality made not some of the cheap kind that you do find on here. It comes with a traveling case that I use for some of my out of office clients.  Overall, absolutely love my investment, not only for the office but for patient's benefit.",5.0
"I take this with me to train clients on the go and on every vacation!  I love that the handles easily change from one strap to the other, or you can double them up!  The door attachment is GREAT too!  This is a perfect item for any fitness buff.  Perfect for people who travel a lot but can't rely on hotel gyms.  This kit has almost everything you need.  The carrying bag is nice too.",5.0
great set for home work outs.,5.0
"Update 09/02/16:
After a couple of years, the black band finally wore through at the center, mostly from abrasion against the edges of the door strap.  The red band got so stretched out it can't be far behind.  I used those two bands for pretty much every workout, though.

The great part - I e-mailed BMP about the replacement band warranty, Rich responded in a day, and had my replacements in the mail immediately at no cost to me!  I just got them a couple days later.  Fantastic service, and a great product I'll continue to use for my home and travel workouts!

Original Review:
I'm a lifelong weightlifter and bought these to take on a several-month trip where I wouldn't have access to a gym.  They worked great once I got used to the difference of using resistance bands instead of regular weights.  I mostly used the red, black and blue together for heavier exercises like standing bicep curls (the bands passing under my feet to anchor them), took off the blue for tricep pulldowns and lat rows, used just the red for front and lateral delt raises, and so on.

Coupled with other bodyweight-only exercises I got a full, toning workout while traveling.  I didn't build up muscle, but I stayed in good shape.  And if you roll the bands up carefully, the whole bag flattens down nicely to fit in the front outside pocket of a suitcase.

The anchor-strap was great with almost every doorway I used it on, too...there were a couple that were obviously too weak to support the kind of stress I was going to put on them.  And you have to place it so the strap won't slide towards you the first time you pull, or you might do very minor damage to the wood or paint.",5.0
Great bands.  Only thing I wish it would have come with was a booklet with how to use them/exercises.  It came with a small 2-page pamphlet but a beginnings guide would have been great.  Equipment is great though! 5 stars.,5.0
no more trainer  these r great and so convenient  i just wish they came with an extra set of hand grips,5.0
Loving doing my bicep curls and tricep extensions using these.  You can't go wrong for the price and the utility.,5.0
"Purchased this product a month ago. Quality is outstanding, the construction was so good, I purchased additional resistance tubes, and ankle attachments directly from the manufacturer. They delivered immediately and the quality of service and support is outstanding. If you want resistance tubes, buy BMP. The only option!!!

Purchased this product again for a family member!",5.0
Great product and fast delivery,5.0
"Started adding these to my home fitness routine a few weeks ago. They work great and are very easy to set up and use. They're a simple and cheap replacement to going to the gym.

Customer service at Black Mountain Products seems great. They're running a promotion where I just need to write a review, and I get free equipment. Yes, please! Very generous indeed.",5.0
I'm glad to have come across these resistant bands. I spend most of my weekends in hotels and don't really like using hotel Gyms as they are pretty limited. These bands which come with different levels of resistance that allow for an unlimited set of exercises that can be done comfort of any room really. If you're looking for a compact yet extensive resistance training product I would suggest you take a good look at this set of resistance bands.,5.0
These bands are the reason my pain has been manageable.,5.0
Arrived quickly and is a quality product. Instructions included several useful exercisers and it is easy to find additional exercises through a web search for specific muscle groups.,5.0
This product is new to me ... I recently finished a cycle  of physical therapy for a triple herniated disk ... these bands are true life savers... the quility of all the items it's top notch .. everything looks like it will last for years ... I think the handles are perfect comfort for all work outs .. also the door latch is perfect for any door I tired .. the strap for the leg is very comfortable  and breathes welll ... I have larger ankles and the straps fit me with no issue ... If I could change anything .. maybe put the weight of the band on the band.... but only using for 1 month I love the  bands ... I will deff be trying all the creative work outs  that come with the bands... it's also very affordable all that can be done with the bands it's less than One month at a gym .. I would recommend this product to all ages and abilities ... it's truly a work out item that you will grow with and never grow out of...,5.0
These resistance bands are great! they are convenient because they fit into a small black bag that is included. There are instructions that indicate how much weight each band is supposed to be. It would be great fi this set could have two pair of handles so a couple can work out together but I am sure I can buy a second pair otherwise. An in house weight system.,5.0
They smell horrendous. Like a hospital. I put them outside so my apartment wouldn't smell. I then took them back inside so the sun wouldn't crack the rubber. I put them back outside when I got home from work today. My sliding glass door is very heavy.,5.0
Great for the price!,5.0
"I share an Amazon account with my boyfriend, and we both use these bands at home. Overall, they are a very nice set of basic resistance bands.

The foam handles are firm and feel comfortable in the hand, and the carabiners that connect the actual bands to the handles are sturdy and easy to use. The anchor band is thick and well-stitched, so I expect it will last for a while even with all the chafing between door hinge and frame. Stepping on the bands is okay, but it might be a good idea to purchase a cover or protective sleeve if you plan to do this a lot. Also, for those who are concerned about the ""universality"" of the lengths, we have found they work well for both of us even though I am 4' 9"" tall and he is 6' 1"". Just make sure you give yourself enough room!

One suggestion brought up by my boyfriend: the anchor band is vertical when used in a door frame (unless at the very top or bottom) but many exercises require stretching the bands horizontally. It's a minor point, but this could be off-putting since the resistance is tilted vertically - perhaps an anchor band that swivels to allow pulling from all directions?",5.0
"I purchased this resistance band set because it included the door attachment. I have an at-home workout that requires a pull-up bar, but I knew I wasn't ready for one of those. These bands with the door attachment have helped me build upper-body strength without a pull-up bar. They also have a lifetime guarantee. I have recommended these bands to anyone who is looking for an alternative to a pull-up bar.",5.0
"excellent set. recovering from shoulder surgery,  perfect.",5.0
The nice addition to the home gym.,5.0
This is my first set of bands and they are working very well.  I've had them for 2 months now and use them almost everyday.  Being able to attach multiple bands together makes it easy to get as little or as much resistance as you need.  I use the door anchor all the time and it has never failed me yet. The bag is nice to have to since it makes for easy storage in my small apartment.  The metal clips do make them a bit loud when you are fumbling around with them but as long as you aren't working out with a person trying to sleep in the same room then it doesn't really matter.,5.0
Great quality resistance bands to help with toning my muscles,5.0
"I am a distance runner, and I bought these resistance bands to do targeted strength training for my legs. These bands are fantastic and very high quality. The best factor with these bands in my mind is that they have the carabiner attachments on each end. This means you can attach them to different handles / straps and you can combine multiple bands together for added resistance - something you can't do with most resistance bands on the market. I frequently use the door anchor and ankle strap together, and it works perfect. I'm very satisfied with these bands.

UPDATE: I have since purchased a second set of these bands to start a more thorough home exercise routine with the right combination of bands. I use these bands every day, 5 days per week, rotating through various neck/shoulder, chest, arm, leg, and back exercises. I have been doing this routine for several months now, and they work perfectly.",5.0

Good for working those muscles when you can't get out to the gym. Bought for my sister who is primarily home bound and in a wheel chair so she can so some muscle strengthening workouts.,5.0
"First, shipping was very fast and the company provided their number so you can reach them directly. Bands are incredible - very well made, sturdy and I expect these will last for many years. I think the scale of pounds per resistance bands is true to the rating. I would like something stronger than the red and black bands for squats and lunges.  Men will need heavier bands than women, especially for a lower body workout. It does come with a detailed book detailing the various full body workouts using the bands.  I will definitely be taking this with me on my work trips as I can do these in my hotel room.",5.0

I have been using my bands for over a year and am still enjoying them. They are extremely durable made with top quality materials as they are still in perfect shape after being used everyday for at least 2-3 hours a day. I highly recommend Black Mountain Products!,5.0
"Have used these for about 2 years as a part of my P90X program and never had a problem.  This morning, however, I noticed a small tear in the green band and, just assuming I had somehow pierced it with something, went online to buy a replacement.  Lo and behold, I saw on the Q&A that the parts are under a lifetime warranty. Called 815-322-202, told them my problem, they got my info and are sending out a replacement free of charge; whole thing took 2 minutes of my time.  Great customer service!!",5.0
"Purchased this product to offer us something to do on days when we can't make it to the gym.  This product has exceeded our expectations.  We have ordered more door stoppers, handles, and all of the available bands so that we can maximize our workouts at home as well as work out at the same time.  You are able to replicate nearly everything you can do at the gym with these bands.  We had our trainer come to the house and show us some things to do as well have have found many videos online that offer a variety of workout ideas and exercises.  We've used this product for a couple of weeks now and have not anything but great workouts and options for exercise outside of the gym.  My husband and I both are able to do a variety of workouts that benefit our bodies.  He is able to use the heavier rated bands to give himself the weight resistance he needs while I am able to do the same with the lighter rated bands.  Great in home system that can be used by all family members.",5.0
what a great deal!!!,5.0
This set is very effective for keeping tone. The product is nicely designed and easy to use. The company that supplies the product is very responsible and will always try to make things right if you should have a problem. I highly recommend this set of resistance bands.,5.0
"I've been using the bands for a few weeks now and am really happy with this purchase.  I like how easy it is to quickly get some strength building exercise done in the morning.  I tend to use the same band for all of the exercises I do, but it's easy to switch whenever  I want.  These are good quality, no fear of them breaking. The handles are comfortable to hold and feel so much more stable than therapy bands.  I was a little disappointed in the print quality and content of the included pamphlet of exercises. However, I checked their website and found better photos and instructions there.  I like that these are so compact, take up no space in my house, don't collect dust like a whole rack of weights would.  They cost so much less too.",5.0
I am new to resistance band training so this is my first set.  The bands are good quality and I love the handle - I have used therapy bands before with no handles and I'm not a fan of that.  BMP offers great customer service.  These provide me an easy way to get a quick work out when I'm running short on time.,5.0

"I've bought three sets of these things and love them!

I, unfortunately, lost my first set when I was living overseas and bought another one when I came back home and can't imagine using another brand. The quality is fantastic. The bands themselves are very resilient and last a very long time. I haven't had one snap on me yet (and yes, I have had that with other brands, like Gold's Gym) and am very happy with everything BMP includes in the bag. It's very easy to swap out bands, I really appreciate the cheat sheet the include to see the different what resistances is equivalent to what weight, although I wish they would upload a PDF copy of it to their site.

I've recommended this set to my friends and have bought one as a present for someone who was starting fitness for the New Year. Great product all around!",5.0
I've had a few more days to use the Black Mountain Resistance bands.  They are good quality holding up to my most strenuous efforts of fitness.  They came with a good guide  showing you how to get the most benefit from their use.  I was surprised at how flexible they are to fit your needs and it's easy to step up to the next level of effort.  They show no wear and I think they will last extremely well.  You can't go wrong trying these.,5.0

"I was looking for a way to get a workout in at home on the days where I can't make it to the gym.  I ordered these bands and have been very pleased with the quality of the bands, and the ease of working out with them at home in limited space.  You really don't need much equipment to get in an effective workout!  If you are new to using resistance bands, there are many great workouts posted on You Tube to follow.  Just type ""resistance band"" in the search box and choose one that targets the area you want to work on.  I use my Roku (also ordered on Amazon ) to stream You Tube on my TV so I can easily follow the many different exercise band video's to give me a complete workout - no trainer needed :).  I am thrilled with the ability to get in a great workout at home with these bands and they will be easy to travel with too!",5.0

I have used these bands for about a week now. I really like these bands and I found the quality was very good. I think I would at some point buy a couple more handles so I didn't have to change up the handles for each exercise. These would be great for traveling and the carry bag is handy and well made. The only complaint would be the website exercise routines. I wish the photos were bigger and/or they had videos of each of the exercises.

"These bands are excellent. I have used them on a regular basis for the past two weeks. Each day I use one or two different resistance levels. The straps are strong. The handles are comfortable. The quality seems great. I really like the ability to stack multiple bands at the same time to increase the resistance. The only thing I can think of that would make them better is a label for each, showing the resistance lbs. Without it, I had to cut out the piece of paper detailing this and tape it to the wall.",5.0

I haven't popped one yet, so that's a plus!  The metal on the bands and handles seem really sturdy.  The door anchor holds very well.  These things can really injure people if they were to pop or not be anchored well, so I am very satisfied with the quality and safety they have provided thus far.",5.0

"These resistance bands are the first I have ever had so I don't have anything to compare with but I am very pleased with them. Since retiring, I needed something to help me exercise and keep my strength up and these do the job. Very nice quality and a great price. The only complaint I have is that the handles seem a bit too narrow for my hands. I don't think that my hands are large compared to a lot of guys, but when gripping and using them, the webbing coming out of each end rubs against both sides of my hands. It's not a big problem though so I do recommend them.",5.0

These bands are very durable & the handles have a nice feel. The accessories the bands come with are handy as well. The only con I found with using these bands is that I have to swap the handles when I want to use a different band since it only came with one set of handles. I mosly use these bands with a wall station and overall they have met my expectations.,5.0
These resistance bands are AWESOME!  I recently started a personal training business and purchased these bands as part of my mobile operation.  I work with fairly heavy and tall people so I was concerned about my clients being able to stand on and extend the bands in certain movements.  I've been using them for weeks now and they are VERY DURABLE!  The are easy to switch up and the door jam works on every door I've tried with no slipping.  I am going to purchase another set soon just in case I start teaching group sessions.  The price happens to be pretty awesome too!  I love these bands!,5.0

This boat came packaged in its original box with a label written on it.  One of the oars was broken.  It wouldn't have been a bad deal if it came packaged properly and didn't get damaged in the mail.,1.0
Too small to really do anything in. The floor popped on first use. Boat received was also deformed at the seem. Junk boat.,1.0
"After reading the mixed reviews about the leaking problem, I decided to blow this thing up as soon as I got it to make sure it held air.  Well, it did not - there were three sharp cuts/slits on the inside of this boat on the side.  I called Intex to let them know and they said it was Amazon's problem, not theirs.  Make sure if you order one of these you blow it up as soon as you receive it so you have time to send it back for replacement or credit.",1.0
"The very first time I inflated this product, it would not hold a seal and deflated after just a few minutes. I tried re-inflating it several times to no avail. This thing is worthless. Pony up for something better.",1.0
Deflates to easy after filling with air and going into water.would not buy this again.but other than that it was fast shipment,1.0
"First, I knew when I got this that it is for CALM WATERS.  I will tell you exactly why...

On the front of the boat, there is a ""knob"" where you can put the pull string rope (or whatever you want to call it).  If you hold on to that, and pull it, the spot where it is attached with DETATCH from the boat, causing a huge hole, and a fast deflation.  It was my fault for taking it in waters that were not calm, but the fact that it detached is worrisome since it makes a HUGE HOLE when it comes loose.

It was easy to blow up but the pump that came with it sucked.  Was easier to blow up without the pump.

We never used the paddles.

It should have a rope along the edges to give the kids something to hold onto.",1.0
"i took this on our vacation for my grandchildren, we blow it up and it did not last an hour ,took it home only to find a tear in the seem of the boat. we had some disapointed kids. i feel it must have been defected. we saw exactly the same 200 explorer all week long with other people at the same resort even a 100 explorer held up. i was not a happy camper",1.0
We pulled out the boat to use- it was brand new out of the box and the seam in the back is not sealed so it won't hold air.,1.0
One of the boats shipped came with a large hole in it. Since they require me to ship it back at my expense I tried fixing it with the enclosed patch. The boat was flat again in less then a day. Total garbage and they shipped it that way! This is terrible.,1.0
"This raft started leaking within 30 seconds of being placed in the water. I tried to paddle back to shore, but the paddles were so ineffective that my friend had to pull me back in. Do not buy this product unless a child wants to use it as a swimming pool toy - don't even think of using it in a lake or creek.",1.0
I bought 2 of these boat's I have not used them yet to see how they hold up. My problem is the description said that came with paddles and a pump but the paddles and the pump were not in the box. If would have known that I would have bought just the boat for 9.99 on amazon and not this one. Thanks for making me spend more of my money then I should have too and also for the false advertisement .,1.0
I had no idea this boat was a toy. It said so in the ad but it wasn't made clear. When I received the package I was in shock. It was a tiny little box. I got it for an adult male. It won't work for him. Bt I am keeping it because my kids will play with it I'm sure.,1.0
"If your an adult looking to buy this raft for yourself or another adult don't waste your time and money. This product should be advertised as a toy, although it's rated to hold 200 pounds don't get the wrong idea. The vessel is hard to keep from folding and taking water on board the trick is to displace your center wieght almost like your lying down, this will keep the boat a float but it's really hard to paddle in that position. As a boat being tugged or lazy floats about it could be beneficial somewhat or for a pool toy for kids you can again somewhat get your money's worth out of it.
One more thing; to inflate this raft takes a good bit of time, the pumps works but not that efficiently and furthermore it will take you longer to deflate the toy than it did to inflate.",1.0
"I bought two boats for my grandsons birthday, we were going to the mountains, we can not see where it leakes the boys are so sad.",1.0
"I ordered this boat but received a completely different and cheaper boat. Instead of the pink Intex RECREATION explorer that iIorder I got the orange explorer 200 which was cheaper than the one I ordered, but when I called customer service they said there is nothing they can do because they have the same model# I feel very cheated! And if I would try and return it will still have to pay a25% restocking fee",1.0

"The description for this item is incorrect as noted in other reviews. The item description shows made in USA as does the product picture. Similar items are half the cost knowing they are made in china. The product might be fine but as a matter of princliple, I cannot accept bait and switch tactict even if it was a mistake. This was reported in other published reviews from 2016 and not corrected. My last review was rejected so lets hope this gets through.",1.0

"I have ordered this item twice and it hasn't come with the two plugs, one inflation adaptor and a 24 exercise guide poster as stated in the product descrption.

"I ordered the yellow 45cm Pro-Series ball from ToysNGamesEtc. When it arrived, the package included the deflated ball, an inflation hookup, pins to plug the hole, and a tool to remove the pins. No instructions. No measuring tape. But fine, as long as the ball itself does the job, we could do without the missing items. Fully inflated, it turns out the ball is 30+cm shorter in diameter than it should be--I measured the circumference and divided by Pi, and just in case my math was off I also placed it against a wall, placed a box on the other side, and measured the space in between. It was 111cm. My son is 4'3""--we were worried this would be too big for him since the lower height range is 4'7"", but instead his knees are pushed up under his chin. And on top of that, it's NOT a Pro-Series. Comparing what I received to Thera-Band's website, it's their standard ball.

RETURN.",1.0
The plug supplied with tha ball won't hold the pressure. It doesn't make sense to always have to reflate it.,1.0
"I expected 45 cm to be 10 cm smaller then 55 cm.
The quality of the ball is great, i expected a larger ball.",1.0
not comfortable to sit on which is why I bought it.,1.0
Package was open and there was no plug for ball. Can't even use it. Disappointed.,1.0
"I've used Thera-Band balls at the place where I got physical therapy and I know they are great quality. The issue I had was that the ball I received did not come with an adapter that would allow me to inflate it with a bicycle pump, nor did it come with a plug. So basically it was unusable, as you can't inflate it without a plug to stop the air from exiting once it's inflated. Also, if you don't get an adapter for a bicycle pump, you will need some sort of pump that can fit into the hole of this ball to inflate it.

As much as I love the brand, I would recommend a different ball that comes as a kit with a hand pump, plug, etc. I ended up getting a GAIAM ball and have been very pleased.",1.0
"If you want the slow deflate feature, this is the wrong ball. The logo on the ball should say Pro Series if it's the slow deflate system.

Secondly, I could never get this to inflate to 65 cm. The highest I could get was 61 cm and that was after multiple attempts. I'm 5' 4"" with long legs and that put me at about a right angle, and I need my thighs to be higher than my knees.",1.0
I wish I could give zero stars. The ball did not last more than a day and developed a crack. I am glad I wasn't sitting on it when it deflated.,1.0
"IT was sent to me with no package material, just a plastic cover with a ball inside with no instruction. the official package is abscent",1.0
This ball will not stay inflated! It needs to be reinflated every 2 days. I am frustrated beyond belief - who has time to be reinflating a ball every 2 days? Beyond crap. And missed the return deadline. Bah. Such a waste of money.,1.0
"I ordered this product 2 separate times (the 65 cm ball).  The first time, it wasn't the Slow-Delate System, it was just a normal Thera-Band.  So I returned it and got the same incorrect product again.  Amazon partially refunded me for the inconvenience and I kept the normal Thera-Band ball.  I didn't inflate it for awhile, but when I did, the ball's the incorrect size.  It's only 53 cm instead of the 65 cm ball that I ordered (I even let it 'settle' like the instructions recommend).  I don't know if the seller is selling fake Thera-Band balls or what, but it is definately not what it should be.  Order from someone else.",1.0
One thing that people don't mention is the sizing issues with this ball. The 75 cm is  not actually 75. The company I bought it from told me to re-inflate it to loosen it up couple of times but no change. I am 6 foot 2 and this thing fully inflated  is no where close to 75 cm. It's quite disappointing.,1.0
"This product was shipped promptly, but it won't remain inflated after I put air in it. I anticipated better after buying a big name product like Thera band.",1.0
"Bought this product for my pregnant wife and ended up returning it because when we tried to inflate it, it didn't even come close to its stated size.  Have not decided whether we're going to buy another one or go with a different brand.",1.0
When I opened the box and pulled the ball apart my hands became covered in a thin layer of an oil like substance.  I returned the product because I didn't expect to have to spend my time degreasing it before my first use.,1.0
"The company that sells Theraband products has been very helpful and replaced the ball when I complained. Unfortunately, the second ball wasn't much better than the first - both were not spherical but more oblong like an egg. This makes it difficult to do some of my exercises. Seems like a new cheap Chinese model versus the model I bought several years ago which is very round and works well.",1.0
There wasn't a pump included in shipment to blow up the exercise ball.  I still don't have it blown up because I have to purchase a pump even though a pump was to be included in shipment! I have another ball I got from a store and I love it!  I probably will not use the one I got from here because it is more of a hassle than fun!,1.0
These r trash get Rivers or Kutrick or MPG or Lucky or Envy but not these I went high speed on these and they literally melted,1.0
I bought these for a project that doesn't require precision but I'm still shocked at how bad these wheels are. The bearings came too crooked to even fit onto an axle so I had to remove them and reset them. The rubber molding is wobbly and has a high spot when spinning (runout) I imagine if I actually used these wheels riding on a scooter I would be bouncing down the road as if they had a flat spot. I didn't return these because for my project it doesn't matter but I wanted anyone who would use these on a scooter to know not to get these.,1.0
Bought as replacement wheels for my daughter's scooter.  She wore off all the rubber and is down to the rim in less than 2 weeks.  Junk,1.0
"These wheels are VERY SOFT. My son used them for 3 days and they have worn down out-of-round. They have huge flat spots and now I'm looking for another replacement set!  And before anyone starts thinking ""well, he must have been hard on it"", no. The original wheels from Razor have been on there for over 6 years, this was a hand-me-down from a neighbor. I replaced them because the bearings were worn out, the wheel itself was still in good condition.  See pics!!!

Update 6/11/17. Replacement wheels arrived today. These are direct replacement from Razor. I believe these will be great!  Notice the difference in the last 2 pics.",1.0
"We bought these wheels as replacements for a Razor A4 that my daughter has been riding for 6 months with the original wheels that come with the Razor A4 scooter .  We installed the new wheels last week and they are already worn down!  The product that they are made of must be way too soft to withstand scootering since they should last WAY longer than a week.

way too big for a razor,1.0
"These wheels were a really big disappointment for a number of reasons.

First off, I bought the purple color expecting a deep hue like the one pictured but instead received a dull transparent grey that was really unappealing. I wish I had remembered to take a picture before packing it back up for return but was honestly so appalled by what they thought could pass for ""purple"" that I completely forgot. Lol.

Secondly, they felt so cheaply made. Sure, they were lightweight, but the wheel itself doesn't have much depth. If you look closely at the picture, the plastic from the spoke part extends into the rubber, leaving you with not that much to work with. I imagine these would wear down incredibly quickly, even for casual riders.

Third, the bearings are ABEC-5 but there are better quality wheels on Amazon at the same price point with ABEC-7 or even ABEC-9 bearings for a smoother ride.

Unfortunately can't recommend these.",1.0
Received old stock wheels. Not as advertised. I'm going to see if I can make them work. Thanks amazon for making things difficult.,1.0
I ordered the wrong wheels. Had to send them back. I needed Ripstik wheels,1.0
Did not do what I want it to do,1.0
"The first time they arrived, they seemed brilliant... one went out within 2 hours of using it. That night, I complained to the company to send a new one. The next day, the second light went out. Yesterday, a replacement wheel arrived, and a burred piece of metal was stuck to the bearing... it splintered deep into my thumb, and I cant get it out. It hurts.

All that being said, I think this company needs to improve the machining of this product. And I am 200 LBs... I think it is a fine product for someone less than 100 LBs, but they should have a weight rating. And I should get my money back.",1.0
"Received wrong items, it was not for scooter. Now stuck with the item order. I taught when I search it was for ripstik.",1.0
"These wheels are too small. They still fit on the scooter, so we are keeping them. There is no indication of the size of the wheels, so it's my fault I guess for ordering them. However, I did search for Razor A3 wheels, and this is what came up, so I trusted Amazon's search engine to get it right. Oh, well.",1.0
I wish you would show the size of the wheels in inches.  I have to return them because they are too small.,1.0
"I understand that there's not much to this particular item, but if Amazon is going to offer several different colors (and charge a different price for each), the least they can do is provide the color that you order.  The package I received has two red wheels in packaging that says 'clear'.  And while I don't really care what color they are, I'm sure my 9-year-old will.  So don't pay extra for a specific color because you might not get what you pay for.",1.0
After only 30 minutes of riding the braking was causing the wheels to be unstable. Also the wheel was too big to fit into the front spot.,1.0

"I finally got around to actually using this rack after having it in my garage for over a year.
 I discovered that it does NOT mount properly on my car which is listed on the box as a car that it will fit.
Since the company advertises a lifetime warranty, I contacted them to explain the details of my mounting problem.
this company has very bad customer service, and refused to consider my problem, reply that they try their product on every car before they approve it. I tried to explain that the hooks on their straps can actually mash and damage the black weather stripping on the back lift latch door. I have a 2006 PT Cruiser. I could not get customer service to let me talk to someone more technically understanding.
I could not recommend this company based on my experience.",1.0

"Online it says that it fits most SUVs, minivans, etc. When the package arrived, right on the back of the box it lists which cars it does and does not fit.

"After hearing my husband talk about traveling with our families bikes for a year, this Father's Day I bought him this rack. My husband said the packaging was horrible, I wasn't around for that. After struggling to install (which wasn't a total nightmare after watching numerous videos online) I double checked the contact points to make sure there wasn't going to be any scratches (HA!! THAT WAS MY BIGGEST WORRY!!)))) It took us about an hour to figure out how to load our bikes (1 man's, 1 woman's, 1 kid's, and 1 tiny without training wheels) with heaviest closest to the car. They fit snugly, and it took a little maneuvering.  We took it for a test run to a local trail. Unfortunately, a huge storm rolled in and we opted to head home, (the whole time I was watching the bikes bob up and down over little bumps in the road, worried about the paint on our car).  We got home and unloaded the bikes when we saw what this rack did to our trunk. The whole thing was pulled out of alignment! It doesn't close with out one of us pushing it forward while the other closes it. Now for a $100 rack, we are going to need body work done on our car, but I suppose we were fortunate that the rack didn't scratch our car.  I am still waiting for a response from Allen. What a cruddy Father's Day gift!",1.0
I tried several times to tighten rack on the back of my 2005 Honda element.  No matter how tight the straps are the rack still shifts side to side and the top bumper moves off of the hatch.  Of course I try this on the first nice day since Christmas (when it was purchase as a gift for my wife) and now it is to late to return it.  Even if I was able to get it to be secure the metal it grabs on to around the rear hatch and it will scrap up the paint and possibly bend the metal.  Maybe good for other cars but don't get it for a Honda element.,1.0
"I tried this bike holder on both my Toyota Sienna and my Honda Civic and in both cases, despite painstaking efforts to avoid it, the rack rubbed paint off the cars.  Further, we had 3 (not the limit of 4) bike on the rack and it appeared to be screaming OVERLOAD, despite the fact that 2 of the 3 bikes were made from mostly aluminum. It was also difficult to get 3 bikes on this rack (handlebars and all) so I'm not sure how one would get 4 on there.  It also appeared/felt unstable, not a good feelings as you are rolling down the road.",1.0

We bought this bike rack to transport bikes from VA to SC for Spring Break.

"This rack actually fit fine and carried the bikes properly. But on the very first use, the most important top hook dis-attached from its strap (must have been glued/sewed improperly).

"Update - June 17 2013 - We've had this rack for 2 years and used it a few times, definitely less than 10 times total.  We used it yesterday, on Father's Day, and a strap broke while driving down the highway.  We avoided accidents by the grace of god but lost 3 of our bikes as one was tossed and crushed while the other 2 were dragged and rendered useless.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, I hope Allen Co makes good on this because this is not a good product

Aug 2011 - I purchased this rack in June and finally was able to use it in August.  It is fantastic - held 4 bikes with no issues what-so-ever.  We have 2-26"", 1-20"" and 1-12"" bikes.  We followed the comments of others & fit them like a puzzle piece.  We did buy the extra bar for female bikes as well as velcro straps - all were exactly what we needed.  We drove 400 miles round trip & they barely budged at all (going 80 mph).
I have a Nissan Murano ('10) and assembly took less than 2 minutes.  Our other car is a Mercedes C class and assembly/use on that is the same - quick & easy!
Highly recommend!",1.0

"I bought this rack to replace an old 3-bike rack that we had for years. We never had a problem with that one. After reading the reviews, I put the rack on the van ahead of time to be sure that it felt secure. It seemed okay, but 1 hour into a trip with 4 bikes on the back of the van, the rack collapsed, denting my tailgate and one of the bikes. I weighed the bikes, and we were not above the 140 lbs that they say it will hold. The problem was caused by the top straps not staying tight. We had to put one of the bikes in the back of the van and tie a knot in the straps at the buckle in order to get to a friend's house, where we could borrow a different bike rack and leave one of the bikes behind. I will be calling Allen tomorrow, but I do not expect much. Beware- this product may be an expensive risk to take!!!",1.0
"My 2004 audi A4 cabriolet was listed as compatible on their website, but the bottom two sponges pressed on the bumper so hard with 3 bikes (1 adult and 2 kids) that it cracked and permanently dented my plastic bumper cover. Hence, I am telling you now that the 2004 Audi A4 is NOT COMPATIBLE. in addition, the clips that go onto the side of the trunk was a V shape, say 10 degrees, but it was too small an angle so I could not easily close the trunk. the 10 degree angle was so narrow that the clip could not attach flush onto the trunk lid. as such, the only way that I could close the trunk was to slam it shut and accept the fact that my paint was going to get scuffed by the clip.

I am pretty sure that changing the design so that the 2 sponges that come into contact with the bumper are made wider, such as 1 foot wide total instead of the existing 2 x 2 inch wide sponges, it would put less weight per square inch. at the very least, it would likely not crack the plastic like it did for me.

If you have an all metal bumper, you should be fine, but a bumper with a plastic cover may be a problem.

if you can get a roof rack or tow hitch rack, you may be better off.",1.0

We also had a hitch mount they sent us....We only traveled about 20 minutes away and thought we better make sure it's holding up...It wasn't, the pin was coming out. It came out of one of the holes. We weren't taking any more chances. We contacted the company once again.  They sent us 2 racks previously without fixing the problems. This last time we wanted our money back. They told us we couldn't get our money back because we must have caused the damage and it wasn't covered under warranty!!!!

I will never purchase anything from this company again!!!!",1.0
"I never got to use the product.  Online it says that it fits most SUVs, minivans, etc.  When the package arrived, right on the back of the box it lists which cars it does and does not fit.  Mine, of course, was listed as one it does NOT fit.  That info should be listed online because then I would have known to never buy it in the first place.",1.0
"We read all the reviews before purchasing.  All but one seemed to be very good, so we figured the one bad review had just installed the item improperly.  We wished that we had listened!  We installed the rack on our minivan and double checked it to make sure all was sturdy.  We were only traveling about 2 miles and only carrying 2 bikes, but the portion of the rack that was against the top part of the hatch completely crushed the car hatch and the bikes were nearly falling off the vehicle.  This product should not be used on a minivan!!!!!  We have quite a bit of damage for a 2 mile ride and needless to say we are returning the item for another car rack.  If you own a minivan, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!",1.0
"We purchased the Allen Deluxe 4-Bike Trunk Mount Rack for a recent camping trip.  We wanted to take all four of our bikes but neither of our vehicles is equipped with a hitch.  After researching racks both in local stores and online, this Allen rack seemed to be a good choice.  It was easy to mount on the car and held the bikes beautifully . . . in the driveway.  Even for a short trip around the neighborhood it seemed we had made a wise purchase.  However,  45 minutes from home and on a busy interstate during rush hour traffic, we were singing a different tune.  The rack collapsed and though the bikes did not actually fall off, they were being dragged along the highway at 65 miles an hour.  We had to call for help and then sit along the interstate with our two boys for over an hour.  There was damage to the rear bumper of the car to the tune of $644.  It became evident that it would have been cheaper to just rent four bikes for the week once we got to our destination.  I would not recommend trunk mounted (or non-hitch mounted) racks for anything over two bikes.  Even though we were well under the recommended total bike weight for the rack, it was just too much for the rack to handle.",1.0
I bought this bike for my three year old. He fell off the bike when he turned the corner and the handlebars fell off. The handlebars are positioned to low so it doesn't balance his weight evenly. I later purchased a plastic ride-on which he loves.,1.0
I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday. He is turning 3 in a few weeks and finally can touch the pedels. This toy should be for 3 and up. It has been basicly sitting on my porch for a year untouched. And the weather here is nice all year. Also a wheel fell  off. He barely ever used the bike. now he can reach the pedels and he can't ride it because we have to go buy a cap to hold on the wheel.,1.0
Total waste of money if you are using for golf. This unit that I purchased will give false readings on yardage and sometimes will not give yardage. Sent it back to Bushnell and they sent it back to me and said nothing was wrong. Save your money and buy a good rangefinder,1.0
"I got this item as a gift in the winter I could not use it until late summer. Bushnel says it was not made for golf but for hunting. It does not give true readings to the flag at all. It is advertised as using for that shot of a life time ,What a line of bull. They will do nothing for me because I did not contact them within 30 days. An impossibility since I could not try it for a few months. DO NOT BUY FOR GOLF!!!",1.0
"This item was returned for credit. It simply does not work outside of about 100 yards. Beyond 100 yards or so, when the flag was in front of any other target (i.e. trees, etc.) it would only register the farther away target. When only the flag was visible, it would not register the distance at all.",1.0

"Updated Review:

Inaccurate weight limits and capabilities of this pogo stick.

After owning this pogo stick for 8 months, the footpeg snapped. The predominant user of the pogo stick was a 5'2"" 108lb person and the other 2 were 5'7 and 5'10, 130lb and 185lb respectively. 185lbs is still 25lbs below the posted limit which didn't stop the footpeg from snapping off.

This is a heftier model than other versions of Flybar's pogo sticks but it's definitely not capable of doing the ""extreme jumping and technical pogo tricks"" it claims it's designed for. And for what it's worth, maybe it was the lack of extreme and technical pogoing that caused it's demise: the pogo stick never got past basic pogo jumping use. Still looking for replacement footpegs or even a modified footpeg to repair this pogo stick so if anyone knows of any vendors who do carry these parts, please leave a comment in the comments section. Would really hate to waste this pogostick on an inaccurate description and poor design.

If you're looking for a basic classic pogo stick, look no further. Basic design, no frills. Just remember to bend your knees out and jump and not hug the pogo stick with your knees or you'll knock them.",1.0
This was the third summer with this pogo stick. My son who has autism enjoys going on it. That is until one of the pedals snapped off and he became very upset. The description claims it withstands weight up to 210 lbs. My son is 185 lbs. Paying 103.00 for this it should've lasted a lot longer than just 3 summers 1 of which we were away for so actually it was 2 summers of use. I've been looking to possibly replace the pedals but no luck. I would have to buy another one which I can't afford right now. May as well buy a cheaper one that would probably last just as short.,1.0
Have had it for 2 months and the foot peg broke off with someone that was only 195 pounds.,1.0
"The width of the pogo stick bruised my son's legs, and he ended up duct-taping it and trying to make it work anyway so then it was too late for me to try to exchange or return it. He was really bummed, and tried to make it work.",1.0
"i bought this thinking it would be a fun thing to do at my college, little did i know it would break within the first minute if use... I'm 5'10"" 150 pounds well within the weight limit. one of the foot pegs completely broke off. i feel like this was a waste of money and want to know the return policy...",1.0
"When i first got this pogo stick, it worked fantastically, but i was constantly using it, and after about two months, the whole thing suddenly fell apart while i was jumping. So if you are going to be using this product a lot, invest in a better pogo stick! although if you are just occasionally going to be using it, its pretty good.

NOTE: DO NOT POGO INTO THE MUD WITH THIS EITHER! I DID A FEW TIME AND THE BOTTOM STOPPER FELL OFF AND I HAD TO REPLACE IT MULTIPLE TIMES WITH DUCT TAPE BALLS. DO NOT POGO INTO THE MUD!",1.0

Takes a super long time to blow up not for backpacking at all.,1.0
"The first one I bought, no air would go in the valve.  I was sent a replacement and with some work, I got the air in and then out so I could fold it and take it with me.  When I got it there, I had a hard time getting it to inflate and then when I slept on it, the air all leaked out and it was useless.",1.0
"This item came with a very visible hole on the top of the mattress. We needed it for immediate use so we put the patch in the box on the hole and still found another hole, which we patched also. The mattress still would not hold air. It must have been leaking at the seam. We couldn't find the third leak. It's useless! P.S. We should not have to patch a new item!",1.0
The mattress is not as durable as expected. A tear appeared in one of the folds on its second use. I will invest in an REI product that will last much longer than two uses.,1.0

"Terrible. I bought this for a camping trip in the smoky mountains, upon arriving I opened it up, aired it up, it fit perfectly in my 1 person tent. Once I went to bed that night, I laid down on it, and realized this is basically just a pool float. You know, those bright pink/blue/green floats you get every summer for like $1.99 at walmart? That's what this is. It's just a different color. Slept on it one night, then a second night. Come the 3rd night of my trip I laid down on it and realized it was a little flat, Figured it was just the air pressure in the mountains, but no, it wasn't. I aired it back up, went to sleep, woke up in the middle of the night laying on the freezing cold hard ground because this was completely flat. Terrible investment! Go to walmart and buy a pool float. or spend the $8 and get a twin sized mattress.",1.0
it arrived and would not inflate!!!! I was pissed off and I ordered a second one for guest but little did I know that this thing would make me wake up in pain. My back was so stiff. I felt as if I ran a marathon that I never trained for. Please skip there are better options. I have slept on many air mattresses and had a wonderful night sleep this was not worth a penny.,1.0
Popped on first night.,1.0

It's not a mattress. It's a pool raft. Way to thin and narrow to be referred to as a mattress.,1.0

Too hard to I flat.  Debating on returning it.,1.0
Awful...I think a pool float would have been more comfortable.  And it's a pain to inflate and deflate.  Wish I could return.,1.0
Too heavy to use for backpacking.  Really challenging to inflate.,1.0
I bought two of these.  Neither one retained air through the first night of camping.  So frustrating.,1.0
I go threw about 2 of them ah year they are comfortable but can damage easy i used mines in my bus because i work at night for the price its still worth it i could be paying up too 60 for ah better quality air mattress but am saving me the problem of having too replace it everytime it gets damage at that price and its not cheap but this one is jusy wished it came with its own sack too store it away,1.0

Garbage product. Do not buy!!,1.0
Do not buy this crap.  Inflatable pads are normally $50+ and you get what you pay for.  I brought mine up for a three night camp and after taking 20 minutes to blow it up I found it had an inch long gash in it.  I patched it up and it still didn't hold air!  Slept on ground for three nights.  Terrible.,1.0
"Bought 2 of these. The first had a hole in it and won't hold any air. The second, had a small seem separation and would slowly leak. You get what you pay for.",1.0
"This is not very well made. I filled it up each night and would wake up in the middle of the night practically on the ground. Pretty cheap, and pretty cheaply made. Would not recommend, and would not buy again.",1.0
This didn't even last one night of camping.  Leaked from the get go.  I would not buy again!,1.0
"I have no idea how comfortable this thing is to sleep on. I never got in inflated. It is virtually impossible to inflate orally. I knew it would take some effort, as all air mattresses do, but I mean virtually IMPOSSIBLE. The valve won't open by gently squeezing as they usually do. This thing requires a pump.

The problem with that is that it doesn't advertise anywhere that a pump is needed. The mattress didn't even come with instructions in the box. Now I realize that the instructions may be simple, but it should inform you that you need to get a pump, sold separately, or you can't use this mattress.

But even worse than all that is the last bit. As hard as it was to inflate, it was even harder to deflate. No matter what I did, I just couldn't get all the air out. That means it can't be fully compressed for easy storage.

I will be returning this immediately.",1.0
Inflated it the night after receiveing it ... already deflated .... i will reinflate to see if it was a fluke but if not I will be returning it to amazon.,1.0

Rolled it up gently and stored it clean, dry, and at room temperature. Took it on a camping trip in July '17 and found that it no longer holds air. Deflated completely in just a couple hours.

"Purchased this mattress last September for my wife. We used it once for a late season camp out. It seemed fine, and she said it was comfortable. Folded it back up after camping and stored it with the rest of the gear in the garage. Fast forward to this year. Went camping mid June and got all of the gear out of storage. everything was fine until we went to go to bed. This thing would not hold air. Attempted to air it up several times, but nope flat again in a few minutes. Turns out that where the mattress was folded the material had cracked where it had creased. Very Disappointing and a total waste. Glad we only wasted like 8 bucks on it. Made from cheap, garbage materials. I have other air mattresses that I have used for decades and they hold up fine under the same conditions this one failed under. Avoid this product, it is trash. Granted if you only want to use it once I guess its fine.",1.0
These don't hold air. I bought two for a two week camping trip and neither of them hold air. They both seem to have leaks around the valve. One has a slow leak and the other one leaks air right away.,1.0
"Impossible to inflate. Horrible, frustrating experience. I read every single review and answer about how to find a way to inflate this (""pinch the opening while being inflated"" etc.), and NOTHING worked. I wound up with a cramped hand and a bad mood. Even called the manufacturer's customer service for assistance--they were unable to help. I only felt better when I was able to return this to Amazon for a full refund.",1.0
"Mattress took about ten minutes to inflate when camping and 5 minutes to deflate due to small valve (this should be an issue; worked for one night, then split during the second night of use in a soft-use camping site, definitely do not recommend and I am not able to get a refund. The second issue might have just been a defective one that I bought with a bad seam but the small valve that takes a while to inflate will be on every mattress.",1.0
I get it this is a cheap mattress however what kind of air mattress that's made now a days does not have a quick fill spout the only way to fill this up is a traditional but way by mouth same goes for releasing the air it would have cost him $0.10 more to put in a quick fill screw cap so I can use an electrical pump or a battery pump honestly I'm probably going to throw in the trash it took me about 5 minutes to get the air out of it,1.0

"What a terrible manufacturing process. Made in China!!! - Go get them Trump.
I bought two mats.  One mat does not hold air.  The other mat will not allow air in because there is a very hard plastic thing blocking the passage.  The box states ""100% of our products are tested before leaving the factory"".....WHAT????
I read other reviews and found those buyers had the same issues. Base upon other reviews, some buyers have a properly manufactured product.  However, most reviews state there is air leakage to different extents. If you have a properly manufactured mat and it holds air then you have a good product. BUT you would be taking a chance buying this and hoping it will function properly.

"I really wish I had tried out this mat before going out to use it. First of all, it takes forever to inflate, and when you are no longer able to blow anymore air into it (with your mouth), it still felt like it wasn't done. It was 'good enough' because it was keeping me off the ground, but only for about an hour or two. I weight 150 lbs so I don't think I was an unreasonable weight for this thing to hold in air for. The mattress wasn't blowing out air in an obvious way, as I even tried to look for a leak, but couldn't find it.

After about an hour of sleeping on it, I'd wake up with my ass freezing. There was no air between me and the ground there after only 1 hour. After 2 hours, my whole back was on the ground. I wish I'd just gotten a regular flat pad instead at this point.",1.0

I got a second one, a replacement. Started leaking air much faster this time. I've been nothing but careful. Make certain nothing sharp is around it.

"I was excited to try these in place of our usual camping sleeping rolls/pads. I have used Intex inflatable full size/larger mattresses before and was always pleased with their performance/quality.

 They arrived a day earlier than expected, packaged inside a larger box, without any wrapping/bubble wrap/extra protection/padding. Each pad nearly folded and packaged inside small, really sturdy boxes accompanied with a hole/tear repair patch.

They were actually larger than I expected and SEEMED to be made of decent quality material. Their appearance matches the advertised photos/description. They do have a slight chemical smell, but it isn't overwhelming and dissipated quickly after unpacking.

I used an Hi output Double Quick(by Intex) manual air pump to fill/pump them up. A process that only took a few minutes for each one.

I tried mine out in house before our trip. It easily handled my height(5'6"") and weight(134lbs).

All that being said, I can only rate this product 1star because they only lasted for 8 days before, one after the other, (I ordered 4 in total) they began to leak and we'd wake up on the ground, sometimes before the night was through.

We all took precautions in regards to keeping sharp objects away. I also went over each pad thoroughly in search of holes/tears, even using the soap/bubble test and was unable to find the source of the leaks.

I am really glad that I only spent around $8 each for these, as my purchase was a complete bust.

They say that you get what you pay for, but I have never had an issue with the Intex brand before.

I am greatly disappointed and will not be purchasing this product again.",1.0
"DO NOT BUY!!!!! This got tons of holes before I even used it. I didn't even take it camping, I had to sleep on the floor for a week and the first night it deflated almost instantly which left me sleeping on carpeted concrete instead of an inflated mat like this one should've been.

"This inflatable mattress worked great...once.  On a camping trip, I was able to inflate it relatively quickly and it was comfortable to sleep on for the night.

This made my pack lighter on the hike home, but I left feeling like I had wasted some money.

I took it to the headwaters of the Amazon in Ecuador to camp out. I made the mistake of not trying it out before I left. When I went to blow it up I noticed that the tube which would admit the air to the mattress was blocked. I guess it was an manufacture defect. I tried several ways to punction the obstruction but could not. Needless to say not having it made life difficult in the Amazon.,1.0

"Terrible item. Would not keep air throughout the night. I definitely would not recommend this item. I am only 190lbs, and this deflates though there are no holes anywhere!",1.0
Worked alright until it got a leak in it on it's first week of use on a week long cycling trip where I slept on the floor in houses.  Had to spend the last 3 nights of the trip sleeping on the floor.  I would not consider my use of it overly rough.  I would even say it was somewhat pampered.  Bought something different for its replacement.,1.0
Leaked first night! Big bag o suck!,1.0
Did not make it through one night. Deflated the first time I used it. Made my night miserable. Of course it didn't make the trip home so I was not given a redound bc I had nothing to send back.,1.0

"We were very disappointed when we put these on our kids wish list for Christmas. The grandparents purchased them and the first time we used them camping,  2 out of 3 didn't hold air.  We tried them again once at home and they still didn't hold air.  Very disappointed.",1.0
"ordered 2 of these air mats, first off they were a fight to inflate with my electric inflator, the inflator nozzle just doesn't seem like it was made right. second thing 1 of the mats leaked first time out to the point of sleeping on the ground and third they are a chore to deflate well at least the one that held air is... would not recommend .",1.0

"I bought two of these after reading good reviews, but on the first use I found this mattress to be very hard to inflate, and not at all comfortable to sleep on.

"I've never written a bad review before but this mattress is so bad that I feel that I must.  I bought this a few months ago and kept it in it's package in the garage.  I was very excited to use it for camping over the weekend and couldn't believe that it lost all of it's air by the middle of the night.  I only weigh 107 pds so I know it wasn't my weight.  I used it in a tent that was sitting on a tarp so I don't think there were any sharp objects near it.

I spend one of the most horrible nights of my life thanks to this mattress.  I'm very disappointed.",1.0
"I have tried using my foot pump, my car pump, mouth. Just short of calling my neighbor I have tried everything. I got answers from other users to buy a pump sold by intex.

I scan the barcode they give on the packet and it takes me to an a website with a huuuge image . No instructions.  Maybeit worked for others. Not for me. Return was simple but you have to pay return shipping. I also  lost about 4 hours of time trying to blow and blow and blow..",1.0
"Tried to inflate the mattress and it turns out that the valve was plugged from the manufacturer. Instructions were not included. After puncturing a hole inside the valve we were able to inflate it with some difficulty. This mattress size is ONLY for children, not for adults of any size.",1.0

I bought this mat to sleep on while I was visiting a friend to avoid having to sleep on the floor. Honestly I'm not sure which is worse. The mat was extremely uncomfortable... No more than a glorified pool float. I got maybe 2 hours of sleep. I suppose you get what you pay for.,1.0
"Do you enjoy waking up every few hours in the wild to refill your air mattress?  Do you enjoy waking up to the cold hard ground?  Well, then this is the product for you.

This doesnt hold air. I pumped it up and tried to close the valve in everyway possible and it just leaks. What a piece of crap you get what you pay... Ruined my whole night,1.0
because by the end of the by the end of the night all of the year is out and yo all of the air is out and you ARE sleeping on the floor. I bought two and will try to return them both,1.0
"Pros - Small and lightweight.

Cons - Hard to inflate (if you expect to blow up this mattress with a traditioal
  battery operated pump you are mistaken - the hole is tiny and we ended
  up having to use a bicycle pump)
  Material is loud.  If you move everyone wakes up.
  More like a glorified pool float than a mattress.

As you can see, many more cons than pros.  I wish I had never purchased this.",1.0
I thew this garbage away after spending only 1 night on it. Kept deflating and I had to wake up repeatedly to re-inflate it. Be careful - if you order one you might get a leaker and spend a miserable night on it.,1.0
it won't hold air.it went flat the first day.i put it in the tub and ran water over it cant find a hole.,1.0
"I've always had a problem with this thing: it deflates through the night so that you are flat on your back by the morning; it's not the most fun way to wake up. The construction seems decent though, and the other reviews are positive, perhaps I just got a lemon.",1.0
"When I recevied the Intex Fabric Camping Mattress it came in a box that had already been opened; like something that had been returned before. Took it camping anyway and it didn't make it through the first night before I was lying with a deflated mattress between me and the ground. Tried making adjustments to the air valve cap, thinking I just didn't seal it right, but the next two nights were the same experience.",1.0
"Despite what the picture looks like, this inflatable mattress has tubes instead of waffle air cells. The tubes are ok, its still comfortable, I just don't like being mislead by the pictures of the mattress.",1.0
"I ordered this as a cheap backup sleeping pad. One of the reasons I ordered this was for the waffle air pattern on the mattress rather than the standard tubular design on the more common mattresses. Well, I received the standard tube design air chambers on this mattress. I was miffed to say the least. It is too cheap to hassle with a return, but this is happening more and more on Amazon and I am getting frustrated. I feel a bit deceived by this practice. The mat is ok, just not the design I wanted, this pad is no where near as comfortable to sleep on. I have used both and much prefer the waffle pattern on the sleeping pad. I'm not to worried about the air valve, but the proper picture is a huge issue.",1.0
"This sounds ridiculous, but there really was No Hole! There was a defect in the molded plastic plug valve such that there was no way to blow up the mattress. I needed this right away, there was no time to do a return, so I managed to cut, smash, rip, gouge, and pierce enough of a hole in the thing to blow it up with a battery operated pump. Deflating was just as bad, had to lay on it, sit on it, squish it, and roll it to get the air out! Once it was blown up, the air stayed in and it was comfortable. Thank goodness I didn't pay much for it. I'm still thinking about putting a red hot skewer in it to make a nicer hole.",1.0

At first I told him not to climb on it, but my neighbor said it was ok, so I loaded him on and began to push him around the yard (a flat yard, mind you).  Upon deciding to pivot the Trike to change direction, the darn fool plastic that joins the adjustable steel tube handle snapped like a twig in my hand.  SNAP!  Unbelievable.  Well, I guess I can buy my neighbor another one, now.  As someone who is keenly attuned to product design, I can tell you that this is NOT one that was intended to last.  Save your money.  Very disappointing for a company with so many other great offerings and such a fantastic reputation.",1.0
"this thing has NEVER worked... the cable broke right away. We have had it for maybe a month. In a months time, we have struggled with it and basically hate the thing by now.

I thought Radio Flyer was a good name brand too... ????

I do not recommend. Our Daughter is two. Got it for her b-day in April and we are finally getting the reciept from the gift-giver and taking it back. We asked for this item, thought it would be fun.

NOPE!

needless to say the german bike/trike is our next buy.",1.0
"My son received this as a gift from grandma.  We thought, being that it was Radio Flyer, that meant quality.  Boy, were we wrong.  The steering was completely stripped after one use by my 2 year old.  I took it back and am awaiting a new Kettler to be built.  Hopefully, this one will be better.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BIKE!!!  Very poor quality.

I also called Radio Flyer before returning the bike and they offered little assistance.  However, at the store it seems to be a regular problem as all of the Radio Flyer trikes that they carried had stripped handle bars.",1.0
"This product is probably the single largest disappointment in our child's 3 years! In the very first week, the cable to the parent bar broke. So we got a replacement after much debate and protests by their customer support. Then, something went wrong with the handle bar and that does not turn the wheel anymore.

Try explaining these to a 2-3 year old!

I cannot believe that this company and this product are still in business with such a shoddy product",1.0
THERE ARE NO BREAKS ON THIS BIKE!  The adult stearing bar option is the toddler's only hope for safety.  Remove the walking bar and the toddler has an independent little bike.  NO!!!  Bikes have breaks.  Not this one.  My son had to drag his feet on the sidewalk ringing the bell while I chased after him grasping his seat to slow the bike to a stop.  Thank goodness he was wearing a helmet.,1.0
"As another person stated, I also requested a new set of cables for the trike after the first set broke.  They were great about it.  But the new cable lasted only about 4 rides before it snapped, too.  It took my husband over and hour to get the new cable in, and we were very careful to do it correctly.  Very disappointing that they used such a cheap part for an otherwise well made, and expensive toy.  Don't buy it: it's not worth the tears of your tyke when it breaks!",1.0
"I bought this bike in March for my son's second birthday.  Ever since putting it together, the handlebars seem ""stripped"".  I was hesitant on tightening it too much so I had my husband and father look at it.  This is before we even had my son riding it.  4 months later, he is finally taking an interest in it but the handle bars are still ""stripped"".  I am not at all happy with the fact that this bike does not have any breaks.  I understand why the pedals don't move, so he can put his feet on them and coast, but there should be a mechanism to snap where it would enable to connect so he can use them to go backwards/stop,etc.  Last week, I ran into a neighbor in the park who was pushing her toddler on the very same bike when I noticed that her handle bars were also stripped!  I was so infuriated that I went back to Toys R Us and complained.  Unfotunately, I did not keep the receipt and it is past warranty (the bike has sat in the garage up until now) so there was nothing they could do.  An intersting observation was that they no longer carried this product in the store and I mentioned it to the clerk and he said they had many returns and it was not, in fact, a good product.  He suggested I call Radio Flyer, which I will later, and see what they can do.  In the meantime, I bought another trike I found in the store.  Note, there was another Radio Flyer regular tricycle on the stand, already assembled, and the steering wheel on that one had also been ""stripped"".

Too bad, I belived a little more in the Radio Flyer name.  Hopefully customer service will give me some kind of restitution.

They had nothing to say you can't even buy one as an extra.  So I wasted my money, and now I am going to have to buy one that steers and has a seat belt.

Unfortunately the wooden handlebars where they join to base on this trike are cracked & the trike is unuseable. A birthday gift for my 1yr old grandson so very disappointing. Unable to return because only discovered when we went to assemble it & it was outside the returns date.,1.0
"I put this together and one of the screw holes was not properly aligned. I couldn't get the screw in the right way, which resulted in the screw coming out and stripping the hole. Because of that, the handlebars barely stay on, which is completely unsafe. My husband and I have tried many times to fix it and it works for a day or so, then it goes back to wiggly handlebars. This was so expensive and I would not recommend it to anyone!",1.0
"It goes far, but it is too small. No matter how you throw it, it always go to either the right or left. Almost impossible to get a good throw.",1.0
"got this for my one-and-a-half yr. old's xmas present, a year ago.  She loved it, and has ridden on it a lot, just round the living room.  BUT, after only a year of use, it is totally broken.  the handle tore right off.  Not from rough use; just being ridden by two tiny little girls.  My partner tried to re-screw the handle in, which worked for about a week, then it broke again, and now the wood is too broken to mend again.  So, do not recommend.  Any ride on toy is fun for this age, but this one is not durable.  Not worth it if you hope to hand it down or have it be used for more than a couple of months of very light use.",1.0
"My biggest issue with it is that the wheel placement means she can't move her feet freely to scoot. The front axel and back axel wheel widths should be reversed to allow free foot movement. While the design is stable, it is not functional either. My daughter likes to push it around standing off to the side instead of sitting on it.

My next issue is that the paint is peeling off in several places. It's been out in sun and weather, but not to an extraordinary degree. I would suggest this toy stay mostly indoors to prevent damage to paint.

My final issue is that the handlebar grips have faded dramatically from the sun and did not hold up well to teething. Giant chunks got bitten out, which I find to be rather concerning as a safety hazard. They have both torn completely off now, and she is left with a plain metal bar until we can find some replacement handlebar grips.
All in all, I'm pretty disappointed that a company with such a name as Radio Flyer would design such a poor scooter.

Our daughter has had this scooter from 12-19 months now. she's in the 99th percentile for height. She ""fits"" fine, though is getting to be too tall for it now. Too bad the seat isn't adjustable.",1.0
I am sure that the arobie disc is great in and of itself. However when I received this frisbee (ordered prime) some unintellegent life form decided to shove it in a box too small for it and it causing both sides of the frisbee to be bent upwards causing permanent damage to the arobie and its flight pattern. I hope you don't get the same packager.,1.0
"For those of you skimming: The Bike really is quite small. My one-year old daughter is too big for it and the seat is not adjustable. Consider taller bike options.

For the real reason for the post: I got the bike and got it assembled no problem. Over the following days we noticed an odd ""scratching"" sound somewhere in the playroom. Long story short - The bike arrived with something living inside of and chewing away at the wooden body of the bike. It arrived with the bike as there is no exterior entry hole.  Not sure where AF gets the wood for these things, but the bike I received definitely arrived with some additional cargo... pretty nasty.",1.0
"I had this trike for my first 2 kids.  It broke while still in use by my 2nd.  It was gently used, indoors.  My children are not rough with their toys at all and rarely break anything (I know I just jinxed myself).  This was a matter of poor quality.  The assembly was done for us by the toy store where we bought it, so that wasn't the problem either.
The steering column totally fell apart and when I contacted Radio Flyer about new parts that they claimed they would replace, I never received a thing.  I am hoping to find something better for my 3rd child.  This is way too expensive for the low quality that you get.",1.0

I normally love Aerobie Sprint Rings because they're so easy to throw perfectly and they fly a long way.  This one was defective though.  It isn't balanced correctly and it's very hard to throw it without having it pull over to the left and then drop down to the ground.  I have to adjust the way I throw it and compensate for the imbalance and it still doesn't fly as well. This ring was less expensive than others I saw on the internet and this is probably why.,1.0
"I bought this tryke last week and spent an hour assembling it.  It comes in this small box and once assembled, it's still really small.

"At first I thought this was a great light, very inexpensive, pretty bright, several modes and all. I bought it becuase I always ride home after dark, and I wanted to see ahead of me, and let cars see me. First of all, it isn't all that bright to see the road in front of you, but more than bright enough for cars to see me. Second of all, the day I bought it, I was riding home and as I was cornering,

it came right out of the clip that holds it and went underneath my tires and broke. I was very disapointed. The same day. What a piece of crap.

P.S. From all the use I gave it, the tail light worked great.",1.0
"The tail light has worked well for quite some time, has many light modes, and stays on the bike well, but its construction is not that great so I'm just waiting.  The headlight is another story.

This was given to me as a gift and that's the only reason I have it.  I've never known Bell to make quality bike parts and the headlight is no exception.  As others have noted, the lamp mounting design is terrible where it easily falls off while you are riding and ends-up into a bunch of pieces when it hits the ground or you run over it.

I've been able to keep mine working by taping it together, but finally I took a fall the other day and the base of the light that slides on to the handlebar clip broke into a million  pieces (very cheap plastic construction) and no amount of tape/glue/etc will ever hold it.  Also had on my bike a Cat Eye LED light (that I've had for years) that took even more force from the fall and it wasn't even scratched.",1.0
"I bought 3 of these lights for my family.

This light set does have its plus sides...rear light functions are great, it is very bright, and it installs very easy and out of the way. A+ on the rear light.

Front light dual light sources are very good. Extremely good coverage and is very bright. Light source A+.

It's all down hill from there:

Batteries are difficult to remove, there is a design flaw the actually pins one battery in once installed. A work around is that you can you needle nose pliers to remove. Front light is very cheaply made, and DO NOT DROP IT. I had one in my back pack and it fell to the floor from about 3 feet and the light inside was in pieces. My wife had hers slip out of the handlebar mount and it shattered...I could go on but you get the picture.

The worst part of the set is the handlebar mount...with in 3 weeks all 3 of the mounts quick release tabs have broken. Meaning the lights just slip out of the holder and fall to the ground (and shatter) unless you tape them onto the mount. I tried to contact Bell Manufacturing directly and of course they don't offer a replacement part, nor a guarantee.

My advice is - Buy a different light set. Or else this one will end up shattered, taped to your handlebars, or...as we have done...used for camping.",1.0

Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of ""Bell products"" ever again. That's why i'm now a ""Cateye's"" and ""Nite Ize"" product fan. Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost.",1.0

The front light part of it became loose, and fell, and it does not work any more.  I would not buy this item.  In the time it did work, I thought the beam of light was much too diffuse.  I have previously owned a cateye light, and it was much more sturdy and had a better beam of light.",1.0
"I had to return this product on the day I received it from amazon.

When I opened up the product to insert the battery, the light set literally crumbled in my hands.  And I was being careful.

In my disbelief I inspected it further and new pieces kept falling apart.  The very tiny and cheap plastic piece holding the bulb fell apart next, the tiny metal and precariously soldered piece holding the circuit just gave up doing what it was made to do.

"My main issue is with the tail light.  You can't just turn it on and off.  You have to cycle through all the blinking options (7) in order to turn it off.

"Beware! It might say 10 packages, but you'll only get one!! Don't expect to get the other 9 anytime soon. I tried that and all they said was ""oops. Sorry we're all out of that product, can I interest you in something else?"" So stupid. If I wanted something else I would have bought something else.",1.0
"I thought this looked like a pretty good deal for 10 ice cream sandwiches.  One review talked about what a good deal it was, and I agreed, so I tried.  I found that I paid $11 for ONE single ice cream sandwich.  I am in the process of filing complaints and trying to get this fixed, but considering that another person posted with the same problem, I am suspecting that this is something of a scam.  If it isn't a scam, then they have poor quality control for their shipping.

The single package I got looked good and was foil wrapped.  Unfortunately I can't eat it until the dispute is resolved.  Oh, and it took nearly 3 weeks to get that one packages sent via extremely thin packaging that left the ice cream smashed to bits by the postal service.  We'll see how the resolution goes, but I don't expect to order from this seller again.",1.0
"The ""ad"" for the product said a package of 12 ice creams.  I received one.
Not happy about that but too frustrating to try to track down the seller, fight with him/her and just gave up.
So upsetting.",1.0
"Don't waste your time with this seller.  didn't read the other reviews to realize before I ordered that the product being in stock would be risky. Yep, out of stock and my 4 year old was really looking forward to it for his bday party.",1.0
Lasted one day.  Breaks easily.,1.0
Ordered the kind with the lights. Got the one without the lights. Disappointed.,1.0
Ugly green color,1.0
The product was delivered and it looked like it had been crushed.  You can tell the stick is cracked in a couple of places.,1.0
"Sadly it didn't last a day! It's so soft, all the edges broke off with my puppy catching it, clamping her teeth into it and running around with it in her mouth! Honestly though, the throws I did manage to get in, didn't seem any more aerodynamic than the 94 cent one from Walmart or Target.

Update: to the anonymous customer who claims that this item is not for dogs, and chastised me for purchasing an item that at the time, was clearly listed as a dog toy, I have found other brands of dog frisbees that last just fine through two dogs roughly playing with it. This one did not, and I am entitled to share my review based on my experience with the product. If that bothers you, don't read reviews.",1.0
Bought as a gift and didn't like it. Disk is too heavy and colored rim is bulky and hard to hold especially for younger kids. Should have sent it back but it was opened and used a few times before we realized it just wouldn't work for a 5 year old.,1.0
"The frisbee works fine. But based on the picture and the description, I was expecting to have purchased a set of four frisbees. However, there was only one frisbee. So I would say the picture is misleading to the actual item.",1.0
"The only thing I can think is that the people who wrote the great reviews have never spent much time throwing Frisbee. I've been throwing for over 40 years and I'm rather proficient in many throwing techniques, overhand, finger,thumb, back hand, short floating throws, bullets and long sailing tosses. This thing has nothing much to redeem it. It can be made to fly, but not well, and the full range of grips and tosses you can perform with a regular Frisbee can't be had. It's not as stable as a regular disc. I was disappointed with the first throw and after 1/2 hour decided it's going back.",1.0
"I'm aware the listing said 'colors' may vary'...but you should be ABLE to CHOOSE the color you want!

Was hoping for a red one...as pictured in the photo, but I received a yellow one.
SO FRusterating. I'm gonna return it.

I should have just bought this locally at Big 5, instead of gambling for the color i want--just to save a couple of bucks.",1.0
The netting broke after the first day. A few good kicks from my 9 year old and it was done for. Waste of money!,1.0
I bought this for my 7 year old soccer player for Christmas. Within 2 hours of opening the package the netting has came undone and the ball will not stay in the net now. I will be purchasing a different type of kick trainer now (no netting).,1.0
"Has potential but the manufacturer's decision to use lower/thinner quality fabrics results in a quick tears in the netting.  Along with the single stitched wasteband, this product is literally falling apart at the seams.  I have really nothing positive to say which for me is rare.  Sorry, but this product needs to go back to the drawing board or be discontinued.",1.0
Don't buy this. Extremely had to get the ball in the net.,1.0
You can't even get the ball in the net!!!,1.0
"Has the potential to be great, but the strings are so delicate that many have busted apart after just two days of mild use.  It is not an easy chore getting the ball in and out quickly, so it is recommended to have a ball that you do not mind leaving inside the net.",1.0
"sucked ,really hard to get the ball out and in the net. You spend more time trying to put ball in and out of net then you do learning. I do not recommend this product.and the instructions don't even tell you how to get the ball in or out of the net. Don't waist your money on this product",1.0
"Got it from another retailer, but decided to put in my 2 cents worth.  I can't even figure out how to open the net to put the ball in.  I know it involves my hands, because the instructions say to ""open with your hands"".  That's pretty much it.",1.0

"I ordered the ten pack to share with my pre schoolers for our space theme. I was so excited whe i got the email saying it had been delivered. However, when i opened the package i only got one pack. I am so upset over this. We called amazon and they said there is nothing they can do about it. My account was credited but they couldn't send me the remaining 9 packs. It should be interesting trying to split a single pack between 16 five year olds.",1.0
"I was really looking forward to giving the kids at my son's birthday party this ice cream.  The packages arrived quickly, but I could tell the ice cream ""bars"" were in bits.  I opened one package to take a look and the ice cream was in fact shattered into little pieces.  And the inner packaging was sliced open in two places, possibly by a machine or razor.  It just didn't look right and I didn't feel comfortable serving them to the kids.

Now, this is probably not a problem with the seller, but perhaps they want to evaluate their vendor for these products.  I just didn't want anyone else to have this same experience.  Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy...",1.0
"I was excited to use this mattress for the first time.  It was easy to inflate and use.  It was not comfortable at all, especially if more than one person uses it.  If you move, the other person bounces up and down like on a waterbed. Midway through the night half the air had leaked out somehow (even using the double lock valve) and I was laying on the ground.  Despite numerous attempts to fix the problem, it never worked correctly.  Avoid this air mattress!",1.0
"I've owned Coleman gear for years.  So it was very disappointing to receive this Coleman queen sized bed and find out that it would not hold air for even an hour.
I did not wait to get to a camp site to find out if I had a problem so the air mattress was opened and inflated in my living room for a test run.  When properly (not over) inflated, it lost air within an hour.  I read the instructions that said it would stretch a little so air was added the second night.  Again it leaked off within an hour.  DO NOT buy this product.  I'm sending mine back for a refund.  I was told that K Mart had a good camping mattress - Northwest Territory.  Bought it and it works great.  Better valve and no air leaks! As always, make sure your tent floor is clean and free of things that could puncture the mattress.  I've slept on the Northwest Territory mattress three nights.  Sleeps great. No loss of air.",1.0
"I bought this mattress for my 3 year old granddaughter and me to sleep on at a family gathering.  My pregnant daughter set it up and she and my 2 year old granddaughter slept next to us.  Strong fumes coming from the mattress woke us up during the night.  The baby moved off the mattress and slept elsewhere in the room.  The next morning I read the fine print on the bottom of the box.  It warned that this bed could cause cancer, birth defects, and reproductive harm. Made in China.  I called Coleman and talked to someone who wouldn't comment on my situation but said that someone from the company would call me within the half hour.  No one called.",1.0
"I have had nothing but trouble with this bed. The air pump failed to work from the start and the bed does not stay inflated overnight. It slowly gets deflated, even if no one is sleeping on it.  I purchased it brand new, not used.  Must just be a lemon!",1.0
"My wife and I bought this airbed for visiting guests.  We tried it ourselves for one night and were quite disappointed in the bed, because it was very stiff, it did not provide any support, and we both woke up with sore necks.  We have decided to return it and go for an Aerobed instead.",1.0
"Coleman (and so many other US companies) has lost their common sense and allowed their products to become impractical (and primarily for light duty use) by focusing on how cheaply can they obtain their products. The height of American men averages 6'. I am 6'2"" tall. All air mattresses that are available are 75"" long, which means if you are 6' tall or more and you use a pillow, your feet will not be supported well and have to hang over the end.  When air mattresses were 79"" long, they were acceptable. The brand ""Coleman"" does not necessarily mean ""quality""; it probably just means better than the other low quality, cheap products.",1.0
"What a disappointment.  I sent this bed to my daughter's house so that I would have something to sleep on when I visit.  It is very thin and the pump is flimsy.  The mattress does not pump up fully, I cannot determine if that is because of the pump or the mattress.  During the night, unless you are a slight, skinny person,  if you turn over you will find that parts of your body touch the floor. This definitely would not be comfortable for two people.  Also, getting up in the morning is difficult because you are so close to the floor.  A young person may have no trouble but anyone over 40 will find it to be a challenge unless you are an olympic gymnast. I used this for three nights and saved the price of a hotel room. In that respect I got my money's worth but I will not use it again.

Spend a little more money and get a thicker mattress.",1.0
Coleman does not stand behind this product. Got this as a gift and used it three times. Started to leak and called for warrenty. They said since I don't have a receipt I can't collect on the one year warrenty. I understood that. However the warrenty starts when the product is manufactured not when purchased. So be aware.,1.0
"This mattress doesn't pump up to be very firm - after a minute or so, the battery operated pump gets really loud and seems to lack the strenght to pump enough air into the mattress for it to be more than medium-soft.

The first time I used this is deflated quite a bit overnight.  I'm not at all impressed with the quality and plan to return mine.",1.0
"my second one has just died, I had friends over to spend the night and my pump was dead. would not even take a charge. I tried a second one because of the brand. Not again.",1.0
This is an awful product. Save yourself the money and buy something else. I used it once and it worked fine. But it doesn't hold a charge and you have to hand pump once it reaches a certain pressure.,1.0
"Terrible.  Used once and it worked great.  Pulled it out months later, charged it and nothing!  Won't work at all.  This happened before and I returned it for a new one.  This time I will be getting a different brand.",1.0
I have been through 4 of these in 5 years. They are lead batteries and need to charge every month or two or will not work again. They go bad exactly 1yr and 2 months every time just after warranty. I am looking for an alternative,1.0
"Used this pump one time. Filled 2 queen mattresses and then it stopped working. Found that the motor went out.  Unfortunately I purchased it in the winter and didn't use it till summer. I was unable to return, so I was stuck with a useless piece of plastic.  This is the first time I've ever given a bad review. Very disappointed. Made me rethink purchasing Coleman products in the future.",1.0
Used it once 8 months ago and now the battery is dead and the unit won't charge.  Coleman stuff has really gone downhill overall and this unit is poor quality and lasted less than a year.,1.0
"We loved the Coleman Quick Pump we had for many years, but it finally gave up the ghost and we ordered the newest version of it.  We charged it overnight before the first use as recommended, but the pump was weak from the start, barely blowing up one double air mattress.  It only worked a couple of times, then would not take a charge at all, no matter what we tried.  We did not need it often, so by the time we realized it was dead, we were out of warranty.  A note to Coleman was answered promptly, but only offered us 25% off any product on their website, none of which was a rechargeable pump.  Maybe we just got a bad one, but I can't recommend this pump.  Now I have to remove the battery and find someplace to recycle it, one last indignity.",1.0
Used pump once and it never worked again. Won't recharge. What a rip-off,1.0
This broke and coleman wouldn't issue me a refund without a receipt which I didn't have. I'm out $40!,1.0
"I ordered this product less than a year ago. I finally had a chance to get it out to use it. After charging it for over 24 hours, it did not turn on at all. I can only imagine how quickly it would've gone bad had I tried to use it more regularly. Find another pump.",1.0
Less than a year old and it will no longer hold any sort of charge.  I've used this pump less than 5 times and taken care when storing and charging it.  I'm through with wasting money on low quality Coleman products.,1.0
The batteries in these Coleman-branded but Chinese-manufactured pumps are utter crap and die after 3 or 4 use/recharge cycles. I returned one pump and the replacement pump has the exact same problem: Dead after a few month's use. It was great the first time but it will let you down when you need it on the 2nd or 3rd time you use it. Don't waste your money on these.,1.0
I used this pump 1 time. That is the only time it ever work. Its now in the trash can.,1.0
Broken out of the box  No return!  You are kidding me.  Not Happy.,1.0
"I didn't buy this from amazon. I bought mine off walmart and was totally dead, so i return it and get a new one....and its dead like the first one. I don't know if im using this right or not, i follow the instructions to charge over 10 hours before use.",1.0
"Unit came in with damaged box and right out of the box it didn't work. You could tell this product has been ""around"". It keeps getting sent back and the company which sold it just keeps putting it back on the shelf. I suspect it is old enough that the battery has lost its ability to hold a charge.
While a purchase from another company may be fine seeing as this style is old and still uses a lead acid battery I would stay away.",1.0
I've had two of these that won't recharge.,1.0
"This is the second Coleman inflator I've tried.  Both were garbage.  The first wouldn't charge at all.  The second, after more then 10 hours of charging, put out just enough air to blow out a candle, and died after 30 seconds.  Will look for another brand.",1.0
"My second pump has just died. Second in as many years with each pump only used a handful of times. Very unimpressed! We did not buy from Amazon, but feel the need to leave a review on this shoddy product!",1.0
"I plugged this in and forgot about it overnight.  In the morning, I discovered that the overcharged battery had released a large amount of hydrogen sulfide gas, which is noxious and explosive.  It completely filled my garage and leaked into my house.  I had to air everything out for several hours to get rid of the rotten egg smell.  I have a headache and my lungs hurt.  Even the cheapest electronics these days have some sort of safety feature to prevent battery overcharging, but not this piece of junk.

Avoid Coleman at all cost.  It will cost you more in the long run as everything I buy self destructs almost immediately.  This time this junk could have started a fire, exploded, or caused me great harm.",1.0
Never worked even after following directions for charging.,1.0
I have now received 2 of these to replace the existing one I owned and neither have been able to hold a charge. I charge it for 10-12 hours like it suggests and it blows air for 2 seconds and then dies! So frustrating since Coleman says the only thing they can do is send me another one. Did that 2 times not doing it again. Very disappointing!,1.0
"The battery requires an initial 10 hours charge time before first use. Not a problem in and of itself but, the documentation should have highlighted this up front and not have that critical fact buried in the instructions.

After overnight charging I tried to pump up an air bed but the air pump only worked for about two minutes before stopping.  I'm going to return the unit.

Not happy.  Very poor user experience.",1.0
got it out of the box. charged it for 24 hours. It blew air for about 10 seconds then died.  Returning it.,1.0
"I used this charger 2 times and it worked fine, and a year later I wanted to use it again and found out that it does not charge at all, so I had to buy another brand.",1.0
"I have so far bought two of these pumps at Target and neither worked.  I purchased the first and charged it for 12hrs.  It was then unplugged and turned on.  It ran weakly for about 10 seconds, then shut off.  The wall outlet was working, so it had to be a product issue.  I returned it and got another unit of the same type.  The exact same problem occurred.  I tried changing wall outlets and charging it for the max of 24hrs in the owners manual.  It still didn't work.  I don't usually don't give 1 star reviews, but after having two fail in a row, I have no basis to give anything else.",1.0
"Got it in the mail charged it didn't work battery will not hold a charge still waiting to hear back from Coleman.
It appears they send out these products with defective batteries to begin with Probably not a good product to buy.
We will see how the customer service works I will write another review in a week to let you know but right now I have heard nothing back from them.",1.0
"Either I've bought two defective pumps in a row, or I'm doing something wrong.  The instructions say to switch pump to off position and charge for 10 hours before first use.  Because there's no lights indicating that the unit is charging, or that the wall wart is working, or even anything to indicate which switch position is ""on"" and ""off"" (there's just a line and a circle, and forward or back), I've had to use my best guess about the unit being off, plug it in, HOPE it's charging, and then wait for 10 hours.  When that didn't work, I changed the switch position and tried again. Then tried a new unit.  Neither worked, on either unit.  If anyone has any ideas, I'm all ears.  Otherwise, steer clear of these d*mn things.",1.0
I've only used this twice and now it won't recharge. This is quite disappointing! It looks like others have had the same issue.,1.0
"Bought one, and exchanged it because it wouldn't charge.  Second one suffered the same fate.  Thanks, Coleman!",1.0
"This is junk.  I purchased this in March used it once where it worked just fine, then pulled it out in May for another trip, charged it for a full 24hrs prior to camping and it just stopped working.  Unfortunately, I'm outside the return window, so must write it off as a loss.  Purchased a cheap Inotek pump, while its not rechargable.....it is reliable!!!!!!!  Do not buy this product.",1.0
the battery only work for 2 years. don't buy it.,1.0

battery died after 2 months.  date on unit says its over a year old.  Sent message from manuf but never heard back,1.0
Well bought this pump from bargin barns on amazon an they ship it to me a day early I was glad then i open up the box I get just the pump nothing else no charger no hose a pump how can u use a pump with a dead battery that always  should stay charged an if the battery dies its trash so I got no use from this wasted 20 bucks for a peice of junk,1.0

didn't work so had to return.,1.0
Not. Complete and had been used it looked like.  Said new.,1.0
"Terrible pump. I fully charged it and once we pulled it out to use for our air mattress, the air came out ridiculously slow and barely did anything to inflate the mattress. Tried to recharge it again but it won't even charge. Don't waste your money. We bought a similar coleman pump that uses batteries and it works 100x better.",1.0
Didn't work right out the box and could not be charged. Seller didn't refund or replace. Do not buy!,1.0
The Battery would not hold a charge. I threw away my money buying this Item. I will most likely not buy anything on Amazon again,1.0
"We ordered this as well as the Coleman Double-High Quickbed for my son and his wife as we knew we would be spending a couple nights in their small apartment and didn't really want to sleep on the bare floor.  When we arrived at my their apartment (at 4 am - our plane was late), they and we discovered that they had been unable to charge the pump.  For some unknown reason, the pump battery would not take a charge.  They had kept it plugged in for over 12 hours yet the battery was as dead as if they had never plugged it into an outlet.  Since there is no other power source on the pump, it was useless.  I slept on the couch and my husband ended up sleeping on the floor after all.  Coleman has generally been a very reliable brand and I am extremely disappointed in this particular product. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.",1.0
"Cannot keep a charge to save its life.  If you charge it all day you might get 30 seconds of life out of it.  If you charge it all day then leave it for a week before using it, you'll get no life out of it.",1.0
"Pump did not last nearly as long as expected and after calling Coleman Warranty they say NO RETURNS WITHOUT RECEIPT.

Thanks for nothing Coleman and this will be the last Coleman pump this family purchases.",1.0
"Forget getting any relief from Coleman.  The instructions say to charge MONTHLY, for a product you might use one time per year.  Horrible customer service.  I'll never buy Coleman again.  Cheap, Chinese made garbage.",1.0
"It was fine, but then one day after only a couple months of owning it, just never worked again no matter how long it was charged. Disappointing.",1.0
"I purchased this last year for a fishing raft. When the product arrived the hose attachment was cracked and did not fit right. My first mistake was not returning immediately, instead I glued the broken part and used it twice. After the second use it would not recharge. Since this product has to be returned to Coleman I contacted them and the number was no longer in service. So I am out $35 and will never buy a Coleman product again. This was the second pump I purchased that was made by Coleman... the first one lasted a little over a year. Do not make a mistake and buy this product, it is cheaply made and will not last. It is complete junk",1.0
"I've had a rechargeable Coleman air pump for the last 10 years, and it has worked great. Recently it died, so I went a new Coleman air pump. The new pump is basically useless, it won't even hold enough of a charge to completely pump one mattress.",1.0
"Honestly, maybe i'm an idiot. I could have left it plugged in too long, or in direct sunlight, or overinflated a mattress, but of course, there's the problem:

It completely failed after normal use. Normal use, might I add, that any person who uses the Coleman Rechargable Quick Pump as a pump would subject it to.

Shame on you Coleman for putting a trusted American brand label on this Chinese made piece of junk.

MY VERDICT:
Unless you only need it for one season of camping, kayaking or only long visit from a relative, buy something else.

Even then, you might as well get a manual handpump, such as my new Coleman Dual Action Quick Pump. There are no cables, charging times, battery lives, hazardous materials for landfills, and you get a 60 second workout. Honestly, how lazy have we become anyway? This product is probably equally both a cause and consequence of the obesity epidemic in the USA. In retrospect, i'm actually ashamed I bought the Coleman Rechargable Quick Pump, plus about $40 poorer. Ugh, do yourself a favor and run the other way.",1.0
Arrived in a beat up box. I charged it for 10 hours. More than once. Does not work for more than about 3 seconds. Tried to contact seller with no response.,1.0

"These pumps do not last.  I have twice purchased this pump (because it was recommended by friends) and both pumps have gone dead on me after 3 or 4 uses.  The item won't recharge and does not function.  I will not buy this Coleman product ever again, and think twice about other Coleman products before purchasing.",1.0
"Used this once, it worked great.  Charged it and put it away.  Next time I needed it the battery was dead, and would not work, nor charge, nor run plugged in.  I was very disappointed.  I tried to replace the battery at a local battery store, but the replacement cost almost as much as a new pump.  Don't waste your money.",1.0
We have had a Coleman rechargeable pump for over 15 years.  We bought this new pump after looking at the reviews.  This pump is so loud we are sending it back.  The sound must be well about what is safe. The design is unbelievably poor.  I am very disappointed considering the old pump was excellent for so many years.,1.0
I bought this for camping last summer based on the reviews but when I got it the packaging was all busted up. But I plugged it in and it worked.  I was terribly disappointed with it as I only got to blow up one and a half beds when it stopped working properly.  All of a sudden it lost power and not matter how long I charged it for it just never regained full power. So I was very disappointed.,1.0
"This is a cheap product.  It never took a charge, and I suspect that is because the wiring inside is not connected to the battery.  I tried to take the unit apart, and couldn't access the screws because they are set into holes that are too small in diameter for a standard screwdriver.  Do you need a specialized screwdriver?  Who knows.  I then tried using my small diameter screwdriver set and the screws are set in so tightly that they scoured the bits of my screwdrivers.  Who designs this and specs these parts?  What a piece of junk.

So, to return it or have it fixed, I have to deal directly with the manufacturer and I can't take it back to the store.  Oh, ok, I guess I should pay more money to send it back to you now.  Invest more money in it when it hasn't even worked once yet!",1.0
The product did not hold a charge long enough to fill a queen size air mattress. We took this on a camping trip and fully charged it but did not test the product prior to the trip. When we went to blow up our mattress is died before completing the job; we were stuck an entire week with a flat mattress =/,1.0

"This thing will hold a charge! I've gone months between uses and it still fills the airbed quickly. I like the idea of a seperate inflator.

"We followed the instructions for charging right out of the box and used it once. It performed great. We returned home and did what the instructions said...charge after use/before storage.

I will attempt to contact Coleman and Amazon if necessary and can update after that.",1.0
"I am so glad you asked for a review.  I wouldn't know how my Coleman Rechargeable Quick Pump works, because I can't use it!  It came without the pinch nozzle adapter, which I need.  I called Coleman, and because the young man I spoke with was in a giant hurry to get me off the phone, he did not pay any attention to the model number or my question about whether the adapter is the same for the MANY different models they have of this pump.  So naturally he sent one that doesn't fit.  Since then I've sent 2 emails through the Coleman site to support with complete and specific information about my order - and have never received so much as an acknowledgment, let alone the right part.  All this for a $2.50 adapter!  I'm totally disgusted, and would reiterate - DO NOT do business with Coleman!

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak, Priscilla Joyce",1.0

In addition, to return it, you have to get yourself to a Coleman Repair/Distribution center.  If one of those isn't reachable (and it probably isn't), you have to ship it to them and YOU HAVE TO PAY THE SHIPPING.  So it'll cost about what you paid for it just to get your money back.
Complete Rip Off.  Absolute Waste of Time and Money.",1.0
"I bought this item along with a Coleman Queen Mattress.  30 mi N of Durango and a long, long way from civilization, I found this thing didn't hold a charge after 12 hrs of charging.  After trying to blow the mattress up by mouth for 30 min and almost passing out, I abondoned the idea, having to sleep on the ground! DON'T RELY ON THIS ITEM TO HOLD A CHARGE for very long! I have since purchased a Coleman ""double action"" hand pump - no batteries/ no electricity!",1.0
"Same complaint as the previous reviewer who wrote that the pump never worked - mine was even missing parts when the air mattress arrived! I now have to go to both Target and a sporting goods store to see if I can find another pump, which is priced at just ten dollars less than the entire airbed package that included the pump in the first place - does that marketing make any sense to any of you?

Buy the airbed separately from the pump in case the pump is malfunctional and needs to be returned on its own. This will save you the trouble of running around your hometown looking for another one, as I get to do today with a fever and the flu :) while waiting for my new queen size bed to arrive.",1.0
"I got King-sized air mattress and quick pump together yesterday by mail for my first camping tomorrow. However, the pump never worked. It seems just bad luck, however I can't return this product to the Amazon. I called to Coleman service center near my place but they only repair stove and lantern. If you don't have Coleman service center near your place, you need to pay for shipping for this heavy product to send it somewhere Coleman service center. I didn't know this restriction when I ordered this product. If Amazon let me know this restriction more clearly, I would not embarrassed when I found the problem of pump.",1.0
"I bought this pump along with an inflatable air mattress for use when guests visited.  However, after only two uses the pump is completely dead.  It won't recharge and it won't even turn-on.

I understand that products break from time to time, but the real problem is Coleman's customer service department.  When I called them to ask about warranty information for the pump, they responded with ""We don't actually make that pump, we just put our name on it so we can't help you,"" and then they hung-up the phone!

I called them back right away, and got them to give me the number of the company that does manufacture the pump and when I called it, it was a disconnected phone number!  Coleman does not appear to care at all about the quality of their products or the concept of customer service.  I will NEVER buy another Coleman product again.  As I said, products break from time to time and that can be forgiven, but no company should treat their customers this way.

I urge everybody who is considering the purchase of any Coleman products to boycott this horrible firm.  By their own admission, they don't even make the products, they just pass them off to consumers.  You deserve better than Coleman!!!",1.0
I am disappointed in this board. The first one I bought was with the cabinet. That one wore out so I bought this to replace it. I used it for a week and played a few games and found that it has many dead spots. Dart will bounce out even though they are hitting the board and not the wire. Most of the bad areas were closer to the bullseye on numerous numbers. Also the double bullseye had  bad spots which is not cool. Hopefully I can find a better one.,1.0
"Had for two months, playing a couple of times per week and the board already seems dried out with lumps and frayed bristles. 1 our of 3 darts bounce out without hitting wires due to the board being so stiff.",1.0
Overwhelming aroma of mold/mildew out of the box. Ive never owned a board so prone to bounce outs. Ive owned this board since Christmas and Ive finally given up on it. Ordered my Winmau Blade 5 and had it quick shipped.,1.0
Are you kidding me!! I received these opened and they don't even work!! Ughhh....,1.0
"The fibers seemed old and almost dried out.  The entire board did not arrive looking new or in good condition.  Every throw made a huge hole that won't ""self-repair"" like sisal fibers usually would.  Three bulls-eyes and the center is now useless.  Do not believe this product was as advertised.  Definitely would spend an extra 20$ on a board that will last more than a few days.",1.0
"Absolute garbage. Darts frequently bounce out of the board and come back TOWARD the player. Wires come loose after just days of play. Difficult to hook to the wall, the bracers are practically useless. Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't risk your health to play on a board this cheap.",1.0
It doesnt come with darts like advertised.,1.0
"Honestly never reviewed a product on amazon but this one just got me mad. The board is fine, it works great and theres nothing wrong with it. The darts however are absolutely horrible. The first day of playing every time I should throw the dart the flights of the darts just keep coming out and out. The second day 2 darts just broke. One just snapped in half and the other the section that holds the flights just cracked and fell apart. 2 days and now its basically not useable unless I buy more darts.....",1.0

just recieved it today and i played only one game and everywher you thrue the darts leaves big deep hols i thought it was a good board since it said it was a viper board for compitition but i see its not i guess after a couple more plays i don't want to even look at it and the colors red and green wher the dart hits it it rips verry disapointed i guess i learned by this last one this is the second one i purchased i guess i would have to go personal to a sports store,1.0
Board is fine I guess. I've already had a dart break. The plastic tail which the fins attach to snapped off inside the metal middle portion of the dart.,1.0
the quality is not compared the price.i just used few times.,1.0
The board itself is built well and appeases to have longevity. On the other hand after opening the box and playing one game the dart broke after falling to the floor. I thought it was the way the dart landed but have had the same problem with other darts. The darts are cheaply made. If it wasn't for the darts I could definitely recommend this problem.,1.0
"PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay away from this board. A good dart board is the single most important factor in making darts fun. Get yourself a Winmau Blade 4 or 5 instead. Sure it's a bit more money but will last WAY longer than this piece of junk. Also, this board has round wires. That means your darts will bounce out like crazy. So get ready to enjoy picking your darts up off the floor. I understand that you might be attracted to the price. But also know that this board will most likely self destruct in a month or so. And if you plan on playing a lot, forget it. This board will not last at all. Spend the extra $25 and get the Blade 4/5. You'll be thanking me later. Cheers, WWD.",1.0
3 darts were broken in the package. Another dart came apart in a couple of days,1.0
Garbage. If you want to waste money like i did then you should buy this. All six darts broke within 3 days and the board itself should be sold at a dollar store. Its a scam and NOT WORTH ANY MONEY!,1.0

This thing barely lasted 3 months and the double bull area is completely destroyed.  It wouldn't hold a dart in there with a hammer.  The only consolation is you get what you pay for.

Poorly made! Stopper fell off multiple times.,1.0
Mine came with no darts and no installation instructions. It is bent on some places and the packaging was heavily damaged from the outside (which I guess damaged the board itself). On top of that it's very heavy. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It could at least include some darts... good thing I bought better ones from somewhere else.,1.0
"I wanted to by my husband a dart board for father's day and took on the task of finding the ""right one.""  I ofcourse, turned to amazon and started reading endless reviews.  The Shot King had great reviews so it was a clear decision.  I ended up giving it to him early one night.  I swear on my life, this is the worst dart board I've ever placed.  First of all, as soon as we started playing, we noticed that the darts would stick and then slowly fall to the ground.  It happened ALOT.  The material is self healing but after one night of use, we could see hundreds of very visable large holes.  It appears to me that it's not healing, at least not properly.  I don't know if I just got a bad one or what but I now have to buy a new one.  $32 down the drain.  I guess it's a lesson learned.",1.0
I bought this a few months back. It didn't take long before the bullseye started to come out from the board. All the bristles are poking out and the board is bascially in operable. This isn't the first time its happened Ive had the same one before this and it did the same thing on the other one too. Definitely don't waste the money. Buy a better one so it'll last.,1.0
I opened it and it was cracked and broken. The metal rim was bent in really bad. The back was chipped bad.,1.0

I should have known something was wrong by the fact that metal was stabbing out of the box through the Christmas gift wrapping!  I just figured it was poorly packaged and that I would need to put the wheels on when we opened the box (annoying, but no big deal). Well today, I went to assemble my daughter's new skates so she could go have fun skating only to find one skate functional, and one with no wheels! Not in the box either. They remembered the care instructions, and even the little wrench thingy for tightening the wheels, but I'm afraid these skates are quite useless without wheels.

Trust me on this. No matter how hard i put that lock on it won't stay tight enough for someone to twist it off. Its actually terrible. But for a secondary safety device to prevent your littlw ones that don't have the strength to twist it then its good. I would not recommend to anyone really.,1.0
"Bought these for my revolvers, wife's semi auto's and rifles. They lock on all of them. DO they stop the gun from firing? Not on a single one of the 11 firearms we tried them on. As I said yes the locks lock. The issue is with the post. It does not fit behind the triggers it fits in front of them and wit enough slack that with minimal effort (our 5 year old grandson can fire the weapons) . Now before you go off on how unsafe it is for him to do so it was a test. Controlled and with empty guns we are not idiots. After all it is the kids that will pay the price for this lock not working.
We took them to the gunsmith and the same thing. He recommended throwing them in the trash because he has never been able to make one work. EVEN Master Lock themselves could not give one single example of a gun these would actually fit well . The fine print that comes with the locks state the same basic thing. Folks there are much better locks out there for the same or a bit more money. If you have a magazine type that a cable lock will fit that is a much better idea for them. Look for a lock that has two posts, one to fit in front of the trigger and the second to fit behind the trigger immobilizing the trigger itself.  A gun case is important as well however if you have the weapon for home defense you cannot actually keep it unloaded in a case or safe and actually think you would be able to get it out and loaded before the bad guys get to you or your family. I believe after a break in the average time you have to be prepared to fire and defend yourself or family is 4 SECONDS. Have something that will allow you to defend AND secure the firearm. Herters has a nice electronic safe that will pop open instantly with a wrist bracelet or finger print. Many other examples out there as well but please, If you need a trigger guard for local rules then find something that will actually secure your weapon and not just look like it's secured.

There are no pictures/directions at all to reference.  Do you scoop with it?  Do you hold it and pack snow with your other hand?  I think it's going to be difficult for a child to successfully build anything with this tool.  We haven't had any snow yet this year, but I'm not confident that this will hold up very long.  It seems brittle and would break due to the cold. However, all that written, I am keeping this product because the price isn't high enough for me to take the time to return it.",1.0

"This seat is for the rider/peddler in front, which is the bigger kid. My 5-year-old daughter's legs are too long to maneuver the pedals; her knees bump against the handlebars. The seat is tiny. A child younger than 5 wouldn't have the strength or coordination to operate the trike with another rider in tow, which makes me question who Kettler intended to use this seat??? Useless product, but excellent quality nonetheless. Bottom line: Don't waste your money.",1.0
"After getting an Air Navigator for our toddler daughter, we figured that we'd get this attachment so that we could add our infant son to the set up. This is a cool idea - it allows you to add another kid to your (expensive) Kettler trike. But it doesn't work very well. In particular, it becomes almost impossible to maneuver and steer the trike once this insert has been added.

Before getting the insert, we would push our daughter in the trike using the steering bar. To avoid complete chaos, I locked the front tire and steering bar, and used the bar to manage our direction, often tilting back and pivoting the trike if we needed to change direction (if you own one of these trikes, you know what I'm talking about). Once we added the insert, it was difficult to change direction at all. Not only could we not ""tilt and turn"", as we had done before, but it was almost impossible to push the steering bar in a way that would effectively change direction. The trike with the insert was simply too heavy and awkward to change direction. (BTW, if you're letting the kid steer herself, I don't see how that would solve the problem, as a kid can't possibly manage to steer with the insert attached.)

At first, I figured that it would just take some time to get used to maneuvering the trike with the insert. But in the end, we simply couldn't figure out how to steer the trike when we added the insert - it was way too heavy and cumbersome. This is a real bummer because the concept is very appealing - in theory, it allows two (or more - although that would be a disaster) kids to enjoy your (expensive) Kettler trike. But in practice, it just doesn't work. It's too hard to steer, and your kids will constantly end up in the ditch as you futilely try to pull, push, and tug them back onto the sidewalk. Your kids won't be hurt, as it all occurs in slow motion, but they'll progressively head off the sidewalk while you're trying to figure out how to get them back in line.

The trike is great, but the insert has been relegated to a corner of our garage. And will never be used again.",1.0
"I purchased the Kettrike Air Happy bike and in the Amazon.com website, they state that the Kettrike Tandem Insert is an accesory of this bike.  It is not.  Even in the Manufacture's Information it states that it can be used with an adjustable Kettrike frame, one that separates in two.  Well the Air Happy Kettrike separates in two and it does not fit.  I'm sure, having the correct bike would make this item a 5 star toy.  I guess not being able to return it because my 30 days are up has soured the situation.  Good luck and be sure you purchase the correct bike.",1.0

"This is the 3 rd defective Suunto product I have received over a 3 year period. The bezel of this watch was installed upside down. Accordingly, the names over each function button are wrong. When the manual says ""push the Select button"" you have to remember to push the button marked ""on/off"" instead. It is the same for all 4 buttons since they put the watch together backwards. If you buy this and have problems operating it compare the actual watch with the pictures of the watch in the manual. If it is reversed you have the same issue.

Suunto used to produce high quality products that were long lasting. I have now had one Observer fail after several years use, another watch (a Core) was shipped with a broken altimeter) and now this Observer shipped constructed backwards. Also, the straps fail quickly and are expensive to replace. Over the years Suunto has shifted its production from Finland to China on most models. As this has happened the quality of the construction/function has gone down. One reason I purchased this last Observer was the statement that it is still ""made in Finland"". If that is the case it is still a piece of junk. I have now learned not to purchase Suunto products.",1.0

HOWEVER: There are many times that the watch has sat in my desk drawer waiting for parts while my G-Shock and Timex IronMan carry the load.  Today is one of those times. The Observer's wrist strap breaks every 18-24 months - and that occurs even with preventative maintenance on the band on a weekly basis. The replacement straps cost $40. My straps have broken for the 4th time. So, if you think that a $20/year cost of ownership on top of the price of the watch is a good bargain, then get this watch. If not, then get something that is a one-time investment only and doesn't require a hotline to the Suunto replacement parts store.",1.0

Their customer service person could use a basic course in ""how to treat people with dignity."" Or find a job where she only deals with rocks and other inanimate objects.  Finally I ended up talking with a supervisor and they replaced it.  Less than six months later the replacement also gave bogus elevation gain readings --- now off by 1000%. I must now send my intrument in for them to check manually. However as the back of the so-called watch is plastic, not metal, it is impossible to get inside any longer. So much for a  $200+ purchase.  Into my junk drawer.  A complete rip-off.",1.0
"SUUNTO Observer

I have owned my Observer for four years now and wear it daily, whether at work or outdoors (hiking, climbing, etc). Basic features include time, date, stopwatch (with split time), altitude/barometer, and compass. There is also a logbook function, that records your ups and downs while hiking. As the star rating indicates, I do not recommend buying this, or any other SUUNTO product, and I explain why.

I bought the Observer because I wanted a tough built watch that could take some roughing up without sweating. The case is indeed impressive (mine is steel, there is also a considerably more expensive titanium one). But rarely do watches fail because their cases crush in, rather, it is the mechanism inside that is usually the first to go. A few months ago I dropped the watch from about one meter (three feet) to a hard tile floor - the screen went black, and there was no response whatsoever. I took it to SUUNTO and after a couple of weeks they informed me that the entire module had to be changed. You might think that a company that tries to pass for the Mercedes Benz of sports watches, would be somewhat embarrassed that their toughest model died on a one meter fall. Perhaps they would fix it for free? No. Perhaps they would sell you the module at a minimal cost? No. They charged a full 200 USD for it and, for a watch that now sells for about 320, this cannot possibly correspond to the actual cost. So SUUNTO tried its best to make a profit out of an unacceptable malfunction of its product.

Some more observations: the crystal in front is superbly hard, just a minor little scratch after four years of use. Mine has the plastic straps with the metal incrustations. Expected lifetime for these is two to three years, and SUUNTO will charge you anywhere from 50 to 100 USD to replace them! To make things worse, it is practically impossible to change the straps yourself - after trying it for half an hour without success, I watched a very skilled technician spend another twenty minutes, with all sorts of weirdly shaped tools, until he managed it - no rational explanation occurs to me for such maliciousness in design. The locking mechanism, on the other hand, is nicely thought out, and very secure. The alarm function is practically useless (hence not mentioned above) as the volume is ridiculously low (and you cannot adjust it). Even if you put the alarm at home to go off in one minute, chances are you will not be able to hear it when it does. The barometric capsule is very accurate, even after four years you can see your altitude increase meter after meter as you go up the stairs. Battery is supposed to be changed by the owner but again, a silly design makes that much harder than necessary: there is a sort of a coin slot in the back to rotate the battery cover, but after you do that, there is no way to pull the cover out (it does not come out easily because of the rubber seal). So you have to try with all sorts of sharp metal objects to pull it out, and this will scratch the rather soft back cover.

Overall, this is a deceptively tough looking watch - it is silly to come up with such a case when the internal mechanism cannot take a G or two. SUUNTO, as a company, has no sense of class whatsoever - their service is slow, overpriced, and irritating. If you need a tough sports watch try a lightweight model that will not reach ridiculous terminal speeds in a fall (while climbing, say). Make it also a non-SUUNTO product, until these geniouses learn how to deal decently with their customers.",1.0

Just so you know, my beloved Cricket swears the Junior Stellanos molded unit is the closest to LeRoux's genitalia of anything available in the life-molded marital aid (marinade) market. I asked her how she could be so sure, and she changed the subject real quick. When she thought I wasn't looking later, I caught her smoking a cigarette and looking sorta misty-eyed at that framed WCW poster we keep on the ceiling above our bed. She really loves the WCW.

I had the marinade all loaded up and was on my merry way injecting the meat when the injector slipped and stabbed me in the hand!! About 3mL of marinade was injected into my left hand, it hurt like a motherf#%$&@!!! My wife rushed me to the hospital where I sat for over 4 hours waiting to be seen. During this time, I became light-headed, nauseated, and eventually lost consciousness. Apparently my marinade is not meant for intravenous consumption. After regaining consciousness and having my hand thoroughly cleaned, I thought I was going to be fine.

flex arm too loose. does not hold position. useless. screws don't tighten to fix it. why do they even offer to sell this? it is defective. dangerous.,1.0
"poor mirror! can't see oncoming cars, until they're on top of me!! the gooseneck won't stay still. I would""t buy it!!",1.0
"all in all a good product. works and is cheap. great for the owner of an inexpensive bike not wanting to spend a lot.ps after using it a while, it got deformed(bent out of shape). would not reccomend this at all.",1.0
This mirror was easy to attach and inexpensive however it was useless. I couldn't see approaching cars until they were right behind me!,1.0
"Pros:
1. Cheap

Cons:
1. This mirror made me realize that handlebar mirrors are practically useless for any bike without the curved handlebars found on road bikes. Otherwise you get a nicely distorted view of your arm/hand or your leg/groin (depending on if you place it above or below the handlebars).
2. The convex lens does give you a wide angle view of whatever is behind the lens (mostly you) but this also means that anything farther away than 25-50 yards is about as small as a speck of dirt in the mirror.

The Result: This mirror gives you a falls sense of security (when you can actually see the road behind you) because you won't be able to see any cars behind you until they're already passing you.

Instead of the FlexView, I'd recommend mirrors that attach/strap to the end of your handlebars like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirrycle-s-Bar-End-Bicycle-Mirror/dp/B0009R96YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirrycle's Bar End Bicycle Mirror</a>.  Even better, get a mirror that attaches to your helmet or sunglasses like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bike-Peddler-s-Take-A-Look-Cycling-Eyeglass-Mirror/dp/B001VTQNVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bike Peddler's Take A Look Cycling Eyeglass Mirror</a>; they offer a view of everything behind you with a minor head turn and won't shake with the bike (so you can actually see what's behind you).",1.0
"After about 2 days the screw that holds it together striped out and fell out, and now I have to use duck tape to hold it together. So I wish I had saved my money.",1.0
"My first comment will be positive.  The mounting clamp is good and works well without tools.  The flexible arm was also solid and held nearly any position desired.  Even with the really large mirror, this stayed in place and the vibrations were adequate.

But in the end this mirror is completely useless.  I do not recommend buying this mirror for bicycling.  The problem is the convex mirror.  The convex mirror does not allow you to see cars approaching until they are directly next to you.  I was hearing cars and looking over my shoulder to see cars less than 1/2 block behind but they were completely non-visible in this mirror.  I presume the convex mirror was selected to assist with wider coverage, but on a bike your peripheral vision is adequate to see cars directly over your shoulder.  The safety purpose of a bike mirror is to see cars approaching, which this mirror does not provide.

I do not recommend this mirror for bicycling in traffic.  You cannot see cars approaching.  You will hear cars and see them by turning your head slightly long before they show up in this mirror.  Nice mounting design but I cannot believe an experienced parts supplier like Bell would not notice the absolute uselessness of this mirror for bike safety.",1.0
"I cannot understand a company like Bell would design such a bad mirror. Its stem is so short that all it displays is your body, and next to nothing to your left. Whichever way I try to adjust it just doesn't it fails to show view left of you. It is like having a small mirror in front of you and expect to see what is behind.

Bad purchase. I returned it and bought again just to make sure whether I make any mistake. But no, it is just a badly designed product. I am returning it again.",1.0
"I didn't expect a lot for the money, but this mirror was worthless.  The flexible neck was TOO flexible--wouldn't maintain the position I put it in.  Too convex to see anything out of when it WAS adjusted correctly.  Very cheap materials--broke quickly, and I was actually a bit relieved when it DID break.  It was just wasting space on my handlebar.",1.0
"Instructions show that it's a ""toolless install"". When I took it home to install on my Trek 1.2 road bike, it quickly became clear that the included straps are WAY too narrow for my bar.  I'm not sure what bikes the included mount could possibly work with....",1.0
It is impossible to see anything in this mirror because of its convex shape and the amount of vibration. I am sorry to say that I found it to be completely useless.,1.0
"I bought these mirrors. I hate them. The flexable arm dosen't stay put...the wire has too much memory and ""drift's"" back to it's original position. They also vibrate while you are riding. Spend a few extra bucks and buy bettter mirrors.",1.0
"I bought the gazzelle thinking that it would give me a similar workout as the eliptical trainer I use in the gym but was I wrong!  First of all, this machine makes such a horrible noise when you workout, I have hardwood floors, so maybe it would be less noisy on carpet. Also, I didn't break a sweat for at least 45 minutes and after my workout on the gazzelle, I did not feel sore and certainly did not feel like I had a good workout.  This machine is nothing like they advertise on tv and I regret I ever bought it...",1.0
"I purchased the Gazelle Freestyle many years ago and have loved it.  Now that I need a cable on the right side, I cannot get in touch with Fitness Quest.  Their phone number does not work, the e-mail was returned, and I saw that they had filed bankruptcy in 2011.  Why are they still selling the machines?  I would purchase another one, but if I can't get parts, I do not want to do that.  Is there any other place where I could get the parts?",1.0
"You must reduce the price a great deal.  The manufacturer, Fitness Quest is out of business, no longer makes them, no longer makes parts, no longer warrants your machine.  You are selling a Pig in a Poke.",1.0
Not satisfied w. item simply because the item was scratched and the computer did not work and because one of the legs was looser than the other one.,1.0
Quality is somewhat bad. The iron pipe is blocked by iron debris and could not be assemble. I think this company need to improve the quality otherwise it is heavy to send back and forth.,1.0
"I don't have anything to add to the guys who had this experience with squeaking noise of this Gazelle. Just wanted to say that I had the same problem, and wanted to add my bad rate star in order to help future customers to know, that Gazelle is good only when you watch it on TV commercial. Maybe they used the best machine for demonstration, but my machine was cheap assembled. After I assembled this machine, it was not stable on one of the sides. I added washers (which were already prepared for this known issue), but nothing changed. The second day, the squeaking noise appeared. Next day it came louder...After a week of usage, I am packing it back for return. I did my research beforehand and bought it in my local Walmart, so I don't expect any problems to return it back. Hope it will help others to make their choice.",1.0
Basically the gazelle is a waste of money. There is little to no resistance on the swinging motion so it feels like i am just kicking my legs. I threw this product away after just two weeks because it was so easy i decided to just go on walks instead. Seriously i am overweight and getting off of my ass can get me more winded than this machine. I recommend that you just get a treadmill for an indoor workout.,1.0
I thought I was purchasing the glider with resistance when I actually bought one that was just heavy duty.  I work out a lot but have developed some hip issues so I wanted something that would be kind to my hip that I could do at home.  I can't get my heart rate up enough on this without resistance.  After further research on the internet I found out they don't even make this with resistance anymore - you have to buy an older one.  This would cost me more to return due to its weight so I will donate it some place.  I supposed it would be good for a heavier person who does not exercise on a regular basis to start a program on this but I did not like it.,1.0
"The actual work out isn't too bad (though I'm not really losing any weight or gaining any muscle after a month of 60 min a day, maybe a little tone but I'm not super impressed)but moving this thing is TORTURE!!!  Using it is a bit dangerous too.  The way you are supposed to roll it or move it is the most horrible, poorly designed thing ever!!  I look mike my husband beats me since using this thing.  My shins are bruised and my upper arms are bruised.  My toenails are all broken and I think I may have a broken bone on my foot.

The reason for this is not from actually working out on the thing but from moving it.  It folds, but the arm and leg things still swing free and the only place to grab it (weighs around 60+ lbs and it big and floppy and unwieldy) is the moving parts.  Then the placement of the wheels means you have to kind of flip it up to get it open.  Often it will keep rolling and smash 60+ lbs plus momentum onto the top of my foot.  Because every part of it will either strike you, pinch you or smash you there is no safe place to grab it and set it up.  I think if I had a workout room with my DVR and never had to move this thing I would like it a bit better.  It is unconscionable that they would make something like this so dangerous.  A simple locking mechanism to hold it rigid for transport would totally solve the problem.  I'm thinking of drilling holes in it and pushing a rod through it like a giant cotter pin.",1.0
"I used to work for the company that took the phone orders for these.  They are complete overpriced, overhyped TRASH.  Have fun trying to get your heart rate up on this thing--it ain't gonna happen!  You're basically just swinging around with no resistance whatsoever.  What a joke!  Shame that trash like this makes Tony Little wealthy.",1.0
"What to start with, this thing has too many flaws to be on the market!
When I first got on the machine I was impressed. That lasted about 2 minutes. That is how long it took for the bearing to start grinding which consequently is the only resistance offered. No lubricants have made the grinding stop. The only thing that did was replacing the cheap ""bearings"" with proper ones. After a couple of days the movement creaks began and have become more than a distraction.
Don't bother with the ""computer"" either. I have placed multiple fingers on the sensor for way more time than should be necessary. It likes to read 71 beats per minute. The only thing on there that seems to be worthwhile is the timer to see how long you've been on the machine. However, one should remember the time when starting as there is no reset feature.
So once you get past all that and you pop in the DVD you'll notice another flaw after 20 minutes. The woman on the video turns sideways on this thing. Are they CRAZY, unless your shoe size is five or under there is no way your feet aren't going to hit the support posts and each other.
The only way this product is making me run like a gazelle is to return it and find a superior machine.",1.0
"We bought this because my parents have one and it's an excellent workout. I've used it before, and was winded after 10-15 minutes.

My husband put the machine together without too much trouble. He's good at putting stuff together and followed the instructions to the letter. We noticed there wasn't any way to adjust the tension. The digital timer thing doesn't work at all. We're going to have to send that part back.

I watched the DVD and read the instruction booklet and got no help regarding the tension. I thought I'd try it, so I got on and noticed how little exercise I was getting. After half an hour according to my TV clock, I wasn't winded, didn't break a sweat and my heart rate was barely above resting. I tried the different methods they suggest, such as putting your toes up or bending your knees or going really fast. But it wasn't exercise.

It's not like I'm a pro athlete, either, I'm very badly out of shape and at least 40 pounds overweight. I can barely ride my bike around the block. I wanted a low impact exercise to get me started. This is not exercise.

This is nothing like the one my parents have, there has to be something wrong. There's nothing in the instructions, DVD or otherwise that really address how to put the machine together or to tell us if we've made a mistake. Can anyone help?",1.0
"I bought the Gazelle a little over a year ago as a space-saving and cheaper alternative to an elliptical machine. I'm 30 years old, not always the best about working out but also not horribly out of shape, and I thought this would be an easy way to get a quick workout at home. Unfortunately, I find it really hard to work up on a sweat on this machine or get my heart rate up, and the harder I try, the more the Gazelle starts moving across my living room with me on it. It also doesn't fold up small enough to fit under my couch or bed, which is a disappointment. I wish I had just waited and saved up for a real exercise machine. In the meantime, I'm sticking to my aerobics DVDs for my home workouts and using this as a clothes drying rack. I think this would be a better purchase for someone who really doesn't exercise much and has bad knees.",1.0
"HOLE IN BOX, MONITOR DIDNT WORK, NOISY, AND DEFECTIVE, HAD TO SEND IT BACK, SORRY",1.0
I was over my friend's house and saw that she had one.  I tried it to see if I would get my own.  I can't comment on the squeaking because it is still fairly new.  The work out is a complete joke.  You could do better by walking around your sofa for 30 mins!  There is NO resistance.  It is really hard to keep your balance because the pressure from your arms swings the feet part back and forth which has you scrambling for controle.  The more you try to grip the handle bars the more the feet parts go flying.  I'm just glad I wasn't the one who bought it!,1.0
"If I could have given this thing no stars I would have. Unstable,doesn't give a good workout, difficult to fold away or move without the feet bashing into you, takes up too much room when set up (the feet need room to do there thing) and just plain sucks. I am 26 and it did not feel safe enough to me to get in a groove (unstable). I certainly would recommend either an electric (pay more for an electric one that you can adjust incline and speed)  treadmill or elliptical before this hunk of metal.",1.0
"i bought a supra model gazelle at sears for 179.00. i thought it is so light and the shock absorbers made a good form of resistance. well after a year the welds cracked for the shock absorber holders and are useless so i took them off.the guy at sears(where i bought the junkpiece) says,""Ew,man too bad""!!Remember that the light tubuler construction while making for ease in transport also means ease in breakage. Another machine meant for looking good in leotards sipping a sports drink and put it away if you start sweating.if you don't the sweat will rust out the weld joints and who knows where you'll be catapulted to when the next thing on it goes.maybe Maybe Tony little will give a surprise visit to you in the hospital!!",1.0
"I bought this item about 18 months ago and could not wait for it to arrive! It's hardly a workout. Walking is more physical.  It has no resistance, my feet have slipped off the peddles.  Im not rich and felt stupid wasting my cash.  All in all, I folded it up and put it on the treelawn. Im so glad it is out of my house.  Someone garbage picker came and hauled it. Good luck.",1.0
"The gazelle is advertised as whisper quiet. This is true only for a short initial period of use when the factory librication is still functioning. After a month or so the unite WILL begin to squeek and crack in several places. I found that I spend more time trying to lubricate the thing than excercising. The WD-40 would last a few days, in the meanwhile dripping and staining my carpet. They suggest grease for the main bearings but you must dismantle the unite to do this. It is a very messy process. You would think they could at least put in grease inserts (like a car). In other words since they use the cheapest of bearings (a plastic ring between two metal tubes) or no bearings at all the unit is meant to last only for a short time (just long enough for FitnessQuest to take your money). I have even noticed that when Tony Little is advertising on TV (such as the shopping channel) there are extra parts around the main bearing area (black tubes?) on his display models which are not found on the sold ones, (probably good bearings so that the unit does not squeek on TV). EXCERCISE REQUIRES MOTION, MOTION REQUIRES MOVING PARTS, MOVING PARTS REQUIRES GOOD JOINTS AND LIBRICATION, WHICH THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE!!! Even my fishing reel has more bearings than this thing!",1.0
"I so wanted this to work. I was looking forward to a low impact full body work out. What I got was a large machine that after no more than a week was so noisy I had to turn the tv up incredably loudly. All in all, this was loud, not very stable, and didn't do anything that walking can't do.",1.0
I did not really like this machine it is big and i found it hard to fold down because the foot pedals go every where except were you want them to go. (WATCH YOUR FINGERS!!) and after using it just one time the little floor protecters fell off no big deal i guess just figured they would have figured some way to make them better. after using mine for one day the next day it started to sqeak which is every distracting even if you turn up your tv you shouldn't have to after paying all of that money!!! I'm glad to bought mine at a store so that I can return it with out a big hassle I got more of a work out putting it back into the box then i did on it. So if you deceide to buy this I serently hope it brings you more joy then heart aches :(!!!!!,1.0
"I would highly suggest that you save your money and get something else. I bought one of these and returned it two weeks later. It seems great, and it lures you with the fact that yes, it IS fun to use. But really, it IS a glorified swing. There is no resistance except what you put into it by leaning back or forward. I could do this, very fast, for over 30 minutes and barely break a sweat, and I'm not in great shape. And while it was nice to stretch on, I found myself trying so hard to have a good workout I over extended my leg and limped for three days. I'd save your money and buy a treadmill or exercize bike.",1.0
"We have had the Gazelle Freestyle for just under 1 year. We purchased it because we needed something very low impact due to knee problems, and it seemed like a very simple machine with few parts that would need to be replaced in the future. We were very wrong. The first few times that we used this machine it was very quiet, however within a few weeks it began rattling. At first it was tolerable. Now it is so loud that I have to turn the television up extremely loud just to hear it, and I cannot use it at night when the kids and husband are sleeping. There are no parts that you can tighten or adjust to make the sounds stop (or to adjust the resistance level...). Now the footpads have began to squeak.

 As many others have said, this machine is not for you if you are already even remotely healthy. I have not worked out in years and did not even break a sweat in the first half hour. I was sore the next day, but only because I had really stretched my muscles - you can overdo it. The footpads are unsafe. Perhaps I don't actually weigh enough, but I slip even when wearing shoes with good traction.

 One final note - if you have kids or pets that might be around this machine use caution. My dog walked in front of this while I was using it and I nearly took her head off. Also, we had it folded up ready to store and my son bumped it and it fell on him. It could have easily crushed his head or arms. I really have nothing good to say about this, every time I look at it I think about what a complete waste of money it is. I would much rather have an elliptical machine like I had years ago, I could actually feel improvements in my health and it was just about as easy on the knees.",1.0
"This is the worst air mattress I have ever bought. No instructions on how to inflate. You can hear a slight slight hiss when you twist the valve and put your face to it, but the mattress doesn't get bigger at all.",1.0
"First, there are NO directions. (I think they are purposely left out to limit your expectations) Second. it does NOT inflate.  Third, when you evently get to the point of blowing into the valve to add some air, it does inflate into a VERY narrow strip of vinyl so when layed on you roll back and forth like you're on a boat.

DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And if you are like me and already bought it, TAKE IT BACK!!!!",1.0
If I could give this zero stars I would.  It came with no instuctions which would be fine if it inflated.  It has been out of the box for 10 minutes and looks no different!  I am glad we tested it out before our trip.  Will be returning this product. Don't waste your money!,1.0
"as most of the other reviews have already stated, this item is pretty much useless.  there are no instructions for how to use it, so i assumed i would just open the valve and it would inflate.  i opened the valve and waited... and waited... and waited...  it did almost nothing.  the pictures on the box show a product that clearly works differently than what is inside the box.  i'm going to return this lousy product.",1.0
I agree with what the others have said. It does NOT inflate. It is not comfortable. Buying this was a mistake. I'll be returning it tomorrow!,1.0
"I'm quoting what another customer experienced, since it's exactly what happened to me: ""I've had this out of the box for a grand total of 10 minutes, but I am not impressed.  There are no instructions beyond the ""Automatically inflates in 10 seconds"" on the box, but when I opened the valve, I saw almost no difference whatsoever in the thickness of this pad.  I kept opening the valve further and further, checking again and again for more instructions in case there was another step, but to no avail. It is maybe 3/4"" thick except in the little circles where the front adheres to the back, and apparently, this is as cushy as it gets?""
And this is the rest of my personal story: I thought it was broken, so I surfed the net to see if I could find the instructions to make this ""self-inflating pad"" work.  To my surprise, instead of the instructions I found out that many other customers have experienced the very same frustration I have.  It's a rip-off!!  I'll be returning this product to Target ASAP!",1.0
"When I purchased this I was not expecting a very cushy air mattress, but I was expecting more than I got with this sleeping pad.  I bought it for camping because I have a bad back and need a bit more than the ground.  I agree with other reviews that it does not inflate ""in seconds"", or much at all, as it claims to on the box.  We waited quite a while before testing it out and realizing that it felt no better than our floor, which means it won't be any better than the ground when camping.  I will be returning this and getting another one.  I feel as though a Yoga mat would give me more cushion.",1.0

It cooks only on high flame.  The flames kick up everywhere and almost burned her face.  I contacted Coleman and they are willing to give us a new one if we return it.  The problem is, we don't want another one if they only cook on high flame.  This was an unbelievably hig flame.

This grill may work for most people but it was a piece of garbage for me. I went camping with a large group and 5 of us had the same stove out. My stove was the only one not adjustable and which melted two Coleman griddles in less than 10 minutes. I assume I just received a flawed version.,1.0
"I am a Coleman fan, but this one will not lower the flame, the minute your finger comes off the knob it goes right back to high.  Also, very loud when flame is ignited.  I have an older one in my RV and I love it, but won't be buying anymore of this version.",1.0

"Arrived damaged. They sell these in stores, just go buy it in a store that way you can return it if it doesn't work properly.",1.0
"Poor temperature control, either hot or really hot, can't simmer.  Made in China, not the Coleman Stove of my youth.",1.0
"Same problem as a number of other reviewers here. The burners can't be adjusted. If you try to turn them down to a simmer, they'll pop right back up to high. I know someone else posted a review with  instructions on how to disassemble the valves and apply different grease but come on, this was a brand new product malfunctioning like this right out of the box. That's totally unacceptable.

I haven't bought a Coleman product in quite a few years but I remembered them making quality, dependable products growing up. Now I see another once-great American brand was bought up by a cost-cutting, low end mass marketer. This is cheap, made-in-China crap with zero quality control.",1.0
"The clasp that is supposed to hold the stove closed is flimsy and does not stay closed.  I bought a Coleman camping stove 25 years ago, and used it for 20+ years.  I am shocked by how much flimsier this one is, and by the poor quality clasp. Standards have gone downhill.",1.0
Solid build. Unfortunately the burners on my model are on/off. I assume there is something wrong with the valves.,1.0
Coleman is a dissapointment these days-- my fathers stove lasted a few decaades--- one i had built in 2000  lasted 14 years going through hell... and this one--- fell apart in a week--- the burners seem to be placed too far back as well--- cant handle a bulk tank well flame starts pulsating--- the metal is garbage as it just deforms and twists... must be made in china,1.0
"Right out of the box this thing is defective. One of the wind shields fell off when opening it. Upon inspection, the one that's still attached is held on very poorly. You'd think they'd have a better fastener to hold on the wind shields, but they don't. I guess that's what we should expect from Coleman since they have their products made in China, which makes them pieces of junk. I received this 15 minutes ago, and I already initiated the return for a refund. What a joke!",1.0
"Decent bang for the buck, but inability to control the flame makes it a total loss. I have been doing LOTS of camping since I was a kid; one of the best parts is the cooking challenge. Cooking over a fire is better (but harder on non-cast iron pots and pans).",1.0
"I picked up one of these when I switched to propane, and found out that Coleman quality has considerably diminished. I don't know where their equipment is being made but it's being made poorly. Used it for about eight or ten trips and the back came loose due to a material shortage caused by the forming process which allowed anything spilled while cooking to drip down under the plate for the burners. Growing mess. Another friend received one for Christmas. The propane attach plug was so mislocated that we had to use a screw driver to actually bend it into a position where it could be hooked up to a propane canister. Coleman used to be hard corps, heavy duty that would last. But now, pffffh, strictly tail gate parties.",1.0
"like many other posters here, this thing has no flame adjustment.  Its either off or full burn.  I very surprised that this is from coleman; worthless.",1.0
"Dangerous. I take groups of kids into the wilderness in Maine. Have done so for years. When showing how to connect propane tank and light stove, It leaked from stove and flames were shooting out.  Cheaply made and have had trouble with these stoves. Threading is sketchy and leaks happen, especially from the stem where it enters the stove.",1.0
This product arrived with the metal bent. Had to return.,1.0
I have used the same Coleman stove for camping for 15 years. Bought a new one and can NOT get the flame to adjust from full to simmer - the knob turns but reverts back to full if you don't hold it. I would return it in a heartbeat but the 30 days passed while we were out of the country camping. VERY disappointed! Now I see many people with the same problem - stove is virtually unusable for me to cook on.,1.0
This stove doe not have electronic ignition. And it is hot or off can not adjust heat properly.  I sent mine back.  I will go back to using my old Coleman.,1.0
"Why should you buy something you can not get repair parts for , I wouldn't waste my money on this",1.0
"Never in the history of the world has such a piece of junk been placed on an American store shelf. By the burners you're supposed to screw in four brackets for your pots to rest on. The screw-holes are too small for the screws!!!! I mean a 7th grade metal shop student can drill a proper screw hole. I'm returning. I'm not going to drill their holes for them. With this kind of craftsmanship, we would never would have had the Industrial Age and we'd still be living in animal skins. This is utterly disgraceful and an insult to every American consumer. DO NOT BUY!",1.0
This stove is very reliable and easy to light but is pretty much only useful for boiling because its two settings are off or nuclear meltdown.  It is very difficult to set it to simmer to cook things like scrambled eggs or even bacon.  The knob sort of springs back in the direction that you had it set in last and to get it to simmer you have to turn it as low as you possibly can and hope it doesn't spring back too much.  I just ordered a dual fuel stove which should have a better simmering capability.,1.0
"i almost think this is a knock off because the coleman i grew up with wouldn't put out a product like this. the stove is almost like the old ones but the metal in the lid is thinner and flexs.
the big problem is the knobs have one setting, VERY HIGH only. you lite the stove and it is on full blast with no adjustment, almost seems like a safety hazard. made in china of course!",1.0
"Flimsy and poorly put together, and awkward to use, it's really hard for me to understand how this relic become a camping classic. Everything about it is unfriendly to use, from the awkward propane canister arm to the poorly labeled temperature control knobs. And if that wasn't enough, after a couple of uses it just stopped working all together. I think the regulator failed shut. I guess I could replace that, but I'd rather chuck the whole thing in the garbage and start over with a product whose sales are based on quality,not nostalgia.",1.0
"Way too hot! This thing is a beast, can't get flame low enough to not scorch everything",1.0
"prostituting a fine old American brand.  Adios, Coleman!",1.0
"It arrived damaged, the corner was bent and was subsequently unlevel on a flat surface.  The grate is too close to the burner, it would be hard not to burn food. Basically very flimsy. Off course made in China!",1.0
"Piece of junk, Colemans pride in workmanship has went to the dogs ... very dissapointed !  Box had been opened & taped shut, discovered that lid latch had been bent beyond use, lid & one side had serious dents, had no automatic spark ignition, entire construction was very thin metal & regulator with feeder tube were missing. Got so pissed I throwed the thing in the junk ... don't buy any more Coleman products unless you can inspect them before you make purchase.",1.0
Biggest problem is adjusting the gas .. near impossible to reduce and increase,1.0
"Flames were big enough, but very hard to adjust. High or off seem to be the only options. Poorly made in general! Whenever I put the griddle on the right flame went out!!! My older one was much better.",1.0
"First use - operating with adapter hose for larger propane tank.  Both burners worked fine the first morning.  On second morning, upon lighting the second burner, both burners go out after a few seconds.  Cant operate both burners.  Has anyone seen this before?  Trying to determine if I should return the stove.",1.0
"Coleman a great company threw my childhood great products. Well move to China and all your great products turn to junk.
I have this same model but it's 20 years old and looks beat up so I wanted a newer one so I bought a new version. There is more wrong with the new one than the beat up one.
If you have any brains DON'T buy this if you once trusted Coleman. The old one must have been dropped a 1000 times the new one if you drop it it will be trash. It's flimsy cheap, it's on high all the time even set on low, the paint came off the first time we used it in places the old one still has paint. I'll never or my kids will never buy anything from coleman again.",1.0
"I purchased one of these for a camping trip in August.  I tested it before I left and noticed that even on low the flames looked really fierce and hot(and loud), like a jet torch instead of the nice mellow low-setting flame on a kitchen stove top.  I figured I was being a bit picky and it would probably be fine.  Well it wasn't.  I was constantly burning the outside of all my food(and I do know how to cook well enough to not burn everything) on the lowest possible setting.  And the lowest possible setting is very tough to get on this grill.  The flame would go out almost every time I tried to adjust to flame that low, and that caused another problem.  The only ""pan"" I brought was a cast iron griddle. Now I have a burning hot cast iron griddle with food on it that I have to pick up in order to relight the flames that just went out.  I have heat proof gloves for this, but the grill got the cast iron so hot that the gloves that are rated to 480 F started to melt.  Needless to say cooking was the worst part of that trip, and it took a week to get the taste of burnt cooking oil out of my mouth.  I returned the product to Amazon as defective very soon after the camping trip.",1.0
"We bought this for camping a couple years ago and the quality is horrible.  Thin, flimsy, but my biggest complaint is that you can't regulate the flame!  You can only cook on very high heat and end up burning everything.  It's nearly impossible to cook pancakes.  The only way I can get a lower flame is to hold the knob in place with one hand, while cooking with the other.  I am seriously looking for a better camp stove.  I thought Coleman was a quality product, but this Made in China stove is a piece of garbage.",1.0
"So I bought one of these back in about 1999 or 2000.  Thought the Coleman name would mean something.
well, if by something, one means faulty o-rings that leak from the gas canister and explode, then, yes, Coleman is your brand.
this was on the very first usage, too.
seriously, it is a good thing I tested this on my parent's back deck, a bit off from the house, prior to taking it out camping.  Forest fire would have put a damper on things a bit.

so, yeah, unless you like exploding bombs of gas canisters and fires requiring full sandboxes to put out, avoid like the dangerous pile of crud it is.  I imagine that it has only gotten worse, cheaper in intervening years, much like everything else with planned obsolescence.",1.0
This stove is great for boiling water and burning food. Wish the flame was adjustable like in previous models. Waste of money.,1.0
"There is no way to adjust power of flame, the grate on top makes it difficult to balance anything on top cause its too spaced out. (so only good if your using a pan or something with a large base)  Only one side works, the other burner lights and then blows itself out constantly.  Ive used other stoves that actually worked as you would imagine them too, this was a waste of my time. What really is a bummer is driving out to our campsite for 4 days and finding out you purchased a piece of crap.",1.0
"I have this stove. my parents have an much older version which is awesome. my brother, sister, & I got these new versions for Christmas we've used it but we can't adjust the flame at all. it slipped back into high all the time. I hardly ever burn anything and I was moving quickly but you can't make up for the high heat. very disappointed! boils water great but that's not really what we need for very often. I'm going to try to loosen the nossel by rotating it back and forth a bunch in hopes that will loosen it up. I would definitely buy another stove if I was trying to find my own.",1.0
"This was my 3rd Coleman stove in 40 years of camping and I THOUGHT it was defective and tried to return it but was outside of the 30-day return window. The first time I used it (40 days after buying it) the controls for heat were either ""on high"" or ""off"" I don't know HOW many times I tried to adjust down and it went off & I had to re-light. AND used a canister of propane once a day for a two day trip -  this has NEVER happened. One canister has been fine for a two-day trip.  Blame the ""on high"" if turned on at all. After reading all reviews I was an idiot for trusting the Coleman name.  I was looking just now to buy a 3-burner Coleman stove (since I have to replace this one I bought BECAUSE I thought it was DEFECTIVE) but all the reviews say the same thing about the burner controls. So.... what other company makes camping stoves?",1.0
"I purchased this stove and left immediately on a camping trip. What a disaster. The stove would only light after numerous attempts and then would go out in a few minutes. I used a whole box of matches. When burning, only part of the burner was lit. The name Perfectflow; is  hilariously inappropriate. We actually had to cut our trip short because of this stove.

Ultimately, I was able to fix the stove by purchasing a new Coleman regulator from Amazon (better price than direct from Coleman). Apparently Coleman products are now being manufactured in China and are no longer of the same quality as years past. While my stove is now in working order, it cost me an additional $15.00 and a great deal of frustration.",1.0
Bought this as a gift for my nephew.  He just tried it out on a camping trip this past weekend.  there was NO way to regulate the flame!  It shot straight up - either full on or full off - no knobs to control.  Made it very difficult for cooking.  Is this just a bad one or can it be fixed/replaced?,1.0
"I unboxed this Coleman 2 burner propane stove today and fired it up for a test run. As others have noted, the burner valve control is not very sensitive and takes careful turning to get a low flame.

And it does seem cheap - Coleman is only relying on their name now as this is not the robust product of old. The sheet metal is thin but decent quality, but the top lid hinges are cheap and on one side is flexing outward from the rivets.

It's probably fine for most, but priced too much for a product of this lower quality. $29 is closer to what I think it's worth. Not sure what to recommend for better quality, but if want something a bit sturdier I'd be inclined to spend a few more dollars or search for another product.

UPDATE Sept 01 2012. After 5 nights camping I am returning the stove .. the gas valves are hard to adjust to a low flame (as others have noted) and there valves have ""spring back"" too. Another camper had the ""Coleman PerfectFlow InstaStart 2-Burner Stove"" and the valves were not springy. I may consider that stove ... the BTU output of the stove is identical, the only useful difference is the better gas control.

UPDATE Sept 22 2012. My return was processed. 5/5 stars for Amazon's return process - excellent and efficient. After more research I am considering the ""Camp Chef Mountain Series 2 Burner/High Pressure Stove"". It is $100 (and more than I want to spend) but one of the users have posted a video and the gas controls are very good and precise.",1.0
"The stove functions as expected, but it is very poorly constructed.  It took my boyfriend and his dad, a few tools and a couple of hours of bending and finagling to get the metal lid to close somewhat properly and to level the silver cooking base.  I highly recommend getting a more well-made stove or buying from a store instead of online.  The defects were in manufacturing, packaging was excellent.",1.0
"This stove is a major disappointment in quality. This is only my 2nd coleman stove in 20 years. My first stove lasted that long, but coleman quality has not. I was worried about the stove's quality when I took the stove out of the box the first time and saw that even the stove's label was put on crooked.

You cannot turn the burners down to simmer. High heat is constant and burned our bacon black and other foods unless watched every minute - flare ups from the burner to the bacon grease on the griddle I was using is a fire hazard. The high heat also scorched my new coleman griddle. If you just want to boil water fast - this stove is for you.

The side wind blocker hinge broke on the second day of using the stove.

I've already ordered a new stove from a different company and hope the burner controls work way better then the coleman.",1.0
"I purchased this stove this summer.  On  its inaugural use, I opened the lid and the wind caught it such that the lid flipped backwards. The chintzy rivets that held the lid to the base didn't hold so the lid fell to the ground.  We placed cardboard around the back and side so we could get some coffee brewing.  The stove lit acceptably and the coffee perked quickly.  However, the 12 cup coffee pot almost spilled over when I sat it back on the cooktop after pouring a cup.  The rods on the cooktop are much too far apart.  Later, when we were cooking a meal, we couldn't throttle down the flame to where we could use a low or simmer setting. The burners are either full on or off suggesting cheap throttling valves.  I remember when the name ""Coleman"" stood for rugged quality...they were made in Kansas, as I recall.  My brother has a Coleman stove he received when he graduated (in 1975!!) and it still works great.  Not so with the new ones.  Another great product made by Chinese children.  Next time you go into a camping/big box retail store, check all of Coleman's products and see where they're made.  I will never buy another Coleman product & suggest you stay away from them as well.",1.0
Surprised at the poor quality.  Not like the old coleman stoves.  One hinge was completely loose due to 2 rivets pulled out.  The whole thing is rivited together.  The  only  thing that resembles anything like the old Coleman stoves is the color.  Very poorly put together and very flimsy.,1.0
"The first ""Perfectflow"" stove I bought would not maintain the gas flow rate. It was either on full or off. So much for ""Perfectflow"". I sent it back for a replacement. On the second stove, I could not even open the lid, despite pulling very hard. Coleman either can't make a quality stove or has zero quality control. I will never purchase another Coleman product again. What a big waste of time! That's too bad, since I have a Peak 1 stove from the early 1980's that still works just fine.",1.0
"I bought this Coleman product remembering my great camping experiences with white gas stoves and lanterns.  As soon as I opened the box I knew I was in trouble.  This stove is made out of cheap, easily dented metal. I unlatched the lid and the top would not come free.  It was so tightly held, I thought there was a secret catch some where.  I finally took a screw driver and popped the lid. It was being caught in the right front corner by the edge of the aluminum catch tray which was not formed
correctly and slid in on top of the rolled lip of the cover.  The next thing I noticed was that three of the four pop rivets for the cover side of the hinges were broken off and the cover was ""flapping in the breeze"".
I was about to go on a long camping trip and really needed this stove, otherwise I would have returned it in a heartbeat.  I re secured the cover with stainless pop rivets, but no matter how I tried to tweak the catch tray edge I could not get it to stop catching on the closed cover.  I elected to take the tray out to see how to bend it down better.  Well the tray is held in by two of the softest snap rings I ever encountered.  These hold the tray down by locking in grooves on the two burner tubes.  These rings were stretched and distorted as soon as I expanded them.  This made me wonder, if some soup or spaghetti water overflowed it would drain into the very bottom of the case because the splash tray has big holes in it.  Coleman provides no easy way to remove the tray for cleaning
I fashioned some spacers from 3/4"" copper water pipe that slid over the tubes so screwing the burners on pushes down on them and also the tray. Duh! coleman couldn't think of this!  I finally had to cut the corners of the tray with a tin snip to keep it from catching.  Oh yeah, I've seen paper clips thicker than the little metal wires that hold the wind wings in place.  Run away from this model
fast.  My credentials?  Twenty- one years propane and HVAC technician.",1.0
"This is what I've just sent to Coleman customer service:
I recently used my son's new Perfect Flow Two-Burner Propane stove. I wanted to try it before buying one of my own. He warned me that it is impossible to adjust the flame and that it remains on high even after turning the knob to low.
He was correct.
When the adjustment knob is turned to the left to lower the flame it very briefly does just that, but as soon as you let go of the knob it quickly turns back to the right on its own and raises the flame -- as if its spring-loaded and the spring re-coils.
This is fine for boiling water.
It does not work for frying eggs, etc.
Because I had a toolbox in the car, I was able to maintain a lower flame with an extreme jerry-rig using vice grips attached to the fuel-flow knob and a heavy adjustible wrench to rest against the vice grips to keep them from moving, thus keeping the knob from turning back to the right and increasing the flame.
I find that to be excessive effort.
I have read various reviews online, including here, and it seems others have found the same problem. Then again, many others give it positive reviews.

I want to buy a camp stove and I otherwise like the Coleman. But I do not care to go through that effort every time.

My questions: Are you aware of these problems? Have you done anything about it?
Can I purchase a model that I can be sure allows for heat adjustment from simmer to full flame?",1.0
"I could not open this stove. Recently another customer had the same problem.  Sent it back and Amazon was very good about sending another.  The second stove opened and immediately one of the ""windblock side panels"" fell off. The rivited clip that should hold it on was loose and flapping in the breeze.  Another recent customer had this problem also.  There was no box damage; these stoves are made incredibly shoddy.  Formerly a coleman stove was something you could pass on to your kids; this one will be passed on to the land fill in a year or two.  Amazon took back the second stove, and compensated me for my trouble.",1.0
"Having seen many of these over the years, this particular model is really shoddily made. The first one was damaged on arrival (with no damage to box), so I couldn't even get the top open. The second one came, and was also damaged (but less so). The silvery metal is not attached well at all to the green base and there is glue all over it (clearly where it was supposed to be held down. What a piece of junk!",1.0
"I have owned three of these stoves over the years.  i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model.  The windscreens are cheaply, made, fall off the stove which then doesnt  support the rear screen.  Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid.  The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.

I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it.",1.0
"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and now I am trying to decide what to do about it. She was so excited to get it and ride on it, but we soon learned that it moves so slowly (literally slower than she can walk), that it is frustrating to ride. She currently has a push scooter and always wears her safety gear. So I think we will try and return it and wait until she gets a little older to get her a real scooter.",1.0
Used the mat for the first time today.  Picked it up to get the sand off from it and the outer seam ripped.  Now it is coming all unwoven and is worthless.  Can't return it since I didn't use it within 30 days.  Not a good product or company.,1.0

I bought this because a friend has had one for years but it is obvious the quality is not what it was.  The first time I used it the binding ripped.  After the second use I was hosing off the dirt and my thumb punched a hole in it when I flipped it over to hose the other side.  If I'm lucky this will last another one or two uses.  Definitely not worth purchasing.,1.0

Have had may Speedo product before that were great and as I opened a great looking package poolside tried to put on in pool and hard plastic cracked and broke off after ONE minute in pool.

Cheap broke first time they where used.,1.0
"So sorry, used 2 times and the strap on the google tore. Not able to repair. We will still purchase Speedo brands though. Have had such bad luck with other brands that will leak around the eyes.",1.0
"Better named the Tunnel-Vision Ultra-Fog Extremes, these goggles I can honestly say are about the worst I have ever purchased in my years as a regular lap swimmer. The straps flop about your face, there being no clamp for the loose ends, when tight enough to avoid leaking, which causes them to fog to pea-soup visibility rapidly. When you can finally find the correct balance of some loose water inside the goggles to prevent the fogging, you still can't see except straight ahead because of their tubular, non-acquadynamic design.

These are the goggles that have finally pushed me over the limit with the Speedo brand. I'm done. Making products that appear well-made and work well a few days out of the package, rapidly become useless, forcing another purchase is the way businesses of consumer products work, and Speed has it down to an absolute art. Speedo products that did actually work well and durably in the past have all disappeared in favor of pieces of trash like these. Steer clear!",1.0

"Used to love this model.

Like their suits, appears Speedo decided that if items last too long, customers won't have need to buy the thing as often?

A couple years ago, they changed the gasket formulation on these.  I knew something was amiss, when a new sets gaskets were stuck, as if glued to the mounting inserts they ship with.  Actually damaged the gasket trying to gradually peel it off.  The next pair had the same issue.  I ran warm water over the area and that worked better.  But, evidently the weakness that causes them to stick to the mounts, also impacts longevity.  (As always, I rinse thoroughly in tap water after every swim.)

The other issue, is that the coating inside the lens wears off quicker.

I have tried everything!  I may return these even though it will be a hassle for me.  I do not recommend these goggles!",1.0

"The nose bridge on these goggles are way too small. I wouldn't consider myself having a ""big"" nose by any means, either. It's so small to the point where they won't create a seal around my eyes, making them useless. For a one-size-fits-all pair of swim goggles, I'm surprised that the bridge wasn't bigger, and that it's not adjustable. If you have a larger nose, than I would definitely suggest looking for a pair with an adjustable nose bridge.

On top of that, the straps on these seem awfully weak. With the amount of force needed to adjust them, I was afraid of them snapping while trying to adjust them. It was pretty clear that the straps weren't happy with the amount of force needed, either.",1.0
"I have been using this brand and model goggle for some time.  The puppy got into my gym bag and chewed up my last pair, so time to replace.  Bought these and I don't know if they were defective or what, but after 2 swims, they began to leak.  The soft silicone that goes around the eyes started to get all wavy and finally there was no seal at all.

Ended up getting another pair at the gym.  Liked the brand until this pair.",1.0
"While these goggles are comfortable, they fog up after just a couple uses.  This makes them totally useless in the water.",1.0

I used these a handful of times.  I went to put them on and the band just broke.  It may be because og Florida heat.  I'm going to switch to my old brand. Waste of money.,1.0
"These are the worst swim goggles I've ever used.  First of all, the piece between lenses is made of hard plastic that will dig into the bridge of your nose.  To make it not hurt, I've tried cotton (which is not a good material to use for swimming) and loosened them (they leak).  Also, they started fogging up the second time I used them.  I've only had them a month or so and they're as bad as the one-year old goggles I replaced.

Do not waste your money.",1.0
"I suggest going with the adjustable nose piece because these goggles did not fit me whatsoever.  If you have an above average sized nose at all, I suggest not buying these goggles either. The hard plastic bridge of these goggles rested on the bridge of my nose.  I bought these for triathlon training in a lap pool and was miserable, although I didn't really comprehend exactly how miserable I was until after trying new pair of goggles. I decided to purchase a pair of Speedo mirrowed goggles at Target with adjustable nose for $18 and they were so much better it was unbelievable.  It made swimming much more enjoyable and relaxing when I didn't have to worry about finishing a lap with one eye shut because my lense was filled with water.  I literally had to drain my goggles after each lap.  I tried to really push the limit with the suction to the point that I burst a blood vessel on my eye.  Frankly, i was shocked at how high these goggles were rated. There are obviously much better options out there.",1.0
"I bought theses after researching many goggles on Amazon and other sites. Since I love to shop Amazon and usually have good results by basing my decisions on product reviews, I decided upon this product much to my regret.

The first thing I noticed when putting them on is that they were uncomfortable, particularly in the nose bridge area. These have no adjustment ability as you can see by the photo. They also seemed awkwardly sized (I believe this to be more in the design than size of goggles) around the eye area and caused some discomfort there too. The top rim rested more on my eyebrow than the area above the eyelid as I believe it should.

I contemplated sending them back (after many many purchases I have never returned a product to Amazon) but they did have some features that I liked, such as the clarity of view, the quality of the silicone and the strap.

Returning a product is quite an inconvenience so I tried them on a several times to figure out if maybe it would be more worthwhile to just keep them, but I could not get past how uncomfortable they were around the nose bridge. I am a medium sized female and by far do not have a large or wide nose bridge, so I believe this to be more of a design flaw rather than something that would be unique to a person with my particular features.

Anyway, the material seemed very strong so I (unwisely) thought that perhaps I could pull on them and twist them a little in hopes of stretching out the nose bridge. Bad I idea. I tried several times but it did not seem to loosen the material at all... and finally I pulled and twisted just a little too hard and the product snapped in two.

Now I cannot even return them. Regrettable purchase. And unfortunately, I also bought a couple of other swim related products at the same time that I am also disappointed with and may decide to return. I usually do well on Amazon, but not this time around. :(",1.0
"Sorry, but just because this has the Speedo name does NOT mean it has the Speedo quality.  These do fog continually as well as leak.  I am a Speedo fan and always buy their products, but this gives me second thoughts.",1.0
"Really light weight and flimsy. What you would expect from $2.00 goggles not $12.00.  I have used Speedo goggle for over 40 years and these are the worst value for money goggles i have owned. Maybe I should stick to trying before I buy.

PS my last pair of Speedo goggles lasted 8 years and costed the same price all considered.

2 months is all i give these goggles. If these are really Speedos goggles.......... then Speedo needs to Wake UP.",1.0

Unfortunately, this device doesn't seem to repel anything! I tested the Bite Shield in my garden on a warm afternoon. As the mosquitoes buzzed around my face and swarmed my bare arms and legs, I held the device a few inches in front of me and turned it on. I could hear the fan (very quiet) and smell the geraniol (not unpleasant), but the mosquitoes were absolutely unfazed. They continued to swarm, including in the immediate vicinity of the Bite Shield, and bit me numerous times -- even on the hand that was holding the device! The packaging states that geraniol is 400% more effective than citronella. Well, 400% times zero still equals zero. Very disappointing.

After 4 nights of use (and note that the expensive refills don't last very long), and a dozen bites later, I gave up. Mosquitoes weren't deterred in the least by this product, so don't bother buying it.",1.0
"The first Bite Shield I received was faulty. First the fan wouldn't work then, after being turned on for some hours, it began rotating accompanied by a loud bumping sound. One presumes it was the fan bumping against the body of the Bite Shield. I contacted the manufacturer who said that I would have to contact Amazon, that they couldn't help me.

I did this. And Amazon could not have been more helpful, asking me to return the product and they would send a replacement.

The replacement Bite Shield is also faulty, however: the fan making the same bumping sound as the first unit.

I have just called the manufacturer, again, who said that I should call Amazon. When I said that I intended to write a review of the product, I was told ""we don't care"".

Amazon 5 stars; Bite Shield a minus 5, if that is an option...",1.0

Second, one of the electric models will not hold a charge.  There seems to be a problem with the charger, but they only have a thirty day warranty. Since we had twelve inches of snow on the ground for the six weeks after christmas, we did not know of the problem until after the warranty had expired. We cannot get anyone at the company on the phone, so we cannot order a replacement. Third problem, on this particular model, every time my child rides it the rear wheel falls off!  We have tried on numerous occasions to contact someone at Razor to no avail.  They do not provide company contact information in their owner's manual.  We went online to try to find a customer service number. They do not have people answering the phones, we had to leave a message--no one ever returns our calls.

dont fit and the straps hurt your legs but if u put them on lighter they come off. They just suck really bad. If you want good knee and elbow pads get protec ones,1.0
"Not adult sized. They are a Medium (there's an M tag inside) so they should be sold as a Medium not ""Adult"". They did not fit and had to be returned.",1.0

These pads fell apart within a few months of use by my 7 year old who basically used them 2-3 times a week. Wouldn't recommend them to anyone.,1.0

flimsy.,1.0
"Very poor quality and feel terrible when worn on bare skin.  I thought the Gel would increase the padding, but it did not.  They do not stay in place even if you make them very tight.",1.0
These are huge! I thought they were for kids but i guess not. They would be way to big for my 2 and 6 year old. Is this a mistake? Every time i searched for kids knee pads these came up.,1.0
Paid $12.99 returned completely unopened and only got $8 back...RIP OFF!,1.0
"I'm sure they work for whoever really wants to use them, but they definitely do not fit around every joint. I'm not fat, not even slightly plump, not a smidge over average. I wear a 4-6 in pants and I can't fit these comfortably around my knees. I wish the straps were a little longer. They were barely longer than the straps for the elbows. The elastic was so uncomfortable that I rather not wear knee pads at all. The elbow pads fit perfect, though.",1.0
These fell apart after 3 uses. The velcro came apart so they won't stick on my son's knees or elbows and the knee padding is already coming out. I am very disappointed with this product.,1.0
The first time my son put the knee pads on the velcro came completely unstitched from the padding.  Very disappointed.  I will be returning for a new pair hoping for a better result.,1.0

the kneepads broke after a week of use by my ten year old. but I haven't found her elbow pads yet so was unable to return them before the allowed time frame. guess i'm just out the money and will have to resort to duct tape. lol,1.0
"Poor stitching,  velcro came loose on first use",1.0

These were a big disappointment.  Broke after the first use.  I ended up having to go to Sport Chalet to buy another bunch.  These have lasted much better.  Would not buy again.,1.0
"I thought we'd love these.  We hardly used these at all cause they are so big and bulky on my girls.  They aren't shaped like other knee and elbow pads I have seen since buying these that fit much better.  Anyway, the hard protective part of one of the elbow pads has already pulled away from the part that secures it to the arm & we've literally only used these a handful of times.  Maybe we got a defective elbow pad.  Thanks for reading!",1.0
Too small for an adult so I gave them to charity and ordered something else.,1.0
Bought these for my 6 year old for skateboarding camp.  The knee pads fell apart after day 2.,1.0
I bought these for my daughter who tends to fall a lot. We bought her a scooter for her birthday and felt these would help protect her. One of the knee pads broke on her FIRST FALL! Unfortuately I waited 2 DAYS too long to return them! What a joke. I will definitely tell people not to buy these.,1.0
"While the picture may seem to represent STURDY devices, and while I thought the ORANGE sections were covering hard NUTS, it's just a facade.  I bought these because I wanted to protect my child's elbows and knees, and I feel scammed.  They should indicate TOYS ONLY WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR CHILD IN MOST CASES.  Who would these work for, maybe Santa.  Terrible.  PS: It's not the fault of the seller, but the MANUFACTURER and our government that allows such products to be sold.",1.0
The only reason I rate these items so low is there is no mention of small size of the pads.  The description should mention these are not meant for larger individuals.  When I tried putting on the knee pads the straps would not even go 3/4 around my leg.  I was looking for a way to order a larger size but there was no way to do that.  So I assumed they were one size fits all.  That was not the case so I had to return these.  And the return process went very smoothly and I got my money back right away.,1.0
pay the extra $20-30 for real skate pads.  These don't stay on my 7 year old and the stitching is completely blown out on one of the pads.  worthless.,1.0
"You might feel, these would protect the kids joint, but these are too big for toddlers, and eventually fall often, you might need to sit back and tie them.",1.0
"These do not have the full sleeve that pulls on, but just straps that go around above and below the joint.  It wasn't what I was looking for, so I returned it.  The razor ones for basically the same price ended up feeling much more solid.",1.0
We did not even get to use these. The velcro closures were not secure to the product making them impossible to secure to my 4 year old gdaughter.,1.0
"When received the package, clearly on the back of the package it states NOT TO BE USED ON MOTORIZED VEHICLES.
I'm returning and purchasing pads specifically for motorcross.
Although the pads would probably be ok with the Razor Motorcross Bike, if my grandson became injured because they weren't OK, then I would be upset that I didn't follow through with returning them.
SO... warning to others, just because they are recommended by Amazon or frequently bought by others who also purchased the Razor Motorcross bike, they are not designed for use on motorized vehicles.",1.0
These pads are really large. Didn't fit my average 8 & 10 yr old boys. My kids complain that they itch and detest them! They also do not fit securely when I tried them on myself.  No good at all.,1.0
"Ive been trying to get more active and so I've picked back up skateboarding and ordered these pads at the same time as i put in my order for my board.  So of course, having one and not the other now I'm highly disappointed. Im 32. There is nothing on the description i found that said these were for little kids. My 13 year old nephew couldn't even use these. The strap will barely go around my knee at all and I'm not big at all, I'm wiry.  Not only are they tiny but they look like they are made cheap. I know they aren't the most expensive pads in the world but after you put down money for shipping they aren't exactly free either.  I love shopping online because it takes away the headache of dealing with busy stores but I'm not taking another chance with safety equipment. I'm getting mine from the store so i can see what I'm getting.",1.0
"Worst knee pads don't listen to anyone these are all fake reviews, someone hacked my account and wrote a fake review shame..",1.0
"The instructions for this product actually call for THREE people to put it together.  My boyfriend and I managed to do it with two, after about 45 minutes and a great fear of losing our eyes.  If you do buy this (which I do not recommend), put it together on a carpeted area, that seemed to help us.  I will NEVER take it apart for storage - first, because I'm scared, and second, because it will take days to put it back together.  Also, at one of the places where it had been welded, it is rusting AND one of the legs was too big to screw onto it's peg.  Oh - and there is an unadvertised weight limit of 200lbs - so you can only use this if you just sort of need it, not if you really need it.",1.0
"Good luck putting it together-it takes 3 people

god knows why they didn't just send it assembled......total waste of money",1.0
"This trampoline was the perfect size, but unfortunately from the get go the legs would turn in after a few minutes of bouncing and then it would wobble and be off balance.  I had to turn it upside down and ""flatten"" it several times per hour in order to use it...if you didn't jump exactly in the middle it would not work.  I tried tightening the screws, rebuilding it (thought I might have done something wrong), etc.. I ended up junking it with remorse because as I said, the size was Perfect (sigh).  I had no problems putting it together though it was challenging it was doable.",1.0
"We've had this for about 4 months.  About a month ago, the stitching on the blue wrapping has broken and the white cushioning inside is now coining apart.  My kids do not use this product regularly but when they do use it they do have fun. The problem though is it makes my remodeled basement look cheap since the cushioning is falling apart.  But the pricier one, it probably won't do this!",1.0

"The metal was all rusted underneath paint. Looked like someone is refurbishing old crappy ones, spray painting the metal to make it look new and then adding a new screen top/bumper. Terrible design also. Once it was opened it didn't take much for it to fold back in on itself. Would not recommend.",1.0
Was missing a key part to assemble the trampoline.  Completely unusable.  Was hoping to exchange or return but missed the 30 day window to do  so.,1.0
"Oh my gosh, I don't know where to begin.  My husband spent an hour trying to assemble but the screw holes were not even aligned, we had to return.  Overall a cheap Chinese product!",1.0
"The threading of the legs was two large on one, and the leg would not stay on. The entire trampoline has very little bounce. I went out and found a better one that used springs instead of elastic, I paid less for it and it is a much better product!",1.0
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I just threw it out.  It is next to impossible to put together, even with two people.  You have to stretch apart the two halves to make it one piece and we could not make it happen.  Shipping it back would be too much of a hassle.  Pay a little more for a well rated trampoline, this one I would never recommend.

The seller is welcome to rectify the situation.",1.0

"I bought this because my doctor recommend rebounding for lymphatic drainage. I was excited when it arrived and my sister, father and I started putting it together. This proved to be quite the difficult task. It requires three able bodied adults (men in my opinion) to assemble this beast so it took forever for us to get it to lay flat. When we went to get the bolts we found there were none and we all agreed that it would be far too dangerous to use without bolting it together. This product was painstakingly disassembled and put in the trash.",1.0
Absolutly STRESSFUL to put together. I am returning it. PLEASE buy one put together or you'll need to call The Hulk!!!,1.0
"I read several off the reviews in advance of ordering this trampoline and it seemed that the set up was hard for some people. I was not worried about that and ended up having a simple set up. Some of the reviews talked about springs and there are none. :(
The elasticity is coming form bands, that I just not making the trampoline very jumpy... the idea was that my son would be able to dump into his basket ball hoop, but his jump really hardly improved on the trampoline. It also gets bend very easily.
Overall pretty bad quality and it smelled bad when it arrived.",1.0
"Sucks , not very much bounce cause of no springs , won't last very long because elastic will wear out !",1.0
returned it,1.0
"Just a note, since mine is still in pieces. It takes two people with incredible arm strength to put this together. I have a broken joint after my husband tried to do it himself. I would recommend if you get this product to get it already assembled.  Not something you should be doing at home.",1.0
"This trampoline was impossible to assemble. In order to assemble the trampoline one must thread 4 quarters of the frame through loops on the trampoline, attach the frame pieces to form two halves, and then open the trampoline like a bear trap. The two frame halves are supposed to snap together. Finally, one must insert two screws to prevent the frame from folding. Opening the trampoline requires considerable force. It definitely would not be safe for one person to do alone. The instructions recommend that three able bodied individuals complete this step, but two adults should not have any trouble unfolding the device. When I unfolded the unit I purchased, the holes did not line up. There was so much tension that it was not possible to align the holes. After several tries we got the holes aligned close enough to insert the screws, but one screw would not go in. When we folded the trampoline we discovered that one of the screws still would not go into the hole. It is not clear whether the hole was originally defective or if it was damaged when we tried to turn the screw into the hole. I am returning the trampoline, and I will not be reordering this model again.",1.0
"Maybe if I could put it together, it would work just fine. I cut my finger and got bruises on my legs while trying to piece this trampoline together. I even asked for help from my friends and it was stuck and definitely not hinged together correctly. Sad because I was really excited to use this! Feels rather cheap - but I guess you get what you pay for...I'll be returning it somehow even though it is rather large...sigh.",1.0

"Got this for light exercise, but barely made it out of the box (after assembly, of course) when it broke with the first jumper - a 40 pound 6 year old! I suspect this product is defective.",1.0
Returning item due to the difficulty of assembly.  It is extremely hard and over 2 hours I still can't get them connected.  Even the included instructions are written for assistance of two additional individuals.  Disappointed because I gave it the benefit of the doubt when others talked about the assembly process but others said they had no problem.  I don't know how they assembled it so easy.  I was really looking forward to using this as a cool workout.,1.0
No real spring bounce. My 3-yr-old and I got off after several bounces. It hurts and doesn't actually create any BOUNCE. It's not even spring. It's like a heavy-duty spandex. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Worst purchase of 2014.,1.0
"Mine must have been one that someone returned; it was missing instructions and appeared to be opened.  It was missing two bolts that help hold it together.  After finding the instructions online (thanks Amazon!) I decided to return it instead of risking broken limbs.  Building it is akin to setting a 300lb mousetrap.  You are supposed to have two dudes stand on one end and pry the other end down into place.  Not complicated, but not acceptable as a consumer product.  And like others said  - there's no springs; just rubbery elastic bands instead.

Avoid this, and buy something fully assembled.",1.0
"My eyes are still watering from taking this out of the box 10 minutes ago. It has the most awful chemical smell I have experienced on any product. It smells like it was in a fire or smoked. The blue fabric band that goes around the outside is also discolored in spots all over , there are just spots that it is green instead of blue. It kills me to return this since Christmas is 1 day away and this was #1 on my kids list but I don't think I have a choice. So disappointed!!",1.0
"Easy to assemble but unfortunately when I stepped on it the middle part dropped to the bottom, not enough tension.",1.0
"This is our 2nd try after returning the first one because it bowed.  The 2nd one did the same thing.  Very cheaply made, would not recommend this product!",1.0
"One of the worst product. Please don't buy this. The assembly is a joke. It would be a huge pain. They claim you need 3 people to assemble this crap. The stand instead of black on all four legs was black, grey. didn't even felt it was new. Tried to assemble on my own and felt helpless. Wonder how the smart people who bought this were assembling and why i didn't review this product before buying.",1.0
I don't recommend it. The metal circle frame bends easily (it comes in two semicircles and you have to put it together). It may constitute a hazard situation. The legs feel a bit fragile. Better buy a similar product where the upper metal circle is a single part.,1.0
"I didn't even keep this trampoline.  It was impossible to put together, and gave off a horrible odor that smelled like fire.  I couldn't wait to get it out of my house.  It had some kind of warning about the smell in the box- kind of an oxymoron for a product that you're buying to make you healthier.  I ended up buying a much more expensive trampoline from a company that specializes in them, it arrived assembled, and is working out very well.",1.0
"Well, I tried to assemble it with various amounts of other people on multiple occasions and we just couldn't do it. By the time I decided to just give up (earlier today) when I couldn't get it with THREE other people all pulling on it, I tried to return it and it's past the date. Now I'm stuck with this stupid thing that I can't get to work. The kicker is that I still need a trampoline. I wish I'd just gone to a store and bought one already assembled at this point. I have NEVER been unable to assemble something in the past, and don't frustrate easily, so either the one I got is somehow defective or this thing is just impossible. You shouldn't have to have a dinner party of 8 in order to try to assemble the thing.",1.0
there was no option lower than one star.  the trampoline bands broke within two weeks of purchase.,1.0
"Absolute Garbage!  2 of the legs were too wide so they would not stay on.  Screw threads would not grip.  They were unwilling to send replacements and said they would send a replacement of the whole product, but it never came and then they stopped replying to emails.  Had to Glue the legs on, but it still tries to fold in a little bit and will not stay flat with all the legs on the floor.",1.0
We had 3 adults put this together as directed.  The pieces keep coming apart.  My son weighs 65 lbs. and he is the only one who uses it.,1.0
"I've used many rebounders over the years and this one is horrible in comparison. I thought this version without springs might be better but it has NO BOUNCE. It doesn't have the proper feel of recoil and low impact benefits at all. Yuck! A huge disappointment. If you want an actual mini tramp and all the lymphatic system benefits of a soft, springy bouncing experience AVOID this product!",1.0
"Worst item we've ever bought! Put together no problem. (I have 4 kids so putting things together is like a part time job and I have never had an issue with not being able to follow directions) My daughter was so excited to get this for her ""graduation"" from elementary school, after about 5 days of jumping the posts started to bend inward and the whole trampoline went wiggly. We never allowed more than one child on it and my daughter weighs about 50 pounds so it wasn't an issue of too much weight. The metal rim went wavy and was extremely dangerous. We took the posts off and put it in the dump! Amazon refunded us immediately, that is why we will remain amazon customers but I will never buy a product from this place again.",1.0
I had to return it because I could not assemble it even with two other people helping. It also had a terrible chemical smell.,1.0
This completely fell apart within 6 months of purchase with very light use.  The metal frame warped and the fabric on the sides ripped.  My kids are both under 80 lbs and used it for about 10-15 minutes maybe 3 times a week.  Very disappointing and not worth even the relatively modest purchase price.,1.0
Receive the trampoline and did not realize it doesn't use springs .  Much harder to jump on...:-(,1.0
"Ladies, save your money and do not buy this.  It is impossible to assemble.  After opening it and reading the assembly instructions, it tells you you need 3 adults in good physical condition to assemble this. Per instructions it requires that three adults (male, that is) use their body weight all at the same time at different places in order to install.  So why don't they tell you this in the description?  I tried to return it, but was informed it would cost me $15.00 shipping, so I'm not even going to bother.  This product is entirely misrepresented. This is my first bad experience with Amazon.  They should not accept these kinds of products from vendors to sell.  It really hurts Amazon's image, in my opinion.",1.0

"The trampoline was difficult to put together, I had 2 people helping and we could not fit the pieces together.  I do believe it was bent.  The trampoline also arrived smoke damaged, it had a campfire smell to it and everyone who tried to put it together noticed the horrible smell too.

"This trampoline was purchased by my 11 year old son who weighs a total of 80 lbs. When we first received the trampoline and pulled it out of the box, it was broken. The company was good to send a replacement but after about 5 uses, the new replacement trampoline broke!!! The first was defective in a weld on the frame, the second had legs that bent in. My son is not a big person at all!! I am scared to think what an adults weight would do to this cheaply built tramp. I don't recommend this product at all - not even for little kids!",1.0
"When I purchased this item it did not read how many people it was going to take to put together
It arrive and I open it to read you need 3 people you have got to be kidding!!!! We bought this for exercise for my husbands heart issues recommended by his cardiologist. Now he is 72 140 pounds you have got to be kidding when you see what needs to be done to get this put together.  If the box had not been open we could of sent it back for a full refund but since the box was opened you have a restocking fee a this a that what a mess. We have bought from you people a lot but you need to disclose more information. I called the church and they had 4 boys from the football team come put this thing together. Home delivery is not the best option as they had the same one at sports authority for the same price already put together I could of paid someone to go get it. Let us see you post this honest review does not deserve a one star!!!!! Very us satisfied with the last 2 items I have bought from Amazon",1.0
"I have put these together before.  It's hard, but not awful.

The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult.  THREE.  Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time?  Almost never.  So, needless to say, it's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up.

My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together, and finally gave up.

THEN, the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say ""Keep away from open flame"".  But, I think this is more like ""Do not light a match while this is in the room"".",1.0
"For us, one of the two weld joints in the circular frame broke during set-up. No major harm done -- just the annoyance of returning the thing and finding a different trampoline.

But for you, the weld joint could break while your child is jumping on it. If this happens, the tension keeping the four steel arcs of the circle in place will suddenly snap and the trampoline may fold up very quickly -- and perhaps the jumper will be fine, and perhaps the jumper will be seriously hurt.

"I wish I never would have bought this piece of crap. I can't even return it because the box was mangled and open when I received it. I should have read all those bad reviews before I purchased but I never ever thought that this would be such a nightmare! I have both my two kids 5 and under jumping up and down excitedly my trampoline! My trampoline! little do they know that this mom can't assemble the piece of junk by herself. I can't believe that actually states in the instructions that three people are required...would have been nice to know before hand. very disappointing now I'm out my money that I spend on this, when I could have just went to Walmart and paid 30 bucks to buy one already set up.",1.0
Sent it back... Way too hard to put it together. Even with 3 adults. Gonna try to find one that comes put together.,1.0
"1. One of the legs was way too tight when I tried to screw it on. Had to use a vice grip, gloves, and lubricant.
2 .One of the legs was way too loose.
3. The springyness is Definitely Not as good as a spring-based unit.

You get what you pay for. Or maybe not

I thought this would take 15 minutes to put together, but it took more like 45, given the above issues.

Not awesome.

It's passable for my daughter.

and It's one of those things where if I just put this much time into putting it together to find out I think it's meh, do I want to take it apart, and put it in a box, and take the time and effort to ship it back.

Win some, you loose some.",1.0
"When the package came, there was a warning that it contains cancer causing toxins that causes birth defects, reproductive harm, etc...How can anyone with a conscience allow their kids to jump on this?

"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my son. After a bit of a struggle two adults managed to get it together. Unfortunately every couple of hours the screw came loose and the trampoline would begin to fold up. By the next day the metal was broken. Very dangerous. Unfortunately, my son never got to use it and since it didn't get opened until Christmas my window to return it has passed. I would not recommend this product. Poorly made and very dangerous for anyone, especially kids.",1.0
Feet may become trapped in cover while jumping. Metal not sturdy enough to support adult. Leg bent first time I used it.,1.0
"This thing set up nice but after using it with 5 year olds, it bends and is warped.  The blue tarp was stained yellow and looked like a dog peed on it.",1.0

I bought this trampoline hoping it would be made well - parts of it were - there was actually a screw to keep the trampoline from folding up while being used!!!!  The bad part - the fabric is so cheaply made - it ripped the first time I used it - sooooooo  thank goodness for duck tape!!!,1.0
This product bent the first time it was used and completely fell apart in less than a week.  It was used by my 7 year old who weighs less than 60 lbs.  I do not recommend buying this product.,1.0

"This trampoline has no bounce to it! There are no springs,so it really isn't even a trampoline,it just looks like a trampoline. Pointless piece of crap,please don't waste your time and money.

"The instructions states that you need 3 healthy adult people to put it together.  It is EXTREMELY difficult to assemble and
injury is certain if you don't have the proper support.  DO NOT try it alone or with just two people, it's dangerous.",1.0
This came in pieces and the it is impossible to assemble.  It's so tight it's impossible to stretch it enough to connect the frame.  Useless,1.0
The product was purchased for my granddaughter who is 4 years old.  The circle is out of round so when the trampoline is sitting on the legs it does not sit flat.  I would never recommend purchasing a product like this online.  If I would have purchased this from a department store I could have returned it for another one.,1.0
"This product looked very sturdy and well built with parts in box, but after assembling it never worked as advertised.  Product comes in semi-circle sections that require bolting together in two places.  The bolts never stayed tightened and the trampline would twist out of round.  Very frustrating!  In the end kids used it in twisted conditions which then caused the screwed in legs to strip and fail.  Not worth buying at any price!!",1.0
"I bought this for my 4 year old, 35 lb. daughter with Autism.  She's tiny and needs the stimulus for her sensory needs.

Assembly:  While a lot of people complained, I didn't find it to be THAT difficult if you are careful.  My husband and I put it together without a third person and managed to get it done within 10 mins. without injury.

The little tiny bolts that keep this thing from snapping back like a bear trap are not enough to keep my kiddos safe.  We assembled it late last night and the frame starts to slowly bend back after a few strong jumps.  We popped it back and checked the screws only to find that one of them had come loose.  So... we tightened it.  It came loose again.  We tightened it with a power tool (don't ask me what it's called, it's a guy toy) and once again, it came loose.

When you are trusting your tiny little special needs kid on this thing, a little loose screw is simply terrifying.  I can see it closing like a bear trap and hurting my baby.  And she only weighs 35 pounds.  WELL BELOW the 200 pound limit.

All I can say is Be CAREFUL!!!!  And ALWAYS watch when your kids are using it.",1.0
"One of the legs of the Trampoline is broken !!, everything is beautiful with this Trampoline but unfortunately when i got the package and tried to install it i found that one of the legs is broken n i can't put it in the right place so now i can't use the Trampoline because it's unstable without that broken leg ....",1.0
"i kept this because my sons worked so hard and long outting it together, risking injury to themselves, i couldn't ask them to take it apart for return! but its flimsy and crooked and terrible",1.0
"The legs do not all sit evenly on the ground, making the trampoline very wobbly. If you put even the slighted weight on the out side frame, it will fold and collapse. It has dumped my 7 year old son off twice. This thing is far inferior to other similar trampolines I have owned. An accident waiting to happen!",1.0
"It was great for about a month, then started getting squeaky. The noise got louder and louder every time I used it up until now, where the noise is very loud. It's squeaks more than the trampoline I had with springs ever did. Very very noisy, and I have no idea how to ""fix"" it.",1.0
"Four different family members attempted to assemble this mess of parts, and all that was accomplished was cursing and bad moods!  The diagram that indicates the parts of the trampoline fails to list the first two pieces that need to be assembled, and the only identifiable object in the black and white faded pictures that accompany the instructions was the person's sneaker! I'm not sure that the instructions were even meant for this specific trampoline. And trying to re-package all the parts so that I could return the trampoline presented a whole other aggravating situation in itself! Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for a mini trampoline that already comes assembled!",1.0
"Purchased this for my 5 year old son so he would stop with the couch. The frame warps if you step on the side so it isn't level and flat and results in an unsafe surface to jump on. Also, one of the legs won't stay screwed. I think the leg is stripped and it came that way. I am now past the return policy so I can't return it.
I do like the jumping surface and the fact that it is springless. If it weren't for the frame issue I would have given 4 stars.",1.0
This prodouct did not last.  It broke in about two weeks.  And never went together quite right it seamed defective from the start,1.0
"not bouncy at all!!! So disappointed, I was actually looking forward to using this.  Also started to tear on the edges.  Very difficult to assemble, definitely need more than 1 person.  Wish I hadnt spent the money on this.",1.0
"I don't usually write reviews but I would truly warn you not to buy this one product; especially since it is dangerous!  We cannot believe the terrible design and quality of this product.  If I could give zero stars I would.

Firstly, the assembly was dangerous.  Secondly, after assembled it seemed to us that the frame was not completely straight.  However, we figured that when the unit was upright and weight on it that it would straighten out.

Not only have the legs and frame not straightened out, but they are bent over even further and the frame has never straightened out either.  In addition, the vinyl cover that goes over the bands is completely shredded already.

We have owned a few different brands of these type of trampolines over time and this one is the worst we have ever had.

At a minmum, I think the manufacturer should replace it under warranty.  However, I'm not even sure how we could ship this thing.  Quite frankly, we are ready to throw it into the garbage.

I am quite surprised that Amazon themsleves is selling an item of this quality.  I wouldn't be as surprised if it was sold by a third party vendor.  I will have to rate this product at zero stars.",1.0
"I bought this trampoline as a Christmas gift for daughter. It has not been in use for long. The legs are wobbling, the threads are loose,the bolts are falling off. The blue plastic covering stinks. Is there somewhere I can return this and get my money back?terrible quality.",1.0
product lasted a week.  put it together properly with tension equally distributed.  trampoline warped to the point of not being able to sit flat on the floor.  this is the second one purchased.  the other one (a different brand) broke at the joint .  gotta love the quality of our manufacturers!!  profit first--quality last.,1.0
"This product is extremely unsafe to put together.  And after the fact, we had only been using the trampoline for 1 week, when the tension began to bend/bow the frame.  I am scared that it will snap in half from the tension.  It recommends up to 200 lbs.  We aren't close to that.  Do not buy this product.",1.0
"Got this to add to the playroom and its still in pieces...very hard to put together. My husband is deployed and why did I think I could do this myself, lol. The directions say you need 2-3 adults...terrible purchase.",1.0
"I've had this trampoline for over a year now and it has held together fine, but I haven't used it much. I finally bought one at Walmart (cheaper - for only $30) and realized that this one does indeed fall short. I'm about 165 pounds right now and the trampoline doesn't seem to bounce enough - - like I hit the max stretch and then stop abruptly before returning upwards, which hurts my body!! No fun at all! The one I just bought has metal springs and is way more comfortable to jump on!",1.0
"This was a Christmas gift and before the day was through, the frame was completely bent.  My kids are fairly small and should not have made a huge impact on it.  Also one of the legs was stripped by the end of the day.  Poor quality.",1.0
"FIRST POST NOV 13 ""It bounces""
My 7 yo daughter bought this to jump on. She says its awesome. It was easy enough to set up and came as advertised. Not sure what more $ would have got me.
UPDATED FEB 20 Trash STAY AWAY!
My 14 yr old son (100 lbs) jumped on it and somehow one of legs got bent and stripped out the threads. Rest of trampoline is fine. No big deal right- I'll order replacement leg...WRONG. The trampoline will go to recycling for scrap metal.
Since I'm outside of the 90 warranty window Bravo Sports will not replace it and they do NOT have replacement parts? They said they'd sell me another and ""help me out"" on shipping. What a joke. The other issue with Bravo Sports is that their online support link doesn't work so the only way to contact them is to call. Wish I would have known this 2 days ago.
Anyhow you get what you pay for and this was $29.99 I'd like my 7yo daughter to get back. All she wanted to do is bounce and now she's grounded.
Amazon should drop this company. Especially since on their site they give an impression they have replacement parts but in reality they do not.",1.0
Unless you have at least three people to help you put this thing together .... you aren't going to. I bought it as a Christmas present for my daughter. Unfortunately I have a disability in one arm and between my daughter and I we are unable to put this thing together. For others it might not be a problem but for us it is very frustrating. We have no strong male family members to rely on and no friends who are able to come over and help us out. The delivery was super fast and I do appreciate that part of it... but I truly cannot say what it is like to use this product. Perhaps they should consider making it easier to put together ... or maybe let people purchase it already assembled.,1.0
"This thing is an absolute piece of junk. Not sturdy at all. You can't move it at all with out it wanting to twist back up and be crooked, meaning you really can't use it for it's intended purpose, which is to jump on it. I read and reread the instructions, I know I have it together correctly, so maybe I just got a defective one, as all of the reviews were good for this. I read them to be sure. Really think I'll be returning this.",1.0
"I had high hopes for this mini trampoline. I spent a lot of time reading reviews for this item as well as different trampolines. Finally, I settled on this one because the positive reviews seemed fair.

Packaging was good and Amazon delivered our item fast. The trampoline does require at least two adults for assembly, but we completed the assembly (both times!) within 15 minutes.

We noticed the trampoline seemed to be unsteady after only a few weeks of light use. The frame was bent and it was no longer safe to use so we contacted Amazon and they quickly and courteously took care of initiating the exchange process. We assume the trampoline became bent after using it in our backyard on the grass, but this still seems unusual. 99% of the time, the trampoline was used inside of our home on a carpeted surface. We never exceeded the weight limit.

We promptly received the replacement trampoline and began the assembly process. It must have been a refurbished replacement (though this is just an assumption), because the net/jumping surface was already installed on the frame. The final step of assembly is screwing on the legs and at this point we realized one of the legs did not fit on the trampoline. We tried switching around the legs, but the threading just didn't seem to fit for this particular leg, rendering the trampoline useless.

So disappointed. We boxed up the item for a 2nd time and initiated the return process. In this case, we are opting for a refund and we will look for a different brand in the near future. Perhaps we just had bad luck for these two items and I hope future buyers receive a more competent product.

On a positive note, Amazon has provided great customer service.",1.0
"Got this for school kids- we ordered 5 The trampoline when assembled were all twisted and bend. It was hard to assemble. Please do not buy it, totally unsafe for kids. We definitely expected better quality. Returned them all back. This is the first time an Amazon listed product was returned and was not good.",1.0
"Not at all stable! The circle frame comes in four parts, and when put together they did not create a flat circle.  When together only 2 of the 6 feet hit the floor at any given moment.  Not stable and not at all safe for my 2.5 year old son to bounce on.  This is going back.",1.0
"I am very angry with myself that I didn't read the warnings.....this is too difficult for me to put together.....hence worthless/useless ..

However the people selling this should have clearly stated that it needs a lot of work to assemble .......N~",1.0
"After jumping on it for 20 minutes by my 6 year old, the outer bars became crooked and the legs are not on the ground anymore.  And the threads of the legs are no longer tightening.... sending it back.",1.0
I was not happy with this item.  The leg was not steady and keep falling apart.  I was looking forward to excersice with this item but it really disappointed me.,1.0
I purchased this for an exercise tool. It worked for the first two weeks or so (used about 3 times per week) and then started to fall apart. I literally was jumping on it when it buckled and basically threw me off. We put it back together only to have it happen again about a week later. I am nervous to jump on it because it keeps buckling and is very unsafe. Honestly please do not waste your time or your money on this product. Spend a little extra and buy a high-quality item.,1.0
"Took a couple people several tries to get it together in the first place, and it never really went together straight.  Within an hour the whole thing was so twisted and racked, it's unusable.",1.0
This was very difficult to put together.  It takes 3 people to follow the directions.  The very first day the soddering broke and had to be returned.,1.0
Why is amazon selling something that like this that so many people say is very dangerous to assemble??? Look at the one-star reviews - they'll scare the applesauce outa you!,1.0
"This product is garbage! My husband spent hours trying to put it together, and he is a very handy guy. He has worked in the construction industry and can usually put things together without instructions. He was ready to throw this trampoline right in the garbage! He said that even if he could get it together, he would never let our kids play on it. It's that bad!!!",1.0
"I'm shocked that this is sold as a trampoline, at least one that could be sold to an adult. I set it up and found that there was little more spring than standing on a sheet. There's no bounce, and I was very upset that this wasn't made clear. My mattress had more spring. I immediately boxed it back up and returned the item. This might work for a child, as the lack of bounce is safer than standard spring trampolines, but this served zero purpose for any adult looking for a trampoline to warm up on or exercise with. Not recommended at all. Spend the extra $30 and get a trampoline that specifically has springs.",1.0
I haved been rebounding for the last 15 years. My old one finally became unusable thanks to a few springs breaking.  I didn't want to spend too much for a new one. The reviews on amazon were ok on this one except for setup which was fine for me with the help of 2 people like it said. But I have used it 4 times. It a lot harder to bounce on then my last one which at first I thought well I'll get a better workout & burn more calories. But Ow! my feet don't seem to bounce flat thus making my ankles feet & knees hurt. So It is weird like you are bouncing on an angle almost like my feet sink in & turn my ankles in like it's not sturdy enough or not supportive enough & I'm only 130 pounds. So in my oppinion that's dangerous for joints which is why I was using it in the first place. So this one is going back to avoid injury!,1.0
My son ordered this product so that he and his friends could jump before slam dunking his baskestball into the hoop. He used it for about three days staight and then the legs one by one bent back until all that was left was a blue ring on my pavement. I think the quality is very low but for $30 I guess you get what you pay for....,1.0
I am very dissapointed in this product.  The last one I bought I purchased from Sears and this one is a mess.  My 3 boys are thin and jump on this on the inside and it not even usuable.  The washers have fallen out and it falls apart easily!! Not a happy camper!!,1.0
"This trampoline is VERY dangerous to put together.  It snapped shut several times while I was trying to assemble it.  After finally getting it together the holes where the screws go didn't even line up!!  It works fine after you get it together, but the worst trampoline ever to put together!!!",1.0
"First let me assure everyone that, yes we did put this together correctly.
within a week it looks like it is warped. 2 sides are coming up so much that those 2 legs don't even touch the ground anymore.
The remaining 4 legs appear to be starting to buckle in.
Obviously the trampoline is completely unstable and unsafe at this point.
It's disappointing. My son loved it and is not happy that his mama is taking it apart and sending it away.
I am going to try and attach a photo also to show you what I mean...20 minutes later...I can't figure out how to attach an image.
Sorry.
If anyone knows how and is interested in seeing the pic,  let me know (I have a mac)",1.0
"We were very disappointed in this item. It was very difficult to put together. In fact, it even broke during assembly. I am very hesitant to use this name brand again. This was supposed to be a Santa gift for my daughter. She couldn't even play with it and we had to think of some other ""reason"" for her not to open it on Christmas Day. Not at all what we pictured for Chrismas morning.",1.0
"This trampoline is not well made. I purchased one and tried to put it together and couldn't, so I purchased another to see if maybe it was just a fluke. Neither of them went together in a way that they could be used safely. This is one of very few Amazon purchases that have truly disappointed.",1.0
Do not buy this item.  Trying to assemble this was impossible.  There were three grown men and weren't even close to getting this together.  I'm sending it back.,1.0
"We bought this trampoline last Christmas for our kids. Assembly did not seem to be an issue. The blue cover started ripping after about 4 months. 11 months later, all of a sudden, the frame bent, and the trampoline became unusable. It has only been used by a 3 and a 12-year-old kids (not overweight). Have to find a different model now. My friend has had a 36 inch Gold's Gym Circuit Trainer Mini Trampoline, which lasted so far for two years and has seen a number of teenagers. I guess, I'd go with that one.",1.0
"Beware of this product. After less than one week of use it broke, A metal rim. It presents the risk of danger to the user. My little niece could have been severely injured, paralyzed or even killed and it's only grace that she's o.k.",1.0
"Only after receiving this and attempting to assemble it did I decide to read Amazon reviews to read other peoples experience, because mine could not be assembled.  I'm convinced there must be a couple of different products being shipped or the mat size must be very inconsistent because some people find it impossible to assemble and others simply have someone hold one end while another person snaps it in place. Mine under great tension wasn't close to being close to working.  I don't think the football team could have done it either, the mat simply didn't seem to fit.  There are 4 parts to the metal frame. To connect the two pairs to have 2 semi-circles (supposedly the easy part) was actually very difficult. I needed to pry a band (that wraps around the frame, instead of having springs attached) over the protruding threads (for the legs to be screwed onto later) and back to be able to do that.  The semi-circle metal frame had an outside diameter of 36"", not 38"" as advertised (and it didn't say ""Airzone"" anywhere), so I returned it and received a prompt refund.",1.0
"Do not buy if you don't have at least two burly friends.  Even when you do,  they will likely be injured in the making of this trampoline.  The pieces don't fit together and the instructions don't help at all!! The box should come with gauze and bandages for your inevitable injury!!  We spent half an hour on the first two steps in the instructions.  AND FAILED.  And we are two college graduates who work out.  We considered it an accomplishment to put all the pieces back in the box so we could ship it back to god-foresaken place it came from!!!!  Do not buy. This product has ruined my love of trampolines forever.

Why can't the pieces just come welded together in a slightly larger box?  Then, no injuries would occur.  I should be CEO of this company.  But if I were, I would just cease production on these trampolines.",1.0
"It was so hard to put together, i hard a shoulder pain from assembling this mini trampoline. I find it hard to put together so I'm getting a new one that would be easier to assembly. This is going to the Garbage.",1.0
"I was NOT happy with this trampoline. It was impossible to put together safely...and I stopped half way through because I was worried me or my friend would loose an eye. Once I boxed it back up, I called Dick's Sporting Good and they had the same one for the same price and they would assemble it. SOOOOO much easier. It squeeks a little, but seems to be holding up pretty good. But if I couldn't get someone else to put it together I would have gone with a different kind all together. It really is a horrible design if you have to assemble it yourself.",1.0
"When I read other reviews that said it was dangerous to assemble, I just thought maybe they weren't doing it correctly. Be forewarned, until you put the bolts/screw in (which we didn't receive), the trampoline CAN snap shut with FORCE.  My husband was injured.  Having three adults is the best safety precaution, just make sure they are all in place before the final stretching into place of the trampoline. One strong adult can push the trampoline into place, while two others can hold it down to make sure their half does not snap back while the bolts/screws are being put in. I wouldn't have attempted this in the first place if I knew the potential for injury. It's just not worth it.",1.0
This product is almost impossible to put together.  As many others have mentioned you could get seriously hurt trying to assemble this thing. It was obvious that the product I got was purchased and return only for me to have to return it again.,1.0

"This product had no value to me and I had to ship it back. Very disappointing.  A poor imitation of a genuine rebounder, it has no elasticity whatsoever and of course, no springs (I knew that part).

Perhaps I got a defective product but I ended up in the emergency room trying to set up this trampoline.  We followed instructions and were very careful but after putting the main pieces together and wrestling the two sides down flat - it sprang up and hit me in the face with a lot of force causing a laceration on my face and a lot of bruising.  The instructions do not indicate that this is a possibility.  No product this dangerous should require assembly. Be Careful.,1.0
"This product and others like it are IMPOSSIBLE. If you don't have 3 men in your house, two of which are the size of Hulk Hogan, don't bother flushing your $ away on a colapsable trampoline. The instructions for assembly actually say it takes 3 people to set up. I am an average sized woman who is used to ""manuel labor"" and I was no help what-so-ever to my big strong husband. He's going to take it to a mechanic friend who employs ""muscle"" men and see if ""we"" can make this happen. My suggestion is to throw it in the trash!",1.0
"This is impossible to put together.  I haven't been able to use it.  Thought I was trying out something which might help improve my fitness, but the cheap price and free shipping is useless.  Can't put it together.  Pay a bit more, or better yet, go to a sportshop and get one that is pre-assembled.  Try it out to make sure it will be sturdy and usable.  I couldn't do that because I live 50 miles from the nearest such store. Do it, if you want something like this.  Don't gamble on a mail order cheapie.",1.0

The lock worked perfectly fine for about a week and then it rained and the lock started to oxidize and rust. I would recommend getting another lock and not wasting your money on this one.,1.0
I purchased this item couple of weeks ago and was able to use it just once. Consider purchasing another item. The key has stuck in the lock and I cannot pull it out.,1.0
"I ordered it a while back and just stored it until we needed it, about 2 weeks ago we opened it, tested the keys and they don't work for the lock!  It would cost more in shipping to send it back, and it's been at least a couple of months anyway, so I am not going to bother sending it back, but I am pretty dang disappointed that this happened.",1.0
"Someone took boltcutters and clipped one side of the end chain link.
they left the chain and lock though, so i have a spare key lock! that makes the lock only a bit over 400 dollars hooray
Sorry, im sad",1.0

"The chain is of good quality but the lock is very cheap. It got rusted within 2-3 days. Its now difficult to open and close.
The key is extremely small for the size of the lock. Key can even break easily.",1.0
"Unless I was sent a different lock, I am very disappointed in this purchase. This lock does not seem as substantial as everyone is posting. It is not heavy at all... I purchased this for my girlfriend... I have no problems lifting it... neither does she. NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Will most likely be returning pending shipping and return costs.",1.0
"i bought it several weeks ago. i thought bike locks are supposed to be rust-resisitant. however, the lock became rusty and i just could not open it.",1.0
This lock worked well for a month. I had my bike locked to my RV while traveling. It got rained on and the lock no longer works. Not a good bike lock.,1.0
"Our 4 year old received this for a birthday present.  The helmet is ok, except that the adhesive pads inside came off the first wearing (and the adhesive got in her hair - what a mess!).  The knee and elbow pads are too stiff to stay on her knees and elbows.  And they are just a plastic bubble.  The first time she fell, the plastic shattered on one of them and made it worthless and dangerous for further use.

The big sell point was that it was pink and had the Princesses on it.  Why can't Disney make quality products?  They sure charge enough!",1.0
"Of course the real draw for this item is that it has the disney princesses on it. Let face it, you could put disney princesses on a piece of garbage and people will buy it. My daughter loved this when we gave it to her, but almost immediately the stickers popped off, the seams on the edge of the helmet were coming loose, and the strap that goes under the chin is cumbersome at best. I cannot say she has even worn the knee and elbow pads, as they are stiff and uncomfortable. Makes you wonder if anyone who makes this stuff actually tries it to see if it's any good. Do I feel ripped off? Yep. I do have to say that the best part of this whole set was the bicycle bell. It's cute and actually works. As for the rest, I am sure it will be resting at the bottom of my trash can soon. Don't buy it! Just say no!",1.0
I bought 2 of the Disney Princess helmets and they both broke within a couple of months. On one of the helmets the entire plastic covering fell off and on the other the glue holding the straps to the styrofoam didn't work. While these helmets are cute they are not worth the money.,1.0
"I have a Schwinn bike and assumed the Schwinn light would fit, but I was wrong.
I emailed customer service at Schwinn and they didn't apologize for it.
I ended up getting a Cateye light which was so much easier to install and didn't require any tools.
Do not bother with this Schwinn light. It is big, bulky, won't fit on a Schwinn bike and harder than it needs to be to install.",1.0
"I got this set because i needed something right away and it was the only one i could get locally.  The tailight isn't bad and is pretty visable, but the headlight is very dim. You won't be able to see much in front of you if you are traveling at night at any sort of decent speed.  I almost hit a possum once (i live in a rural area). This light will also drain batteries quickly (making it even more dim), unlike most LED lights.

I would strongly suggest getting a LED light for a few more dollars (there are .5 watt LED lights on here).

UPDATE:  I ended up getting 2 LED westinghouse flashlights for like 2 dollars from dollar general and using plastic ties to strap em on the bars (the kind of ties that look like police use for handcuffs..).  Worked great for months without a battery change and im willing to bet they are as bright as some of the expensive dual lamp systems out there.  The straps hold them steady, but i can adjust them up and down as needed (i keep one pointed lower on ground in front of me, and one ahead like a high beam).  I still use the tailight that came with this package, cause it is pretty good.  So for 5 bucks, i got awesome headlights.",1.0
"I bought the schwinn 12 function speedometer at Wal Mart. I set up the computer and installed it on the bike,I tried it out, it did not work. Thinking I mounted the sensor wrong I made some adjustments,it still wouldn't work. Long story made short, I pushed down on the schwinn emblem on the computer and it worked. The contact points on the holder and computer are not making a good connection. It works good if you want to keep pushing on it, stops working when you let off. I would not recommend this item.",1.0
"I only give it 1/5 b/c there isn't an option for 0 stars. After proper set-up and installation, the unit doesn't show any type of measurements. I'm not sure what's the problem, maybe it's the sensors that are bad. But even with the cheap price you would expect it to work at least ONCE! I guess it's a hit or miss when you dealing with low-end accessories like this one. Spend a couple extra bucks and get yourself something that will last you longer than 0 minutes.",1.0
Got two of these and they both never worked. Waste of money.,1.0
I lost it on the second day of using it. It just fale from my bycicle and I could not find it since I was not shure when it happened.,1.0
"This item was a compete waste of money, and time! It comes with long super skinny wires that you somehow have to run up the handle bar. In addition there is a tiny black plastic pice that goes on the spokes. It is easily lost, and renders this pricy unit worthless.",1.0
A total waste of money. Very cheaply made.,1.0
Too hard to make it work - stil have not figured it out so I gave up :-(,1.0
Did not work properly,1.0
does not work at all,1.0
"DOE. Did not work out of the package. Tried the provided battery first, nothing. Bought another battery thinking it was probably just old, still didn't work. Never powered up. Never displayed anything. It was returned (thank you for the great return policy Amazon!)",1.0
Worked for five minutes then broke DO NOT BUY. Do NOT BUY AT ALL.  I rode 2 miles and it broke in the first 1/2 mile.,1.0
Same comment as J. DeFosse.  The contact points between the computer and the mounting bracket are poorly designed.  The connection is not tight enough.  When the contact points lose contact during a ride the computer is useless.  It re-sets in the middle of a workout.,1.0
"Mine didn't work, but I bought it for a spin bike so I could keep up with MPH and miles traveled.",1.0
"Sensor does not work. Period. I have installed at least 6 other bike computers. All worked after adjustment;
This one WILL NOT SENSE WHEEL MOTION.

AVOID.",1.0
"Very poor quality build and software. I'm going to re-buy something I can use and pay a little more for quality (that's my suggestion to you)

The way the software works (I still haven't figured it out, and I work with software all day), I wouldn't be surprised if this is a generic Chinese product that gets branded with what ever brand wants to carry it as their sub, sub, sub bottom of the range... The issue with that is... All that did for me is make sure I don't rely on Schwinn for quality ever again.",1.0
"I was a little concerned about the quality of this item based on its price but since the majority of the reviews seemed positive I decided to give it a try and that was a big mistake. This is probably the most poorly conceived bike computer ever designed. Rather than being held in place with screw tightened brackets everything is mounted with zip ties which seems like a good idea except that you cannot get them tight enough to hold everything in place, the readout unit slips down due to the normal vibration and the pickup unit needs constant adjustment in order to work. This will be going back in the morning and I will buy a decent Cat Eye, or Sigma computer like I should have done in the first place. I would not use this thing if they were giving them away free.",1.0
"Love this bike computer - it does everything that I expect of it. Some functions are useless to me because I cant see them due to age related vision impairment. And I accept that. I can see the things that are important to me without my reading glasses: Speed, Distance, Time, Average Speed.

BUT - set up was a pain. When it did not work initially I referred to Amazon customer reviews for help - nothing here actually helped. I called the Help line included in the instructions - they also were unable to tell me what i eventually determined:

in addition to being not more than 1mm apart the faces of the sensor and magnet must be parallel to each other.

Ergo, this review.

Consider this to be an addendum to the instructions. PLACEMENT OF THE SENSOR AND MAGNET ARE CRITICAL. The sensor (the part that gets attached to the fork leg) has two flat faces on it and each face has 2 lines across it. The sensor must be located so that the face closest to the wheel(it can be installed on either fork leg) is parallel to the wheel. The magnet (gets attached to a spoke) must be located so that the face of it also is parallel to the wheel AND it must pass the sensor within 1 mm AND between the lines on the face of the sensor.

On my bike (27"" wheels) the sensor is about 5"" above the axle.

Initially I had the sensor about 4"" above the axle. In that position, to clear the magnet the face of the sensor was rotated away from the magnet ever so slightly so their faces (sensor and magnet) were not parallel even though the space between was less than 1 mm. That fulfilled the installation instructions, but not the need.

I give 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons:
- installation instructions don't tell or depict what you really need to know to install it so that it works
- it must be installed on the handlebars. My handlebars are crowded and part of the display is obscured by my headlight. If I could mount it on the crossbar I could see everything without moving my head.

Updated 7/22/11
I have logged about 60 miles on this computer since i got it to work properly. The speed indicator really helps me set and maintain a steady pace. I have improved my speed and endurance weekly.

HOWEVER, I ran over some bumps (this is a road bike) and it stopped working! The pavement in my town is in reasonably good condition. The bumps i hit were not severe. But apparently the shock was enough to damage the connection from the sensor wire to the computer base. I know this because when I wiggle the wire at the computer base while riding I get intermittent readings. If this cant take a couple bumps and keep working it is worthless. I change my rating to zero stars.",1.0
"I was so excited but when I opened the package....oh my....talk about difficult to calibrate! I had to call the company to get instructions.

I was surprised when they told me the calibrations for the item were incorrect in the instructions...duh???  My gosh, suddenly a simple little digital item needed an engineer to set the darned thing up! Who knew?

When I biked on my 2nd time with someone else, they told me my calibration was wrong so my mileage was incorrect! ;o(

The item is difficult to change settings when riding, so that made it ever less user friendly. (Who carries the directions with them on their bike? Who should have to?)

I had to stop and pull over and attempt to recalibrate again but still had problems with accuracy.

The 3rd time I used the item, I rode over a normal sidewalk bump and the computer bounced off the base into the bushes in the dark and disappeared ...looked for 10 minutes with flashlights and decided to write this off as ""I received what I paid for.""

A badly designed product.  Not recommended.  :o(

A bad purchase and decision on my part!

Good riddance!!

I have ordered another brand and have to untangle all those danged wires and start all over.

I made a mistake thinking the Schwinn name on the product meant they had checked the electronics out thoroughly in advance.

No way!",1.0
"Functionally, I like it - it's a nice little computer. But it resets itself every two or three months. That drives me crazy because I can't keep a mileage history. It happens when I detach it, put it in my pocket, then reattach it. Back to all zeros and I have to reprogram the date and tire size. I had a Cateye before this and that never happened.

Update 10-15-11: FAILED. Lasted a little over a year. Started going intermittent, then stopped working. Tinkered with it to learn the sensor is unreliable. It started working again if I turned it upside-down, but I don't trust it enough to put it back on the bike. Back to Cateye.

Bottom line: Spend the money and get a Cateye. (BTW, the Cateye I replaced is still working after several years).",1.0
"I used one of these computers for a couple of years and although it worked fine most of the time, the real problem was in summer heat, where the entire display screen would turn black so I couldn't read anything.  I first discovered this while on an 1,800 mile tour in Central America, where every day was near 100 degrees.  It was almost useless on that trip, except in the mornings before it got too hot out.  Later, I started experiencing the same problem others have reported of the contacts not making a connection.  At first that would only happen when it rained, but later it did it even when dry out.  I would avoid this one, unless maybe you just want to use it on a stationary bike indoors.",1.0
"Worked fine for 3 weeks. Stopped sensing the sensor. I could move the magnet past the sensor and hear its internal reed switch click open/close. But, the computer wasn't detecting it. Computer could be manually turned on. But, still, it didn't detect anything happening at the sensor.",1.0
"This product doesn't work right out of the box.  I've made adjustments and tinkered around, and I can't get this thing to work AT ALL.  Sometimes when I ride I see it jump to random m/hr readings and then drop back down to it's usual 0.0 m/hr.  I now just use it as a clock.",1.0
I read the brief direction for this product and put it together with great attention to detail...the product has never worked and I am very dissapointed after buying the brand I thought was trusted,1.0
She only used it 2 times by the 3 time it would not register any speed or any distance she had been.  Thank you,1.0
"Save your money- this version does not contain any teams from 2010.  I received one version with 2007 teams, and the next version (for the supposedly correct version) contained 2008 teams.  Now I have to ship both back.

I love this game and think if you or your kids are really into it, buy the full edition with all 30 2010 teams for around 50.00.  Of course, I haven't received that version yet, but am feeling hopeful it is correct!",1.0
"The product description says that the game comes with 6 teams from 2010, and I received teams from 2007. I was also originally under the impression from the title that it would contain all MLB teams from 2011. Do not purchase this, unless you were already planning on additionally purchasing a specific season.",1.0
"Buyer beware!!  Although this claims to be the ""2011 Revised Edition"", it is no such thing.  It is a 2007 edition, and does not even include all 30 teams from 2007.

If you're expecting the latest version of the game, as the description would certainly suggest, you're in for a disappointment.",1.0
"Well, I wanted a simple pedometer.  This is so simple that it doesn't work well at all.  No bells, no whistles, no reliablilty.  A couple friends also bought one, they are equally disappointed.  I got what I paid for.  It wa so inexpensive that it is not worth returning. It claims to self adjust for your steps.  It doesn't seem to.  I have tested it for 200 steps on 7 occassions and the steps ranged from 105 to 180.  So, if you are on a 10,000 step program, you'll end up walking at least 12,000 which I guess is good.  I also wear it biking as it counts ""pumps"" of the leg.  Sometimes.  Today O biked for 36 minutes and it came up with 174.  Yesterday 24 minutes and 5027 was recorded.  I have been vary careful to place it on my belt line at the place indicated to no avail.",1.0
"I was thrilled with this pedometer and wore it every day.  Found that it added steps while driving, not wearing it in the car corrected that.  After 3 weeks, it stopped working -- counted 2 steps one day, 5 the next.  Changed battery and now I just have 00000 regardless!  What a waste!",1.0
"I bought the model last night. The numbers have been all over the place. For example, it was just at 530 and then, after I walked a few steps, it went down 127. This model needs to be pulled real fast as whoever sells it will end up losing customers.",1.0
"If you are a masochist and enjoy finding your 2000 odd steps reset back to under a hundred several times a day then go-ahead and buy this - you will be transported to ecstasy on a regular basis.

For anyone concerned about things that might rile them enough to put their blood-pressure up may I suggest they avoid this product?  After a day of use I feel sure this product had to have been designed by someone who suffered a deep personal dislike of anyone trying to get fit.

Putting a highly sensitive and huge reset button on the front was NOT a good idea, not even a half-good idea.

Heaven forbid that you dare to bend over when wearing it, put a coat on, brush against a work surface, or even dare to drop your trousers when you need to to meet a call of nature. Any one of these actions, plus a multitude more will cause it to reset back to 0.

You can slightly overcome this reset problem by cutting the strong plastic packaging up, (which BTW must have been designed by someone else as it is tough and does it job) and taping a bit of the strong plastic over the reset button, ( Sadly this vital information does not come in the instructions.)

This is the first pedometer I have ever bought, and won't be the last as I'm going to look for one that has  tested in real-life and not just via a computer screen.

I am giving it one star. This as you might guess is not for the pedometer itself but for the little book about fitness that came with it that is really quite good.",1.0
"You have to run to count right. It's not so sensitive, you have to walk almost jumping to work. When you run, it's ok.",1.0
"Just a bad product.  Wish I'd read the reviews before I bought it.  Like others say, this will reset at the lightest touch of the exposed reset button.  Try to take it off your belt, and it will read 00000 by the time it's off.  Worthless.",1.0
I have had 3 330 units and now a 340 was given to me. The 330 Model was somewhat good but the Model 340 is a loser. Buy other's not Sportline.,1.0
"Design flaw. I kept resetting it by hitting the button by mistake. Don't waste your money.

I ended up getting a Timex instead which I really liked.",1.0
"I am so frustrated! I usually wear a pedometer all day, every day. I bought this one to replace a different brand in which the screen display stopped working after 2 months. This one was priced just about right, so I bought two for the inevitable loss or breakage that comes with daily use.
This pedometer might be all right for a specific walk, but for daily use, it's useless. It resets itself frequently, so unless you are paying attention, you have no idea what your actual step count is. I cannot recommend this to anyone.",1.0
"I purchased this pedometer because I didn't really want to spend much money, but I should have known better. With every step, there was clicking/ticking sounds which drove me nuts so I wouldn't wear it while walking around the office. It also didn't accurately count steps for me. I programed the stride length, per instructions and then tried to test the count. Sometimes 10 steps = 35 and other times only 4 or 5 steps. Plain and simple, it simply didn't work at all. I returned this and spent the extra cash on an Omron which worked beautifully! Was quiet, accurate, and simple to use.",1.0
The pedometer is too sensitive to touch. Every time I would put my hand in pocket the meter would reset. Tried several ways to wear it but always the same RESET. I bought two of these. Would not buy anymore of these for anyone.,1.0
"I hate when products are poorly designed, and the problems are so obvious! Because the reset button is on the outside of the unit, is is incredibly easy to bump against it and reset the numbers-- thereby deleting any knowledge of all your hard work! Its also difficult to see, as from the user's view, the numbers are upside-down. Pedometers that flip open are much better. Check out this much better option: Model SW-200 Yamax Digiwalker(tm) Pedometer. Very cheap, but mine has lasted me a long time.",1.0
"This pedometer not only counted my steps incorrectly, but it counted them when I was sleeping! Imagine my surprise when I woke up and found I had walked about 10 steps in my sleep. It also would reset itself all by itself, usually in the middle of a walk. There is no protective cover for that, there was no way to adjust for your stride. Cheap it as and well worth the cheap. I returned it. PS I also could not add any tags to this review. The program would not allow me to.",1.0
"My former Sportline 330 was an excellent and 100% accurate instrument. This one is a totally different design and is useless. I never found out how accurate it is, because in the new design the reset button is in front of the device so you can't help but to  accidentally reset it in the normal course of human motion. On the old one the reset button was inside its cover. This one has no cover. Useless. To add insult to injury, they don't tell you they changed the design, so it's a nasty little surprise when it arrives.",1.0
"My Sportline 330 gets reset at least two or three times a day, because it's so easy to accidently press the button.  The instructions say that you have to press it for two seconds to reset, but that's not the case -- a brief touch will do it.  It was a total waste of money.",1.0
"I have owned at least a dozen pedometers, and this is the worst. It counts, at best, one of five or six steps. I even fiddled with the stride length in hopes of tricking it to work. But it still undercounted by half or more at the end of the day. Furthermore, I wrote the company to register my complaint, and I never received a response. This pedometer needs to die a quick death. And the company needs to be more responsible.",1.0
"I ordered this and sent it back because it resets itself too easily.  I would not have purchased this (and ultimately returned it) if I would have known that it has no cover (the picture here on Amazon shows it with a cover).  Sportline appears to have changed the 330 so that it no longer has a cover.  Not sure what they were thinking on that move.  As it is, I was able to go to a Target store and see that they still have a Sportline model (I believe it's a 330) that looks like this picture - even though it's about $4 more -- but well worth it since it doesn't reset whenever you sit down.",1.0
"I did not want to give this device any stars, since it could not accurately count my steps. However, amazon will not let you post without at least one star. This is my first pedometer - maybe they're all inacurate?  I don't know. I just know this one can't count.",1.0
Pedometer resets when you put your coat on or accidentally hit it while walking because it doesn't have a cover.  The company should shelve this model.,1.0
"If the complaints about inaccuracy don't dissuade you, let me add another reason to reject this product.  Battery replacement is enough of a hassle that you may want to smash the device to smithereens.

A company is short-sighted to market a shoddy product.  People tend to reject everything a company makes once they've had a bad experience.  If I'm looking for a $100 heart rate watch, I'm sure not going to consider any products by Sportline.",1.0
"I bought this pedometer yesterday because I wanted to try to walk 10,000 steps a day.  It recorded false steps when I was driving, and then stopped recording real steps when I was half-way through a two-mile walk.  At one point yesterday, it reset itself back to zero.  What a disappointment!",1.0
"I purchased this pedometer from REI because I wanted to know only how one day's walking compares with the next. This model should have fit that expectation exactly.  I did not want numerous features telling me everything else, which would make the use of the pedometer more difficult.  I was disappointed from the start.

I tested the unit by walking around the block, counting the steps and comparing my count to the number on the readout.  To my amazement, it was less than one percent off.  I had heard that anything within 15 percent was acceptable.  My disappointment came in the ""routine"" wearing of the unit the next day.  First, it must be worn clipped on clothing or the belt at waist line, like most models.  But the readout is then upside-down for the wearer.  It is very difficult to glance down and check the number.  Like most digital readouts, the 2 and the 5 as well as the 6 and the 9 are easily confused if trying to read upside-down.  This means taking the unit off if I wanted to look at it, which brought about the second problem.  The reset button is fairly large and nearly impossible to avoid touching when removing or installing the unit onto my belt.  At the end of a long walk, I glance down to see that I have accumulated 4 digits of steps, but removing the unit to read the number erased the total.  I was disappointed enough in the product that I returned it to the store for a full refund, with no problem.  I'm glad that I shop at REI for no hassle returns and knowledgeable staff.  Very little thought about practical use went into the design of this product by the manufacturer.  There are better models for the same or similar cost.",1.0
"I purchased the Sportline Walking Advantage 330 pedometer from a local sporting goods store about 3 weeks ago.  This morning it died.  Even if it hadn't died I would not recommend it because most days it would reset itself to 0 steps at some point in the day.  It could be that I accidentally reset it, but if so, it was too easy to do by accident.",1.0
"I also wanted just a basic ""count the steps"" type pedometer, so I bought one of these recently. It has proved to be totally useless as it will reset itself to 0 steps at seemingly random intervals. This makes my ""total"" for the day meaningless. Apparently only very light pressure is required on the reset button to activate it...",1.0
"Does not work reliably. If you are looking for a pedometer, there are better ones out there, such as the Omron HJ-112, that do the job they are supposed to do.",1.0
"I've had 2 of these and while one was accurate for 3 days, the 2nd one I got in exchange for the first was doing the job for only 2 days.. even at a discounted price, it's not worth your time and money. Buy a more durable and reliable pedometer!",1.0
I wore the pedometer for two days during the same extended walk. The results were no where similar. Day three it stopped dead and hasn't worked since.,1.0
"I wanted something simple. No calorie counters, no timers, no built in radio...just count my steps. The design of this product does exactly that, but not accurately. In one session, I can walk around the house, count my steps, check the counter and its pretty close. I can then go for a mile walk and it registers 600 steps (meaning each stride was roughly 9 ft...sorry, not possible). Upon taking some very long walks over several days and placing the device in different spots, I have not ever come close to the count I should have gotten...so I am very disappointed in the product and will be returning it. For the one thing it was supposed to do, it just doesn't do it's job.",1.0

Power yoga isn't a simple physical exercise- and this is the way Brian sees it, or at least this is what his video presents. It's not all about building muscles in every single part of our body; if this is what yoga is then why don't we all work out at our local gym instead. Yoga is all about physical and above all spiritual equininity. In order to get in touch with our inner part and feelings yoga should be practiced in a relaxing place with an instructor who can make his students relax and LET GO, not tense throughout the practice! Brian Kert isn't a professional yogee, he is instead a common trainer for body building and working out with the only difference that he uses some yoga poses instead!!!!

My feeling on the design change BAD CHOICE on the new design. I feel it is now unsafe to use due to the fact it tips over real easy.,1.0
"I found that this rangefinder is very difficult to hold still on a flagg to find distance.  I am very sorry that I did not get one of the larger size finders that I have owned in the past from Bushnell.  My view is not to buy it for golf.

"I had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course. After a lot of research, I settled on the Pro Tour Laser.

As previous reviewers have stated, this unit is very hard to stabilize.  I have a feeling this is true of all lasers.

Even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car I found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present.

On the golf course, finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping.

This unit has been returned and I have gone to a standard handheld GPS instead. Once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint, this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage, you just have to convert feet or 1/100's of a mile into yards. I do this with a chart taped on the back of the GPS. Accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper.

I am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles.",1.0
"Exactly the same experience as calamity Jane here.

First off, the stove is of a particularly poor construction.

The whole case is thin and buckled from the box, and the wind guards are laughable - they have the feel and flex of painted cardboard. It really must be the absolute thinnest gage metal they could possibly use while still leaving the guards able to support themselves without creasing like aluminium foil.

As Calamity Jane mentioned the model is dangerous.

The pump on our model was a joke.

It wouldn't pump properly and produced no hiss.

We tried 3 times to light the burners and at no time did they produce the hiss I'm told they should have done.

After the third try of pressuring and turning the tank valve on and attempting to light, the whole stove went up in flames.

Turns out the fuel had been spluttering out of the end of the tank/pump and had been pooling in the hollows at the bottom of the case that double as feet.

After extinguishing the fire we put the whole thing away and cooked on the camp fire.

I inspected the tank/pump and it's pretty obvious the problem lay there.

Coupled with cheap burner and case construction leave this an incredibly dangerous stove that reeks of poor quality.

You see people with the older Coleman stoves with almost no paint on them due to their age all over camp grounds.

They're just not the same thing as these modern clones.

I certainly won't be buying one again and I'd warn anyone who wants one to maybe think twice and at least check it over carefully.",1.0
"I couldn't have stated it better than Mr. Moses' review.  I did the exact same thing...opened it up, and immediately noticed the metal construction to be very poor quality.  So much so, I am going to send a note to Coleman.  My stove that arrived was bent in several places on the cover just from handling and shipping.  I do not know what alternatives there are out there, but I am certainly not going to look at any of the NEW Coleman stoves.  I will perhaps look to get an older used Coleman, or just find a different brand.

UPDATE:  Jan 2006:  I've used lots of Coleman stoves.  I did not need to use this because once I opened it, I realized the quality was terrible.  Also, keep in mind that some of the other reviewers may be/are referring to older models of the same stove.  Coleman uses the same model number on some units for many years in a row.  The older units are much better constructed, more durable and vastly different in quality from today's versions.  I don't consider a stove's material construction to be of quality when you can make a dent in the stove cover with your thumb.  But that's just me I guess.  If I am going to be paying close to $100 for a camping stove, my expectation is durable quality.",1.0
"I've owned and operated Coleman products for over 50 years..since my old two burner stove ws beginning to show its age I ordered this new powerful stove.  What arrived was a tinny poorly constructed stove that  I never even tried to operate it. Although it may have worked fine its cheesy constuction turned me off completely.. the cover didn't really close tight since the hasp was off kilter, it didn't sit levelly but wobbled, the cheap dark green exterior finish would look well used after several uses of the stove...the burners were nothing like the quality of older Coleman stoves...all in all a bust.  Amazon came through with a no questions asked refund which was the best part of the deal. Take care of your old stoves, get spare parts before you need them and you'll be better off.  R.E.Moses",1.0
"Having grown up with Coleman everything, I am sad to say that their quality has taken a nose dive. I purchased this to replace my 1980's model 424 rather than rebuilding it...huge mistake. The sheet metal is flimsy, the fuel tank cannot be removed without bending the front panel (can't bend the metal on my 1980's model), and the regulator was bent straight out of the package. I didn't try to light it out of fear of fuel leaks and because I knew I would be sending it back as soon as I took it out of the box. This will be the last, non vintage Coleman product I ever purchase (and return).",1.0

I recently had to purchase a new one, ( I' ve returned it 3 times now) because of the stove malfunctioning.  The first time I was using unleaded fuel, which clogged up the generator after a couple of weeks, only to have a tech at coleman tell me you needed to clean it way more often because of a build up.  Not in the instruction manual.  The next two stoves, which I switched to Crown stove fuel which coleman says is okay to use, after a few weeks, would produce only yellow flames.  I follow the start up and fuel instructions to the letter.  Same results.  To ad insult to injury, trying to find the correct replacement parts online at the coleman website is extremely hard since they provide no pictures of the parts needed.  Very frustrating.  Would appreciate any insight from readers out there.  Don't think I'll try a 4th stove.  Same stove for me, same poor results.",1.0

Needle protrudes 3/32"" from end of generator - will fail when it gets bumped in storage. In early March, called Coleman, they finally suggested that I could buy valve and generator assembly ($42 on a $122 stove). I asked to have it replaced on warranty. They agreed, but wanted to send the smaller $88 dollar stove. I said that I'd wait for the similar stove. They said mid April. I just called on 4/24. They don't have any, will have one in early May and six more in September!? Unhappily bought a replacement because the troop needs it and will wait for a replacement, but won't hold my breath. Coleman can't or won't find a stove to replace one that they agree has failed under warranty. PATHETIC!",1.0
"See other 1 star reviews. I could only get a tall yellow flame. I tried all troubleshooting suggestions from Coleman without success. I have been using and maintaining a backpacking liquid fuel stove for years with no problems, so I don't believe this is due to operator error.

It seems like people like the stove when they get a good one. My only advice is to test it immediately.

By the time I had used it on a couple of trips, it was too late to return it.  Will send it to Coleman repair to see what they can do with it, but will be rebuilding the two old Colemans again.  Shame on you, Coleman; I expected better.",1.0
"This is our second Coleman grill-- our first one was great but it was a single burner. We bought this one a couple of months ago and used it for the first time on a camping trip last week. It was a truly awful experience. The fuel tank would not stay in place and there was a leak in the generator that we could not get to go away, causing a tall yellow flame to shoot out behind the burner. That is what I ended up using to cook for the week. Did I mention I was cooking all of our meals for 4 kids??? Terrible design-- if you do purchase it, try it out before you take it on a trip.",1.0

"I am afraid that Coleman is not what it used to be. I have used Coleman stoves for car-camping for 45 years. I sent the expedition back to Amazon because of inferior construction. I was disappointed to have to pay a restocking fee as the product was obviously poorly constructed. I bought a smaller one from Academy and the generator still turns out too much yellow flame.
While I am talking only about Coleman fuel stoves (no experience with propane) I am deeply disappointed with the new lack of quality in this very honorable (historically ) line. As I carry both canister and Coleman fuel I do not want to add propane.
It ain't your grandfather's stove anymore. I find that sad.",1.0
"Terrible. The third one I purchased and each had the same problem. After a few uses, there develops a leak in the generator just before the is ejected causing a yellow flame at the back end  causing soot on your pot or frying pan. Obviously a design defect that they never solved. Never again!",1.0
"Ordered and returned two of these stoves. What is called the generator (pipe from the fuel tank to the burners) was bent on the first stove we received. This made it so the generator could not properly fit under the main burner and the tank to securely fit in the slots on the front of the stove. The second unit only produced tall yellow flames, which has been identified as a problem by other reviewers. The packaging could really be improved too. The cardboard around the fuel tank makes it very difficult to remove the tank. My guess is that the first unit we received had been returned by someone who had bent the generator trying to remove. Also, the tape that secures the wires on both sides of the wind baffles is very difficult to remove without bending the wires. At least one other reviewer has mentioned that the purchase of this unit was to replace an older version. We attempted to replace a stove date stamped 8 80. It is extremely disappointing to see that the quality of the stove has deteriorated so much compared with the previous one that lasted 36 years.",1.0
"Can I leave zero stars?

The fuel tank doesn't fit properly into the slots on the front of the case.  If you wiggle and jam the generator tube into the opening in the burner assembly AND hold it in place without moving or jarring the stove at all, it stays in but otherwise it just pops back out again.

I thought I got a dud so returned the first and the second was no better.

I bought this stove as a replacement for the same model of Coleman stove which I had worn out over a number of years and camping trips. The replacement worked for a week and, then, burst into flame. My best guess as to what happened is that the shut off valve continued spraying gas into the stove even though it had been shut off. Flames filled the inside of the stove. I was able to pull off the gas tank and throw the stove out from under our canopy, thereby, preventing a larger fire. It burned itself out leaving me with the burnt shell of a stove and a gas tank.

Bought this for the upcoming deer season since my regular buddy wasn't going this year and he brings his older model Coleman stove.  Unpacked it and filled with fresh Coleman branded fuel and then the fun began . . .

Tried many things and messed with it for an hour trying to get this to work but ultimately ended up sending it back and borrowing my buddies.  I have other Coleman gear and was really disappointed in this stove.  Will have to keep an eye out at yard/ garage sales and find an older unit when the quality was still part of the Coleman process.  I really liked the idea of duel fuel and wanted this stove to work

"The main reason why I purchased this Coleman dual-fuel stove because it's made in the USA. My partner and I took it out for a 3 day camping trip and it was so unreliable that we cooked by campfire for the majority of the time.

Some of the problems:

In order to fill the tank, we had to use the funnel that comes with the stove.  The funnel is tiny and acted more like a straw than a funnel.  Anything more than a trickle would cause gas to bubble out and spill everywhere.

The stove was difficult to light and keep lit.  This could be due to lack of experience on our part with this particular stove, but we both have experience with other portable stoves and know how to operate lighters, so we assume this is an issue with the product and not just operator error.  Even after three days we couldn't reliably get the fire going and keep it burning.

And then when we weren't expecting it, the stove caught on fire!  Yes, not sure what happened there, one minute we're trying to get the fire going and nothing was happening, next there was an uncontrollable fire that no knob twisting or valve closing could shut off.  We thought about tossing the whole stove (while still on fire) into the fire pit, pouring water on it, or just backing up and let it either burn out or explode.  It ultimately burned itself out.

During operation it often smelled like gasoline, and that's not a smell I want to associate with my food.

Overall, a lousy stove.",1.0

"First time I used this stove it had a yellow flame on the primary burner even after burning for five or ten minutes. With both burners on it gave our a blue flame and worked properly but as soon as I turned the second burner off the yellow flame was back, now all my cookware is now black.  I had problems with the fuel tank mounting on the side, it would not fit properly.  With the lever in the up position for lighting I also had problems with gas pooling in the primary burner causing a lot of flame when it did light. Very Dangerious! Bottom line is I would not recommend this stove to anyone which is a shame since Colman used to be and was the best. I have finally settled on a proprane stove having given up on the dual fuel.",1.0

The stove arrived with several dents in the case and the latch is bent at a 45 degree angle.

"I just read another review on this product posted after my original reveiw and I feel they do a diservice to anybody thinking of buying it, so I have to re-review this product.

They claim that anybody having trouble with it is probably a 'newbie' or not using a funnel. (that review believe it or not being from a person who has admittedly never used a coleman stove before!!!)

I've been using these stoves very regularly for thrity years and I've seen them do everything imagineable. Sometimes from misuse, sometimes not. I've used them in snow, sand, rain, icestorms, mud, and even on nice sunny days. I am aslo a mechanical engineer, so this stove doesn't confuse me.

The newer models are definitely much lower in quality than the old ones. Yes they are lighter, but that's hardly a selling point!

Weight isn't a concern considering how these stoves are generally used. In all my years, I don't ever recall wishing my stove was lighter. This is a CAMP stove, not a backpacking stove!! If you're hiking in any more than 15-20 minutes, this is the wrong stove for you just based on size alone.

If anything, I think that the lighter weight increases their danger because the stove can slide more easily from an accidental bump, tip, or strong wind.

Aside from all that, my original message that I want to reiterate here is that these stoves ARE dangerous. Not so dangerous that you shouldn't buy it, but dangerous enough to treat with more care then you're probably expecting to.

Especially when people are here telling you that only foolish people have trouble with them!!!

If you do use it a lot, you will have trouble from time to time - clogs, leaking joints, worn valves, poor quality/bad fit, etc.

When they work, the stoves work well enough. I miss the old quality, but the bottom line is they still quickly boil a pot of water, and they offer a decent amount of cooking space.

One big concern when buying a stove like this is the ability to find parts and fuel for it when you're traveling. I think if you went with a lesser known brand, you'd regret it eventually.

As long as you anticipate a major flare up when you decide where to place the stove, and every time you light it, you'll be fine. It won't always happen, but you should always be prepared!",1.0

"This is the first product review I've written. I buy and use a lot of stuff but I'm typically too lazy to write any reviews. However I'm unusually fired up right now after tearing up my shins hauling this piece of scrap out to the trash.

The bottom line is this: the most important aspect in the design of any mechanical system is the provision for its repair. Any mechanical system - a system with moving parts - no matter how well made _will_ break down eventually. This is a simple and unavoidable fact. That said, repair or replacement is the inevitable consequence. The 1100HR/A failed for me in the same way I've seen others note: the foot platform bearing wheel assembly comes loose. But the real problem is that this cannot be repaired! The whole unit is now unusable because of this small component failure. What a poor design. Clearly this company has skimped on the design to get their price point low enough to attract value-conscious buyers.

Honestly, do not buy this. Spend the extra for a design that can be maintained.

"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR WIFE TO HIT YOUR UPS DELIVERY GUY WITH A BROOM.

I purchased the Eclipse because of the reviews on Amazon - mostly they indicated that the machine worked great, but would break after two years of daily use.  This I can live with.  Heck, if an exercise machine isn't a rack for partially-dirty clothing at this point and I've put in 800 hours of sweat and blood into it, it's still far cheaper than joining an exercise club.

So, I put it together.  Assembly was easy.  My eight year old and I slapped the thing together with a minimum amount of cussing.  He knows I don't like him cussing.

My son was particularly happy about the included water bottle.  For some reason he has a minor obsession with them.  Hydration is his mantra.

I put my exercise togs on and started ellipticising, or whatever you call it.  I set the timer for 40 minutes, and made it through 35 minutes of silent sweeaty cardio.  The silent part is nice, because my wife is a writer and comes out and hits me with a broom if I make too much noise.

5 minutes left, right?  Then the thing started making a horrendous clunking on the downstep on the right side.  My thoughts?  Maybe it's left handed.  In order to avoid making my wife angry and getting her broom out, I stopped.

The next day, I called customer service.  They indicated that the part to replace was a little bearing.  They'd ship it out in 7-10 days.  Hmm, I get to pay to repair the thing on the first go 'round, after one excercise session?

So, I waited.

Bearing shows up.  I don't know what they feed the people who tighten the bolts on these things in China, but they must have bulging arms and tendons of rippling steel.  I finally got the bearing off, and replaced it.

The thunking stayed, and my wife re-emerged with her broom.  I hit the Amazon website, furiously re-packed the Eclipse in the original shipping container, and *poof* a UPS man appeared immediately to whisk it away, muttering that he hated lifting three hundred pound boxes.

I'm very disappointed in this item.  It only works if you can hold it flat and completely still and since I wanted it to monitor my heart rate during exercise . . . It is also not very accurate.  Pulse is typically 10-15 beats off.  Might as well just hold your fingers on your wrist or neck and save the money.,1.0
of little or no use - much to difficult to use when you are excercising - i find this product totally unacceptable,1.0
I purchased the Omron HJ-105 last year.  It was a waste of $16 because it would usually reset somewhere around mid day so I never could track a full day. The counter was unreliable at best.  I finally just purchased a fitbit which works great.,1.0
This product doesn't work and it was a waste of money.,1.0
"The new Omron HJ-105 was not the same as the one pictured,  It had no memory and had to be reset every day  Not worth the effort..",1.0
I supported a friend considering Bariatric weight loss surgery some years ago and she gave this pedometer to me. I noticed from the beginning that it was inaccurate after just jiggling it in around in my hands for a few minutes for fun. Wearing it was even worse. No matter how you adjust the sensitivity it will either miss steps or record more steps than you take (i.e. 1 step will equal to 4). The settings weren't hard to work but do note that they only go up to 300lbs. The height setting also doesn't go very high which is kind of mind boggling to me as to why it would be limited so much. Out of curiosity I came here to see how much they were running for and I'm flabbergasted at the price. For what you get this isn't worth more than $10. I don't understand why something so obviously inaccurate has so many 5 star reviews. Don't waste your money on this and find a pedometer that doesn't feel like it came out of a cereal box.,1.0
Didn't like product.,1.0
"The pedometer pictured is NOT the one I received! The one I received not only looks different, it is lacking several features that it is supposed to have.",1.0
didn't work as expected,1.0

Very cheaply made I would not recomend this product to anyone...You can breathe and it jumps up 10 steps lol,1.0
"This pedometer broke the day I received it in the mail.  It worked for about 10 minutes and quit.
Healthcheck Systems Inc sold the item.  They said that they would replace it if I sent it back at my expense.
The postage to send it back was to high to make it worth it.",1.0
Doesn't count steps properly. Buttons stick and sometimes falls off while running I have had better luck with new balance counters so far.,1.0
I really don't think this product is accurate at all and it's really difficult to use for such a simple mechanism.  I wish I would have spent a little more and bought something of a little more quality.,1.0
"this is my second one & did not like it it is not what I wanted the Battery case is impossible to get in to
Want to send it back for a full refund or credit for  Amazon so I can buy a new one different one",1.0
I was so disappointed with this.  I bought it for a friend.  It was difficult to program.  It looks cheap and didn't work well.  I'd bet she thought I got it at a dollar store!,1.0
"It worked for a day, then counted about 4 steps for every hundred steps taken.  I sent the POS back.",1.0
Too small and too difficult to program. The instructions must have been written by someone who doesn't walk around. Not good,1.0
I clip this on my pocket and or waistband and find myself picking it up all day ;long. The clasp is not good. also it does not keep count properly and I am sooooooooooooooooo sorry I bought it. spend a little more money and buy a good one. this is a waste of your money,1.0
"broke right away.  I thought I could save money but I lost it on this product, Id rather invest in more expensive",1.0
"As instructed, I pulled the plastic tab from the battery and nothing happened. Can't get it to set. Perhaps it's a bad battery. At under $12, I expected it to look and feel pretty cheap (it does), buexhaled it would at least turn on.",1.0
"I do not recommend this pedometer.  It is EXTREMELY difficult to set and read and is not very accurate.  I was attracted to it because it in in a closed case (which a previous model was not and it proved to be a problem), however, I still wasn't able to obtain the information that I wanted from a pedometer.",1.0
This pedometer is extremely inaccurate.  It says you've walked about 1/2 mile less than you actually have.  I would not recommend it.  What good is it if it cannot keep accurate counts!,1.0
"It didn't last long before it stopped working.  We purchased 2 & both broke in a very short time.  Extrememly dissapointed that this company made a pedometer that couldn't stand up to normal wear.  I wanted it to track my daily walking, & gym activity.  Nothing unusual.",1.0
"Pedometer has tons of great features that would all be really neat and useful IF it could accurately count steps.  I clipped it on to my belt, walked 30 steps, then checked the reading - 4 steps counted.  Useless!",1.0
"I thought this had a heart monitor. SMALL Display. The Calorie Burnt Counter is Kcal vs regular calories. I ran on the treadmill and compared my Calories burned and Distance and it was VERY OFF!  Overall the pedometer said I only burned 83 kcal I ran for 30 mins and walked for 15 mins = 45 mins total in  which the treadmill stated I burned 400 Calories. You must also calculate the kcal according to your age, but my results did not come close to the treadmill measurements.  Dissapointed. I bought this because of the reviews on how accurate it is. But it's not. Have you compared it to something else? a bike or a treadmill?",1.0
"Received the item quickly. I work retail and am on my feet all day, but 12,000 to 17,000 steps? Reset to zero and walked up and down the break room counting. At 20 of my steps I checked the product and it was at 38! Guess i will try a more expensive one.",1.0
"Accurate when it works but that's been very intermittently.  Continually resets in the middle of the day so can't keep track of anything, then started freezing on me.  Only thing I could do was readjust the battery but the battery compartment is IMPOSSIBLE to open.  Tried with numerous different size screwdrivers and ended up stripping the screw & finally breaking it open just to reset the thing.  Now held together by tape which is ridiculous. A complete waste of money.",1.0
"I ordered two OMROM 105s and received two BP pedometers. I had used the OMRON 105 for the past two years and was very satisfied with it until I lost it. The BP does not have the aerobic function and does not have the 7 day memory feature. It is quite variable in recording steps as well. Therefore, I am most dissatisfied. I don't understand why the product was substituted without notifying me. I have reordered the OMRON 105s and I am hoping that I will receive the correct item this time.

Bought this for my wife. I figured the good reviews outweighed the bad ones. I was wrong. It completely fell apart after a couple of weeks of her using it. Don't waste your money like I did.,1.0
This pedometer is very difficult to calibrate.  Just when you think you've got it right it doesn't record any steps.  I walked for 3 miles and it only recorded a few hundred steps.  Other times it would record way too many steps.  Having used other Omron pedometers in the past this one was extremely disappointing.  I'm going back to get the HJ-112 eventhough it is bulky.  I guess you get what you pay for.,1.0
The sensitivity settings are inconsistent. The clip is useless-- I lost the pedometer before I even had it on for a full day. I do not recommend this one.,1.0
"I am 14 weeks into a walking program and dropped my simple pedometer.  I buy this one and have not been able to track my steps for over a week.  I am usually not technically challenged, but I cannot get this to count my steps.
I am going to Dick's or CVS this weekend to buy a simple step counter so I can get back on track with my program.",1.0
"The pedometer is sensitive.  I thought I could wear it all day and get a fairly accurate number.  That's not so.  Every time you move a certain way, like getting out of your chair, it would count 2 to 5 extra steps.  Also, you have to spend some time getting your stride set up so it will accuratly count the steps.  If you are planning on going walking, then it might be fairly accurate.  But if you bump the pedometer it will add steps. I don't think it's very good.",1.0
"Unfortunately, this item doesn't actually count the steps correctly for me.  There's a little switch to help calibrate the pedometer, but no matter how I set the calibration if I walk 50 steps it shows that I walked 4 or 5.  It counts based on shaking, so maybe I'm just so smooth the pedometer can't tell I'm walking, but I doubt it.  Honestly, I had pretty low expectations, so I'm not shocked.",1.0
"This is the most grossly inaccurate pedometer ever to the point that it looks as if it were deliberate! I used the Omron HJ-112 pedometer, a very accurate one, for comparison and the HJ-105 was registering twice and sometimes three times as many steps. Based on the rest of the reviews I must have gotten the lemon.",1.0
"This pedometer which can be found at Walmart in the pharmacy section of the store for about $10 is a real dud in my opinion.  I will grant you that it does have several nice features:  for example, it counts ""aerobic steps""  in addition to regular steps.  Regular steps are counted any time you move with enough intensity for it to register on the machine.  If you had the machine on your person, you could get up and go to the refrigerator and it would count each step you take.  ""Aerobic steps"", on the other hand,are counted when you use the pedometer continuously over a set length of time-- like when you want to go for a walk. This way you can have the unit on your person all day and the time you spend in a continuous aerobic activity will be tallied by the ""aerobic steps"" feature.  What this gives you is a tally of your actual ""aerobic"" activity. Nice feature but the problem with the unit is getting it to register accurately each time you take a step.  My experience with this pedometer is that it is either way too sensitive to your movements or barely registers anything at all.  In the instructions it says to walk 100 steps counting the total in your head and then comparing it with what the machine picks up.  With this information you adjust the unit's intensity manually.  The place you do this (in the lower left-hand corner) is so tiny that it's physically hard to adjust. Out of maybe 10 tries I could only get one occasion when it counted my movements accurately.  Every other time was way off.  Bottom line, I don't recommend this unit and I think I'm going to stay aways from Omron pedometers entirely.  They have some more espensive models but they have lost my confidence.  When you do buy any pedometer, save the receipt so you can return it if you have the same problem.",1.0
"Not very accurate,spend your money on the Orman HJ112,very accurate and gives more info.",1.0
"When I got this pedometer, I found that the instructions weren't clear.  I never did get the thing to work.  I have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate.  This one wasn't.  The pedometer doesn't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost.  It's just easier to buy a new one.  However, I suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store.",1.0
"The person who received this pedometer as a gift tried and tried to get it too work, found it much too complicated and gave it back to me.",1.0
"The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these ""packaging engineers"" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them!

But I was thrilled.  A handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open.  So much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband.  I yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed.  But, alas, it would not follow instructions as they were written.  ""Press and hold the Set button.  Hour display blinking.""  (Could they not have said, ""The hour display will blink""?  I pressed.  ""Press Memory button to adjust the hour.""  I did.  The Memory button never did a thing.  So I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either.  We both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.

I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what?  J & R Music & Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves.  Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&R again.",1.0

She ended up using her ""old"" Fox40 because she could not blast a loud enough warning from this junk. Buyer beware.

By the time I realized she wasn't using this pink one, and she told me it was defective, it was too late to return it.  She let me hear the difference between the two whistles, and trust me, there IS a difference.",1.0

I received this whistle and was concerned that it took significant power to create a sound, so I contacted Fox40 and they confirmed that this whistle was not manufactured by them.

"Purchased four of these for my son who has been a lifeguard and using Fox 40 classic whistles for four years. Two were retail blister packaged and were authentic. The other two (one red and one black) came in plastic zip bags. Both of these would appear to be fakes and did not function. While they look authentic, a close examination reveals differences in the labeling on the back and the mouth opening is larger on the fakes and they don't work properly. Academy has them for just a little more and I'll purchase them there from now on. Lifeguards go through whistles very quickly and we have to buy a bunch every season.",1.0
"This product is not a genuine Fox 40 product. I read some reviews that said it was not and thought, well, it sure looks like it. I am here to tell you that I ordered it and it is not genuine. It does not have the same distinct sound of a Fox 40 and, trust me, I know my whistles. Refereeing basketball, football, and working  traffic have taught me well about what kind of whistle to use. Fox 40 is one of my most favorite whistles of all time, next to the Acme Thunderer. It's a shame that fake product is sold like this; its a waste of money.

It says it is ""pealess"", which I think means it has no ball in it and so doesn't have the familiar trilling sound of a referee's whistle. That is fine--I just wanted a loud whistle for emergency use. As the other reviewer said, this is high pitched but not loud, and you have to blow really hard to even get a decent sound out of it.

Oddly enough, during summer time and heat, it somehow freaked out and now the arrow points to the opposite East/West direction from the heading: for example, if I head NW, the heading it accurate but the arrow points to the NE.

Need to find something else!!",1.0

We abused the life out of that one throwing it as high as we could, walked all over it, you name it. Obviously they've changed how these are made over the years. Maybe I got a defective unit but I really don't want to chance getting a replacement and having the same thing happen so I'm just going to ask for a return.

"When we received this ring we quickly went outside to throw around.  We discovered there was no way to play with this in a neighborhood.  It goes a long way with very little effort, but it has a hard shell within the rubber which could easily scratch a car, injure someone or even break a window.  We then took the ring to the school near us and had a great time with it as the claims of distance they give are definitely possible.  Six and nine year old boys  could throw this a long ways.  In the next two weeks we took it to parks and other schools.  Everyone who threw it was impressed and could not believe the distance it traveled and how easy it was to catch.  Then the BUMMER!  The inner black rigid part covered with rubber broke just from normal use.  Sure, we can still use it but the only thing holding it together is a little bit of the rubber surround.  This ring was a 5+ when we first got it but having broke in the first two weeks, I can only give it a 1 star.  With the design as it is, not sure how this company will have very many repeat orders.  We were very disappointed.  Returning for refund.",1.0

The first time I threw this for my dog (large dog, German shepherd) she was running full speed, caught it, and the second she tried to run back to me with it her feet got caught in it and she tripped and tumbled forward into a roll with it wrapped around her legs.  If this were half the size it would be perfect, but it is a seriously dangerous toy at this size. I am just letting her chew it up in the backyard to get some use out if it. Terrible design for pups so look elsewhere if you want a pet frisbee.",1.0
I love the Aerobie and have ordered a few before but my old one was bent and when they get bent the don't fly right. So I decided to oreder a new one which I do ever couple of months because we go to the park and play with them alot and they get beat up. Well they sent this one to me in a box which was to small for the ring. They just shoved it in there and the ring came in bent after waiting almost 2 weeks. So now I have two bent rings thanks.,1.0

"Good knife but reason for 1 star is false advertising and sheath, it is not the same knife as the picture. It is slightly different and made in china instead of taiwan. Some of the differences are the serated  edges and handle in the first few pictures.

The photos show the sheath not fitting and how the knife differs from the picture.",1.0
the button of the sheath has a garbage qualityIT is really difficult to open and was broken after 3 times open,1.0

"I gave this a 1 star rating as the knife together with the sheath as a complete product will not work.  The knife is as expected and of good quality.  It is light with a good balance and I was able to sharpen it to my liking.
The sheath itself has a good design but the snaps are of poor quality.  After one use of the first knife I received the snap broke.  I contacted SOG via their website and had NO RESPONSE from them.  I returned the knife to Amazon for an exchange and received a replacement with equally shoddy snaps.  The snaps on the product box picture are metal where as the ones on the 2 knives I received were plastic.  The snap that goes around the hilt of the knife is next to impossible to close with 2 hands and is impossible to close with one hand.  It is also much more difficult than it should be to open.  The snap on the back for the Molle webbing is the same plastic and hard to use but it is less of a concern as you typically only would use this snap once to attach to your gear.  This sheath will not function on a belt or strap where you will only have one hand available to close it so for me the knife/sheath combo is a failure.",1.0
"Knife is very nice, but the sheath is terrible.  One of the two buttons was shipped broken, and the other is impossible to open.  Would be impossible to take out a knife in an emergency, or if one was in a hurry.",1.0

And it's not like I was trying to pick up and 60k pound truck with it. I would assume it is a knick off made in China or some other country that makes knock off items.

this is a fake or a very very very poor reproduction. before you buy this knife  pull up the picture posted here on amazon and then go to sog's web site they do not have the same stamp or handle,1.0
"Purchased 2 pairs for my 8 & 9 year old daughters for Christmas. The shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic. The box includes bunches of black, elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the ""bounce"". The more your child  weighs, the more bands you use, but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks. They are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them. Once assembled, the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored. They haven't played with them since. Don't waste your money!",1.0
"these seemed like such a good idea and my daughter and her best friend were actually willing to spend their own hard-earned money on them. So we bought them and I spent an hour or so assembling the two pairs. Within an hour we knew they had to go back. First and foremost, the girls were totally disappointed in what they did. Blame the box, it's deceptive, but I was willing to chalk that up to real world education and would have let my daughter deal with the  lesson. More disturbing was that we had to replace a half dozen or more of the black rubber bands within that time, they snapped. Now I know why they give you so many, it's not just for the heaviest kids (who proabably are too old for the toy to begin with.) It's so every time the kids use them an adult can spend time putting new bands on...until you run out. Needless to say, they went back the same day.",1.0
My son got these for his birthday. These are so dangerous!!! He almost broke his ankle in the first 5 minutes he had them on!! He is a VERY agile and coordinated kid too. His whole ankle twisted it looked like it turned inside out!! These are heading for the trash!!!,1.0
"My 10-year-old daughter used these moon shoes for two days and her back has been hurting ever since, which at this point is almost a week later.",1.0
"My 7 year old daughter received these for Christmas from a cousin. We immediately returned them. My daughter had no interest, thank goodness, because it would only be a matter of time before she broker her ankle on them.  You're better off just buying a real trampoline.",1.0
"My son is 9 years old and very angile. he was very excited about these moon shoes. After we prepared the shoes and adjusted the straps to fit his feet, he jumped twice and landed awkward on one foot. The hard plastic bottom tilted over and now he has a hurt ankle. If you have a problem with agility and balance this is not the product to teach it to you. Play with theses at the risk of breaking your ankle!!",1.0
"As a huge Prince fan, when I first saw these I thought they were PURPLE RAIN shoes, so I purchased four pairs without hesitation.  Imagine my dismay when I realized they were some ode to Michael Jackson instead, and were in fact Purple MOON shoes.  Very confusing indeed and back they went.",1.0
I did not get the horse shoes and stakes. The box was open and wasn't anything in it,1.0
Broke wishing a couple hours,1.0
"The manufacturer of this product was unresponsive to the poor quality of this product. I can hardly believe that they would send out such inferior merchandise, and think nothing of it. Made in the USA on this product has done nothing but made us look like we don't know how to make quality merchandise, at least in this case!!",1.0
"This was for my 6 yr old grandson. It was way too small for him. I cant imagine a 3 yr old skate boarding, so I'm not sure who this product would be good for.",1.0
Worst skateboard ever. As soon as you stand on it the wheels won't roll. Terrible wheels and bearings. It's not even usable for a two year old.,1.0
DO NOT believe the reviews for this skateboard.  It crap and made in China.  It's comparable to the crappy skateboards at Target or Toys R us.  We ordered it for our son for Christmas (this was the only thing he really wanted) and the front wheel doesn't work. It looked like it might be missing a washer but when you add a washer the wheel gets to tight and doesn't spin.  If you don't put on an extra washer the screw falls or gets to tight (and the wheel doesn't spin).  I'm not sure who these other reviewers were but this skateboard is garbage.,1.0
"Just got this for our son for Christmas. He used it an hour in our basement and it looks like it's been used for a year.  Terrible particle board, fraying on sides.  We are returning it.",1.0
"I, too, received the wrong skateboard....3x. Seems to be a very popular skateboard since I can't find it elsewhere either.",1.0
very unnhappy with this purhase... after letting my 4 year old pick his very own skateboard when he opened the package another spiderman skateboard was in the box... the other one is listed on amazon for only $21.... this one was $38.... pretty upset right now... will be contacting amazon in the morning,1.0
"I gave this item 1 star because it's not even the skateboard I received . It is however, the one I ordered !  The board that I was sent  only had the name of Spider Man on it. I had bought it for my 5 year old grandson's  CHRISTmas gift . It was a rather boring looking skateboard , & not the one that I had been shown on the website.",1.0
"Very poor quality. Barely used and already the top of the board is peeling. Wheels are terrible, make for a bumpy riding experince. Save your money and get something else.",1.0
THE SKATE BOARD IS NOT HARD.  IT BENDS WHEN YOU STEP ON IT.  I AM NOT SURE IF THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BUT THAT SCARS ME.  I WOULDN'T BUY IT OR RECOMMEND IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.  THE APPEARANCE IS VERY NICE.,1.0
The Characters Spongebob and Patrick's pictures was on the bottom of the Skateboard. I don't think the little girl I bought it for will like that.,1.0
"This is a horrible piece of junk when it comes to skateboards. Please do not buy this.

The wheels on this boards do not even spin, seriously, when you turn the board over and spin the wheel with your hand or foot, it will only spin for half of a second before coming to a halt. The reason for this is the cheap bearings that are installed on the wheel. When you do this spin test on a real skateboard, the wheel should spin for a good minute at least. If you give this board one push when on it, you won't go further than a couple of feet. I bought some good bearings to put on this and they actually spin now.

The wheels on this board are made of PVC. All real skateboarding are made of Polyurethane or urethane. For that reason, it also slows down quickly.

The only reason i could see someone buying this board is because of the Spongebob graphics on the deck, but even after 3 days, that's peeling off. It's just a cheap sticker plastered onto the deck.

The description says that the deck is made of Maple wood, which most skateboards are, but this board just looks made of cheap wood. Cracks have formed already after only 3 days and the plys in the wood look separated.

The only thing that seems to be made to quality on this board are the trucks, they're made of real metal and not plastic like some of those Walmart boards, however.",1.0
This item is smaller than I thought it would be so my son could use it if he was like 1 or 2 years old.,1.0
"My 5 year old granddaughter couldn't stay on this board - it's too long and angular.  Even her 25 year old uncle who is a semi-pro skateboarder from California found it an awkward shape.  Giving it one star for the decorative appeal to young girls.  Otherwise, it's a hazard.",1.0
Skateboard was in poor condition. Bottom sticker covering the entire board was coming up from the edges. My son was very unhappy. I should have paid the extra money and gotten it at Walmart. Worst part is I was asked by Amazon how I liked my purchase and I explained how we received the board and I never heard anything back. Oh well - live and learn.,1.0
"My six year old daughter was thrilled with her new skate board having a fun Barbie design, but was very disappointed when everything started to peel off when it got wet. We now have to buy her a new board or sand it and repaint it to pacify her. If you decide to buy, don't let it get wet at all!",1.0
"I had to send the shoedryer back two days after Christmas when the middle

of the units both started to melt.. I have to say I have always heard awesome things regarding this product so I was caught off guard.

"I tried this product for drying my surfing booties and it did not work at all. In fact, the passive heating (no fan) and warm air seemed to provide the perfect environment for bacterial growth and the booties smelled like something the dog would like to roll in. The low rating is for use as a neoprene booty dryer. I have no experience with it otherwise.",1.0
"Peet Family Model Dryer M97. I ordered this item on the Internet and it arrived quicker than expected. It is quiet and appears to work well. I bought it because I had planned to buy an expensive pair of work shoes and instead of buying two pair to alternate each day I bought one so the dryer would have them ready for another day.

The buying experience was the worst. The shopping cart experience was unusual. I was charged sales tax even though I ordered the product from another state. I was given the final price and then afterwards was charged sales tax (per the receipt) because it was shipped from a company in my same state. This was not mentioned up front and I have lost all interest in the company and its products.

The company did not respond to my emails regarding this extra charge.

If you need a shoe dryer I recommend buying it locally to save $8.00 shipping and just pay the legitimate sales tax.",1.0
It leaked. Didn't do well at all. Didn't hold water well.,1.0
My third one always breaks in the corner every time,1.0
Flimsy. Nozzle crushed on delivery. Won't stand independently except when full. Packed it away.,1.0
The water spout on this model provides very slow flow and leaves it of little value except to supply small amounts of water.  A previous version of this product would allow rapid pour to perform great functions like rinsing off kayaks after leaving salt water.  I tried to send it back but the woudl not accept it.,1.0
"Not good for camping, very weak and leaks. I had to throw jug in the garbage after a couple of hours as it was leaking all over the bed of the truck during travel.",1.0

couldn't figure out how to unfold it.,1.0
Got a hole in it somehow? From bending? I have no idea. Not very durable and leaked inside my tent.,1.0
Popped withing 2 weeks of using it.,1.0
"These are soft collapsible plastic, that sqush and fall.over when half the water is emptyed. They ate very cheaply made. Mine stated to leak and water ran all over my floor. I would not recommend these.",1.0
This isn't a great product by any means. When I filled it up with water and kept falling over. When I try to use the tap it was very slow and I kept having to release the air pressure just be able to get anywhere. By the end of my weekend we just unscrewed the tap every time we wanted to water. I would not recommend this product.,1.0
Leaks after minimal use. Water flow is abysmal. Not happy at all with this Coleman product.,1.0
There is no vent on this so it takes forever to dispense the water.,1.0
Very Flimsy,1.0
"waste of time and energy!  We normally camp at full hook up camp sites, our first voyage into the boondocking so I tried this to keep weight down in our small (14') camper.  Screw cap leaked, took almost 5 minute to DRIBBLE out a quart of water, then tumbled off table and spilled the quart I had just pulled from the spout!

I would only recommend this if you buy it for the Coleman reputation (which I did).  Not even worth returning the product!",1.0
"Ugh, bring me a bucket.
I had one with my Coleman hot-water heater, and it leaked. I bought this one for $10, and it also leaks. I think they are designed to leak.
The plastic is fairly thin. Why not make it a bit thicker, and it will last longer? Remember, a lot of Coleman stuff has a fairly short lifecycle, so expect it will leak.

I have another 5-gal container made by Reliance. It's now about 15 to 20 years old. It has thicker plastic. It never leaks. Unfortunately, the screw threads are different so i can't use the Reliance with my Coleman hot water, so i'm forced to use this piece of junk.",1.0
So flimsy! It is so thin that it folds down and comes packaged in a small box. The spout leaks. Don't buy.,1.0
it leaks,1.0
"I bought this product,thinking that because it was coleman it would be quality.
Wrong,it had a hole right out of the box,just like the other brands.",1.0
"You cannot use this for drinking water, the water tastes like molten plastic immediately, just terrible. It is good however for utility water for washing dishes etc, just not drinking water, regardless what the marketing says.. Easy to drain due to removable large spigot tho you have to reinstall carefully it has a tendency to leak..",1.0
Bought this product for our travel trailer. Filled it with 2& 1/2 gallons of bottled water and it leaked all over the kitchen counter. I will not buy a product like this again. Very unhappy and disappointed with this Coleman product.,1.0
Very thin used once. Invested in something better for your money that will last.,1.0
"Be carefully! This carrier is VERY unstable, has no air valve to let air in if water goes out, this carrier is not what it should be. It will collapse if you take out water. NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM A OUTDOOR COMPANY!",1.0
"I found it extremely awkward to handle, switched to a hard side container.",1.0
dont buy,1.0
Lid popped off.  We are returning it.,1.0
I am starting to taste plastic. And the spout is to small. Takes to much time to fill a 19oz bottle.,1.0
It leaked over all the place.,1.0
3 of these containers were taken by a boy scout crew to Philmont.  All 3 ended up with cracks in them at the spots where they collapsed/folded down.  An older container from a different manufacturer held up.  Won't buy these again.,1.0
Not good. No vent so the water just trickled out. By the 3rd day the cheap plastic valve didn't even work. We had to completely unscrew the valve every time we wanted to use this.,1.0
Leaked the first time I used it.,1.0
Piece of poop,1.0
It is flimsy!!! Certainly not made made of good quality plastic. The spout leaks so it has to be turned up on its side...therefore the turn spout is useless. I will not buy again nor would I recommend to anyone.,1.0
"Unfortunately the product I received leaks despite not even having the jug filled to the top. It's only about half way filled and if I leave the spout down it will leak. I tightened the cap some more in hopes that it would stop but on the third ""adjustment"" it wound up being over tightened and leaked even more. Not exactly the confidence you want to have when you take this in the backcountry for several days and this is your only water supply.",1.0
"Not too sturdy.  Have had item for a few months, and now spigot cannot be tightened sufficiently, so now begins to leak. Jug has to be turned with spigot pointing upwards to prevent leaking; however, leaks when turned to open spigot to get water.",1.0
Snagged on sharp edge of our trailer rail and sprung a leak on first use.,1.0
"This is totally not what we expected. It's very flimsy, almost like it's solely used for camping or transport only. Once the water gets low I felt like I had to push down on it otherwise you'll be waiting 10 mins for a full glass of water. A few times it just out right fell off the counter. We don't have the funds for an in home filter so we needed a refillable jug to fill up with RO water at the super market.",1.0
Not what I expected. Cheap. Water doesn't come out well enough to make it practical. Doesn't stand up. Better off making your own from parts at your local hardware store.,1.0
threw it away won't work for larger spigots the mouth is small. and also very flimsy and smelled like was really off gassing.,1.0
it wasn't as sturdy as I thought,1.0
"I was very disappointed in these jugs as we used them to transport water to our cabin. They were bulky and hard to handle, they leaked and the spout for some of them didn't work and was hard to move. I am giving up on these and broke down and bought the heavy-duty plastic jugs.",1.0
"Very thin material, flimsy, awkward to carry once it's full, leaked. Returned after one use.  I do not recommend this at all.  Go with the Aqua Tainer brand instead.",1.0
Thought this would have been great! Little to no water come out of it! Ended up returning it for a refund!,1.0
"It always fall off from the table, it's not steady even if it is full of water,",1.0
This was such a waste of money. Was very disappointed usually very happy with Coleman products,1.0
The water carrier is so weak.,1.0
Water dispenses so slowly as to make this useless.,1.0
Flimsy. Holes in it already,1.0
awful junk,1.0
Sent it back.  We have two humidifiers that require distilled water.  I didn't realize this carrier wasn't ridged.  It's flexible and collapses which didn't fit my needs.  I turned around and bought the 5 gallon jug.,1.0
Not worth it you get what you pay for,1.0
"no after one week this thing was crack open, this is not a very good item.",1.0
"Not a dependable water carrier. The cap/spout cracked, creating a leak. It seems durable in other areas...but a leaky spout is a deal breaker as far as water containers go.",1.0
The opening arrived bent and it leaked horribly. It leaked half of the contents out into the trunk before we noticed! Our friends have some of these with red caps and have no problem. Maybe a fluke.,1.0
"I had a water carrier that I used for years and it worked great.  I don't remember the brand.  I lent it to a friend and it never came back.  This carrier was a disappointment.

Pro's:
It held 5 gallons of water

Cons:
Poor water flow even with valve fully open.
The plastic was thin and was easily punctured during first use.

We threw it out after the first use.  Will try again with another brand.",1.0

it leaked on the first trip...",1.0
"Do not waste your money.  Took on a 3 day primative camp trip.  Cap will not tighten onto bottle without stripping out so it could not be used in a position to use the valve.  Purchase a Reliance brand bottle instead, they have served me well.",1.0
"This is a piece of junk.  On first use i noticed it is nearly impossible to prevent a leak from the threads.  After a couple of uses sitting on picnic tables or the ground, multiple punctures have developed, that I have had to patch.  The plastic is cheap and easily punctures.  Its depressing to get to the middle of nowhere and find an empty container with water all over the floor of your trunk.  Coleman products are cheap, you get what you pay for.  I am done with buying Coleman.",1.0
"This water jug is horrible. Stick with the old blue Coleman ones or the clear ones with the red handle. I camp often (6-7 times a year) and I've not had one good camping experience with this jug. It doesn't fold up well, making it cumbersome when packing. The spout is useless. The water comes out slowly, making it frustrating and useless. I'm probably just going to throw it in the recycle bin purchase one of the brands I've bought in the past.",1.0
"I have two of these, I no longer use them though. The first one , the valve screw broke and the second one had a leak in the seam.

I ended up buying a 7 gallon hard plastic jug",1.0
We purchased the Razor A Kick Scooter for our son's birthday. The handlebar was adjustable but not enough for my 5'3'' son to ride it comfortably. He has very long arms and still had to hunch over. We have other scooters that have longer extensions which my 5'8'' daughter can ride with ease. This does not fit everyone.,1.0
Christmas gift. Two weeks and the wheel disintegrated.,1.0
We kept this scooter but do not use as the wheels are way too small for sidewalks or streets. I bought for my college daughter and then ended up purchasing a larger scooter with bigger wheels. Twice as much but well-worth the money as the Razor scooter did not work for her. :-(,1.0
"I strained my arm while using this scooter, though it was partially because I was borrowing a friend's and I was more used to larger scooters. I accidentally did a wheelie and I strained my arm. Horribly-made scooter, btw. Ugly. DO NOT buy. Grab a Lucky or an Envy instead -- MUCH better quality.

So far, brute force allows the unit to be closed, but it is clear this mechanism will fail completely sometime soon. Second, the back wheel's rubber covering is falling off. This is after less than a month of use.",1.0

"At first we loved this scooter. After owning it for two months, we don't love it anymore. The folding mechanism jammed within the first month. The scooter is very wobbly and my daughter often gets hurt when it swings out in the wrong direction.",1.0
"I recieved this item and it is a great little kick scooter just as it is pictured and advertised to be BUT, they made a serious design flaw in that in order to save space when shipping they made the handles on the upper most bar that are used to steer and hold onto have been altered so they can be attached/removed for folding purposes with NO ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY TO REMAIN IN PLACE. As a result of this my youngest daughter was kick scooting down the street and she was holding onto the handle bars for control and stability she inadvertantly thumbed the release buttons making the bars she was holding onto spin and them slip out and away from the ""T"" neck assembly giving her no control as well as any support to keep her from falling forward into the upright bar itself and ultimately falling face first onto the pavement knocking her front teeth out!! I was shocked, scared, and in a horrific nightmare as I watched without being able to do a thng as it all happened in the blink of an eye, but upon recounting the event over and over in my head and in my dreams(make that nightmares) keeping me awake OR waking me, it seemed like hours watching my beautiful baby girl come crashing to the pavement face first after busting her face on the ""T"" bar which holds the handles. There isn't even a safety device which can lock these into position only a very easily pushed button which leaves any child and parent completly helpless as they watch their child crash to the street!! I am having the scooter analyzed by an engineer and will be contacting Amazon directly to gain a recall on these dangerous scooters!!. My older daughter had the same scooter BUT the handle bars were solid at the top making it a solid ""T"" that could only be safely tightened into an upper or lower position and just like this one it also folded through the use of a latch. Razor made a serious design flaw making the handles so unwisely and unsafely useless by adding these buttons to them just to save six inches of boxing material or space for shipping/packaging and is just down right silly, unsafe and irreasponsible!! I will post pics as to the nature of my daughters scooter so all parents will be able to see the safety concern as well as my other daughters older version ""the original one"" that did not use this dangerous method to aid in the lower cost of boxing materials for packaging/shipping where the money saved is paid by yours/ours childrens faces and or safety!! I am extremely upset and will also be bringing this to the FTC as well as the H.R. 5818 (98th): Toy Safety Act of 1984 Introduced:

"Headed with kids to the park today. Stopped by ToysRUs to buy new scooter for my daughter. Bought new scooter, went to the park, opened the box. The two pipes on the right handle DID NOT fit together. So much for the joy of riding a new toy. Good thing we had the old one with us - all rusty from the unknown number of summers it served us well and carried BOTH my daughter and my son, sometimes together!!! And NOT a Razor. I know it's probably made in China and all but it is SOLD here. It's NO rocket scince to fit one pipe into another, who's testing that stuff? If anyone. No stars, not a single one since a very simple defect ruined the day. Spent a great deal of time today buying and returning a scooter with zero results.",1.0
"Bought this for my son when he outgrew his MiniKick and should have known by the price it would feel cheap. Sure enough, it needs to be tightened constantly or the handlebars are off-center. Second problem is it is LOUD - like a metal shopping cart rolling on the sidewalk loud. The final straw is that it can only stay at 2 heights - in theory you could winch it tightly and make it adjustable, but if you hit a bump on the road it slams back down into first position. My son is tall for his age but he's still not even 5, so he can't reach either height comfortably.

Wish I had returned it.",1.0

Considering that the company messed up something so important to the use of the product, it makes me wonder the quality of the rest of the product.

ordered it through Amazon.
I was so disappointed when I heard it arrived bent.  Apparently, the front wheel was bent. The box was not bent.

company and rectify the situation.  Not to mention the disappointment the granddaughter had
with my gift.  Haven't heard that things are resolved yet.  Bummer.",1.0
Was shipped to my home instead of desired address. Ended up mailing myself and now lost somewhere in snail mail land.,1.0
I would never purchase anything from this vendor ever again.  I purchased the razor and my daughter also got a razor so all I did was to get it and return it immediately and I was charged $9 for a return fee.  That is ridiculous!,1.0
I've bought this scooter for my niece who's used it exactly four times before parts start falling apart. The saying you get what you pay for just never fails. I'd much rather pay more for better quality than go through the hassle of returning one item & buying another one. Sigh.,1.0
"After using the same model for a couple years, my 10 yr old son received this model as a replacement. Within a couple months of scarce riding (he goes a week or more without riding it at all), 2 critical problems developed which make the Razor unrideable:
1) The steering column sometimes will move independently of the front wheel. Adjusting the hex nut where the two primary halves of the steering column connect does nothing.
2) The back tire developed a large dent. My son is far from a professional user, and the jumps and tricks he does are very tame compared to a middle school or high school student. But he does go off low curbs. But he's ridden the same way for years on his previous Razor. The tires are clearly different on this newer model...they are transluscent instead of opaque. And at some point, he must have gone off a curb, putting a large dent in the back tire. The tire should be able to support modest tricks by a modest rider, just as previous versions have.

Since neither of these issues can be fixed at home without expert knowledge and replacement parts, and since the product failed to stand up to what I consider very tame use in its first 2 months, I'm giving this Razor the lowest score possible. I fear the manufacturer is taking a successful design and just making it cheaper and cheaper. My son's first Razor developed unsolvable problems too, but only after a couple years of use.",1.0
"I can't honestly review this product because I returned it after Amazon thought it was OK to ship a damaged and crushed box even though I specifically ordered it as a gift, they didn't even include the gift tag.",1.0

"The scooter was in fine condition when it came but after taking it out of the box and unfolding it, I found that it was defective. It would not fold back into the position it was stored in, which meant it had to be sent back but was made difficult with its awkward shape.",1.0
"I purchased this product for my kids and was excited about the idea of a ball being able to return. BUT,  after receiving the product was very disappointed in product.

I still didn't put it together the way the directions said :)  In consequence it is poorly used.",1.0

I bought this as a gift for my son who lives in another state. He was so excited until it broke during only his second use.,1.0
Total crap.  The bungee cord broke on the first go.  It is cheaply made and certainly not worth the money.,1.0
"I used a very similar product when I was young. Great product for learning how to kick. My goalies use this for punting, and I have made several for my players to practice using weak foot or place kicks. I buy this for the net over ball and stake. I use the provided cord until it frays and replace with heavier bungee. I throw away everything else. I would recommend a softer covering on your soccer ball to build confidence, goalies can use a heavier training ball. Great product just upgrade it and make it a little heavier. Parents this is a great product to help with kicking. You will get rope burn but that's just part of training, be careful. :)

I got this for my daughter to use indoors during the winter and the cords are so long and you have to attach so many different strings that it is a waste.,1.0
The first time my 13 year old used it the elastic tether snapped.  We had to go to REI and purchase new bungie.,1.0
"I purchased this item for my son who recently turned 12.  He plays competitive soccer, I was looking for another training aide.  This item looked like a solid trainer. The bungee cord snapped on the very first use.  My son said he kicked the ball roughly 25 times and snap! What an absolute piece of garbage.  Don't waste your money.",1.0
"garbage, the elastic broke twice the first time I used the elastic is not springy enough.
The screw is the only thing made well.",1.0
Bungee cord ripped first time I used it.  I will never buy this product again.  Wish it came with reinforced cord but it came with very thin and delicate cord.,1.0
"Instructions indicate that you should be able to drop the ball into the netting and cinch it up with a knot or two, however after about 10 kicks the ball always works its way out.  The factory knots slide around and the spacing is too large to keep the ball contained in the net.",1.0
We read the other reviews about this item breaking quickly but decided to give it a shot anyway - mistake!  We used our own cord around the netting thinking that would help but it's actually the bungee cord that is really cheap.  It broke after 5 kicks.  I tied a new loop around the stake and the cord broke again when I tightened it!  It'd recommend trying to make your own - use a dog tie-out stake and your own bungee cord.  It'd likely be a lot cheaper and last longer!,1.0
"It broke
 immediately. Do not purchase!
The materials are cheep and not worthy of purchasing
Big disappointment
Buy something different",1.0
The cord snapped within 10 minutes of my 10 year old son's first go - he retied but then it snapped twice more in different spots.  This was on the grass so nothing present to cut or rip the cord. The screw piece (for the ground) is also poorly made with the soldered bit splitting off easily (though it still functions it means a slightly exposed sharp edge).  The handheld cord seems fine so far!,1.0
"Yes, it breaks! Very disappointed in it. Not only did it break a week ago but seemed very ineffective anyways as far as training skills go. If your looking to hone in on foot skills I recommend something else.",1.0
"I purchased 2 of these for my daughters.  By the 3rd kick, the soccer balls had ripped through the nets provided and rendered these products useless.  Guess they might be ok if you don't actually try to kick a ball with them. Total waste of money.",1.0
"Seemed really great, until my 10 year old boy started kicking and the bungee cord broke.  I cut off the broken portion and got it working again, then double checked the directions.  After a couple kicks of my own, the cord broke again.",1.0

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  ""

the bottle was not frozen.  just left in the car.  I will not longer be supporting sigg after many years of use and many bottles.",1.0
The quality of the bottle is great. The color smoked pearl however isn't. It looks already old and used and the bottle is nothing like in the picture.,1.0
"I like it for its good looks and re-usability, but I can't give more than one star.  I purchased the bottle in April and by September I was getting mouthfuls of the inside lining of the bottle, which is peeling away from the entire inner surface. It is outside of its ridiculous 3-month 'warranty period' unfortunately.

I've never used the bottle for carrying liquid other than room temperature tap water.  It hasn't been heated or frozen.  Nor has it been abused (I take it to work every day).  But it still is completely useless.

In addition, the caps are made of such soft plastic that over a number of uses, the threads naturally get stripped by the metal bottle.  A new cap costs nearly as much as a new bottle.

So much for Swiss engineering.  I have an identically sized bottle that was made in China and it has lasted for over six years, and is similarly BPA free.  Sorry Sigg, this one's a fail.",1.0

"These ear phones seem to work well, however after several hours Persperation collects and is trapped in the ear peaces resulting in static noise.

This probably will not be a problem for those using the Tactical 6-S for short periods, but, I tend to wear them for hours at a time and the moisure collection and condensation has been a problem on both hot and cold days.",1.0
Peltor Hearing Device has stopped working.  Tried new batteries.  Batteries are NEW and fine - device still does not work.  Barely one year old.  Can this be returned for a replacement?  Thanks!,1.0
These sound good but of poor design.  The batteries are a pain to get to and are accessible from inside the cup.  If you sweat while wearing them you must remove the batteries before you store them otherwise they will corrode after one use.  I have bought two pairs in two years and am it happy.,1.0
"These earmuffs are a RIP OFF, the batteries are a pain to change, and the switches get bumped on very easy, so they burn up batteries like crazy. In addition to that sometimes the circuitry spazzes out and they start making weird noises in your ear, as well as being way over priced. Very sorry I bought them !",1.0
"Product worked well for me for awhile. I actually really liked using it.

After a few months of general usage, the mask piece itself broke on me. One of the plastic clips which attached the straps to the mask snapped became unusable.

I'm probably going to buy another mask unit, but not from MSA.

I planned to use the product over the weekend when I learned it was missing something in the center. There is only and empty vent so I assume something should have been included in that area to prevent air from easily entering the respirator.,1.0
Not near the quality of my old set same make and model very poor magnification of sounds and yes like my old set very poor design for battery installation  can not recommend these to anyone,1.0
Respirator is good enough. I  made sure there were replacement cartridges available on Amazon before purchasing. Now there is a one to two month wait for shipping for cartridges on Amazon. Wish I had bought the 3M respirator now. Money down the drain. I  called the manufacturer and apparently this is an older model. And other Safety Works cartridges won't fit it.,1.0
It is the cheapest built.  The way it functions and the way the cartridges fit on is the cheapest of plastic they could come up with.  It is hard to put off and on and hard to adjust.  In years past bought a respirator from Sears with screw-on cartridges and it lasted a long time.  Expected a big name brand product to be comparable or better.  Very disappointed.  Should have returned without trying it.  Now will go in the trash.,1.0
"The mask worked great at first, then the plastic adjuster for the head strap snapped. There is no real way to repair it, and I'm out of the 30 day return window for items sold by amazon. Reading the other reviews, this is a common issue that has not been addressed. Will add photos when I can.",1.0
"Poor battery placement makes swapping them out a PITA.  Had one (fresh) Duracell leak in the headset damaging the contacts. Not sure if this was caused by the Peltors or the battery. Notes in the battery compartments state ""Do not store with batteries installed"". That's really dumb as taking out the batteries is not a quick task and I'm not going to take them out after every range visit. On/off knobs are prone to being turned on accidentally when tossed in a range bag. Overall a poor design with questionable sound protection.",1.0
"I bought this to help with paint fumes and started a project this afternoon. I could smell the fumes through the respirator immediately. I thought I put it on incorrectly, so I checked that. I have a tight seal around the nose, mouth and under the chin. Am I missing something? I'm using spray paint, but this is supposed to be the right respirator for paint, so I'm not sure what the problem is.",1.0
"These deserve negative stars, worst product I've ever used, no joke.

Non-existent hearing protection, non-adjustable, incredibly uncomfortable, difficult to install/change batteries, and lousy ambient volume enhancement.

Received the product without the two air filters filters.,1.0
"I'm a professional furniture finisher, and I was looking for something better than the 3M masks typically found at big home box stores. Those are more or less disposable (the neck and head band elastic always breaks or unravels, and the plastic band adjustment retainer tabs are prone to breaking as well). Got tired of replacing them 2-3 times per year, so I decided to take a chance in this one based on mostly positive reviews. Took one look out of the box and knew I hadn't found what I was looking for. The neck and head bands are the same cheap elastic as other poor quality masks, and the plastic adjustment retainer tabs feel like they won't make it a week before starting to break. If this were $20 I'd say it's ok for the money, but for almost $40, no way. There are much better choices out there for less $, including the GVS Eclipse P100 (which is what I replaced this makl with, glad I did). Avoid.",1.0
Can't breathe through it !,1.0
"MADE IN CHINA!  Enough said?  The cheapest, flimsiest Peltor product I have ever seen.  What a huge disappointment.  Probably made in the same factory as the Harbor Freight ones for $14.95!  I paid over $80 for really nothing more than a name.  ARGGHHH!  Could it be more than coincidence that just like the Harbor Freight ones, these have to be savagely peeled apart to replace batteries or, EACH earpiece has separate volume controls???

Will be returning this total junk and never buying Peltor again.  I'm fed up with big name companies that give the impression of quality product but instead, shove it up the garbage chute of their customers with Chinese made junk like this.",1.0
"Don't waste your money. These are designed, constructed and performed below any reasonable standard. Hearing protection is terrible (I used inner ear plugs most of the time with these) and the location of the batteries is terrible. I felt like I was breaking the ear piece when replacing the batteries. After 1 year, the left side just stopped working (which was right after the warranty expired). Take my advice, spend a few extra $ and get a better set of hearing protection from another company.",1.0
Difficult to install batteries and the batteries are dead almost every time I use them. Will never purchase another Peltor product again!,1.0
"These are terrible so don't buy them. They are compact and light weight and work well but that's all the good I can say about them. Replacing the batteries is a bloody knuckle affair every time. Even worse, the ANR knobs tend to get left on or bumped on when in the gear bag. When you get them out of your bag, the batteries are dead! There is no ""auto off"" feature so I have to replace the batteries so often that the process of doing so is extra painful. The foam wind guards for the microphones are vulnerable and are easily damaged or torn off. The worst part is that these pitfalls were foreseeable and easily avoidable. I don't know why Peltor didn't do anything about it.",1.0
"Compared to my HL Impact earpro, these are a joke. Volume control for each side?? WHY??? Do you need volume control for each side when you listen to music? Of course not. I have no idea why they are designed this way. I find it to be a pointless pain in the butt. It just creates an extra unnecessary hassle to actuate and turn 2 knobs to the same volume instead of one that does both sides. Battery replacement is a pain, as I felt like I was literally breaking my earphones to get to the battery terminals under the housing where the circuitboard and wires are exposed. Not very elegant design at all. They don't come with batteries which is a bit silly. Impact earmuffs are cheaper and a far more straightforward and simple design. A battery change doesn't require breaking apart both sides either, (or one side for that matter) Impact pros are more compact too. Would not reccommend these when there are so much better options out there. It was a mistake buying these.",1.0

"Lousy cheap, thin, frail plastic fittings on the straps. One broke the second time I put it on. They are difficult to adjust and I fear breaking the remaining one every time I touch it. I have been using binder clips since-they work o.k. and don't break. Binder clips are difficult to adjust in this use, but at least they don't break and aren't much more difficult to adjust than the plastic straps that came with this product.",1.0
"Do not like!  Have had them a few months.  A lot of static, then the condensation gets into the cups and shorts out the electronics.  Will never purchase them again.  Did not try to contact Peltor.

"I have generally had very good experiences with items bought on Amazon.  However, this item is a notable exception.  This respirator was supposed to be new, but it appears to be a defective product that was previously returned.  The plastic clasp that clinches the head strap is broken off, rendering the respirator completely unusable.  In addition, the package is scratched up on both the outside and inside, and the instruction manual and warranty card are missing from the package.  Finally, there is a generic sticker with a new SKU label pasted over the manufacturer's original SKU.  All of this leads me to believe that I was sold as new, a defective item that was previously returned.  Unfortunately, the respirator is still defective and is completely unusable in the condition that it arrived in.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this worthless item.",1.0

"I bought this MSA Safety Works respirator and a MSA Safety Works refill cartridge from Amazon.com on May 1, 2011. My 49-year-old daughter uses it occasionally when she works with me in my hobbyist home woodworking shop. For a short while, the respirator worked beautifully. It then broke across the bridge of the nose. I knew nothing of any warranty, so, she has just lived with it. I am very disappointed. I DO NOT recommend this product. No warranty, no sale. Buyer beware!

As for me, I am old, so I just wear re-usable cloth masks. I bought them from a different seller. They work fine for me and I still have them. They did not break.",1.0
"Huge bubble, compass disc won't spin at all, mirror cover flaps around with no real strength to the angles it's supposed to keep (it's own weight will pull it down from 45*), and the rubber boot just gets in the way. Just liked the declination setting method..which I hope to find in another higher quality, functioning product. Returning my item as any item will be better than something that doesn't work at all. I was really disappointed at the quality.",1.0
"It works well as a respirator but the blue rubber part leaves a tacky material on your face,It feels like silicon on your face. I washed it several times but it continued to happen. I stopped using it because it felt gross on my face and I bought a unit from North that doesn't melt on your face. I kept it in my truck for an emergency and it turned to a gel,I had to throw it out.",1.0
This is a great compass let down by the lack of meridian lines underneath the needle. There are some tiny thin meridian lines incorporated on the rotating bezel which are really difficult to correctly line up with UTM lines on a map. This design makes it really difficult to take accurate readings from a map.,1.0
i bought this product from amazon and i taught it is going to be good product but the reality it gives wrong direction my opinion do not buy it,1.0
"I read the negative reviews but thought I knew better LOL.  Negatives:  Adjusting magnetic declination is very difficult, you wonder if you will break the compass;  The design of the rubberized case *looks good* until you have to open the compass, I don't know what they were thinking, it makes it very hard to use (perhaps others don't use the case).  Bottom line: I had high hopes for this unit, but it just sits in my ""backup"" box in case my every day compass gets lost/damaged.  Before purchasing this unit, I recommend you personally handle it somewhere, including adjusting the declination, and opening the case/closing the case, etc. to give it a real-world try.  My judgment is to look elsewhere.",1.0

"I was issued a set of Peltor Tactical 6S headphones by my agency.  I have used them twice.  Each earmuff is two parts - the outer hard shell that contains the electronics, and the inner padded part.  For reasons unknown, the two pieces no longer snap together (in either earmuff) and just fall apart.  No apparent signs of damage; it's almost as if the inner padded part shrunk and no longer fits snugly with the outer portion. Very disappointed with the build quality on these.",1.0
"I thought I was buying a made in Sweden, high quality compass. This is a made in China junker. I spent hours researching and tried to find the best compass.

I use plugs when I shoot long guns and when I got to use them next they no longer worked at all. They did not work that well when they did work. Both sides quit functioning. I called Peltor they said that I should just buy another pair. Not likely I have a pair of MSA Sordin Supreme basic that work great.

"My buddy had done some favors for me while I was deployed to Afghanistan, and I bought him a pair of Peltor 6S's for his efforts.

STRIKE ONE. When we turned them on, all you could hear was a faint static sound, compared to the Howard Leights I was wearing they were miserable. With my Howard Leights I could hear quite clearly the animals, insects, and our foot steps as we walked. STRIKE TWO. Lastly, the knobs came off several times just handling the things. STRIKE THREE - YOU'RE OUT!!!! They are on the way back, and a pair of Howard Leights are on the way to my buddy. BOTTOM LINE the Peltor 6S are JUNK.",1.0

"With the Peltor name attached, I assumed the Peltor 6S Electronic Earmuffs would be the best value for the dollar.  WRONG!  Spoken voices were fine, but there was essentially NO ear protection from range fire - from the 9mm and 40 cal either side of me or even protetion from some of the gunfire as far as 150 feet away regardless of how I played with the adjustment!  I have a pair of cheapee muffs rated at NRR15 that I use for my home workshop and mowing the lawn that give better protection on the rifle and pistol range.  The Peltors were returned immediately and I ordered a pair of Brownings - we'll see if they're any better.

I am very impressed with Amazon's return policy - fast, easy, no complications, and my charge account was credited within 48 hours of them receiving the returning Peltors. The replacement Brownings were ordered through Amazon without hesitation.

If you can't make a pair of safe, useable and fully functional electronic ear muffs in the $60-$90 range, get out of the business.  No further Peltor product trials here, thank you.",1.0
"Don't buy these!  I've had three pairs now, and they all quit withing the first 30 minutes of use under ideal conditions!",1.0
I have had Peltor products before and was satisfied. However the 6S did not work properly from the beginning. One side was not functioning. Another complaint is the difficulty in removing batteries. Very poor design for opening the case. Would not recommend thase,1.0
"I almost never write reviews but I was so disappointed with these headphones that I had to say something.  I am a long time Peltor owner - Tactical 7's, etc.  When I went to buy another pair of Tactical 7's I saw these and I was excited.  I thought I found a product of Peltor quality for a fraction of the price of my Tactical 7's.  I ignored the negative reviews and bought them.  I shouldn't have.

If you are thinking that these are anything like the Tactical 7's then you are compeltely wrong.  These are very lightweight, flimsy and seem to be cheaply made.  At the range, they seem to provide only a fraction of the hearing protection that the Tactical 7's do and even less than the non-electronic Peltors that I own do.  And the amplification also isn't close to what the Tactical 7's provide.  In fact, it seems to me that the amplifier in one ""ear"" of mine isn't working at all.

Maybe if this is your first and only pair of amplified hearing protectors you would be satisfied, but I honestly doubt it.  I threw mine in the trash.  Maybe that's wasteful, but I normally make good purchasing decisions and I hate going through the hassle of the paperwork and paying the postage to return things so it was easier for me to just throw these pieces of junk away.",1.0

"Update 1/8/13- Now having these for 2 1/2 years, I am downgrading this recommendation even more. It is incredibly frustrating that they cannot do the basics such as having some kind of indicator showing when the device is on or off.  Even without that, it should have a marking on the earphones indicating on/off.  Lazy design, lazy engineering, lazy thinking.  They really don't deserve your hard-earned money!

I rated these earphones as ""okay"" but not great.  At the gun range, they definitely keep the sound down, but it's the little things that it's missing.  For example:
1.  It should have an LED indicator telling you if the earpiece is on or not.  That's annoying and can drain your batteries if you're not careful, especially, since each ear turns on and off.  In addition, it should at least give you an on/off indicator, even it it's not an LED!
2.  The overall hearing protector should have an adjustable head band.  Not all head sizes are the same.  I have an XL head and this barely covered my ears.
3.  Installing the batteries is a major headache, that they should definitely make more user-friendly.  I have a graduate degree and this thing took me 15 minutes to figure out.

Bottom line, for the money, I expect more.  Either pay more for a better model or go elsewhere.",1.0
"First off, these amplify ALL sounds, so they are useless in a factory where there are constant noises echoing from a distance.

When I walk on concrete, my FOOTSTEPS get isolated by these headphones, and the phones mute for almost a half second EVERY step. I cant even hear myself walk WITHOUT these on. They are hot and not exactly UNcomfortable, but you feel much better NOT wearing them.

To top it off, I got it at the last GoldBox deal, and I was *NOT* sent the ""7S"" model I paid $99.99 for. I was sent this 6S model that retails for exactly $79 on Amazon, and I didn't notice until 5 weeks later.",1.0

The knobs are prone to turning on when in the range bag and the cups are a little too shallow and bottom out on the ears before sealing.",1.0
"I would rate these as disposable IF and a BIG IF they worked even reasonably well.
They did nothing to ""SHUT OFF"" loud range noise and sound amplification was inferior and distorted.

A total waste of time and money.",1.0
"I purchased model 97044 Peltor hearing protector based largely on the reviews I read here.  This is quite possibly the worst hearing protection I have ever used.  I wrote this unit off as a lemon or part of a bad batch.  However, I was at my local shooting range this past weekend when a gentleman approached me because he noticed that I was wearing the same brand that he had.  We compared notes and realized that we both had the same issues.  They are as follows.

1.  The battery location and replacement procedure is ill considered and lends itself to the possibility of damage to the unit when accessing the battery compartment.
2.  The location and orientation of the on/off/volume knob, specifically the right side, causes the right unit to be inadvertently activated when the unit is folded for storage.  Thus draining the batteries in that unit between uses.  This has happened twice.
3. The function of the unit during the first use was good.  All subsequent uses have seen a severe decline in quality of the electronics of the unit.  My unit crackles and pops.  The other gentleman's does not work at all and he feels that he gets very little protection.
4. The actually Db reduction is somewhat suspect.

That all said, a friend has one of the other, more expensive models, that he is happy with thus far.  I really don't know if I'm willing to give this company more of my money in hopes that there is light ahead.  I really hope this helps everyone who is considering this model.

Caveat emptor!",1.0
Got the hearing protector and read the instructions to install the batteries.  What a PITA to get apart.  Installed the batteries on each side and the left side is fair but the right side does not work. I emailed the comapny and have not heard back.  Save you money and get something else.,1.0

"Any compass without a sighting mirror is virtually worthless for all but the most entry level forms of navigation.

I requested a replacement through Amazon.  That arrived very quickly, but was also half deflated.  I'm not sure what it was exposed to under UPS's care, but I was home the day of delivery so it was not exposed to the elements post delivery.  If they routinely mail these footballs not fully inflated, that should be mentioned in the listing so that buyers could also purchase a needle and pump if they don't already have them.

After only about a week, it looks in much worse shape than couple of the soccer balls my boys have had for over an year.",1.0
"The ball has no luminosity and for all practical purposes, is just another soccer ball.  Our children were so disappointed!!",1.0
The ball is not round.  It would not roll in a straight line.  Overall quality is poor even though its surface looks nice.,1.0
This was a Christmas present for my 8 year old. We go jogging at night and he loves kicking the ball when we jog. The ball DOES NOT glow in the dark and we had several splits on the ball. Looks like someon took a razor and cut it all up.,1.0
"I am really dissapointed by this soccer ball. Firstly it does not glow at all. My regular white soccer balls are actually easier to play with in the dark than this ball because its actually very hard to see in the dark. Not only that but the ball only lasted for about 3-4 weeks  of semi regular soccer practice. After about a month it started getting ""eggs"" as my friend calls it. Basically it is little bubbles on the ball. It got to the point it wouldnt roll but randomly bounce around because of the eggs. Yesterday I finally lost the ball playing street soccer. Didnt even care.",1.0
It did not fit on my rim even after letting down the rim support box.  It was advertised as basically fitting all rims.  I was never told that there was another model available with longer hooks for the modern rims most of us have now.,1.0
I purchased this for the basketball hoop I put in our cul-de-sac and it does not return the ball.  The plastic is not sturdy enough and the only difference is that the ball no longer hits the base of the portable hoop and roll down the street. Do not waste your money on this product.,1.0
We have a Spaulding basketball hoop and for ours the installation of this product is very frustrating. You have to disassemble the spring guard and let it hang down. So the spring is now exposed to the elements. The directions are of little help. It also seems very flimsy plastic. Guess we'll see how long it holds up.,1.0

"My two daughters each received a twirler at Christmas, from different people. One was awesome. The other was homemade and didn't twirl. I felt bad and ordered this Rainbow Twirling Ribbon online for her so she could have a proper one as well. I was quite disappointed when it arrived. The ribbon is not very long at all - probably half the length as my other daughter's ribbon (the good one). Plus, the type of ribbon does not lend well to twirling and tricks as it is too stiff.  I definitely would not have purchased this ribbon if I had known.",1.0
Cheaply made. Very very small and knots easily. More of a cat toy than a child's toy.,1.0
"While the ribbon was colorful, within 5 minutes of it being opened (by an adult) the wand cracked and the ribbon was useless.  Very disappointing and unsure what can be done about it at this point.  The girl who received it as a gift was very sad that this happened.",1.0
Not much thought went into the making of this tent. Or maybe they think every child has 2 beds. The tent was to help a 2 yo sleep in his own bed but its not for sleeping in. The tent has a plastic sheet that the child has to sleep on.,1.0
"In the picture it doesn't say anything about the tent being on a twin size fitted sheet.

Thank You",1.0
Really cute but one of the poles broke after one week!!,1.0
"My grandson wanted this for Christmas, so I got it for him. I figured since he wanted it and the reviews said that it was great for kids that had fears and gave them a nice secure feeling I was all for it. The joke was on me... He was excited, Needless to say we set it up and he got in it and was thrilled until bed time!!!! He had a total melt down, he was deathly afraid of it, we had to take it off his bed.. I emailed the company and heard nothing from them as I wanted to return it.. Not happy!!!",1.0
Nothing near my expectations.,1.0
the picture and box shows it has zippers and it does not it has velcro and it won't stay on the mattress the elastic for the ends of the bed are not strong enough to stay on causing the bed to fall down on the kid.  not a good buy  :  was kinda upset was looking forward to it,1.0
Very cheap. Hard to twist the pieces around to get it to stay in place. Still pops out of place. Doesn't look like it'll last through the day.. So wish I would have gotten something else!,1.0
I wanted this for my 5 year old to hang on the door and practice.  It is so flimsy and cheaply made that it broke the 2nd day he had it.  It is an awful product.  Save your money and buy one that  really works.,1.0
