"So good, nieces take mine. Gave to rebuy again and again",5.0
So glad I found this! I'm no longer pestering my fiance with leaving a light on to read at night. It has multiple brightness settings and clips easily onto a book or an e-reader.,5.0
Works great! Illuminates both pages easily of any size book. Great product!,5.0
This is great quality and really gives off a lot of light. My daughter loves it and the purple color we chose.,5.0
I use it on my piano music stand over my music. Works great!!!!,5.0
So bright and gorgeous. Still working perfectly 2 years later.,5.0
Great Product. The whole family loves it.,5.0
This are great book lights. I bought one for myself and ended up ordering additional ones for other family members. We use them regularly and them still seem as good as new.,5.0
"Exactly as described it gives excellent light, clips easily to all of my books, and is very lightweight. I also like the two different brightness feature though I don't ever need to use the brightest setting it's nice that it's available.",5.0
"I really enjoy using this book light. Very easy to point where I need it to aim, and there are two different light strengths. I seem to use the less bright one most often while in a dark room. Seems sufficient!",5.0
So far so good.  It's perfectly super bright and can flex in any direction you want.  I love that it has 2 brightness options.  I really like everything about this light; let's hope it holds up for many years to come.,5.0
Perfect to read by! Have two - just love them!!!,5.0
Best book lamp ever. My kids use this daily and love it. Hold up to abuse of being dropped a million times also and not because it doesn't stick on a book but because I have boys who are rough with some things,5.0
Mighty Bright is the best for book lights.,5.0
Third one we purchased. Delivered on time and as advertised. Thanks!,5.0
Best book light EVER,5.0
"This is an amazing little light , so bright, and I get about a total of 20hrs from one set of batteries , buy the ac plug adapter and it's great for reading when at home too",5.0
Very well made reading light,5.0
Perfect for my nook!!! I use it all the time.,5.0
Excellent light & has come in super handy during grad school.  Have enjoyed reading on the back porch at night.,5.0
Bought this for the hubs.....I wasn't sure how it would go over...its one of those...oh yeah thats great :::eyeroll:::: or WOW how did you know I needed one of these??  I got lucky...he needed one of these...he put it at his computer station and uses it daily...he loves it!  So this is technically his review....but he is a happy guy...and that makes me happy too!,5.0
"This is a good product. My wife ordered this first and after borrowing hers, I decided to get one for myself. I like the option of using one LED or two, depending on the level of light I need at the time. I do find myself re-positioning it from the left page to the right, but it's a quick and easy adjustment. The flexible arm is long enough to put the light right where I want it and stays in position well. I'm on my third book with it and have no regrets.",5.0
"I got this for my wife. Best money I've spent this year. Now she can read her library books without keeping me up. She loves the two light settings. We've had it for a couple months, and the batteries are still going strong! The clip is big enough to clip just about anything! It's larger than I was expecting for a modern book light, but it's not heavy. It's size actually means it's easy to keep track of, but it's not so big that it's awkward or difficult to tuck away (just very simply bigger than I expected).",5.0
"I have purchased two of these now. One regular, and one Flex2. Both are wonderful assets, great at bedtime for reading!",5.0
"These are great little lights, bright enough for nighttime reading.",5.0
Really bright light. Perfect for reading in bed or in any poorly lit room.,5.0
Awesome lights,5.0
"I'll start off by saying the Mighty Bright light I'm technically reviewing was not bought through Amazon, though I have recently purchased one through Amazon. I bought one of these exact lights at a book store about 16 years ago. This light lasted me 16 whole years and I only had to change the batteries maybe twice. It lights a huge area, and it's great for when you're winding down before bed and want some light, but don't want to have to reach over and turn off a lamp when you're ready to fall asleep.
I've crocheted with this in the dark many times, and it's perfect. The 16 year old one I have still works perfectly, though the clip finally broke in half. I'm thinking maybe it's because I left it clipped to my nightstand every night. It's certainly capable of clipping onto tables, desks, and drawers, but I'm thinking it's not a good idea to keep it clipped to large objects like that for extended periods of time (I'm talking months) I absolutely recommend this light to anyone, it's so handy!",5.0
"Funny little light...clips on my easel or books....great to go.  Love the color and the round, quirky style. Very happy with this light!",5.0
Great light. This one is very flexible and does its job with no hassle. Even works well on a paperback.,5.0
Solid simple product does what it is supposed to.,5.0
Just plain awesome. The kids love these.,5.0
There are a million options out there...I read reviews and bought this light.  Lucky me...it works wonderfully!,5.0
Works great!  Looks great!,5.0
Love this book light. It's light and works well for reading in bed. I bought one purple as a gift and turquoise for myself. The colors are true.,5.0
"Excellent book light!! Very sturdy, works well, gives just enough light. I love the fact that it's adjustable. I use this all the time.",5.0
Perfect. Amount and brightness of light is exactly what I wanted and the flexible neck stays exactly where I point it.,5.0
I have used this for many many hours.  Works Great.,5.0
Works great for my cross stitch projects and clips on to hoops and q-snaps perfectly!,5.0
"Wow, this is the best reading light I have ever had! The clip is extremely sturdy and holds onto books, computers, the side of the bed, anything! The light is very, very bright. It is nice that you can switch between one light or two, but even the single light being on is quite bright. The bendy part of the light works really well, it seems very sturdy and can be moved to any position you would need. I can't recommend this enough, it is extremely bright and very versatile.",5.0
This is a great little clip-on light for not just reading but crafts - I use it for my cross-stitching and it works great.,5.0
very good,5.0
Really a perfect personal book light. On high the light illuminates both pages.,5.0
perfect..like the AAA batteries ..last much longer!!!,5.0
Love this light. It has 2 brightness levels and clips on to books or magazines easily! I've also used it to clip on the inside of my kitchen. Cupboards so I can see way in the back while cleaning them. Love it!,5.0
"My 7 year old son loves reading- in the car, in his room, bathroom, restaurants, you name it & this light will save his eyes. It's light, easy to use, and bright. I just placed another order for my 4 year old who wants to ""read"" using this light :)",5.0
"Use it all the time, it's great without getting in the way too much.",5.0
This light has done wonders for me. I read to fall asleep but own no lamp so i'd find that i'd have to leave my room lights on until i was ready to fall asleep. Well most of the time i'd just end up asleep with the lights on. But now with this clip on light i don't need to leave my room lights on anymore!,5.0
It is VERY bright!,5.0
"Good light, easy to use!",5.0
Excellent! Works perfectly for late night readers.  Two settings are both plenty bright and comfortable on the eyes.  Light weight with super bendable neck.  I'm glad I purchased this.,5.0
Love it,5.0
I actually clip this to a small pillow that I prop on my lap... so it is a light source coming from the bottom of the book instead of the top.  I really like reading with this light and my husband is happy too....,5.0
got this for my Mom. the packaging was a little smashed when I got it so I opened it &  up put the batteries in to make sure it still worked. it is bright. it does come with cheap batteries...not sure how long those will last but it works.,5.0
"These lights work very well. I like the fact that they have two levels of light, can clip onto anything and don't slip off and the flexibility is wonderful. My boys use them as reading lights and they are not the gentlest of boys but these lights are good quality and holding up very well! The lights are still going strong as well and haven't needed replacing or anything of the sort.",5.0
Great when sharing bed with an early sleeper,5.0
I needed a light to attach to my books so I could see better.  This is a great light!  Easy to carry and makes it much easier to see!  I'll need it when I travel.  I carry a Journal and write all information in it!,5.0
"I love this little reading lamp. I bought it so I can read my books in bed and it was one of my best purchases yet. It's biggest advantage is that it's very lightweight. The light is bright enough without being too bright, and the price was excellent!",5.0
works great for reading at night or even as a nightlight! I'd purchase another without question.,5.0
Wife likes it.  The light is brighter than I expected.,5.0
"Serves the purpose, great light with two brightness levels.
After seeing my husband use this I got another as a gift.",5.0
super,5.0
"high powered little light.  It's convenient there are two light settings.  The clip works well, and the light is extremely flexible.  Will buy again.",5.0
Great little light!,5.0
Just what I needed and in a cool color.,5.0
"Bought this for my kids. Doesn't get hot when they leave it on at night. Super durable (I find it tossed all over the place in their room). One of the nicest things is the large clip. Not too big that it overwhelms book, but not to small that they can't clip it onto their bedpost. Very versatile.",5.0
Super bright even on its low setting. I like everything about it. It is sturdy unless you slam a window closed on it then the clip may break :),5.0
best reading light I've had.  Also comes in handy around the house when looking for things in tight spaces.,5.0
great little light.  has two brightness settings.  The flexible neck and clip work well.,5.0
"got for reading in bed, works great",5.0
We have 3 of these book lights (one for each kid) and we love them.  They last for years and provide enough light to read at night with the room lights off.,5.0
Absolutely love this light! It is perfect for casual reading! I loved it so much I bought one for my mother-in-law before she went on a cross country road trip :),5.0
Fast shipping! The light is smaller than I thought but it's perfect! Super cute! Would definitely recommend. Just wish it was USB chargeable instead of taking batteries :(,5.0
Awesome book light.,5.0
Great for kids. I bought 4 of these for kids to read in bed. Just what they needed.,5.0
"This little guy is a beast. Seriously, it's like a flash light, not just a book light. For my purposes, this is great, because I needed it for dim working light when my boyfriend is just laying down for bed, and I'm doing school work.  Great little light with two brightness options, and the battery is still going strong without a charge a few months into use.",5.0
"I don't know what makes these so wonderful, but I absolutely love them. They're slim and sexy and just do a really great job.",5.0
"Great light.
When the TV and computers and lights go out night reading may be the new passtime.
Get a couple for storm season. Powerful, lightweight.",5.0
love this little light. Flexible arm is nice and smooth and the clamp is solid.,5.0
"This is the perfect light for late-night reading in bed. Granted, I've only used it on my Kindle, not on a paper or hardback book, but it is just bright enough to read without waking your partner. The two settings don't have that much of a difference, even though one has 2 lights while the dimmer has only one. I usually use the one light, which is plenty bright to read. It also clamps well to my Kindle cover. Would definitely recommend.",5.0
"Love this book light.  Great spring, two light brightness settings, adjustable neck.  And it use AAA batteries, not one of the round ones that can be challenging to find.",5.0
"What a handy little gadget! This was kind of an impulse buy-- sometimes, I like to skim books while my husband & I watch TV. He prefers to have the lights off, so this keeps us both happy. I expected it to be flimsy, but it seems pretty sturdy. There are 2 power settings, which helps avoid glare. The light gives good coverage-- I can read a full page without moving it. I tried using it in the car at night, but it was too bright & distracted the driver. I'm very happy with it.",5.0
"First real quality book light I've ever had! I'm never going back, and I'll shout it to any avid reader out there: You need this!
I've had a few book lights of different designs over the years, and never really found one that did the job well enough to suit me. They all seemed to light up tiny sections of the page and caused me more of a headache than they were worth. This book light is nothing like that. I love the fact that it has two settings, and I make use of both as needed. Even the lower setting always lights up both pages perfectly, and once the light his angled where I want it, the neck keeps it there despite the general shifting and twitching that comes along with sitting with a book for hours. The clip is large, but that's a good thing, as it likewise doesn't slide around or anything. I've been reading a few paperbacks with it and the clip doesn't damage the book at all. I've also used it as a night light when I wake up disoriented, and it fills the room well enough that I can see my surroundings in the dark without blinding myself in the process. It is a little pricier than any I've had before, but I think it's definitely a case of 'you get what you pay for'. I'm so pleased that I'll be getting one for my mother soon, as well! I can't recommend it enough.",5.0
Looks and functions advertised.,5.0
GREAT PRICE AND A LOT CHEAPER THEN STORE...,5.0

I love it so far!!!,5.0
PERFECT,5.0
very light and compact,5.0
I have several of these and like how adjustable it is so I can focus the light exactly where I want it on my book.,5.0
Sturdy reading light with 2 light levels very bright and bright.  Maybe it could use one more level of less brightness. You can use it to look at awkward dark places when working on your car.  Clip on device works well. It would also be nice if the light had a timer which turned off automatically after an hour. A couple of times I fell asleep and it was still on in the morning.,5.0
"Great little lite has a strong clamp and the 2 settings of brightness is very good, I only need the low setting to read.",5.0
"Really good and clear light. It has two modes of intensity.
Easy to install in different surfaces.",5.0
Works great with batteries and happy with purchase.  Would consider purchase from this seller again.  Thanks!,5.0
Not what I expected,5.0
Works great!,5.0
Very bright with nice long cords,5.0
Perfect for trip to Grand Canyon with poor lighting in the cabins.  Also came in handy at home when the power went out for several hours.  Gave good coverage for my older eyes.,5.0
Nice little light . I can read by it while my spouse sleeps.  It stores away nicely in a small space.,5.0
I have the 4th generation Kindle with the E-Ink display so it looks just like a real book. This book light is perfect because it allows me to read at night without disturbing my partner. It has two light options and the dimmer option is bright enough to be more than sufficient (the brighter option is blinding lol). I will usually switch to the brighter option when the light goes dim from low battery. I used to keep this with my Kindle in my purse but it rolls around and will accidentally click on unbeknownst to me which uses up the battery so now I just keep it at home.,5.0
Fabulous book light! Totally covers both pages of the book when reading in a darkened room. There is no need to move it around. Love it!,5.0
I love it!!! Great for nighttime reading when my husband on asleep!!,5.0
Great size.  Works well,5.0
"My wife and I have one each - these are really, REALLY nice. Very convenient, bright, and they last a long time on a set of batteries.",5.0
Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend so he could read in bed without having the bedroom light on. Win-win for both of us. (Someday I'll convince him to get the Kindle Paperwhite like me.),5.0
Best book light i have ever owned.  These things keep going and going and going... Then the battery dies so you replace it and it keep  going and going and going!,5.0
Works well for what I do with it.,5.0
works great,5.0
This lights my book - exactly as advertised.  I'd like to give it six stars but amazon won't let me.,5.0
I use it every day!,5.0
works good. my kid is using in a car when dark. now she can read books!,5.0
"Wonderful, second one I've pirchased. Would buy again if needed. On;y reason I bought a second one was because my grandson took the original one home with him.",5.0
Great!!,5.0
Great light for such small package.,5.0
Works great!  A great gift for someone!,5.0
"Great, bright light. Perfect for reading or lighting up a kids room at night.",5.0
Super bright (if I want it) and not so bright (if I don't need as much light.)  Long-lasting battery.  Love this book light!,5.0
"Works great. Lightweight, easy to use and pack for travel. Casts a really good light for reading.",5.0
"Excellent light for its purpose. Inexpensive, decent quality, works very well. Battery lasts for a long time. Light output is very good. Would hapilly buy again.",5.0
"This has two LEDs, but the coverage is so good that I usually switch on just one. You don't have to reposition it for every page. Possibly too bright for totally dark rooms, but not enough light for an unlit room during the day, if there are windows. If there is any little light in the room at night, it's fine. Probably about the same amount of light as those key ring LED lights, but more evenly lit, and covers a larger area.

The clip portion does not move around when you don't want it to, and is not too bulky. It does not seem to eat batteries, so an AC adapter is not needed.",5.0
Very nice book lamp that also stands up by it's self for other lighting purposes. Plenty bright enough for those of us with diminishing vision in the dark.,5.0
"Great product, but way over-packaged (too much plastic) for an online purchase.",5.0
"I love this light,  use it just about everything!",5.0
Great little light. Very bright and clips on nicely.,5.0
Great item.,5.0
Does a great job!,5.0
I love these little lights. They are very bright. Easy to move with you. Easy to clip somewhere and grab for a flashlight. The only complaint I have is that the clips eventually break. But it gets a LOT of use. Awesome for plucking your eyebrows or putting on make up. I clip it to the mirror and can move the gooseneck in any position. I have one clipped next to my bed so if I have to get up at night I don't need to fumble for the lamp. Very convenient. Easy to change batteries which last a good long time. One of my favorite things.,5.0
These little book lights are excellent! Exactly as described. Very functional and highly flexible. Great buy. Highly recommended!,5.0
"Love this book light... I'm going on a trip in a month with includes a 9 hour flight, and I do not like the overhead lights for reading on a plane. It's got 2 light settings which are easy to use, and while it's big and the lighting covers both pages, it's not overly heavy, which I really like. It's very portable and light, so great for travel. I actually bought a second one to keep in my car for long car rides so I could read if we were traveling at night.",5.0
"Great quality. Bright, flexible. Tried other products by the same manufacturer - consistent experience every time.",5.0
"Provides two light settings, easy to attach, easy to use",5.0
"This is a powerful little light. I like to read at night without bothering my husband and I like to read on long car trips. this seems to be perfect for giving me the bright light I need. I can position it so that both pages are lit and I can focus it in on the page so that I don't bother anyone else. I highly recommend this light - in fact, I bought two!",5.0
"This is a great reading light, and because it is an LED light, the batteries last for a long time.",5.0
good little light to take to good little third world hotels with no reading lamps.,5.0
very happy it  was  what  we wanted thank  you,5.0

"I use it often, very good.",5.0
Simple book light that works great!,5.0
Great item and service!,5.0
"Two different settings, which I love. Very good battery life so far.",5.0
I really like the two lighting levels and that it clips snugly to not just books (I also use it when shelling pecans).,5.0
These rock.  Very well made and bright.  This is the book light you need.  Get it.,5.0
My favorite bedtime reading light! The clip is super sturdy and doesn't flop around like so many other's I've used do. Nice light that illuminates both pages of my book perfectly. Definitely a keeper! I'll also get this one for gifts for book lovers!,5.0
Easy to use and durable.,5.0
"I love these little lights!  They are great for clipping to the kids' headboards so they can read at night in bed without bothering one another (they're in bunk beds).  They're also great because they come with us on all our weekend trips.  They are sturdy, last forever and can take the abuse of kids twisting them all around.  I also like that they have 2 brightness levels.",5.0
"Love this light!  Two settings of brightness level, and easy to turn off & on with button on top.",5.0
"Works great, easy to use, very bright!",5.0
"Having been through several cheaper book lights, I am THRILLED with my new MIghty Bright. I considered getting the older (cheaper) model but I contacted the company and based on their feedback I was happy to pay a few dollars more for a newer and better light. I have some vision problems and was having trouble reading in bed, even with a lamp. This light has weaned me away from my iphone addiction and gotten me back to the joy of an evening book.  I usually need ""big print"" but this light is so bright that I am able to read normal print. The two-bulb design is clever and effective. The ""stem"" is strong and flexible. I do need to frequently adjust the beam of the light as I move around on the page - but that is my issue and I am happy that it is so easy to adjust the light. The clip is strong and stays put. I am ordering a 2nd light for my daughter.",5.0
"My son loves these for reading at night.  We have several....One for home, One for Traveling, One at his grandparents house.  Having the clip on feature is GREAT and the light is bright and takes AA batteries (Yeah nothing unique and hard to find!).
Light gets used EVERY night for about an hour and has lasted him almost a year before having to replace batteries.",5.0
Great for the music stand and the knitting machine user!,5.0
"These little lights are the best - they last forever, have a bright light and are very effective at shining on the page.",5.0
"Good product, wish it had a lower setting, it is bright. But lasts along time.",5.0
It's a great reading light w a very flexible neck. The two options for light intensity are a real asset.,5.0
"awesome little book light, lots of light for a little device.",5.0
"Great light.  I bought them to clip on my kids' headboards so they can read in bed, and they fit nicely.  I was worried that the thickness of the headboards might be too much for the clips and that they would break if my kids pressed on them, but they've held up so far.  The lights are bright and perfect for reading.  I am planning to buy another one for myself.",5.0
Very flex and portable,5.0
"Two lights, operating separately with switch, battery charger available, strong clip, strong, flexible neck.  Spend the extra money for this model.",5.0
"My mother bought one of these lights for herself and one for me.  I just ordered one for my grandson a couple of weeks ago and he loves it as much as my mother and I do.  We love that they use 'regular' type batteries...no special trip to the store.  I always buy rechargeable batteries and I always have the batteries for this charged and waiting to be replaced as a result.  In two years I have only had to swap batteries once or twice.  Strong, stable clip.  Great product!",5.0
This is a great light.  Very compact and lightweight.  It is extremely bright.  I really like that it runs on AAA batteries that are cheap to buy.,5.0
"Easy to position and clamp on your book.  Illuminates well.
Save yourself time / energy to turn on / off a bedroom light and only illuminate your book.
Battery lasts a long time.",5.0
"It works so so well.  I'm so amazed by it because I've bought so many book lights but this one is by far my favorite just because you don't have to keep twisting and turning the light. It lights up both pages at the same time, well worth the money.",5.0
"Great light, wish the base were a little smaller/sleek, but for the price and brightness, it's super!",5.0
"awesome, so dank, so worth it,,, many uses -works great for bed side table light too",5.0
Great purchase.  Exactly what I needed,5.0

works exactly as advertised.,5.0
"On my second one after breaking the first (my fault, yanked the head off).",5.0
"This was the remedy for not waking up my dog while reading during his sleeping time.  The light is tiny, ergonomic, inexpensive and it really lights up the page.  It connects well to an unusually shaped headboard.  The neck of the light is extremely flexible.  So far, so good.",5.0
"These are wonderful lamps. They are a nice green. Nice gifts for people who are visiting, particularly as places where guests may sleep our house do not always have good lighting for in-bed reading.  These are wonderful.  The color of the light is good.  Not too blue or too yellow.  They are very durable.  I take one traveling.  In case of a power failure, you can even put on a baseball cap and clip it on the cap.  Because it has an l.e.d., the batteries last a long time.  Uses 3 AAA batteries, cheap and easy to find.",5.0
The best!,5.0
This is my third Xtraflex Book Light.  I use one in my office when i want to use my printer at night.  It's in a dark corner and the led screen is hard to read.  I use the 2nd one every night with my Kindle or with a hard cover or paperback book.  It doesn't disturb my husband for me to read in bed.  I bought this 3rd one for travel because I'd be lost if I forgot and left my book light when I visit my mom or the Grands.  Now I always have one to leave at home.,5.0
"Bought this for son to read books in his bedroom.  Works great and batteries last long time.  Great purchase, and have already bought another.  Will buy again",5.0
"I read in bed with my kids before they sleep, so I have these clipped onto their bunk bed rail. The brightness is perfect and the batteries seem to last forever. I bought them as gifts for my whole family. Better light than a lamp because you can point it right at the book.",5.0
Have been through many book lights!!!  This is my favorite. So much so that when my dog ate my last one I didn't even shop around just bought another. And I do so like to shop around!! I love the swivel that never breaks no matter how i beat it up. I love the high and low. The brightness is unbeatable. The ease of use. On and off is quick and changing the batteries is very simple easy and not necessary  every 30 minutes!!  I usually get about 9 months out of the batteries. Oh and regular double As!!!  Yay!!  Good product.,5.0
"Best book light I have ever owned! Flexible, bright, and clips to book very well! I'm sure this product will hold up very well over time",5.0
Long battery life. 2 modes; Very bright and very very bright.,5.0
Good book light.,5.0
I bought this for my kindle e-reader so that I could read at night.  I didn't realize how dark the regular kindle was.  This is awesome.  Clips on securely.  It does glare a bit on the screen but you can easily adjust it.  It has a low or a high setting.,5.0
"This is the best light, it lasts a long time before I have to replace the batteries.  In fact I have only had to replace them 1x since I bought it and I read with it every night!",5.0
"I cant say enough about this book light. It moves in every direction you need, its light and the different controls for light is great! I will never buy another brand again!!",5.0
"This is a fantastic reading light. It has two different brightness levels, the dimmer brightness is plenty for me to see my book at night in bed. It is also stiff enough to stay where you want it, but flexible enough to move when you want it to. I very much like this light and if it were to ever break, I would buy it again.",5.0
This is the 3rd one of these that I have bought for the family.  We all love them.  Highly recommend them.,5.0
"This tiny thing emits so much light with just one bulb, let alone both that it equips. But bending it just right will keep the light to only your book or reading material instead of lighting the whole room (which it could easily do, goodbye flashlights and spare batteries).",5.0
"This book light is awesome. The light is bright, and bends to adjust to any position. I have since ordered two more for family members, I am so pleased with this product.",5.0
"Wow this is bright, and has multiple uses! I started reading at night to help me get sleepy for bed. I couldn't keep using my bedside lamp because it put out to much light and would keep my wife up. The fix was to buy a decent book light and this is more than decent. It is bright, consumes very little power, and has uses outside of reading books. The obvious use is for reading but if you are a handyman type, any time you are working on electrical wiring, it can be clipped to the edge of an outlet box, hole in the drywall, to your shirt, etc. This has come in handy more than once. Highly Recommend!",5.0
This little light is SUPER bright!  I keep it in the living room under my coffee table when I need a little extra light while doing my nails or reading something really small.  I love the clip-on part too and you can bend the neck just about any way you want.,5.0
"Only have this light a few days,  but I really like it so far.  The  only other book light I have is a cheapie from Walmart.  While that light got me
thru the loss of power during Hurricane Sandy,  it doesn't illuminate nearly as well as this one.  The two settings are a nice touch,  I've only
found it necessary to use the lower setting up to this point.  Good for books, and for the Kindle. Five stars.",5.0
Works great! I would buy a 2nd if I needed another one.  Thanks!,5.0
Great light.  Brighter than my other book lights,5.0
"Clip the bulky part on the outside of your book, and bend the neck into whatever position gives you the best light, and click on the 2-light or 1-light level of brightness and enjoy your read. It's not fragile, and the LED lights will make the batteries last a long time.  Far and away the best reading light I've ever owned.",5.0
Have ordered previously.  Work as we need them to work.,5.0
Perfect for night time reading. It has two settings for brightness and it's not too bright that it would bother the person sleeping next to you. The clip attaches perfectly to the book as well.,5.0
"Product arrived quickly (as usual, it arrived before the estimated date of arrival). This is the 2nd of these clip-on lights that I have purchased. It's very bright, and diffuses the light over the entire magazine or book page, avoiding a glare or spotlight look. I like that the light permits you to turn off 1 of the 2 LED bulbs, which is helpful when you do not need much light. I use this as a flashlight, too, probably because it is always at my bedside and is the first flashlight I can grab. It is not too heavy for a softcover book or magazine, although it has some mass, so you need to position it near the spine (as opposed to the far left or right).",5.0
"I bought this book light not too long ago for college because my roommate sleeps way earlier than me and I like to read in bed. It's my first ever book light so I really like it and think it's really useful! I get so excited to read at night just because I can! haha. But.. the color turned out to be a blueish-green color. I'm really into green so I was sort of disappointed when I got that color but it's okay because it works great! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS! It has two different adjustments, the first click is super bright then the second one is a bit dimmer but perfect.",5.0
"Excellent light!  It has two settings, and is bright with just one light on.  It bends back far enough to not obstruct your view of your book or Kindle.  It's also light weight- very light weight.  Batteries included.  I was very surprised at how bright it is.  It's worth every penny.",5.0
This is perfect for a child who has a bunk bed. My son clip the light on above him which gives him substantial light to read. The LED light is very bright so there is  no need to strain your eyes.,5.0
"Love this light.  Ordered 3 of them for reading at night in our dark cabin that has no electricity at night.  These lights have made all the difference for us.  Even with one bulb on there is enough light to read.  We clipped one in the shower and the clip is nice and wide.  The light comes with batteries included...which is a plus.  The color is not the green it shows, but we didn't care what color it came in.  The color is more like a metallic teal.  We are very happy with this purchase!",5.0
"LOVE IT !!! LOVE IT!!!!  After many many years of rejects, this is the best light Ive ever used.  It is light so your hands don't tire from holding while attached to the book.  It clips nicely and the lighting is perfect.  The neck swivels easily... so when I want to jump out of bed for that extra snack, I can light the room to avoid bonking into furniture upon my return... all without disturbing my sleeping hubbie next to me.  HE LOVES IT because the book light doesn't disturb him while I'm reading.  I also use it while traveling to light up the room for my little ones...  clips to anything so I can change a diaper without waking the rest of the people sleeping in the room or tent!  Although I don't leave it on all night, I do leave it on for a while for the little ones while they are falling asleep, as a nightlight pointed at the ceiling;  No more blinding lights near face level.  LOVE IT!  Ordering a bunch for friends and family!",5.0
"This is about the brightest book light available. I keep it by my bed and use it as a flashlight, too. Be aware, though, that the actual color is not a lime green. It's more of a darker seafoam green. It's pretty, just not the same color pictured.",5.0
"I have purchased MANY booklights, and this is the BEST!
I love it!
It is SUPER bright, lights up my whole room, when positioned correctly.
I like that it has two LED bulbs in it, and you just click twice and it only uses one light, saving battery and bulb life!
I also like the foam inside the clip, helping it not to slip and slide very much!

Brilliant!
I plan to buy more as gifts!!!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",5.0
"Useful, easy to use, very bright.",5.0
Great product,5.0
Love it. I can read my book ANYWHERE and it doesn't mess up my sleep/wake cycle like staring at a phone or tablet. My new favorite gift for readers.,5.0

Awesome lamp - very small and great light.,5.0
I am using the Mighty Bright Xtraflex 2LED light for my sewing machine.  I mounted it using 2-sided velcro.  I have many lights in my sewing room but this one is THE best.  Absolutely perfect for my needs.  I have also used it as a booklight and it works perfectly.,5.0
"If you have a kindle, this can be your #1 light. As opposed to purchasing the leather protector + booklight that amazon offers for $60 (almost as much as my kindle!), I bought this light and an Acase. The light was too bulky for the Kindle by itself and felt awkward. However, combined with the Acase and using it to clip the light to, I couldn't be happier.

http://www.amazon.com/Acase-Classic-Leather-Generation-Keyboard/dp/B005S8ND9O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1338280071&sr=8-1

Got em both for around $20.

The light itself takes 3xAAA and has a very even beam, making for a pleasurable reading experience with no hotspots and 2 brightness settings. Works with NiMH rechargeable's.",5.0
Very good light. With one led you can see clearly and this one have two of them. It's so portable. Use three AAA batteries with great life time.,5.0
If you need to light up some stubbornly dark place this booklight will do the job. I've got a workstation with a dark keyboard. I couldn't see what I was typing and I was getting really frustrated hitting the wrong keys. Problem solved. This thing works like a charm. And only 12 bucks!? A heck of a deal...,5.0
"Nice bright light, sturdy strong grip, and a flexible neck that moves as you want it to.  Not really much else you can want from a book light.",5.0
This light is wonderful. It can be adjusted via the flex  to light as much of the page as you want.  Yes- It lights the entire page evenly. In fact it will light both pages of an open oversized text book!  The light has two brightness levels too.,5.0
"great device; works as advertised; thanks so much! we had an older type, but it was heavy and had to be pluggedd in to AC

"I have tried many many book lights and this is the best!

Love it!  Works great and stays in place!,5.0
Love this light. Perfect for reading in bed without keeping my husband awake. It has two settings which is very helpful.,5.0
works perfect,5.0
"Great solution for my daughter's night reading needs.  Easy to operate and has dual brightness settings.  I wish the mounting clip had a bigger ""bite"" to allow mounting to larger furniture, but that's a minor complaint.",5.0
"lots of light, good price clamps on anything",5.0
"Great light.  It's bright, has two levels of brightness, and easily lights two pages of a book at once.",5.0
These little lamps are wonderful! I got one for Christmas last year and it is still going strong. I bought a few for my children as well. Great stocking stuffers.,5.0
The book light is very bright making it easy to read book in dark bedroom.  You can light one or both bulbs.  The clip on works great and the positioning is very flexible.  Selection of colors is great for matching room decor.,5.0
"This little light casts much more light than its size indicates.  Since I'm often reading late at night, I use it all the time.  It's light weight and easy to use.  I like it so much I bought one for my husband, too.",5.0
"This is a great light for reading in the dark.  The light is easy to clip on a book.  I especially like that the light focuses directly onto a book so as not to disturb others in the room who want to remain in the dark.  The light's two settings are easy to use and shine the perfect amount of light.  I am really impressed by the amount of light this product delivers.  I highly recommend it, especially for the price.",5.0
I was worried about buying something that I thought would just get broken in a few days...but these have already held up for a more than a month and appear to be very well made.  I am very satisfied that this is not a toy...but a solid little light for a reasonable price...,5.0
"This product does exactly what it needs to do.  It's a bit bulky on the base/clip, but even the smallest paperback will hold this up using multiple pages (including the back or front cover of the book).  The two light levels are great, but I'm finding that a single LED is sufficient.  It's entirely plastic and seems a bit cheap, but I can't see a more sophisticated product without adding additional weight just for cosmetics.  Good product for the money spent.",5.0
"This book light is perfect. The clip is large enough to keep it in place, it has two settings: very bright and still bright (I use this when I'm on overnight Greyhound trips as to not bother the person next to me). It takes batteries which are included.",5.0
"Just what I was looking for in a reading light!  The ""true"" light is an excellent help to my bedtime reading with aging eyes and so as to not bother my sleeping husband.  It clips on my headboard and I can direct the light in any direction.  It is indeed, a ""mighty bright"" light and I will likely order more for crafting and other desk area needs because you can focus the light right on an area of working.",5.0
Husband uses it in bed and he LOVES it.  The light is a bit bright for me while trying to sleep but hit has a low and he's able to swivel it enough away from me that it's not unbearable.  It's lightweight and doesn't interfere with him holding the book and reading.,5.0
Awesome little light!,5.0

Great product! Fast shipping!,5.0
"I like to read a bit before I go to sleep and this light really helps make things easier. I used to have a big old lamp which isn't very handy when I need to roll to my other side and read. It's got 2 lighting options and I tend to use the softer one more and the stronger one when I use my laptop. The design is chic and small, perfect for traveling, too. I also like that it can stand by itself pretty well since the bottom is flat and has a good weight - that way I can just set it next to my pillow instead of clipping it to my book. Been using it for over a week and I'm very happy with it. Hopefully the quality will last for a long time!",5.0
Great product.,5.0
"Great little lite, works well on a book or any work area that needs a little light.  Has Hi/Low switch and strong clamp that attaches securely.",5.0
"Haven't used it much yet, but seems to be well made and very convenient to have around! Folds up well for travel.",5.0
"I purchased this product as a gift for the wife after she purchased some cheap book light from a local store. The reviews on Amazon are spot on and my wife is very happy with the product.

The color of the light itself is white.

If you have a night lamp next to your bed for reading, you can clip the Mighty Bright to it and the light is bright enough to read from a 2 foot distance. We are now considering purchasing several of these lights as safety lights for our children when the power goes out.

A good soild product so far and worth the few bucks I paid for it.",5.0
"This light is nicely bright, and holds its position. Its being cordless is a big plus. Altogether, I am very happy with it.",5.0

Good design. Simple. Bright. Good clip.,5.0
I use this book lamp every night.  Love i!,5.0
"Ultimate work light. 2 LED's + the clip-on feature w/ a very stable base. Helpful all around the house with un-lit closets/cupboards, behind large appliances, downlight in the kitchen, working on cars. Felt pad on the clip means no marring. Head points anywhere. I don't give out 5 stars often.",5.0
"I can't tell you how many book lights I've bought over the years, but this one illuminates over a wider area than any of them.  No fumbling with positioning so far.  My only concern was the battery enclosure, which seemed big in the pictures, but is acceptable in size in my opinion.  One should contrast that to its use of 3 AAA batteries instead of those of the button type.  Cheaper to replace or recharge and easier to install.",5.0
"This is a great reading light.  It is very bright, clips easily to the book.",5.0
I love this little light. It's just what I needed.,5.0
"This is the first book light I've ever purchased.  I am impressed at the amount of light it gives off, and that you can have in on bright or dimmer.  The dimmer light gives off plenty for me to read in the dark.  The clip easily fits on my paper-back book, and I can flip pages by tugging if from under the clip & it doesn't rip the paper.  The adjustable neck is nice...can move to light up entire book, or just one page.  Seems to be a quality product so far.",5.0
"I bought one of these for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas 2008 and she loves it.  Then my 8 year old daughter wanted one so I got her one this Christmas.  I even bought one for my mom and myself!  We travel alot and this is just the best booklight.  Clip it to your book and you're not disturbing anyone else with a big bright light.  And of course the price was right, too :)",5.0
Got this for my wife and she loves it. It attaches securely to her books and puts out a bright light that covers both pages.,5.0
overnighted it and i'm tellin you it was just overnight. fast...product is very good works great...,5.0
"Don't let this little light fool you. It definitely does what it is suppose to do. It's small but a very nice bright light. Perfect for attaching to a book/magazine and won't keep your partner up. It's very bendable and is easy to shape. The price is just right, won't break the bank.",5.0
"This is great. I got it for reading in the car while we are on the road. The car's overhead light bothers my husband while he's driving so I went on the search for a reading light.
I looked at a lot of different lights online and their reviews. I saw the most positive reviews on the Mighty Bright Xtraflex2 lights. I don't think I found any complaints at all.
It came in really handy the other evening when we lost our electricity. My husband ended up using it before the night was over and now he wants one too. So I just ordered another one.
I really like that the batteries last sooo long. It has two brightness options. I often use the second click so it's not as bright when I'm in the car so there won't be too much light.",5.0
"Super bright light, use it at night to read stuff for school while my boyfriend sleeps. It has two light bulbs and lights up both pages very well.",5.0

"I got this from my daughter rides to school in the backseat in the dark for about 20 miles. She likes to read on the way but the inside domelight is distracting to the driver. This item should work well as it is bright and with the LED lights and three AAA batteries, it should last a good long time between battery changes.",5.0

Great light I am satisfied with it recommend it to any one who needs a little light in the dark for reading.,5.0
"I purchased this light to use on my baby changing table during the night.  It works GREAT and we don't have to turn any other lights on.  The batteries have lasted so far, and we use the light EVERY day...several times.

This is the best booklight I've ever used. I recommend this to anyone who wants a bright and affordable booklight for your reading,5.0
"I have been looking for a good book light for ages.  Most are either too heavy, not flexible enough, or energy hogs.  This light appears to solve all these problems.  Even on the lower setting it is still bright enough to read by.  Using 3 AAA batteries, it is still light enough to clip onto a paperback without the side of the book flopping over under the weight.  I haven't had it for too long, but it seems sturdy for what it is.",5.0
I bought this light to take on vacation with me to read my kindle.  First it travels well.  It made it through my travels no problem.  My only worry was it getting turned on accidentally in my carry on and draining the battery.  With easy to replace AAA batteries I didn't let it get to me.  I found my Mighty Bright easy to use.  I was able to clip it onto my kindles' cover and adjust the light into a position that worked best.  I really like the two stage light brightness.  I find myself using it at home and saving on electric light when I'm the only one in the room and don't need the whole room lit up to read.  I've never been a fan of these little lights but this one won me over.,5.0
"I love this item.  I originally purchased it to use with my Kindle (which I love by the way).  I have been the major caregiver to a family member in hospice care in my home.  This light made it very easy to read in low or no light situations while not disturbing the person sleeping in the same room.  It gave enough light to read comfortably, yet not enough to light the entire room.  This product was perfect for the intended use.  In fact I liked it so much I purchased another one to use with paperbacks, and when I showed it to my Mom she borrowed it to take on vacation with her so she could read in the hotel room in bed and not disturb my Dad.  She loved it so much I bought her one too!  The flexible crook neck is perfect for changing the angle of the light so you never have to worry about a glare.  Can't praise it enough - everybody should have one (or two??)!",5.0
"The XtraFlex2 LED book light is light years (no pun intended) better than the old itty-bitty-type lights that used incandescent bulbs.

The XtraFlex2 gets great battery life, unlike the the itty-bittys, which I found went through batteries like crazy. Of course, the LED ""bulbs"" don't burn out like the itty-bitty blubs (and the XtraFlex2 doesn't heat up from its bulbs, either). The XtraFlex2's integrated battery pack is also great; no getting tangled up in a cord while you're in bed.

I stumbled on the XtraFlex2 at my local Borders. They had a bunch of them in a display when the final Harry Potter book was published (presumably figuring that a lot of kids, little and big, were going to be doing a lot of reading in bed...). The leftovers were sold at half price, a real bargain. I bought one, tried it out, loved it, and went back to buy several more for use as gifts (and spares).

"Nice and bright, stays where you put it. The gooseneck is just right, it is about 7"" long. I would describe the light emitted as white or blue, not in the warm range.",5.0
These are great for reading.  Nice and bright!,5.0
I just used this last night.  So much better than the other one I was using.  I love the choice is two type of brightness.  I am buying another one for my husband,5.0
I purchased this for my grandson's 10th birthday and he absolutely loves it.  He reads every night before he goes to sleep and now he doesn't have to get up and turn off his overhead light.  He is thrilled that it is lightweight and clips on to paperback books.  This is a real winner!,5.0
Great light. Works as advertised. Can't go wrong with the price,5.0
Works for reading and to place on my laptop.,5.0
Just what we were looking for.  My son can read before bed each night without all his lights on.  He also uses it as a nightlight at times.,5.0
"This light works very well. It is sturdy and casts a bright (almost too bright) light so that I may read when my husband is asleep.  It adjusts easily up and down and side to side. The clip holds on very well. I've only used it with hard-cover books. It could be a little heavy for paperbacks, I'm guessing.",5.0
"My mom and I have a bunch of these and so far none of them have died. It's been a couple years, although they don't go through daily use.",5.0
works great,5.0

This light snaps on to any book size I have tried it on so far. I love it and use it for a lot of different things. It has 2 settings that make it very handy and it doesn't upset my husband when I read in bed anymore.,5.0
Got this for my mom and she loves it!,5.0
Nice light.  Just what I wanted for reading in bed.,5.0
great,5.0
"I had one of these before, and it got lost when I moved (or maybe it is still in a box somewhere?).  I'm really happy to have the replacement.  The ""neck"" holds its shape, and the clip opens wide enough to grab on to things other than a book.  The light is bright, but has a blue cast to it, so it is not blindingly bright in the darkness.",5.0
"Works great in a dark corner.  Any place you need a little extra light it works great. I use it for my computer keyboard when I need xtra light.
Great little light. Has two settings for bright and brighter!",5.0
Works well.,5.0
Good quality.  Strong clip.  Bright light.  Can set on table top without clipping to anything.,5.0
"Very powerful but not overwhelming.  I bought this book lamp before a camping trip and it doubled as a great flashlight.  Easy to use, illuminates book well, easy to adjust, good quality.",5.0
I love the features that this light has! The neck is very flexible and can bend in any direction. There is a switch to use two bulbs or one bulb so you can decide how bright you need the light to be at that moment. And finally I love that it uses AAA batteries! A lot of lights use the coins shaped batteries and they are a nuisance to replace. This is the perfect book light.,5.0
Simple and inexpensive and seems to be good quality.  Wouldn't mind if the dimmest setting were even more dim but otherwise I'm happy with this purchase.,5.0
"Works great, light on your book depending on size and good battery life.",5.0

Father's Day gift for my husband. He loves it when he's resting with our young daughter.,5.0
"My husband hasn't woke up, not one time, since I got this light. It's allowed me to read until I want to stop and go to sleep. That's exactly what I needed.",5.0
I bought this years ago and it's still going strong!,5.0
"I was looking for a small, low-cost led light with very bright white light that is energy efficient and doesn't give off much heat, to use as a terrarium light / supplemental light for my air plants (tillandsias). I came across this one by the ""Mighty Bright"" brand, and having had a previous book light by that same brand which I liked, I thought this light would suit my purpose.

It has two bright white LEDs, of which the click-style button on the light head can have both on (super bright), one on (less bright), or all off. The gooseneck head can be bent and adjusted to suit the user's needs. The clip can accommodate thickness of aprox. 1/2 inch - 1 inch, give or take, but I just stood it on its flat base like a lamp. User can choose to power the light with the included 3x AAA batteries, or purchase separately the proprietary AC adapter by the same ""Mighty Bright"" brand. In my case, I did buy the proprietary AC adapter because I didn't want to use batteries. The color of the plastic base and head is more of a teal color, not exactly blue, but I prefer the teal color. The emitted light from the LEDs is a bright steady white.

So far so good, my air plant terrarium looks great with this light; picture provided is with the brightest setting (both LEDs on).",5.0
"Excellent.
I stumble around trying NOT to wake my husband- I was using a goofy flashlight before I bought this!
I like the two brightness settings. I am very happy with this purchase.",5.0
Definitely one of the best lights I have ever purchased.,5.0
"Love this little light for reading in bed, in the car, and on camping trips.",5.0
"This is a great light! It fits on my old kindle keyboard so I can read at night without bothering my husband, but is versatile enough to also work for any other size book I might be reading. Has 2 lights in it so you can make it brighter or a little dimmer if you want. I usually only use the 1 light, it's bright enough for me. Highly recommend.",5.0
Amazing light for reading when it's dark. Love that it holds onto the page to hold your place.,5.0
Great light. Perfect to read at bed.,5.0
Great lamp. Exactly what we needed.,5.0
"This is a great book light. I love it! I've had it for a while now, and use it all the time while working on my laptop computer. It does seem to go through batteries fast, but that is not a deterrent for me. I really don't know how I got along without it! The only thing I would suggest to improve this, is to put some horizontal grooves on the front part of the clip so that it doesn't slip out of your fingers. Other than that, great product! I would highly recommend!",5.0
Bright little light!,5.0
"This booklight, among the many booklights I've ordered, is the best of the lot. So many were inferior that I'm almost reluctant to shower this one with praise simply because it works the way it's supposed to. Am I supposed to swoon with joy because it doesn't fall apart the third week that I use it? This booklight is the only one you should consider purchasing. To try any other is folly.",5.0
I really like this.  Its small and convenient with a bright light.,5.0
Love it! Finally found a light that's bright and dims so you won't stand out too much to distract another in the dark while reading. It's a nice sizable reading light so definitely worth buying! :),5.0

As the reviews I used to determine which light to buy said it has great over the page lighting. Very happy with my choice,5.0
The first decent book light I have been able to find. Diffusion lens makes all the difference in the world- full page coverage with no hot spots. Good quality too. Get black!  My silver one reflects back a little too much light.,5.0
Let there be light!  Works great for night reading.,5.0
Great light at a good price. It has two settings bright and brighter. The lower setting seems to be fine for me and will probably save on battery life.  The clip is heavy duty and holds the light steady,5.0

Playing Bloodborne late at night..I can't read my beautiful limited edition strategy guide at night. This thing is my weewee now.,5.0
Wife is using it nightly as a Night Light to nurse our newborn son without being too distracting. Just point toward floor! Fantastic and Easy to Use! First set of batteries lasted a very long time too which is a bonus. Doesn't get hot even when on all night. Purchased the adaptor to save on batteries,5.0
"sturdy, bright.",5.0
"This light has two brightness settings, and I use it primarily to work on my art in the evenings when laying in bed or when the fam is watching TV and they want the lights kept low. Battery life hasn't been a problem so far, and the flexible arm is terrific, in that I can position the light exactly where I need it for drawing. The only flaw in the slaw is that the clip handle is a bit on the slippery side, and it's easy to lose your grip when you're attaching it to (or removing it from) the pad. That's easy to fix with some tape or other grip-enhancing add-on, but I haven't bothered yet.",5.0
"I use this for reading outside in the summer.  Great little light and doesn't seem to draw the bugs.  I did have tiki torches burning, so that could have helped.  But overall really pleased with this light.",5.0
"my wife uses every night to read in bed! very bright but concentrated so not to bother me! however, the adapter sux; wire keeps breaking",5.0
A perfect little light. It's so small yet transmits enough light to read and not disturb others.  A great buy for the money.,5.0
"This works great, clamp is strong and holds it's position well.  My only complaint would be that it is TOO bright, even on the lower setting for the wife in bed next to me.",5.0
"As an avid reader, this is a great little gadget for power outages.",5.0
"Very simply, bright, and since it's LED the batteries last a long time - I have yet to replace them a couple months after purchase.",5.0
A little on the bulky side but the light has more than one brightness and it can almost be bright enough to use as a lamp.,5.0
Terrific light. I have used several reading lights and they either fall off the book or do not stay in place when bent to perfect position. Not so with this one. I highly recommend to all readers.,5.0

My daughter uses this in her little reading nook and for reading in bed when she's supposed to be going to sleep.  We love that it has two brightness settings.  She has used it a lot for the past 3 years and it's just now starting to show some signs on wear on the bendy arm.  Definitely a good purchase.,5.0
The item was as described and delivered in a timely manner.,5.0
"Light intensity is exactly enough to read without waking the wife or dogs up, and the option to use one or both LEDs is nice too.  The clip part is a bit heavy; it holds 3 AAA batteries, which is (shockingly, I know) exactly what it feels like it weighs.  If you clip it to a paperback it may need some support to hold it up but I haven't found this to be an issue so far.",5.0

"Bought it for books but my son uses it to help Daddy work on cars, to build with Legos, and to look behind the couch for lost toys. When he needs a light, this is his go to. The long, flexible neck makes it fun. The light is brighter than expected (in a good way).",5.0
I have the 4th generation Kindle with the E-Ink display so it looks just like a real book. This book light is perfect because it allows me to read at night without disturbing my partner. It has two light options and the dimmer option is bright enough to be more than sufficient (the brighter option is blinding lol). I will usually switch to the brighter option when the light goes dim from low battery. I used to keep this with my Kindle in my purse but it rolls around and will accidentally click on unbeknownst to me which uses up the battery so now I just keep it at home.,5.0
Works great for late night private reading without disturbing others.,5.0
I always love this product.,5.0
Great light bright and covets a wide span of the book,5.0
"Excellent little lamp for my book. I love it! now I can read until late at night without bothering my husband with the light. He really appreciates this new light and me too!!! It is very flexible to move around the pages and the light has 2 different intensities, for more or less light.

One thing is that the clip is kind of soft so it won't attach strongly to something thick, but it's perfect for thin objects such as the hardcover of a book. I highly recommend it.",5.0
Keeps my 9 year old daughter from driving me nuts all night when she reads late.,5.0
"Weight:
This book light is very light in weight, but also  has a very strong clip.
Brightness:
The light has more than enough brightness to read by without binding you, or lighting up the whole room.
The Base:
The base is designed so that if you hold it one way, you can clip it to a book....and if you turn it over, the base is such that it will stand by itself without being clipped to anything.
Batteries:
I have never had a problem with this light except for the batteries. If you use this a lot, you may want to get rechargeable batteries, because this thing eats batteries bad. I guess that's just the nature of the beast.
Swivel:
The head can be turned completely around (360 degrees) in any direction, as well as up or down to suit your reading preferences.
The Switch:
The switch to turn it on or off, is on the backside of the head & is quite easy to turn the light on & off when needed, but stiff enough that it does not come on when it is not needed. I hope I said that right.
Dimensions: 12 inches long over all; the base is 2.75 inches long by 1.5 inches wide.
The flexible neck is about 7.75 inches long.
The clip is about 1.25 inches deep(the inside of the clip) & 1 inch wide.
The head(where the light is) is about 1.75 inches long by 0.75 inches wide.
The on/off  switch is on the back side of the head....it is a sliding switch NOT a pushbutton.

I have never had a problem with this & it has never let me down.
It has always shown enough light to read by & it has always been easy to operate even with my eyes closed.
I highly recommend this book light.",5.0
"These work well and are easy to operate, I am pleased with this purchase.",5.0
I bought this as a work bag light!  Works great!,5.0
I love it.  It is small enough to put in my purse or tucked in my suitcase or my backpack.

And I like the fact that it has two levels of lighting.,5.0
Excellent condition and is perfect for my reading needs.,5.0

We have had this light for 3 1/2 years and have never had any issues with it. My husband reads when he gets into bed which is much later than when I do due to his work hours. The bedside lamp was always waking me up. I got him this as a gift - more for me than for him to be honest. It easily clips to his book and is plenty bright enough to read by but not bright enough to bother me. The light is on an adjustable 'pole' which makes it easy to change positions. He loves it. So do I.,5.0

"I received this book light as a Christmas gift from my husband. I LOVE IT! A million times better than the book lights I had as a kid. It has two options for brightness, and lights up a fairly large area so I usually don't have to move around the light much. It swivels easily, but isn't cheap or flimsy. My toddler likes to play with it and it's held up well to the abuse. Most of all, it makes for a better marriage - I like the ritual of my husband and I going to bed at the same time, but as an early riser, he falls asleep right away and this night owl can stay up reading without the light disturbing him!",5.0

"This is the most durable light I have ever come across. I bought a few of these to use as auxiliary lighting in areas of my home, like a desk or bookshelf. I took one of the lamps outside near my hot tub one night so I could have lighting while I was applying the chemicals. I accidentally left the light attached to the hot tub and it has been there for over a year. Through rain, extreme heat, extreme cold, blizzards, ice storms, and soaking hands from the hot tub. This little light has not failed yet. It is still as bright as the day it arrived even though it's gone through one heck of a beating.

My wife and I cannot believe the durability of a $10 light. This is not just your ordinary book lamp, this is the apocalypse light. I would absolutely take this thing camping, clip it to a BBQ, etc.. Hands down one of the best bang for your buck purchases I've made on Amazon.",5.0
"This is the third or fourth book light I have purchased this year and it's going to be the last.  None of the others were ever bright enough or easy to turn on (many had those turn & click buttons that can be stingy).  I love this lamp!  It's perfectly bright enough for me to read in bed without being as blinding as a full lamp.  10/10, would recommend.",5.0
It's great! It produces light evenly over your book.  No adjusting necessary.,5.0

"Just got this book light and it works very wells. First, it has two levels of light depending on how much you need. Also I attach it to my laptop for some late night studying. It fits great to my paperback books and the 1/4 inch wire bends in any direction so you can direct the light exactly where you want it. I really was thinking of buying the cheaper $5 light but you get what you pay for. Lastly, this comes with 3 AAA batteries to get you started so you can use it upon arrival.  This was worth every penny especially for me because at night is the only time I can catch up on reading. All the positive reviews about this product are well deserved.",5.0

best book light I have used - extraordinarily bright and easily attached.,5.0
"Perfect for my oldest daughter to use on the top bunk at night without waking her sister. The batteries have lasted much longer than I expected. Overall this is a great reading lamp. Buying another for myself so my regular lamp won't keep my husband up at night anymore.

Update: this is used daily and the batteries still haven't died. Great buy!",5.0
Awesome Light!,5.0
"Clips & Stays on desk, keyboard drawer, side of laptop.  PERFERCT amount of light to see your keyboard.  I bought more, even though LED's last forever, I wanted to have one to keep at work & one for at home.",5.0
"I needed these for the judges at a one act play contest.  I always bring my own when I judge, but I felt I had to be safe.",5.0
"This thing is great! I don't normally use book lights because I don't like them, but I tried it one night and now I'm using it regularly. The light is evenly distirbuted, and just wide enough to cover both pages of a hardback book, and the gooseneck stays where I put it. It's not heavy enough to cause problems.

I wish it had a third ""extra dim"" setting.

If you need a book light, this is a good one.",5.0

great little light,5.0
"I've reviewed this before but it's time to add more cents. I bought the purple version of this little thing and I'm back two years later to buy the blue. This is a great product. The only reason I'm buying a second one is because I like to use an AC adapter and get annoyed moving it around the house. I work on the couch doing needlwork with it and read at night in bed with it. So I've decided having two is a better way to handle things. I've tried a lot of book lights, this is the only one that hasn't failed within weeks, actually puts out a decent pool of light and yet doesn't blind my husband when he's trying to sleep, and gets a pretty good grip on whatever I need it to grip. I clip it to my lamp for reading and another lamp in the den for stitching. Yes, I do have rather odd-shaped lamps, admittedly. Oh, and the flexible neck actually stays where I want it instead of springing back into some predetermined factory position. Yup. Love this little critter. I'd probably put 'em all over the house for various purposes (light up my coffee grinder) if my husband didn't think I was going a bit overboard.",5.0
"Great reading light!!  I liked it so much, I bought one for my husband, and he loves it too!",5.0
Great light!,5.0
Excellent light for reading a book in the dark. I love the option of low/high and it's very well made too. You have to clip it on a substantial part of the book. If you clip it to just to the back of the paper back it will be too heavy. Will be giving as gifts. So happy I purchased it.,5.0
"Works great. Light is broad enough to light up both pages at once. Very flexible neck, easy to adjust.",5.0
"It's very useful, especially when you do a lot of studying and reading as well. Overall, I am quite pleased using this product.",5.0
"Bright book light.  Takes regular batteries, which is a plus.  I have ordered two of these.  Happy with both.",5.0
"I love this thing for reading at night. The two brightness settings are quite good. In my experience even the lower setting is enough to illuminate a smaller paperback novel so it can be easily read.

I clip the light to a number of pages as well as a cover and that seems to keep it where I want, and the flexible neck means the light goes right where you need it.",5.0
as expected. Nice little light. Clip works when clipped to the front or back cover of a paperback. Nice neck allows for turning of the light to see what you need to.,5.0
"I would call it utterly perfect if it was even more bright,  but anyway, am very happy about the product.  It is not heavy at all and you can adjust the direction of the light easily.",5.0

"Works great, has two lights for two different brightness options.",5.0
"My six year old loves this thing.  He has it clipped onto his bed frame and uses it for night time reading.  It's plenty bright enough on the low setting, but has a high setting as well.  The battery life seems good so far.  It runs on three AAA batteries and it's been going strong for weeks.",5.0

Great product.,5.0
"But wait, I gave it 5 stars????? This product has been keeping my sleep away from me because now I can read and not have to sit at a weird angle to hide my eyes from the fan lights. It's allowed me tp stay up past 2am finishing the books I desire to read and is hazardous to your sleep!!!! It's two settings are perfect and the neck is adjustable.... it also holds nicely on paperbacks and doesn't bend them the way some of the others do. DAMN YOU!!!!! YOU AMAZING BOOK LAMP! I WILL FOREVER BE IN LACK OF SLEEP BECAUSE OF YOU!!!!",5.0
works great,5.0
"*** Update after a couple days use ***

Over the last couple days I have used this light almost nonstop. I've just changed the battery for a second time since originally getting the light. Thankfully, I have rechargable AAA batteries. The second battery I put in after the original battery that came in the box might not have been fully charged, however. What tends to happen is, the light gets faint after a while and makes things harder to read once you get partway down the page. A simple change of battery fixes the entire thing though and I'll be smart to keep a AAA battery fully charged at all times now!

*** Original Review ***

I received my book light today. I have previously been using a free book light that my mother gave me because I just finally picked up reading again after years! I was having to point her cheap book light directly at the paragraph I was reading in order to read it. It was getting horrifically annoying! I can't just turn the lights on because I share a room with my 10 month old daughter.

Onto this light. I got it today and already used it during her naps (where we have the blackout curtains pulled so it's almost as dark as night) and it's great! The clip is just right for strength and the light is bright enough that I can read both pages with ease without having to turn the lamp at all. It is not TOO bright though like I've seen complaints about with other lamps. The neck also holds it in place very well. No leaning or slowly falling down. This is a winner in my book, no pun intended.",5.0
Great product. Uses AAA batteries. Much brighter and sturdier than the cheaper alternatives.,5.0
This is a a great little versatile book light. Actually it is just a a great little light to have around. The price is unbeatable!,5.0

"LOVE IT!! Two settings of lighting.  Makes night reading in bed so hassle free.  I use to hold a little flashlight that gave me cramps and did not allow me to be as comfortable as I would like to be.

Great product, very happy with this purchase.",5.0
"I have gone through a few book lights, this is the only one that I really love! The clip is big enough so you can clip it to a good section of pages, even with a softcover so that it doesn't flop all over the place. The bendy part is long enough to put in any position to make reading easier in the dark. I also love that it has two settings, sometimes the brightest one is too bright for me.",5.0
"Awesome little wonder. Have two light modes, one very bright and the other bright enough to read books and immerse into the fictional world of books. Loving it.",5.0
"Bright, beautiful and clear light...just what is needed on an airline flight where everyone else is trying to sleep.  These lights are super and you won't want to be without them for just everyday reading.  Oh, one thing more, they are light weight so it doesn't feel like you are having to hold up a weight when it is clipped onto your book.  Good value too.",5.0
Will order again. This is the BEST booklight I have ever owned.,5.0

"I didn't buy this to read books. I have two of them, and attach them to the handlebars of my 2015 Harley-Davidson Trike (a three-wheel motorcycle).  HD doesn't make a lighted button set for this bike and a number of others.  So far, it has performed wonderfully. The long gooseneck is the real feature for my use, as is the easily changeable AAA battery. I haven't experienced any of the 'flickering' or other problems previously written about.  Those comments are months old and it may well be that the vendor has an updated version. That said, I'm Okay with mine and will keep Alcon posted if I have any problems with them.",5.0
"very nice, extremely handy quick ship",5.0
"We bought this light to attach to our baby's changing table so we could change her in the middle of the night without turning on the overhead light.  It works great for not only that, but we've also used it to clip onto her crib while we cut her nails (helps to see those teeny tiny fingers and toes) and for, you know, reading to her at night.",5.0
Very nice for reading. It is bright without being too strong and reflecting in your eyes.,5.0
"Love my book light!!! Works great while reading at night. Sturdy, and provides adequate lighting.",5.0
"These lights are great - we use them on music stands with our band, and I use one to read in bed without disturbing my wife.

One thing to keep in mind - don't wait too long to change batteries, or use rechargeables; the wires connecting the battery pack to the electronics are extremely fine, and it doesn't take much leakage from old batteries to render the light useless.",5.0
Works good. Quite bright for its size. Have mined clipped to the headboard for nighttime reading. Haven't used enough yet to comment on battery life or long-term reliability.,5.0
This has been great for reading in bed.  The clip grips really well and I like that it can be bright or dim.,5.0

"This Light is outstanding for reading in low light situations.  The wife reads a lot and there are times when she wants to read, but I need to be in bed to get to work the next day.  This light has two intensity settings and the great thing is that it takes two AAA batteries, which is awesome.  Many of these lights take the lithium batteries and they are so expensive to replace.  This is hands down one of the best lights she has ever used.  I am going to get an additional one for myself.",5.0
i bought this so that I could use it on my daughters changing table in the middle of the night. It works perfectly and clamps right on to the back side of her changing table. The arch is just enough and not too much. The light has two options bright and brighter which I thought was great.,5.0
perfect,5.0
I love it it's good for other books too.,5.0
"Awesome book light. Lights up a big area of whatever I'm reading even on the lower setting.

Update 07/22/2015: Added a star to make it 5 stars. Light is still going strong. I use it like a little lamp by my bed when I need some illumination while I'm on my laptop or when reading. I clip it right onto my bed's head board. Makes it easier to handle a book than clipping it onto a book!",5.0
Love it!  Easy to use and bright.  Does the job!,5.0

Works very easy and well. Clips on books easily.,5.0
"Was skeptical about this.  I go to bed later than the lady, and have always read before bed.  THIS.IS.AWESOME.  The range of light is absolutely perfect to where you can see everything in perfect light, but the radius of light makes it to where you can literally be in the same bed an hardly notice.

Paperback, hard cover, doesn't matter...the clip works impeccably.  I've had it attached to my book in a carry-on while travelling, and through all of the bustling around during travel, the clip doesn't budge!",5.0

"Adjustable ,great lighting options just what I needed",5.0
"Lightweight, nice illumination, clips easily. There are two levels of illumination, depending on whether you have one or both light on. For travel, I would recommend removing the batteries as depending on what it's packed with, the could easily get turned on. The manufacturer recommends this anyway, presumably to avoid old batteries damaging the device.",5.0
Third one I have bought. I really like the amount of light they give off.,5.0

If it didn't have the less bright (one bulb) option, I might have complained about it being too bright, but I am satisfied.  I was concerned about the glare at first, but thanks to the flexible arm, I just push the light to the side and the glare is no longer an issue.",5.0
"Use this all the time to read in bed. It clips comfortably to a book, doesn't bother my hubby, and provides good light for reading (2 settings.)

Was only slightly hesitant when purchasing based on some reviews regarding flimsy head of light, and I guess I can feel what they mean, hopefully it doesn't happy to mine. Has 2 levels of brightness and comes with batteries. I'm not sure why I was expecting black color when clearly the picture shows a teal/turquoise;  none the less, very pretty. Very happy. Would recommend, and even if it becomes flimsy I would buy product again.",5.0

"I do a lot of writing late at night, and I don't want to have the regular lights on.  I had a little clip-on light on my laptop computer screen that I had purchased at the local grocery store stationery section. It was better than nothing, but the light was very low, and the light did not extend across my keyboard leaving me to squint and guess when looking for keys on the sides.  The Mighty Bright arrived today, and I was excited to try it.  Wow!  My keyboard now has good light all across it, and the light even extends down over my touch pad.  I like the fact that it uses AAA batteries, as they are easy to find practically anywhere, unlike the little round batteries.  I will be looking to see how long the light will work.  The push button on/off switch allows you to use either one or both of the lights.  I'm happy to find that even with only one light on, I can still see the whole keyboard very clearly, and gives more than sufficient light which should extend the battery life.  The goose-neck is longer than other lights, and flexes into any position one could want.  I love this light!",5.0
Great little light for reading in spaces where others don't want bright light.  Lightweight.,5.0
This is the best reading light in the world. I have owned most of them and this is superior in every way.,5.0

"I purchased this lamp as a simple reading lamp to allow me to read while my wife does not get a lot of ambient light and is able to fall asleep. This is a low cost simple lamp that provides enough light to be able to read without making the entire room glow.

The lamp runs LED bulbs and needs two AAA batteries to power it. There are two settings for one bulb vs two bulbs that allows you to adjust for higher light or lower light.

The lamp is some simple and light weight that I packed it and took it on the road with my for a trip.

I'm happy with the lamp and would recommend to anyone.",5.0
"Mine arrived purple, which is fine.  Adjustable for one light or two - nice.",5.0
"It is exactly what I wanted for a Book L. Very compact and the light is just focused on the book, so it doesn't bother others.",5.0
appears to be very well built. It is nothing like the cheap dollar store kind I usually buy. I like the fact that the batteries are easily replaceable.,5.0
"Love this light.  Bought it so I could read at night in bed without keeping husband awake. This light has a high and low level, the low level is bright enough so I can read and my husband can sleep.  The added bonus I found by mistake. If your lights go out because of a bad snow storm this will work great as a night light. With new batteries it lasted all night long and was bright enough so I could see to change my daughters diaper.  Thank You..",5.0
"Nice and bright, enough to read but does not illuminate the whole room. I like the fact that there are 2 bulbs so you can regulate the intensity of the light (press the switch once and it turns the first bulb on, press it twice and the second one is on so you can choose how much light you need). I clipped it on my bed frame and always use it with the AC power adaptor. Perfect to read at night.",5.0
great,5.0
Best book light ever! No complaints!,5.0
"This is a great light! The clamp is practical and sturdy, the neck holding the light is durable yet flexible and I love the two light settings and the EASE of the on/off/switch button! Very nice value. Provides lots of light!",5.0
"Fantastic booklight. I love the two settings. With one click of a button you can choose to have one or two bulbs on. I find reading in bed at night, the lowest setting is perfect but it's nice to have the option to turn on more light if necessary. It holds onto the back of the book well and no need to readjust after flipping pages. Bought this in the purplish color and it's really pretty. I think this is the best book light I have had so far. Would definitely recommend to others.",5.0
"With winter coming and it getting dark so early, got this for my older son so he could read in bed without bothering his little brother in the same room. There are 2 brightness settings. Perfect.",5.0

"Very nice! Lights up both pages, and even has two different settings",5.0
Great light. Works just as advertised. Does not appear to go through batteries too fast. I like fact that you can dim the light a little bit. It's been tossed around a few times when my toddler has gotten his hands on it and it's still going strong.,5.0
"Fantastic little lamp operating on 1 AAA batery, very light portable and bright",5.0
"I purchased two of these to use during the Christmas program at my church.  The sanctuary is completely dark, and as the narrator, I needed light to read.  I got these hoping they would do the job.  The lights are GREAT.  The other narrator and I use them, and they give us more than enough light to read our parts.  As a matter of fact, we actually put them on the lower setting.",5.0

"These are great! I've bought two allready; if you want to make them a better investment, buy the power ac that goes with it so it stays bright and you don't have to replace the batteries!",5.0
We bought this to use in the car while reading on road trips. It has good battery life and provides just the right amount of light to a reader while not disturbing the driver. It works well as a small flashlight for looking for items in the car at night if necessary. It hooks on to the book securely and it has multiple led light modes for ease of seeing.,5.0

I looked at almost every book light on Amazon and read numerous reviews. This light had the best reviews of all plus it was also tagged as being the #1 best seller - so I ordered it. I read a lot and my optician suggested a good light for night reading that lights both pages of the book I am reading and this one does just that. Every great review I read is spot on.  I love this light and actually clamp it on my large bedside lamp shade because this works best for me. It is perfect.  It is extremely well made and bends any direction with no chance of breaking - it is that strong.  There is no better as far as I am concerned.,5.0
This light is GREAT!!!!!!!!!! compact and bright the two settings are perfect for reading in light or dark rooms. Battery life is exceptional and coupled with the AC adapter it can't be beat. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for an additional light source. We are very happy with this product.,5.0
Great light and easy to use and move around.,5.0
"I have little to add to the other reviews, except to say that my daughter has used her light nearly every night for well over a year (on our 4th set of batteries), bent it in every conceivable direction, clipped it to every possible protrusion, and this little light has proven up to the task. Great product.",5.0
My wife loves this light. Great deal.,5.0

"Purchased as a gift for a 90-year-old friend. Enables her to read smaller print. Has 2 light levels. I have a similar light a friend gave me and they make an amazing difference. And, of course, the clip-on feature is great.",5.0
"Lasts for a very long time before needing replacement batteries and even holds up to our toddler's endless destruction on it (twisting, turning, etc.)",5.0
"This is an excellent product.  It attaches securely to the hard cover of my books and produces plenty of light for reading.  The illuminated area easily covers both pages, so I don't have to redirect the light as I read.  I recommend this product.",5.0
Love this light we've purchased two in blue and pink,5.0
"If you are a night-time owl and like to read a bit or do a crossword before turning off the lights (and if your spouse is a lights-out asap kind of sleeper), this is the mini light you need! It lasts forever, works faithfully, is easy to slip into a suitcase, and clips onto a night stand easily. It is not like those miserable night lights that you hook onto a page or that always topple over. This one has two light settings and can be bent in any direction. If you use nightly, just add the 'Mighty Bright AC Adapter-100V &240V' and you can plug your light in, and save the batteries for travel use. Can't say enough good things about this light after trying many others.",5.0
"Great quality for the price!  Lightweight, but sturdy construction with two light settings.  I'm also happy with the fact that it uses AAA batteries.  You think that would make it too heavy or awkward but it doesn't.  Its also much easier to find AAA batteries than a lot of book lights that use ""watch-like"" batteries.  This is one of the best book lights I have ever purchased, I've had it now for 7 months and no signs of early wear or tear.",5.0
works very well and has two light settings,5.0
My wife can't sleep well with lights on and I like to read in bed. She got me this and now I can read in bed without keeping her awake. The light shines on only the book and doesn't keep her up like the bedside lamp used to.,5.0
"With fewer hotels/motels having good reading lights next to the bed and not wanting to be too insistent with visiting other people's houses, this little device is a wonder.  Puts the light where you need it.  Great for traveling.  Love it.",5.0
I love this little light. I use it for everything as it is so bright and it bends in every direction imaginable. Love it look no further for a little book like a little like that you need to attached to anything!,5.0
"This booklight is bright (but doesn't make the rest of the room too light) and easy to position, and attractive. The base seems a bit clunky (large) but I suppose it can't get much smaller and still have room for the batteries. Definitely good for the price! ($9.89) Probably would make a good gift for people. And I can see this being used for travel, though I'm sure some company also makes sleeker and tinier (and more expensive) ""travel booklights"". (This is already pretty small though!)

Caveat: I can't say yet how it is on battery-life... Haven't used it enough yet. But of course I only use rechargeable batteries with things like this so it shouldn't matter *too* much, since I don't intend to use it frequently. I also can't say how long the bulb will last, which is probably the more important thing. Hopefully it's not junky though!",5.0
"Not only is it terrific for reading, but also great for navigating at home in the dark.  Due to recent surgery, I must use a walker, temporarily; this light attaches to the front of the walker and is great for navigating in the dark, without having to turn on household lights.  My surgeon was so impressed that he is going to tell other patients and also purchase one.",5.0

This is the most versatile lamp I have ever used.  I like that it can stand on a table for lighting my working area or I can clip it to a book and read with it.,5.0
"I've had this book light for oh.... 4-5 years now? It's been quite some time, and I use it NIGHTLY. I've actually never had to replace the bulbs! Just the batteries a few times. With 2 settings you can adjust the brightness. With brand new batteries my husband finds it a bit difficult to sleep if I have it on the brightest setting. (Yes, it's THAT good!) So I use the one bulb with new batteries. The 2 settings also come in handy when my batteries start running on their last leg & the lights dim considerably. Then I use the 2 bulb setting until it won't work anymore. This thing is GREAT!

I've been scouring reviews of cheaper night lights now that I finally need a new one. (With kids involved my finances are not where they were 5 years ago! *lol* Which is also why I need a new one, btw. The light still works, but my son was playing with it & broke the clip! :( ) After reading the reviews of all the other brands I've come to the conclusion that you get what you pay for! This book light has had NONE of the issues complained about on the other brands. Even after years! I'll be sticking with the Mighty Bright brand. Hey, $20 for 5 YEARS is NOT that much! But I think I may upgrade to the ""Hammerhead"" now. The only issue I had with this one is that on larger hardbacks, sometimes the outside corners would be too dark to read so I'd have to adjust it to read those sections. Really NOT a big deal. I didn't even consider it an ""issue"" until I saw the Hammerhead & realized it would probably solve that tiny problem! *lol* I'm in love with this book light, though, so the Hammerhead better measure up!",5.0
"I'm getting ready to buy a second one of these. I always use it on high setting and it does clip nicely to my desk pad that rests on my knees. That way I don't have to worry about reclipping it after a few pages of reading. And I love the color. With winter setting in and my reading needs at the same level, a second one would mean I could leave the one clipped to my portable desktop and add the second one to my bedside table. Uh-oh, now I'm thinking about adding a third one to my little reading nook in another room!",5.0
We had the xtraflex original book light and liked it a lot but changing the special (watch kind) of battery was challenging. This one uses regular batteries and provides better light for both pages of a book.,5.0
"This is a sweet little light, with two settings:  bright and less bright.  The LED bulb is cool, it illuminates my choir music and it is light enough to sit clipped to the top of my folder.  I can also use it to light up my computer keyboard or my book.  I love it, and ordered 3 more for friends who also sing in my choir.  :)",5.0

"Best reading light I have come across. I like to read after my wife has slept, and this is bright enough but doesnt light up the whole room. Also very malleable and light that I can attach it to the book and read easily.",5.0
"This is the best book light I have ever owned. Most of them either slip around on the book and do not stay ""clipped"" or the light goes out. This says firmly clipped to your book. I have also found that most book lights are not bright enough and I end up squinting to read. This one is bright whether you turn on one of the light or two. Mine came with an adapter so I could plug it into the wall or use AAA batteries that are not included. The neck is so flexible that you can place the light anywhere you want. Other lights I have owned do not include this feature and I would have to keep manipulating it so I could see. More often than not if fell off the book. This one stays firmly with the clip. I highly recommend this to anyone who is so sick of other book lights they want to throw all of them in the trash. That is where all of mine ended up.",5.0
Nice product; works great!,5.0
Story times is great with these.,5.0
"I bought this item for my wife thinking it would be a great little gift.  Little did I know that it has become one of her most favorite gifts ever...who would have ever thought...  ;>)  The light is easy to use, and the two brighteness settings makes it perfect for older books or books with darker pages.  Battery operation is obviously not a problem as the original batteries are still going strong even after nightly use for weeks!  It really has become the 'perfect gift'!!!",5.0
"Well, even though I've had this little guy for only two months, it seems as tho' it's been a good friend for a long time; it's been a God-send in the early morning hours when I can't sleep, providing plenty of private light for reading a Spenser Novel, or a Jack Reacher escape into those cool places only those great writers can take us who are smart enough to avail ourselves of that ever-dwindling thing, it seems.....print.
  Even when I read either of my two PC magazines, the Xtraflex is still easy to use; I just hold it in my hand - it doesn't weigh anything at all, is easy to grip, and the flex-wand stays perfectly stiff enough to stay right where you position it - it's really pretty damn neat! Whoever invented this thing, didn't miss a trick, EXCEPT.....my only wee gripe is this: I wish the end on the arm that opens the clamp were much longer - it's way too short, and smooth, making it difficult to open the clamp sometimes. It needs another "" at least with an upward-curved lip you can put your finger or thumb in to facilitate opening the clamp. My thumb slid off the thing quite a few times while trying to open it up - but if that's my only gripe, this is a damn good product.  Oh, and the original batteries are still in use sints it arrived. Prolly cuz  I use just one LED rather than both most of the time - you don't need them! One is nice and bright! Do yourself a flavor and get this one. It's a winnah!  P.S. Yes, the ""sints"" is an intentional missppelll. Sew was that.",5.0

Great quality reading light. I can use the setting with just one of the two lights on and it still lights up the whole page.

very handy,5.0
"One of the best things about this light is that it runs off AAA batteries instead of the button batteries that so many of these lights use.  It has 2 settings for brightness and with the very flexible neck, unless the book is really large, it usually can be positioned to cover both pages of a book.  I also use it if I am reading a newspaper or magazine when it is dark outside.  I have one and have given several as gifts.",5.0
I love this light. This is my second one because all the others I've tried in-between are cheap and are not bright for more than a day or two. My original one fell victim to the children and somehow it got returned to me in pieces.,5.0

Worked very well.  Would recommend for all night reading.,5.0

"Best reading light I've ever had. I bought my first XtraFlex2 about six months ago and am so pleased, I just purchased two more as gifts. I use either one or two lights depending on what I'm reading -- for smaller print and yellower pages, I use two lights. For larger print and whiter pages, I use only one. When the lights start to grow dim, I change the batteries. I've changed them two or three times so far but have used the light for about 30-60 minutes every night for the past six months.",5.0
"it's the one, and I would order a 2nd",5.0
great light; provides total brightness for nightime reading without disturbing anyone. Extremely happy with this unit. Purchase two. Far superior to Itty Bitty Book Lites and other models.,5.0
"These little lights really work well!  Over the years I've purchased four of them.  I'll usually take one with me when I go overnight anywhere (hotel, camping, or a friend's place) because they are so convenient to have near your bed (or sleeping bag) at night.",5.0

The light is great! My wife loves it. It has two different brightness settings and seems to last for a while without having to change the batteries.,5.0
daughter loves it!,5.0
Very nice. A good light but I have only had it for a couple of months. I like LED technology because it is reliable. I also like this light because of the choice of brightness settings (two selections).,5.0
I use this every night. It made a world of difference. Good battery life and it is sturdy. (Have dropped it several times.),5.0
Love this little book light!,5.0
"Awesome little light. It holds on very well to the paperbacks that I often read right before I go to sleep. It is very flexible, yet it holds whatever shape I bend it to. I recommend it",5.0
Just what I hoped for,5.0
"I purchased this light as a gift for my nephew who is a paraplegic and needed a light at night that he had access to while in his bed.
This light was perfect as it is bright led and can clip to most any area around his bed and runs on batteries.",5.0
Love this light. Very Very bright. It lights up the room. Great for reading and swivels very easily. Batteries last a very long time. Ive only changed them out once in 6 months and that is with pretty regular use.,5.0
"I've purchased numerous book lights that have failed, one way or another.  This will probably be the only one I ever buy again.  The light is Super bright, batteries long-lasting and (importantly) it takes AAA batteries that I can recharge, avoiding having to use countless expensive button batteries like many other book lights use.",5.0
Works great! Exactly what I wanted. Now I can read at night without disturbing my husband.,5.0
Great light for the price would recommend,5.0
Great for reading in bed when I am reading a traditional book as opposed to my Nook. It has good light and does not disturb my husband.,5.0
works great if there is a power failure.,5.0
Bright with a strong clip,5.0
"Good quality (white) light output. Like that it is battery (no cord), so portable anywhere. Good brightness. Lights both pages of an open book.",5.0
This is great. Much brighter than I expected and seems to fit all books and even binders. I like it!,5.0
"We use these in our trailer when camping.  Nice to curl up with a book and read at night, and not worry about draining our batteries in the trailer.  I also use it as a night light in the trailer, if I need to get up in the middle of the night.  I just clip it to the window valance.  Gives off good light for reading.  I like the fact it has 2 settings, so you can click it twice for a dimmer ""night light.""",5.0
"Purchased as a gift for my niece and she loves it.  Parents love it too, so much that they bought one for her sister.",5.0
Works as stated--not to heavy so as to make it difficult to balance book,5.0
"Have been using this now for six months.  I read A LOT!!!  I am only on my second set of batteries.  I also found it very useful when my dad was in the hospital.  I would stay all night and did not disturb him at all.

Would highly recommend.",5.0
Love this light,5.0
Works as advertised. Very bright. Both the clip and the clip and the arm hold their position well.,5.0
As expected,5.0
"I love this light! I recently took it camping with me to clip onto the inside of my tent for a general overhead light and it worked perfectly. There are 2 ""brightness"" settings so that you can use to adjust the light output, but both are pretty bright (not much difference between the full and half setting).",5.0
Now I can read in bed while my husband sleeps instead of taking my book to the living room. The light clips to the back cover of the book and gives good light to read by.,5.0
Perfect.  Just what I needed. Fast shipping.,5.0
Works good. Wife uses for reading at night.,5.0
No more reaching to turn out a bed lamp.  I just turn off the light and set the book aside!  It's also sturdy and I'm able to move the arm without fear of it breaking!,5.0
"This is one snazzy little book light. Love it! I can see how it could be used for other purposes in addition to a book, because it opens wide. Love the gooseneck and range of motion. I'm wondering why I hadn't thought of this sooner. Oh, well, better late than never, right? Right!

Pros: Sturdy, gooseneck has great range, lighting is perfect (brightens the page without brightening the room), multiple purpose use.
Cons: Haven't found any and don't see myself discovering any.

I say, buy it!",5.0
Works very well.,5.0
A mighty little light - good for light reading before sleep...,5.0

It is a little smaller than I thought, but it does the job.",5.0
as described no issues,5.0
"I tried a few but this one is the best.  The light is  bright but not overwhelming.  The size is perfect and the book clip strong.  My wife uses it more than me and concurs with my assessment.  In fact, we're going to but our kids each one for Christmas.",5.0

Cool little light. I am using it for my office desk in my room. So far it is doing the right job as expected. No complaints.,5.0
Bought this to clip onto the changing table to keep from turning all the lights on. Works perfect.,5.0
My son has been very happy with this light. It clips onto his Kindle easily and has good battery life.,5.0
This has been awesome for my son to use in his loft bunk bed. He uses it to read every night!,5.0
"Very happy with this lamp. I bought it for my son so he would have a small reading lamp by his bed to read after bedtime.

It throws out a bright light that's easy to read by. The only thing of note is that it's an LED, so be aware of the fact that it has a relatively harsh blue-white tinge, as opposed to the warm yellow of an incandescent. Some people don't like that. But it's a good intensity to read by, and can be dimmed slightly if it's too harsh.

He's been using it for a few weeks now and the batteries are still going strong.

I have no experience with the clip, though, since I opted to affix it to the wall instead. It seems like it'd be a bit bulky to clip onto a book.",5.0
"I love to read, but my bedroom is far away from the only window in my 420-square-foot apartment so I always needed to use the wall-mounted light to read by day or night. After being here for over five years I felt it was about time to invest in a book-light. I have had them in the past but forget why they didn't seem to work out. I looked this one over and decided it looked like it was small, lightweight, easy to use, and in my favorite color (purple) at a really decent price. When it arrived I clipped it to the book I was reading, The Executioner's Song (also ordered from Amazon) and tried it out. It was PERFECT! The only time I may have problems is when I am down to the last few pages since I did clip it onto quite a few pages which I will not be able to do once I am down to only that many pages to read. Still, it is certainly nice that when I am through reading for the night I can just turn off the book-light rather than having to get off my bed, walk around to where the wall switch is to turn off the room light, and then return to my bed. The light comes with the option to use two lights, or just one, and so far I have used both lights so I have to push the button twice to turn it off, but that is no problem. I also have a good supply of AAA's already so when I need to replace the batteries I can do so right away. I can easily adjust the flexible neck to aim the light where I need it, or raise it up high enough to fully illuminate both pages at once. If there is a con to this product, I have not yet found it.",5.0
I use this as a light for my Kindle (as I was too cheap to buy the actual book cover with an integrated one.  The battery lasts forever and it is easy to use.  5 stars.,5.0
very bright and keeps it's shape,5.0
As discribed,5.0
"This light is just what I've been looking for. It is BRIGHT. This thing can light up a room. Thankfully, it has two settings for brightness, and it doesn't seem to bother my husband. Good quality, too. It has a bug clip, and I don't see it breaking easily.",5.0
Bright and works exactly as described,5.0
This is the second one of these I've had. Mine finally died after many years of use so I had to get another one to replace it. LOVE these lights they are perfect and I love how they have two light settings!,5.0
"This light is amazing.  I bought it for bedtime reading since my husband goes to bed much earlier than I do.  However, I find that I use if for so much more.  For example, I clip it onto my shirt when I am doing my nails for more direct light.  I was worried it would be too heavy for my paperbacks but as long as I clip a chunk of pages together it works no problem!",5.0
More that I expected.  What a handy little portable light.  Very easy to insert batteries.  Exceeded my expations.,5.0
This is a great reading light! It is very sturdy. The best feature is that it has two light settings! Both illuminate both pages but one will not kill your eyes!,5.0
"I've had this book light for several years and it still works just as good as when I first got it, despite being dropped several times, so it's very durable. I love the pink color and have gotten many compliments on it. I love the large clip to clip it onto books and that the clip is lined with a soft material so as not to damage the book's pages or leave indentations. When not in use, I clip it on my lampshade next to my bed so I don't clutter up my bedside table with it and it has never left any marks on the white shade. The flex neck is excellent and allows you to easily maneuver the light to virtually any angle that you need and because it has the wire inside the neck, it will stay put in any position unless you physically move it.

Additionally, I was amazed at how bright the light really is! Even in pitch dark, it lights up my entire book, even large textbooks, without lighting up the whole room and disturbing my husband while he's trying to sleep next to me as I read in bed. The light has a large span and two settings, a high and a low. Both settings are bright, but I always use the highest setting. I have used it as a flashlight in power outages as well, so it's multifunctional. This is a bit pricey, but it's totally worth it because it is high quality and works way better than the cheap $10 book lights I've gotten at Walmart. You can't go wrong with this and I'd highly recommend it!",5.0
A+ transaction! Good product!,5.0

This is the best book light i've had by far. Sturdy with two light options:),5.0
I own one of these myself and have bought several others for Graduation/birthday gifts for older kids & teens.  Everyone LOVES how compact it is and the great light it gives.  Use carefully so you don't break or over-bend arm.  Never been a problem for me and works like a charm!,5.0
Purchased as a present for my son's birthday.  He says it works great.,5.0
It was as advertised. It was light enough to clip to the interior sunvisor of my vintage car with out pulling it down from excessive weight. The option of having 1 light or 2 lights lit was good. I could have it on the lower setting at night to augment my weak dashboard lighting without distracting glare. I am very satisfied with my purchase.,5.0
Perfect! Husband is very happy with me using this for reading versus the lamp. It has 2 light options and adjusts very easily. Would recommend.,5.0

"very bright, flexible, and has worked well with hard and softcover books.",5.0
This light clips on and stays put.  It's nice and bright.  And the bendable neck is great since the size and distance of what you're reading varies.  I think it's good quality and I would purchase another one.,5.0
"one problem, the clamp spring is hard to open.  the lever should be longer.",5.0
Very bright but doesn't disturb others around you either.,5.0
Very pleased that this light is still hanging on after 2 years! Bought it as a clip on night light for my baby who is now almost 3. Definitely worth the money.,5.0
I really like this thing. It's bright and I even use it when I go outside looking for something in the dark in my shed. the battery lasts too.,5.0

Best book light ever!!!,5.0
"Wife loves this book light, it's really bright and get's great battery life too. I have issues with sensory overload (particularly light) giving me headaches, while my wife prefers every light on the house to be on, or to have the sun 5ft from her book if she is reading. I got her this as a compromise and she's satisfied enough to let me turn off a few lights",5.0
Very even lighting over the book you don't have to move it around.,5.0

"I like this lamp! It has two modes - bright and dim.
It's flexible, the grip is very good. Got mine last year, and the LED lamp is still working perfectly.
You have to shift it if it's a big book, the circle of light is not very big. But the lamp does the job as
it's supposed to. Would recommend it to anyone.",5.0

Great product.  Glad I switched to LED lights.  The conventional ones I use to use weren't producing enough light.,5.0

"Have given this reading lamp to at least seven of my friends and am about to order three more. Use it to read and light my way every night. Never wakes up my husband, Power outages never a problem with your little light on hand. Try not to run out of AAA batteries.",5.0
"I love this little light!  It is so lightweight and puts out such great light!  The clip is strong and I have not had any problems with it slipping out of the position I set it to.  I like that the neck is long and flexible, making adjustments really easy.  The light beam is bright and wide enough to easily light up both pages in a book, no more adjusting for each page.  I can't believe I suffered as long as I did with a heavy, ineffective, incandescent bulb type as long as I did.  This little gem is worth it's weight in gold!",5.0
"I bought one of these for late night reading without waking my husband. Now that I have it, I never travel without it. I also bought 4 more as gifts for my kids and nephews. Come the winter months when it gets dark by dinner time, my kids will be able to read in bed without bugging each other. The clip is a little hard to open but once it's secure, it's great.",5.0
"Bought 7 of them to clamp on to bunk beds in our bunk room for reading lights. They are perfect; light weight, colorful and have a crisp LED light with two brightness levels. They can be easily carried around for late night trips to the bathroom or main house.",5.0

"Fantastic reading light for your bed. Clip it to your book, dresser/night stand, headboard, and it provides the perfect amount of light to read, and does not hurt your eyes. When you move the light into a position, it stays! We all know what its like when you move a light like this and when you let go, it moves slightly and annoys you to death. Well not this light! Can also be used to light a room when for those times you need to get up but don't want to disturb someone else or blind yourself. Enough light to see, not strong enough to hurt your eyes.

Seriously a great gift for your self and anyone.",5.0
Awesome to light an entire room,5.0

I use it as a nightlight on my bedside table during a late pm/early am bathroom run and an awesome book light.,5.0
"This is a tiny and lightweight book light  but it is super powerful and definitely lets you read with ease. The flexible neck is great since it allows you to focus the light so as to minimize disturbance for others. Let's face it, if you were alone in the room you'd probably just turn on a lamp. In my case, my husband and my twin infants sleep in the room with me and trust me, I don't want to disturb the sleep of any of those parties with my reading light. I had been using a camping headlamp, but that was terrible, because any time I went to glance up at the kids or turned my head towards my husband they woke up from the glare. Plus, the light was so diffuse it lit up the whole room. That's great if you're camping, but not if you want to discretely read your semi-trashy time-travel-romance novel. (Outlander anyone?)

The light is lightweight enough that I can clip it to a paperback, but it is not flimsy at all. I bought this light just to try it out but my husband immediately wanted one of his own and was practically offended I hadn't gotten him one as well since it was clear from the start that this was a great product.

So, you want to read at night but people around you want to sleep? Get this!",5.0
"I own two older e-book readers, an original Nook and a Kindle Keyboard/Kindle 3. Both devices still work and even though the newer e-book readers are better in terms of speed, display, and back-lighting - I'm still fairly content with what I'm using. Not completely satisfied, but content. I'll wait for a great sale and snag a newer version. Until then... I've been reading more at night and due to the fact that my wife goes to bed a bit earlier a book light is a necessity for these older e-readers if I want to read with the main bedroom light off.

I purchased a cheaper light from a big-box store and it worked fairly well for the first month. Then the batteries started to die and replacement batteries meant less commonly purchased button batteries. Not a big deal, but also not as handy as slapping in AAA batteries that we keep on hand. So the baseline was pretty simple: 1. Bright Light  2. AAA Batteries

After reading through several reviews I was rather hesitant to purchase the Xtraflex2 because some individuals stated that it wasn't bright enough. I wasn't too concerned with coverage (it's only a 6-inch screen on both devices) but I was concerned with brightness. My cheap light could have been just a bit brighter, even with fresh batteries, and I didn't want to waste money on a light that wasn't going to be much brighter.

To sum up, I think ""Mighty Bright"" is a perfect company name. This is an incredibly bright light. So bright in fact that I only use 1 of the 2 Led bulbs. I realize everyone has a different preference with regards to how bright a light needs to be. But I was stunned at the difference between my cheaper light and the Xtraflex2. Both of my e-readers have book covers so I just clip it on to the back of the cover and it works great. Even coverage, plenty of light, all as it should be.

YMMV with a paperback book. While the Xtraflex2 is very lightweight considering 3 AAA batteries and the goose neck, it may be a bit hefty for some paperbacks. Yet, some reviewers have stated it works great with paperbacks. I don't read paperback books so I can't respond to that concern. I also don't clip it directly to the Nook or Kindle so I can't respond to how well it does or doesn't work in that context.

If you're looking for a seriously bright book light then I really don't think you can go wrong here. I almost wish I would have saved a couple of bucks and bought the less expensive version of this light with just 1 Led. However, it's nice to have the option for 2 Led lights if I'm reading something larger. Bottom line: Great light, well made, common AAA batteries, and the option to use 1 or 2 Led bulbs. Fantastic product!",5.0
It is a very functional light for reading late at night; it is bright and a battery lasts for some time.  I would purchase it again.,5.0

I work at night and use mine almost every day for about a year now.  My mom visited one night & I let her borrow it... She loved it so much that I ordered her one in purple (her favorite color)!",5.0
Throws good light and doesn't use much energy--the batteries last a long time.  Figured it would be very useful in a blackout so I bought a second light to put away for that eventuality.,5.0
"I bought this for my wife. She reads with the light on all night long. She has also been through many book/reading lights similar to this one, and they never last. So I let her pick through the different models that are offered here and she chose this one. It was a great choice. She is happy with the easy of using the clip to affix to her book. It bends with ease and the light is plenty bright. I require, or I like total darkness while sleeping. I can tell this light is on even with my eyes closed. It puts out a little ambient light, but the tone has a very nice color to it and it works really well for me. The tone itself puts me to sleep. This is a wonderful product.",5.0
My wife loves it!,5.0
"I still read actual books.  Remember those days when you stayed up late, hidden under the covers, with a flashlight. The Xtraflex2 Led Book Light is MUCH better than a flashlight.

In fact, it would be great to have a couple around the house in case you lose power.

It's light as a feather, there's a choice of 2 different light intensities, the clip is easy to use and the gooseneck moves any way you need it to.

I have a dark corner in my living room. I clamped the light to the bookcase, and voila! Let there be light.",5.0
"I have tried every night light on the market.  My husband and I go to bed at the same time but bright lights keep him awake.  Most of the lights I've tried don't have enough light to light up the bottom of the page.  Also, this light is not heavy so it doesn't bend the book pages back, even on a paperback.  The two light function is great.  If I'm reading a legal sized document I can still see the bottom of the page with the two lights switched on.  I'm buying two more--one for my 10 year old to take to camp and one to travel with.",5.0
"I have had this for years and it's wonderful! No issues, decently made with quality material that has not broken or cracked at all. The only minor issue that's not really bothersome is the neck has gotten a little less stiff over time so if you move it may sway or tilt a bit to the side. Otherwise very good product and would buy for others!",5.0
Nice little light for reading in bed. It is not to bright and it is very light. Holds onto your book very well.,5.0
I read every night before I go to sleep - I don't know why I haven't got one of these sooner.  Out in the country we loose power during storms.  I'm going to get three or four of these for emergency lighting to go with the kerosene lamps.  This has two bulbs so it can be turned up if you need more light - stays clipped wherever i put it.  Great little item.,5.0
I bought one of these a few years ago and a couple of months ago I broke the pin on the AC adapter port so I am purchased a new one.  I still use the original with batteries so I have one for on the go and one for bed.,5.0

The dual intensity light, clip and flexibility is perfect for reading in low  to no light and with customer positioning you can put the light on the page right where you need it without annoying others.
Also have used it as a little table light when sitting outside at night.  Works great!  Best book light I have ever owned.",5.0
"I purchased the Kindle version of this light for my Kindle in March 2009.  As of today, January 8th, I have not replaced the batteries. Although I love the light, my usage of it is around 5 hours a month, a bit higher when I travel.

In the fall, my daughter needed a new nite light for her bunk bed and I let her use my Mighty Bright as it clips to her bed frame and she can read with it or use it as a nite light.  This worked so well I purchased two more in December, one for her and one for her brother to use this way.  I love that it the light is cool to the touch.  Most of the bedside clip on lights run quite hot and I worried about my son (almost 6) would touch it and .. ouch!  The kids like that they each have their own color!

I purchased another one at Christmas for a fried that likes to read in bed, however when she travels she often shares a room and found that this light is much better for providing her a bright reading light, while her friend sleeps.",5.0
"Small, bright, and will even clip to your ears! You can imagine hanging it from a tree or camp tent. It's so handy.",5.0

"It's just a book light.  But this one doesn't have any of the problems that have affected the previous ten booklights I've had!  Lightweight enough that it's not a problem reading one-handed.  Bright enough to illuminate, but not bright enough to glare (or even, so far this year, attract the bugs when I'm reading outside).  Easily adjustable.  Uses extremely common AAA batteries, or an AC adapter (sold separately).  No frills, no secrets, no glitches, straightforward product that someone's designed very well for this purpose.  As in the title, this is without doubt, and by some distance, the best book light I've ever used.",5.0
"I love this light. It puts out plenty of light, clips comfortably on my Kindle and is easy to adjust. I love that it takes AAA batteries - I'll be able to use rechargeable batteries after the included ones wear out.

I have had it for about a week. I'll update this review after I've used it for a while.",5.0
"After spending about the same money over time on cheap dollar store book lights I gave this a try. Very sturdy and lights are bright. I bought this for my young daughter as part of her end of school year gift and she loves it So far. She uses only one LED to read because she says the one is bright enough.

Update: just bought a second one for my other daughter and it works well. The other still works well too. We've only changed batteries one time in however many years we've had it.",5.0
My son took this to camp with him two years ago.  He actually still uses it.  It's sturdy and allows him to read in bed before falling asleep.,5.0
"Has two light levels, which is great when one partner wants to read and the other wants to sleep! The light is well distributed over the reading material. Would recommend.",5.0
I bought one for each of my kids for night reading.  They love them.  It is not too much light...it is perfect for reading in bed.,5.0
"The light is nice and bright with the batteries seeming to last longer than my old book light. I like that there is a choice for one or two lights, depending on need.",5.0
"Most products I get through Amazon are excellent and this is no exception.  It is light, small and very bright.  The batteries last even in you are a heavy reader and it works as a flashlight if you need it.  Great if you are reading at night around others that do not want to be kept awake with a bright light.  The best you are still reading print books.",5.0
Is the best solution for people who wants to read or drawn in their bed or places where is hard to find a direct light. Easy to place and the best part is that you can regulate the light direction thanks to its flexible base.,5.0
I'm satisfied with the book light that I purchased.  It is a small but very bright light that allows the reader clear visibility in a darkened space.  Thank you!,5.0
"Nice light, flexible stem, strong clamp.
It's quite bright on either setting, so if you share a smaller bed with someone that might not appreciate it. I have not changed the batteries since the initial purchase (used 5-10x/month).",5.0
"If I buy two of one thing, then it's a recommendation in itself.  I was very happy with the first Mighty Bright I bought so I bought a second one, so now I have matching lights for my e-reader covers.  What I like about Mighty Bright is that it's sturdy, battery life is long, comes in cool colors, and it is mighty bright like the name says.  Makes reading so much more pleasurable.  I also use it for hard copy books and also as a flashlight.",5.0
Great. It lights up even more than I thought it did. The button system for turning on is much more convenient than the slip system on the one I replaced.,5.0
These are great little lights.  They are great for traveling too.  The batteries last a long time.  They are great for little kids starting to read so they can read at night too.,5.0
Bought this book light so that I can read my books while my significant other is sleeping.  The light is bright enough so that I can easily read the words on the page but is dim enough not to disturb my love.  The clip grips to the back of the book nicely and isn't moved easily.  The neck of the light is very flexible allowing you to move it to any desirable position.  I've owned this product for about 4 months now.  I would def order this product again!,5.0
I use this for reading in bed before I fall asleep and it works great! Great price and I like how it has 2 different light intensity options. Seems very durable and stays in any position you put it in...highly recommended.,5.0
"LOVE, love , love this tiny, powerful lamp with its 2 settings! Mages an awesome gift for the reader in your life!",5.0
"It grips the book strongly, the light is as bright as you need it to be and it moves about easily on the page.  And it uses simple batteries that I can buy anywhere. It's perfect!",5.0
This is a great little light.  I orginally bought one for myself for my Kindle and the kiddo needed a light to work when her room mate was sleeping.  I like that you can either clip it to a book or use the base as a stand.  The brightness is pretty amazing given the small size of the light.  We both like and use these little lights a lot.  She was also very happy that it came in her favorite color.,5.0
This clip on reading light is bright enough for any condition.  The single bulb setting is plenty when my rechargable batteries are fresh.  I switch to the 2 bulb setting when the batteries start to fade.  The base is a little bulky since it houses the 3 triple A cells.  The clip is very strong but well padded.  It grips firmly without marking my book or ereader cover.  I also got the single light model that runs on a single battery and think it works almost as well as this one does.  So buy either one (or both as I did) and you'll be reading in any kind of light.,5.0
"So far, so good.  I bought two of these, one for my daughter and one for myself for our new Kindles.  I like the color, it's light-weight and certainly bright enough, even on the the ""low"" beam. Very expensive, but hopefully it will be worth the money!  It was shipped very quickly -- overall a good purchase and I recommend it.",5.0
"What's to say? Nice, cheap, bright, flexible. I clip it to my sewing machine to get more light on the needle area. Works fine.",5.0
"This little lamp is handy and clamps onto things really well (I usually put it on the edge of the desk or sometimes even on my bra strap if I'm wearing a sports bra--it's lightweight enough to do that!). The neck is really flexible, bends easily either forward (like in the sales picture) or backward, and stays where I put it. The light output (the most important part) is great without being glaring. Only gripe I might have is clamping it onto an actual paperback book is a little rough. The lamp is light for what it is, but it's still a bit too heavy for paperbacks (hence the desk and bra tricks), but does great with hardbacks. I also do counted cross-stitch, and use this little lamp for it. It holds well to my sewing hoop!",5.0
"I've been thru several booklights but they all had something wanky (strange batteries, too dim, not enough neck). This is the best I've ever had. It's bright, has a long enough neck to cover big pages, doesn't shimmy off the page, has a wide strong clamp and takes triple A batteries. I'm getting a second for emergency's sake. It's that good. Buy this.",5.0
"This is a very bright book light, definitely don't point it at your eyes (sounds obvious but accidents happen. It's seriously like having a UFO hovering above your face.) The clip seems strong as does the bendy part of the light. Also, the clip has two little cushions on it so it won't damage your book or anything else you clip it to. Will add more to this after a few weeks of use.",5.0
"I bought this light for my wife not myself.  She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on (all in her head I think but I can't convince her of that).  I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.

Brightness is good, I think they could use even a dimmer setting though.  Clip holds to books just fine.

Also, this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.

Recommended.",5.0
This book light throws just the right amount of light required. The clip is strong and does not slip off. The gooseneck is also strong and does not move or drift unnecessarily. Worth the money.,5.0
I love the Book light.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do.  I don't have a small light by my bed so I can read at night.  I can attach the light to my book or prop it up and then I can see to read.  My granddaughter has one.  That is where I first saw it.,5.0
"Really bright.  I used to take it with me traveling, makes it so easy for reading in bed in hotels that don't have remotes for the lights.  At home it's also a great emergency light and good for a night light in my guestroom.  Mine just wore down after several years of use and I think it accidently got turned on when I moved, so I will definitely get a new one.  It's the kind of thing that once you get used to, you can't be without.",5.0
"I love this one because it not only clips on well, doesn't interfere with my book, the light shines perfectly on the pages.",5.0
"I bought this for my wife because she loves to read. She uses it periodically (when she doesn't have enough light being supplied to read her book) or when I'm trying to fall asleep. It has LED lights which are still going strong. It has has a flexible neck that still is holding steady till this day. It also features 2 settings, 2 LED lights so you can have 1 or both of them on.",5.0
I love this little light! I haven't had much time to read lately but I have it clipped to a lamp shade and I use it frequently. Bright enough but not blinding! Love it!,5.0
"I have an older one and this one is better. It illuminates more than the older one. Trust me, this little book light is not a wimpy light. If you are looking for something that is low light then this one is not for you.",5.0
"After reading the reviews for several other book lights, I decided to pay an extra dollar or two for the Xtraflex2.  My wife loves it because I use it to read in bed and with virtually no light spillage over to her side, she can sleep without being disturbed.  It has two brightness settings, so you can make adjustments for reflectivity of the media (reader screen, paper finish, etc.).  I bought it in black because on the day of my purchase, it happened to be cheaper than any other color - go figure.  It was mailed from China, so I was advised that it would arrive in about 6 weeks.  Relax, it only took 6 days.  Would I buy it again?  In a heartbeat.",5.0
"Great service, on time and as described.  I broke my Kindle cover with the reading light.  Had another cover without a light. This enables me to read after dark with a light directed only at the words.  It does not bother my husband when he is driving at night!",5.0
Read art night which use to drive my wife crazy. Now she is sleeping well and I get to read late into the night hassle free. Well crafted and easily adjustable.,5.0
"love it!  bought it b/c I was having bouts of insomnia through my pregnancy, but didn't want to wake my husband by turning on lights or TV in an effort to fall back asleep.  this little book light is perfect - it's small but bright.  I can bend the neck so that it didn't shine in his direction & had plenty of light to read both pages.  Love, love, love this handy book light!",5.0
"I have thoroughly enjoyed this nite light.  I usually read several hours after my husband falls asleep, so I like the privacy it gives me.  It's light is strong even on the dim setting and the batteries seem to last a long time.  Can even see to read when the batteries are kind of low.  Would definitely buy another one.  It's very light weight and easy to adjust on the book.",5.0
This is a great little light. It has two settings and is bright enough to light my book without disturbing my husband.,5.0
Works perfectly for reading at night. This lamp provides enough light even in a dark room. The flex is pretty helpful too. You can adjust the light's angle from where you clip the lamp. Great product.,5.0
"Lots of light coming out of this little thing, and it doesn't bother my husband when I read in bed. I also really like the it has two intensity levels. I usually only use the less bright one as it is enough to cover the page I am reading. The clip is strong and holds the light securely in place. Definitely recommend!",5.0
"I love this book light! The bulbs are so bright that I rarely have to use both. Plus, I love having the ability to choose between ""low"" and ""hi"" settings.",5.0
We used this book light as a music light during our Good Friday service and it was very helpful.  Thank you for providing this item!,5.0
"I have to say that I absolutely LOVE this little gadget! It makes reading in bed so much easier and so much less bothersome to my husband who tried to sleep through lamps shining in the room! Thanks to the ease of this light I no longer bother him with my nocturnal reading habits. Thanks Mighty Bright for delivering such a great gadget!! AND thanks too for the fast delivery! It was earlier than when you first said it would get to me, which was another wonderful surprise!!",5.0
Perfect for my bedrail for night time. I don't have to get up and turn off the lights when I am ready to go to sleep. Doesn't take up any space. Just reach above your head and click! Runs on AAA batteries. Flexible head is easily adjustable and it stays put where ever you put it.,5.0
The light is very bright and it functions well in multiple ways because of the clip.  Good for table to play cards and read menu without having to use hands.,5.0
"Two things are good about this book light.  1)  the battery pack to light head line is longer than many lights. This allows excellent light to reach the page even if the book is quite thick.  2)  using two batteries provides many hours of light.
  Recommend this light for every late night reader, it's the best I've found.  You do not need the transformer cord to plug into the wall. The batteries are so inexpensive because they last well powering the two LED's.",5.0
"I ordered this little book light over two years ago. It is STILL going strong; no issues! I love that the clamp works, and stays put; does not slide around or come off of your book. The neck has been twisted and twisted over the two years I have had it, but it still works like brand new! I don't have to replace the batteries very often, but you do need to check when the light grows dim, before your eyes let you know and it gets harder tor read. I like to stay up reading in bed after my husband has fallen asleep, and this light is so perfect for that purpose; bright enough to read but isn't so bright that it lights up a room. Nothing has fallen apart, and it's easy to use. I bought another blue reading light once of a different brand, when I had a house guest staying. That light didn't work, would not stay put, and fell apart after a few uses. Not this little light! It lives up to it's name: ""Mighty""! It was, indeed, a ""mighty"" smart purchase!",5.0
"I'm a camera assistant.  I love this light, bought this one and the TravelFlex.  The batteries are easy to replace and last forever.  They work great as a lens light on the camera, or clipped into my tool bags to see in the dark.  This one works especially well on mid to larger camera bodies (Red, Sony, Alexa, etc) -- the bottom is flat so it's perfect to attach with some velcro.  The neck is very flexible, yet stays in position where ever you put it.  It's just the right amount of light, maybe even a bit too bright.  But this is easily fixed with a bit of black paper tape.",5.0
"This gives good light, is easy to position, and can be used with a transformer to avoid the use of so many batteries.  It is really a good product!",5.0
I purchased this light after reading the many reviews on it.  It is the best book light I have ever had.  It has two levels of brightness and a very flexible goose neck.  I will use it when I travel or when I don't want to wake up my husband by turning on the bedside lamp.,5.0
"Love, love, love it!!! I highly recommend it! It's bright enough to light up both pages even on a big book!",5.0
This light works great for night reading and illuminates both pages well. Can use it with either 1 or 2 bulbs on.,5.0
"I have been using Mighty Bright book lights for several years now and since I have low vision, I also use the book lights around the house for various things when I need a strong bright portable light for up close reading.  I have used this book light extensively for reading on my keyboard Kindle and if I could give it 10 stars, I would.  The light is easily positioned so its flexible long neck can be directed toward the area I need lighted.  I've used the purple ones in the past so when I ordered a new one I thought I'd get a blue one.  Hard to believe but the blue one has a different color light then the purple one.  The blue one is a ""cooler"" light, the purple light is somewhat ""warmer.""  Different, but both excellent.  I also clip this light to the front of my shirt for knitting, hand stitching, manicures, reading labels in the kitchen and all sorts of things where I need extra light.  Just yesterday I was at the doctors office, waiting and reading, when a woman across the room said, ""Hey, lady over there,what's that light you are using?""  I showed it to her and she said she was going to get one.

One thing.  After about a year or so of heavy use, the neck gets a little too flexible and once I broke the clip off but this is normal wear and tear in my opinion.  I simply wear them out.  It uses 3 AAA batteries which I change as often as needed to keep the light very bright.  It has enabled me to read again after several years of not being able to.  I have ordered a Paper White Kindle and probably won't need to use the book light on it but I'll still keep using it for all the other reasons I've mentioned.  A valuable tool.",5.0
"This light works great & having AAA batteries instead of ""watch"" batteries is a huge benefit. I highly recommend it.",5.0
"Ive had this light for a while and it still works great.  I don't disturb my husband when reading in bed, and when traveling its great when theres not adequate bedside lighting for reading.  It has a low and high setting, and both offer more than adequate light for reading.",5.0
I was looking for a light that would light up the pages on my books and not disturb my wife with my after hours readings. It was hard to choose from the list of lights available on Amazon but I am happy I purchased this one.,5.0
Husband kept borrowing mine when our power went out.  Now he has his own for our any storms and power outages.,5.0
Easy to clip with choice of 2 brightness levels. Flexible neck is easy to adjust. Seems really good after initial use.,5.0
I needed a dedicated light for reading.  The two levels of brightness are very handy and the color choices is a nice feature.  I saw others remark that it is a little heavy and awkward to attach to book - yes it is.  Best bet is to attach to a hard surface or hardcover book.  I attach it to my laptop table and position the beam as needed.,5.0
OMG I love this product.  I bought two.  I gave one to a friend and kept the other.  I don't disturb anybody now when I can't sleep and want to do some reading.  I don't know who thought of this product but kudos to you.  My seller had a great stock count and good prices too. Came fast in the mail too.,5.0
"Good size, weight, and brightness. I bought this for late night reading and now use it often in any situation where lighting not ideal for reading.  No complaints from sleeping spouse.",5.0
"I have had this light for 2 and a half years and it is still going strong.  About 6 months ago I thought the bulb was going out but then I remembered that I could change the batteries.  Sure enough a new battery did the trick and the light was a bright as ever again.

The neck of the light has full flexibility and can be bent anyway you need it to be.  The light itself has 2 bulbs and you can choose to use both bulbs or just one.  Many times I find the 1 bulb setting is more than enough light to read by.  You will be pleasantly surprised by how bright this light is on full setting.  The clip is very strong and has never fallen off a book I have clipped it to.

This is a wonderful reading light that I would recommend to anyone.",5.0
"I ordered the Xtraflex2 and Amazon's Fulcrum MultiFlex at the same time figuring one would be better.  While both devices use almost the same design, the Xtraflex2 turned out to be noticeably more functional and better made.  The two-position brightness control shines a brighter light, the color temperature is warmer and more pleasing, and the mechanical movements are smoother.  While functionally the same, comparison testing revealed the Mighty Bright Xtraflex2 as the far superior product.  This is the one you want.",5.0
"I really like this light!
It is bright enough to read by or do close work late at night.
It clips easily to all the books.
The color is a bold blue easily seen on the night stand.
The only thing I didn't like (my dogs didn't like it either) was the loud noise when I don't get it clipped just right on the book, and they scurry away from the noise!  It really isn't that loud, but I guess unexpected when you are reading in the dark.",5.0
"My 8 year old girl loves this light. She uses it every night to read with. The batteries last several weeks long. We got rechargeable batteries for her, so she can keep it stocked and not keep coming in asking for more. She loves to read herself to sleep and this clips right on the book. She says it is a bit heavy for her, so she clips it on the rail of her bed and uses it that way. If your bed is not made of metal rails like hers, and the light is not too heavy for you, it will work. I tried it out and it did not seem too heavy. Then again, I am not 8.",5.0
"This light is perfect for the DX Amazon leather case. Don't buy the Belkin as it dos not fit properly. This Mighty Bright does the job. All you do is hook it to the cover on the opposite side of the Kindle DX, flex the neck into position and kick back and enjoy the read. One thing!! Remove the clipped light before closing the cover, otherwise you may scratch the Kindle!! Minor inconvenience in my view.",5.0

"This is a good LED light for reading that clips to my bed.  Adjustable, flexible, and it uses 3 AAA batteries rather than expensive ""hearing aid"" type round cell batteries. Good product!",5.0
"Throws lots of light and the flex neck helps you position in a way to distribute the light into both pages, so you're not constantly adjusting it.  The light stays put too which is important.",5.0
"It clamps securely to the hardback book I'm reading now.  The lighting is strong for such a small lamp.  So far, I'm very happy with this, but when I will have to replace it, I'll look for this same one, but with a wider lamp.  Right now, it's no big deal because the book I'm reading now, the pages are large, so I only need a little more light on ea. side.  It was delivered quickly.",5.0
"My 8-year-old likes to read in bed before sleeping. I LIKE that! And encourage it. She's on the lower bunk bed, so she clips this on one of the slats for the upper bed and can shine it right down on her reading material. I very much like the fact that there are two brightness levels. And, blue is her favorite color, so . . .",5.0
Very bright.  Smaller than I anticipated but that's perfect - takes up less space!  A great buy.  Grips the book well.,5.0

"My wife really likes this light.  It is really bright, however it has a three way switch so that either one LED or both LEDs are on which is a big plus.",5.0
This light is awesome. Not too bright not too soft. Doesn't wake my husband up when I'm trying to read at night.,5.0
"This light is as good or better than the previous reviews stated. My biggest worry was not the actual lamp but rather the clamp. I figured it's pretty hard to screw up a light. Have great old pairs of headphones that become worthless because of poorly made external wiring. Please to say that the clamp is of as good quality as the rest. The flexible neck is an superb feature that allows me to make multiple adjustments with ease. The light, ahh, the light. As other mentioned, the brightness is remarkable! I rarely use the highest setting because the 2nd provides such clean, pure, illumination. The 1st setting is amazing, like having a tiny, high lumin flashlight attached to your book. Best of all, the light does not bleed out and disturb my wife even as she sleeps facing me. If you enjoy reading in bed, and have had your share of crappy reading lights, Spend the few extra $$ and get this. On con might be that due to size I don't know how well it be used on a plane etc.",5.0
"This little thing is quite possibly the best book light I've ever had.  It takes regular batteries which is a world better than the ones that take watch batteries.  You have a choice of using one bulb or two at a time and it does a great job of keep the light central to the book you're reading instead of it spilling over into the room while someone else is sleeping.  I would never suggest another book light ever again, this one is great!",5.0
My kids use so they can read without getting out of bed to mess with the lights.  Battery life is excellent and even having left on a few times all night still going strong.  The only consideration is having a thin object to clamp to it.  However in some cases a Zip tie might semi permanently mount it for you.  It will not clip on a thick wooden headboard.,5.0
"I originally bought one of this items with two lights for my wife. Within couple of weeks of used, she found the two lights was two much for reading. So got this one for her and she's very pleased with it. she also loves the switch it has to turn it on and off.",5.0
"The unit feels very sturdy, and the picture is exactly the product you receive. The plastic clip seems likely to hold up nicely and stand up to the load of being clipped and un-clipped a LOT.  The neck is finely jointed black metal, and it bends easily, but the weight of the light head can't bend it.  The neck feels like it will stand up just fine to lots of bending.  The light is fairly white to my eye.  If there is a bluish tinge, it is very slight.  And it's plenty bright enough for reading a book it is clipped to.

Switch seems sturdy, clicks easily but distinctly, and is easy to find right on the top side of the light head.  Hit the switch once to turn both lights on; hit it again and the 'inner' light turns off and outer light stays on; hit it a third time and all lights are off.

Battery cover slides on and off just like pretty much any TV remote or cell phone: just apply a little downward pressure with with your finger on the little 'arrow' molded into the battery cover and push.  Cover slides off revealing the battery compartment.  No screwdriver or any other tool needed.

It has a rubber pad on the end of the clip, which matches up with a rubber pad on the base, helping it to stay in place on hard surfaces.  Some reviews have noted that it slides around a bit on thin book covers, and I saw that too *IF* I didn't push the clip as far down as it would go on the cover.  When I clipped it as far onto the hardcover as it would go, it didn't move at all when I waved the book around.

The max thickness that the clip will go on is 1 1/8"" fully (basically 'hyper') extended.
The clip seems designed to work optimally when the item it is clipped on is 3/8"" to 3/4"" thick.
BUT of course it still works OK on thinner and thicker stuff than that.

Bottom line: I can't think of anything I'd change.  Would be a tich nicer for clipping onto books if the battery box was lighter and thinner.  But you can't get AAAA batteries just everywhere, and they wouldn't last as long.  Also if the battery box was much lighter, you couldn't use it as a lamp base.

DIMENSIONS:
Base battery box: 3.1""L x 1.6""W x 0.65""H.
Clip Triangle Height: 0.7""
Overall height from bottom of base to top of clip: 1.7""

Flexible Neck Length (not counting light head): 7.75
  BUT the neck starts 0.6"" in from the end of the battery box.
  Neck diameter: 5/32""  (0.15"").

Light Head: 2.18""L  x 0.8""W x 0.64""H.",5.0

"*UPDATED*

Surprisingly powerful and portable with two easy-click settings: bright and very bright.  It has become more than just a book light.  I've found myself using it for so many different reasons from finding things in my purse, working at night on the train, applying makeup, the list goes on.  I've eve since bought a second one, which I actually clipped to my car board to use as a secondary light in effort to avoid burning out my car battery (...again).

This definitely deserves five stars.  I do admit the clamp *could* be a little more sturdy but overall the positives far outweigh such minor 'negatives'.  As for color I silver is your best bet unless you're a fanatic about bright colors.",5.0

My boyfriend is a light sleeper and sensitive to light when snoozing. This light is perfect for us. It allows me to read when I can't sleep and allows him to stay asleep when I have it on. The neck is firm and does not move and the clip works well when attaching to paperback books or magazine (as long as you select a few pages to grasp).,5.0
Very bright light and easy to handle.  Nice bending neck!  Tight clip keeps light attached to book. Best light I have had so far.,5.0
I bough this for my wife for christmas and after purchasing I was worried it would be too bulky/heavy for a small book. It seemed like everyone was using these for the tablet. It works very well and is no heavier than the three AAA batteries it holds. She loves it and the brightness is great. It has one dimmer setting which is nice for late night when your eyes are adjusting.,5.0
I've dropped this a number of times in the bath tub!  (Like to reading bubbles.)  It comes out still shining!,5.0
"Works great - the kids love it. I would recommend.
Maybe a little smaller would have been better but this is also OK.",5.0
"The Mighty Bright light was everything I hoped it would be and a bit more. The light has two settings to better fit different reading modes, the clamp is large enough for the biggest of books (or even a table) and the flexible neck holds every twist and bend imaginable. The light is a VERY good value, was delivered as promised and performs beyond what I expected.",5.0
"ITS BRIGHTER THAN MY PREVIOUS LIGHT .HAS TWO BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS AND IS VERY FLEXABLE.
THE BLUE COLOR IS VERY NICE ALSO.",5.0
I got this for reading at night and it is perfect.  The light is very bright and covers all the pages.  No moveing from side to side to get full light.,5.0
Great light at a good price. I use this light in a darker part of the room which has not outlet for a plug in reading lamp. Works great and provides visibility of two pages without moving it. Highly recommend,5.0
"My daughter liked this so much at bedtime that I got her another one for riding in the car. It's bright, sturdy, and flexible.",5.0
This is a sturdy book light that is made quite well and has a great bendable neck. It easily goes in any direction for great viewing.  It has a bright light that makes it easy to read any size print.  I really like this book light.  Plus the color purple is very pretty!!!,5.0
"This works great and really casts a very bright light. I love it. The clip is firm, although it can slide like most clips, but that is to be expected.",5.0
"This light is very bright and much nicer than previous book lights I've had. I also like the fact that you can turn the light down if needed. The clip is heavy duty and holds on well. In fact, I have it clipped to my side table and use it as a lamp in the middle of the night when I need it. Great product!",5.0
For that price; it works like a charm. Just what I expected. I would recommend this a friend in a heart beat.,5.0
"Light weight with two brightness settings, this is perfect for reading in bed.  i also use it reading a cookbook or phonebook when a little more light comes in handy!",5.0
My 4 year old loves reading in bed like her big brother!  this light is perfect and the color spot on.,5.0
The base is a bit too heavy if you are reading soft cover books. The lightening is great and does not disturb the person next to you when they sleep. The goose neck is very flexible.,5.0
I have always thought this would be a great gift for readers. This year I bought one for myself. It is fantastic. Not heavy with really good light.. Love it.,5.0
"I've used the Mighty Brights for years and this is definitely the best thus far. Structurally, it's very sturdy - the last several lights had very flimsy off-on switches that wore out quickly. This light should last for years!",5.0
It's a bright little thing and the neck bends all kinds of ways. It has a battery that's actually replaceable. It more than meets my need.,5.0
This is a very nice book light and I don't regret this purchase. It's well made and doesn't eat up the batteries. You don't even need the two led lights to read. I only use the one and it plenty of light.  My wife is kinda of use to it now because it is a little bright in a dark room. I bought the adapter but haven't used it yet because the batteries are still going strong. If this only last one year I'd get another one in a heartbeat!,5.0
"I bought it for long drives, so I could read without disturbing the driver.  I found it to be helpful in other applications as well.  The light is bright and has 2 settings if you would like to go with dimmer.",5.0
I purchased this for my college freshman son and he loves it.  It allows him to read (study hopefully) without disturbing the roommates.,5.0
"Great quality and it makes reading more fun for my young child!  Does everything it says.  Would suggest for a birthday, Easter basket, stocking stuffer, etc.",5.0
"I got this light to use with my Kindle, and I am so glad I did.  It is bright, but not too bright; the color is nice (not as hot pink as it looks in the picture, but more of a purple-pink, which I like better); it's lightweight; and it's incredibly flexible.  The only thing I haven't liked so far is that it does put a glare on the Kindle screen/book page, but that is easily fixed by moving the light slightly to the side so the bulb isn't directly above what I am reading.  I've only had it for a couple weeks, so I don't have any long-term feedback, but so far, so good!",5.0
"Nice, bright light for reading paperback books in dim light. Clips to the back of the book and the light illuminates both pages. Easy to use. Batteries last a long time, too.",5.0
I got this light to do my nails when I a watching TV where I do not have good enough lighting.  It works great. Peace,5.0
The light is super duper bright.  It is better than some flashlights I have seen.  I love that the wire leading to the lamp is segmented so more angles and weird lighting position can be had.  Previous and cheaper booklight always seem to have a problem wandering when reading.,5.0
"Great light, my son loves using this.  Super bright and has a strong clip.  It also has 2 light settings, low and high, which pretty much look the same :-).",5.0
"My wife reads books all the time, and she can't always find a lamp or light to sit by. So I bought her this light. It works great and the flex part holds well. It has 2 led lights which last forever. You can click it once or twice to turn on 1 or both of the led lights.",5.0
"This is the best book light I have ever owned.  I have had several in the past and I have always had to adjust them every time I turn the page, but not this one.  Other terrific features include two light settings, and AAA batteries instead of those tiny hearing aide batteries.",5.0
"after reading many reviews for a kindle light, i chose the mighty bright-xflex 2-lght. it is awesome. after reading with a lamp on, i finally can read in bed or anywhere with no outside lighting. the light is not too bright. its just right, and fits my kindle with no problems. i thought it might be too bulky, but its actually really small. it uses 3 AA batteries, that are included. on a scale of 1-10, it is definately a 10 !! love it. you won't be disappointed !!!!!",5.0
"It does what it's supposed to do.  That simply earns it a 5 star rating for me.  Anyways if you're in the market for one of these it's a but.  NOTE: Get the ac adapter also, makes the light a bit brighter and will save battery life too.",5.0
"I like the gooseneck design on this one much better than the old plastic unfolding, hinged design.  I liked the older purple better but no biggie.  This purple is ok.  I LOVE that the light has a one or two build setting!  Very nice.
The clip is a bit stiff and hard to manage maybe that eases with time we shall see.

All in all, I'm just so glad to get another one of better design than my first one that broke.",5.0
"I like to use this for my laptop that doesn't have the backlit keys as well as for reading.  It's easy to use and has two different levels of brightness, works great!",5.0
"This is the best book light ive ever tried hands down, it ligjts the whole two pages and you don't need to move it each time you turn pages its amazing",5.0
"This works very well.  I read at night in bed, the light is perfect.  covers the double page easily.  But best is that it is great with paperbacks.  It attaches firmly.  My previous light wiggled and waggled and never stayed attached properly.  I am delighted to have this one.",5.0
"I have been using this light for a couple months now.  It is very bright but not in a way that I think is bad.  I can read my kindle touch in bed at night with no other lights on or in the car (as a passenger, obviously!) and it clips well to the case I use.",5.0
"Light works wonderfully - no fuss or hassel, just clip it wherever you need it; works great!  Light is just enough to read.",5.0
"i hook this onto my chair in my theater room, when I'm eating snacks while watching movies i didn't want an annoying lamp over my seat so i got this and its the perfect solution. Not too bright to where its distracting me but enough to see I'm very satisfied with this light. obviously good for reading as well",5.0
"Clips on easily and strong.  Easy to adjust, move & maneuver neck, which then stays in place.  The light is direct and bright, but not blinding.  Constructed well, looks good and a pleasure to use - I'm very happy with it.",5.0
Absolutely perfect lighting for reading my books.  Nice soft lighting and no glare.  Very handy where contained lighting is necessary to not disturb.,5.0
"Reasonable priced, easy to use and I expect it to last forever base on the fact I have a 20 year old product from this company.",5.0
"I love that I can plug this light in and clip it near my bed. It is bright enough to read by, AND uses easily available batteries, no strange, expensive watch batteries.  I recommend the charger. Just be gentle on the button. My first one broke at the button. I could still use it for about another year, but it eventually gave up. Love this light!",5.0
"Works great and has a nice long battery life. I bought this for my girlfriend because the other reading light she had wasn't very bright. This one has two different settings for brightness, and both are great. It's small and lightweight -- no complaints, just a very nice, affordable reading light.",5.0
Works better than any other reading light I have ever purchased. I highly recommend. Bought as gift for Christmas. =),5.0
"I have this clipped onto the headboard of my bed and it is the perfect light for reading by.  Also handy if you need a little light when you wake up in the middle of the night and need to make a quick run to the bathroom.  I'm a bit old, and the ol' bladder isn't what it used to be.",5.0
I got this light as a second book light so I didn't have to run to my bedroom to get my reading light. I actually like this one better. It has two stages of light for a bright reading light or a dimmer one. It also has several lights to cover the full page. I use it on my Kindle and it clips well and not as heavy as my other one. Great reading light.,5.0
I have had this for a while and it is holding up well.  I like the ease of use.  I would recommend,5.0
"I bought this for my daughter for books but also to play with and use in the car. It is easy to use, stays on a book well and she likes it.  Also, I thought it was a great price.",5.0
My 7 year old loves to read prior to falling asleep. It is very easy to use for her and loves the fact she can clip it anywhere. The light is bright but not too much. There is an adjustment to only have one or two lights on at a time.,5.0
"This is a very lightweight, and incredibly sturdy little light.  Doesn't weigh your book down, and the adjustable neck stays put and doesn't constantly move on you.  Easily the best book light I have ever used.  Plenty bright for you to read by.",5.0
"These lights work very well with kindle covers. I have 3 of them and take them
everywhere. They are portable and fit in my purse pocket. The light is bright enough and the battery life is long.",5.0
"I had a book light from Brookstone, but was always having issues with it.  I eventually threw it away and really wanted one that was better. I used this immediately and really like the dual light settings.  Especially like the fact it takes 3 AAA batteries instead of a watch battery (I never had on hand).  I have a 2nd generation Kindle and this is ideal!",5.0
"Sturdy clip, good strong color, bright light, batteries that last for ages. Most importantly my daughter has not broken it yet. It's good and solid but also nice and light. It has just the right amount of bright light for book reading and I would buy another without any hesitation at all.",5.0
"Very discreet and the batteries have a great durability, I was worried about leaving any marks in my books, but it don't.",5.0
"This light is perfect for those who need more light to see. Mom uses it to read her mysteries and to build her jigsaw puzzles. It's just the right size to carry around, and doesn't get in the way when sitting on the puzzle table.",5.0
"I love this product.  The light is indeed bright and its flexibility makes it easy for storage.  Thank you, Mighty Bright for such an awesome product.",5.0
Adds adiquate light where needed.  Works great on books but it is usefull in power outages!!!  No power coards required.,5.0
"I have only using a few times but it displays a fair light and you are able to read. It a white cool light that doesn't bothers your eyes while reading. The item was as describe with two brightness setting that you can use depending on your choice. Suits good on books and is not that heavy so it's barely noticeable that is on the book.
Love it.",5.0
"Bought two of these for our daughters to use to read at night.

""Works really good.""

I find I am constantly replacing batteries because they use the high setting all the time, but still is only about once every other month or so.",5.0
"I gave this as a gift and am told that it's really good, gives off a lot of light,  fits on the book well, is light weight and doesn't pull a battery too badly.",5.0
"This is the best reading light I have ever had. It has 2 light levels. The flexible neck is absolutely wonderful.

Cons:
Even the lowest light level is a wee bit too bright but not too bad.
The clip holding it to the book is kinda large but tolerable.

Pros:
The light is bright enough to actually read in the dark.
The light stays very focused on the book and not on the area around the reader.
The light can be focused where you want it so it never has to shine in the readers eyes.
The flexible neck means you can move the light so there are no dark spots no matter how large is the book.",5.0
I ordered this to clip on to a head board.  It does and the arm is long enough to provide good light.,5.0
We bought this for our grandson for Christmas because she loves to read.  It was a nice little present and works well,5.0

"I bought this for my 8 year old so she could read in bed. She uses it every night, and now her four year old sister and dad try to steal it from her all the time to use it. The light is bright enough that you can easily see your entire book with it (not just a page like some book lights) and it clips on to something so you can adjust it how you want to lay.",5.0
"This was a gift for my son to read in bed at night without disturbing his wife.  He said it's plenty bright, and he uses it a lot.  This is one I would recommend.",5.0
"I have tried a number of reading lights and this is the ONLY one I can recommend. It works well on both paperbacks and hardbacks.  I have also used it successfully on music stands during music jams.

It's possible that, with all the new LED tech coming out, that a new lamp may out-perform this one, but, for now, the price to function ratio on this lamp is unbeatable.",5.0
"Tried a number of this, but always go back to Mighty Bright. The light covers both pages and it is also good for small repair work, just clip on your shirt.",5.0
"Bought as gift for my wife.  She loves it, especially the two settings for light intensity.  We would buy again.",5.0
"Have enjoyed for 1 year now.  One of my best possessions!  I can read without waking husband.  The light is Bright and Big enough for the 2 open pages of a book.  Many others were not bright or big enough, and were very frustrating.  Yes, this has to be plugged in, but it is SO much better than battery items.  I've traveled with it a lot.  Sometimes bring a multi-plug, for the hotel outlet.",5.0
"Nice, soft light that's mega bright. It has 2 settings, which is just perfect. I couldn't think of anything to improve this product. Love it!",5.0
"In a world filled with flimsy garbage. It is nice to be able to find a product that does what it is supposed to for as long as one would expect with reasonable care.

Have had one for about 4? years another for 3, and ordered a third recently because one was misplaced temporarily.

When you get it put a good battery in it, and it should serve you well.  Vacations, camping, etc...",5.0
"I absolutely HAVE to read in bed at night to fall asleep, my husband HATES the light on. I have a small bedside lamp but it's too bright so he would only tolerate my habit for so long in an evening before grumbling. I'd been pondering a $50 lit book cover when I came across this little guy and took a gamble (it's so inexpensive after all!) I LOVE IT! My hubby was impressed at how well it lit up just my pages and not the rest of the room.  It's still a soft light so my eyes don't go crazy (like they do when you use an electronic screen in a dark room). I just clip it to the already read section of the book and can read like normal. The light has 2 settings but there's not really a noticeable difference between them. Anyway, I'm VERY happy I made this purchase, and it's a great little gift for bookworms!",5.0
"Really like the mini light,  it is very light weight which was very important. I use it for needlework and for reading .",5.0
"I am disabled and in a hospital bed with rails on it. I clipped this to the rail and it works perfectly. I use it all the time. It is bright, easy to use, and nice looking. This is my second one! My son kept using my first one, which I had for many years, so I gave it to him and bought myself another, prettier one. My first one was black.",5.0
"For the price you get a lot of value with this book light. Begin able to turn on one or both LED's is a nice feature and the adjustable  goose neck is nice because it can be bent to where light is most needed.

The person I bought it for was having a bit of trouble reading by regular lamplight so this really helped them out.",5.0
"our little two year old girl loves this light to be able to read in the back seat of our car.  the main overhead light is too bright to drive with, so we have this light clipped to the rear door ceiling handle bar.  it illuminates the right amount of light for her and not to bright to distract my night driving.",5.0
"This little book light is perfect!  Fun color, two brightness settings, not too heavy.  Perfect for travel, too.  No complaints!",5.0
Love this book light.  It also came in handy when I was trying to hook up a blue ray player to my tv.  I'am sure I'll find other uses.,5.0
This works good on paperback and hardback books.  Bright enough in a totally dark room.  Nice that it is lightweight and built to last.,5.0
"So handy, very lite and bright bought several for family--come in bright cheery colors make great gifts for any occasion.",5.0
Love this book light.  A little tricky getting it anchored on a page of a thin magazine but great  for more pages.,5.0
I got this so I could see the keyboard on my laptop at nite as I'm not a good typer. I've replaced the standard batteries with rechargeables and they last forever. One of my best purchases.,5.0
"To circumvent all the drama with my kids about ""going to sleep,"" I instead just give them a time that they must be ""in bed.""  I don't let them have electronics in bed, but I do tell them that they can read as long as they want.  LOL!  Anyways, my solution to pulling this off was to buy night lights.  I originally tried the ones that you plug into an electrical socket, but those just don't last because the bulbs burn out.  Then I migrated over to these clip-on style lights.  The kids can clip them on their books or onto their night stand or anything else, and they bend in whatever direction is needed.  I've found that the one that works best is this one, which has two lights.  The two lights make it brighter than the other single-light versions (I know, rocket science advice here).  The only negative is that there is no automatic ""off"" switch, so if they fall asleep with them on then the light is staying on (unless you make a sweep before going to bed yourself).  Even so, they still seem to last a long time with their batteries.  I just buy a pack of batteries and replace them when needed--it seems a small price to pay to keep everything quiet and controlled at night time.",5.0
"This has worked perfectly for my cross stitch project.  My only complaints would be that the battery life isn't longer and it doesn't give you an indication of when the batteries are weak.  I just finally reach a point where I become convinced that the light isn't working as well as it was.  Fortunately, I just change the batteries and voila it works again great.",5.0
I have one and bought this for my grandson.  Clips onto lots of things and is an easy light by which to read.,5.0
"They work great. The light is bright but it has a one or two light feature so you can soften it if needed. The clips are strong and although I abuse them I do get a lot of use before the goose neck gets loose and wobbly. For the price I just get another. A few older ones I have taped in position on things. They seem to light forever seldom requiring battery changes.

I have one clipped to my small stand mirror for plucking the eyebrows...its priceless. I have one on a basket handle for an emergency light in case the power goes out. Huge basket always on the floor. Have even clipped them to my ipad to take photos.",5.0
"Great purchase!  Love the feature of ""bright"" and ""dim"" by having the ability to turn off 1 of the LEDs if needed.",5.0
"I do not have a backlit Kindle because I don't want to feel like I'm reading from my phone or computer. However, I do like reading at night so this light it perfect. It has an adjustable neck and you can use one or two bulb power depending on your needs.",5.0
Very bright and perfect for reading at night with the room light's off- affixes to Kindle with easy- lightweight but appears to be durable.,5.0
"Who would think dogs would be so fussy.  :)  Mine grumble when I leave the lights on.  This allows me to read until I am tired, and allows them to pass out when they want (so they only grumble when I'm done and they have to move so I can lay down).",5.0
As you can tell by the reviews this is a trusted light. I use this to read in bed clipped the headboard and it works perfectly.,5.0
"Great light.  I have several of these around the house.  They are very bright and nice for reading.  You never have to replace the bulb, but you will go through AAA batteries.  Nonetheless, a great reading light!",5.0
I've had this piece for over 2 years and it's still going strong.  Perfect amount of light to read in the dark.  When we had a hurricane and no power for mulitiple days this little light was a real life saver.  The light is very bright and illuminates the entire page on a book.  It also works well with my Kindle which is an older model and has no backlight for nighttime reading.  I've purchased two of these as gifts because it works so well.,5.0
"Works perfectly, clamped on to any book that I have tried. I like the single/double bulb option. Small but mighty !!",5.0
"My wife has been using this for months now, every night, and no complaints. The paint does chip a bit but no biggie. The flex arm is still working well.",5.0
"works well, even on a paperback book.  Fair price and good ship time. The light has two levels of brightness.",5.0
"I bought this light back in like 2009.  it is now 2013 and I still use it.  I have had to change the battery 2 times since I have had it and I use it all the time.  Wonderful product, great deal.  Thank you!!",5.0
This Xtraflex 2 Super LED Pink clip light is great not only as a Kindle or book clip lamp but as a sot light food reading in almost any situation. It's flood is greater than my outdated LED flashlights.,5.0
"The best light for your ebook reader, outside of a built-in light!  Double bulbs for brighter lighting, and three AAA batteries keep it bright for over a week (reading a couple hours per day).  Can't beat it for the price. Well made, I bought two, but am still using the first one and its going strong.  No problems whatsoever.",5.0
This is great little light.  I have eye problems and use it for lots of other things where I need direct light.  The batteries last a very long time.  Another nice feature is - it doesn't get hot.,5.0
One of the most useful products I have ever purchased - I own three.  I use it every night - never have to buy another battery for it as long as I use the cord.  At first I purchased the light without the cord but I was going through batteries like crazy.  I have a Kindle Fire but I don't prefer to read books on it due to the back light.  I use my Kindle Keyboard and of course I need a light to read by.  This one is absolutely perfect for my use.  I read about 10-12 books each week.,5.0
I recently got this light as a gift and love it!! I actually bought this one for my 8 yr old daughter who loves to read before bed:),5.0
"I like this product, it has good light, very comfortable to put in every small treval case. I use it for kindle, for printed books and for others situations where is need for flashlights. And batteries are durable for a long period",5.0

"Purchased this as a gift to go along with a Kindle back in 2009. Both the Kindle and this Mighty Bright as still going strong. I think it works perfectly with the Kindle (either attached to  the Kindle itself, or attached to the headboard of the bed). Having 2 brightness settings is a big plus as well.",5.0
This light provides a good amount of light at a reasonable price.  Plus it has the clip that is useful.  I recommend it.,5.0
"Bought this for my niece who likes to read in bad.  Parents won't let her leave her light, so this is perfect.  She said it works great, too.",5.0
"I love the fact that there are two little LED lights, one dim but bright enough to be able to see what you are reading and the other one very bright...it's all a matter of preference which one you choose  No switch to have to move to turn it on; it has a big enough button to push to go to two lights, one light or no light.  The batteries were easy to install but surprised me that they all three went the same direction.  This fits great over my Kindle which is fairly thick with its cover and does not slide around like my previous one did.  The extension arm moves very easily to exactly where I want it to be and stays put.  I highly recommend this llight for anyone who needs or wants a light.  Definitely rates a five star rating.  It would qualify for a ten star if they had ten stars here.",5.0
"This light has two settings, one is bright, the other is less bright.  The adjustable gooseneck allows the light to be set at just the right angle.  Great stocking stuffer for book lovers.",5.0
IGOOD LIGHT!  This would make a good stocking stuffer. I use mine on my kindle for when we go camping. It shows a nice light and clips nicely to my kindle.,5.0
"Great light. I got the light because my husband needed more light to read music in the church choir loft. It has made all the difference!  Now I never hear him make up words when he sings behind me, he can read the real ones!",5.0

"If you want a book light to use when reading in the dark or low-light, I recommend the Mighty Bright TravelFlex Book Light. It is reasonably priced, well-made, light and small, easily positioned over a book page or Kindle display screen, attaches quickly and securely, the light is bright and the battery life is exceptional. And, it comes in several appealing colors. I have four of them - one I keep in my purse, one in my camping and vacation satchel, one in the living room, and one in the bedroom.",5.0
"This light is bright, light-weight and very durable. I love how it has two brightness options and the flexible neck is perfect for getting the angle you want. The clip is also very durable and can clip to a large variety of objects or even stand on its own. I've used it to light up books, an old Gameboy, iPad, and a small worksurface and all these applications worked perfectly. I've also had it for over a year now and the original battery is still going strong.

If you need a good, bright, long-lasting book light, then look no further.",5.0
Very bright and lightweight. Don't worry about its compact size. This is a great reading light and very nice for task specific lighting.,5.0
It works well and with the two lights you can control the amount of light you might need.  I would recommend it,5.0
"One of the best and brightest lights for a very good price!  The clip is very strong and stays in place for ""directed"" light.",5.0
Works great for what it's intended for. It clamps on to just about anything and the light is nice and bright for reading.,5.0
"Clever, sturdy, easy to use.  So far so good.  Clip holds on well, neck is easy to position.  The two levels of brightness very handy.",5.0
2nd light I have bought. Great product well made. Light is perfect for my kids to read at night in bed. Would buy more as gifts!,5.0
"Two LEDs, option of connecting with AC adapter (which I purchased separately) or using batteries, which were included. I've heard it is not as bright when using batteries but so far I've only used it with the AC adapter. I can use it for reading at night. Another selling point is the ability to use just one LED or both. Using just one LED is sufficient to be able to read in bed. Casts a wider area of light than most other lights in this category. I can see I'm going to get  more, for myself and for gifts.
*Note: According to the instructions, you can't have the batteries in while using the AC adapter. Though I had no evidence to think so, I was hoping I could use rechargeable batteries and they would charge while using the adapter, but you can't. That would be a nice option, but not a deal-breaker.
**Note 2: This light seems geared toward broader use than a booklight alone. Another review mentioned a bit of instability with the clamp when attached to a book. Though I can see how that might be an issue, I haven't noticed it.",5.0
"So far so good - I've been using this light for about a month now, and it's fantastic. It stays where it's supposed to, and the flex neck makes it easily adjustable even for large books that I read to my daughter. Great product at a terrific price. I may buy a couple more just to stock them in case this one goes bad (which it may, going by some of the other reviews here, but so far so good)!",5.0
Good light no problems here.  Makes reading in the dark a sinch.  I used to just read with the lights on and she couldn't get any sleep and would gripe at me all day long.  After I got this she sleeps like a baby and Is happy as ever.  This light saved my marriage.  It calmed my dog down and got rid of my STD.  Best. Light. Ever.,5.0

Just put the Mighty Bright Blu-Xflex 2 LED lights to use and they are just great. Built quality is good and packaging is professionally done. The 2 level power setting is very helpful when using the lights in either partially lighted room or when the room lights are off. The batteries that came with are useful too - allows one to put the lights to use right away.,5.0
It is really bright with two settings and it lasts.  I am into my second book and it is not fadeing yet.,5.0
"As stated by other reviewers, this little light illuminates both pages of a book. It works perfectly for reading after lights-out. I'd been reading only ebooks on my Kindle at night, but now I can read hard copy as well without waking my husband or the cats.",5.0
I bought this for my wife and she uses it a lot. I lights her book well and doesn't bother me asleep next to her. I thought it might use batteries up but the LED uses so little power they last a long time. It is good to have the two levels of light too for in the dark the low level is plenty.,5.0
"I give this product a five star review at the same time as saying I've gone through several, because the several I've been through have held up remarkably well through some hell. The one I had before this one, I had for like 5 years, and the only reason it stopped working was because soda had been spilled on it and the buttons would get stuck a lot. I love this book light so much, if you don't mind the big bulkiness of the clip (I actually like that) this is an overall fantastic reading light, especially since it has two brightness settings making it easier to read it different amounts of light. I love love love this book light.",5.0
"This was my second one... I loved this little light so much that when the first one finally kicked the bucket I bought it again! I love to read at night with my Kindle, but my husband would like it darker and since I don't have a paperwhite this was my best option. FIts great on the case of my Kindle and is super light and flexible.  It is bright, but not to brights.  I have also used this for books once in a while and it works on every kind.",5.0
"I used this by my reading chair........gives just a little light in a darkened room.  It's perfect for that reason.  I use my Kindle light to read so just want a little lighting........on the side.  This is economical, as well.

Recommended, highly.  Thank you.",5.0
"The battery life seems great and it's very, very bright! It is a little hard if someone is sleeping next to you but it's pretty directional.",5.0

"does what it supposed to do, has two options for lighting, 2 LED lights or just 1, i use only one for my purposes. great stuff, comes with batteries and that prompted me to buy this one instead of another one i saw that was a lil cheaper",5.0
This is the best book light that I have found and I have had a few of them. You don't have to worry about recharging it because it only takes 1 AAA battery and it lasts a long time.  It is light weight and great for travel and is plenty bright to read by but doesn't light up the whole room. I have a Kindle and use it for that all the time.,5.0
"I love it. It is a good quality light. Batteries included, 3AAA. It has 2 little lights so you can have it softer or stronger",5.0
I am very happy with Mighty Bright book light. It has two bulbs but I only use one and it is very bright. It does not bother my husband either! It takes triple A batteries so will be easy to replace.,5.0
"No issues with this little light at all.  The clip works well, the light adjusts easily and holds its position.  It is very bright, so I always use it on the lower setting (and even then it is quite bright).  Haven't had an issue with the battery.  It's just a perfect little light!",5.0

I love this little book light! It is perfect for reading in bed when my spouse is trying to sleep. I love that is had 2 brightness levels too!,5.0
"Such a simple blessing this clip-on light is for adding just the right amount of light. Flexible shaft allows really close to distant lighting softness. Wife just loves this. She even turns it on to light up the bedroom at night so she can see and not disturb my sleeping. So not just for reading. Have used it for anytime we needed a little extra lighting somewhere such as reading labels on products or grabbing serial numbers on the back of some electronics. Clip it anywhere, adjust the shaft and away you go!",5.0
"Purchased this to give as a gift for someone who prefers to read books. They were thrilled and mentioned that the light is great--very bright. The light is light-weight and compact and can be carried inside of your purse or pocket. Very easy to travel with, takes up very little room in your baggage.",5.0
I am a dental student and I have a lot of hard copy textbooks. I loved this light and it was very useful for my books which were not on my kindle. It is really good and very bright and you have 2 switches to alter the light settings. I am very pleased!,5.0

The kindle light is very bright. It illluminates the whole page. I can use it in bed and it doesn't bother my husband. My neighbor wants one too.,5.0
"This was my first book light i have every purchased and as the reviews say , Excellent !!!!
Has 2 settings and is adjustable . Nothing more to say but great purchase",5.0
"Purchased both. Flex2 is for regular reading - bright light for 2 pages. TravelFlex is smaller but it lights one page, and light is less intensive. I have ordered the second Flex2 for my wife. It is cozy and cute.",5.0

"This book light is fantastic. Easy to adjust with the bendy neck, and lights up both pages. Very bright too. I use it almost every night.",5.0
Does just what I want it to do--lights my book while hubbie snores. I use it plugged in. NBD. The flexible neck concentrates the light where I want it. Not heavy at all. I'm very happy with it.,5.0
"Over our 17 year marriage, I have probably purchased 8 or 9 bedtime lights for my wife's reading addiction. All had same problems: high battery consumption, extremely expensive replacement batteries or light. This little LED solved all previous misgivings...She love's it!",5.0
Very light weight and really lights up the pages of the book so you don't have to squint. Highly recommended.,5.0
"This little light is a gem! Bright light to read by even on low setting, using only one LED. Light illuminates both pages of an open book,  and stays attached to the cover of the book without coming loose, and also without marking the book where it is attached. Cannot recommend this reading light highly enough!",5.0
I use this light with my Nook tablet (the original) and I'm very pleased. I clip the light on the top corner and it stays there without a problem. The unit is not overly bulky so there's not too much weight added. The lights themselves (there are two) are impressive. I like the option to have only one or both on at the same time. The bendable neck is versatile and allows me to position the head so I get good light without glare off the sidewalls of the Nook. Great buy.,5.0
"This light is so powerful, even when you're using only 1 LED instead of 2. Also, it has a base that has weight, but doesn't weigh too much. It barely adds to the weight of a book. Also, it stands up if you want it to, so you can use it for other things, not just reading.  Makes for a great ""middle of the night"" light. Definitely an AWESOME buy!",5.0
Bought this for my son who likes to read in bed. Its easily clips to his bunk bed and gives him lots of light to read.,5.0
This is the best light.  I use it for my original kindle keyboard.  Think of a car with high beam and low beam.  That is what this little lights does and it doesn't flicker like cheap lights do.  You will love it.,5.0
"After purchasing many booklights, this one finally is bright enough.
It is everything that was promised.
As bright as you want and holds onto books tightly.
I am a very satisfied customer.",5.0
"This was our second unit because the first was so useful. Love the different brightness settings, the flexible neck and easy to clip on base.",5.0
"I purchased it for my wife so she could read books with the light turned off while we sit in bed. I know, I know, I sound like a old geezer. But hey, the Mrs. wanted one so I got it for her in her favorite color. It works and has held up pretty good since I purchased it a couple months ago. We also used to navigate our apartment during a power outage. LOL! This thing comes in handy! I highly recommend this product.",5.0
"I have had one of these lights for several years, and I love it.  I bought another one for my son.  I use mine for reading my older kindle that does not have a backlight, and reading books.  It does slip around some, but that is not a big problem.  It does use three AAA batteries, which I don't have to change often.  If you are looking for a good bright book light, this one would fill the bill.",5.0
"The brightness is something you cannot compare. I have always been a fan of L.E.D.s and the ones used in this light are designed for one thing, brightness. I haven't been able to test the battery life because I am using it less than I thought I would. But I can't imagine the life being too short. Great Product buy this, rather than taking a chance on a cheaper light that may not be bright it enough for you. Do things right the first time.",5.0
"Got this for my nephew, a book worm. He can clip in on a book at night to read in bed, or onto the headboard of his bed. The light is super bright but small and focussed. It's held up well so far.",5.0
Have an original kindle without back-lighting and a plain case. Read multiple reviews of portable lights before purchase. This illuminate well and does NOT have the glare that so many others seem to produce..,5.0

"this lamp is great I get great use out of it, thank you for the lamp guys i would purchase again.",5.0
"Bought for use with my Kindle....it's an absolute necessity.  Matter of fact, bought another one for my 75-year old mother because she was eyeing mine.  LOL",5.0
This product came quickly and in great shape as stated.  My daughter uses this little book lamp every evening when she reads before going to bed.,5.0
"i purchased this to use as a podium light at work.  It clamps onto the side of the podium nicely and is very bright.  If the highest setting is too bright for the speaker, she/he has the option to use the lower setting, and can adjust it into many different positions.  I was so impressed with this little light, I purchased two more for home use.",5.0
"Nice and bright, I bought three, one for each of my sons. Sturdy. The first set of batteries are still going nice and bright.",5.0
This is a good light and I like that it has 2 different levels of light. Good clamp too. Good buy.,5.0
"I have been an avid reader since childhood. Having a husband and 4 children hasn't changed my love of reading, only changed my schedule, I do most of my reading late at night while my brood sleeps. Our children have always co- slept with us while very young, so we've had a pretty constant parade of little people in our bed since becoming parents.

I have tried several E book readers, Sony, Nook, Aleratek, the Kindle app on my tablet, etc. I like them OK and I do use them for travel, but I am an old school reader I guess, nothing replaces a paperback in my hand. The fact that I am reading a paperback, have our current roommate, our 17 month old, in the room along with my hubby whom gets up at 0' dark :30 most mornings, means that I need a good, reliable book light.

I have owned several different ones throughout the years, some cheap, some expensive, but can honestly say that this is the best one I have had. This is my 3rd one of these. My first one was lost, house full of children.. who knows what happened to it! I have had my other one for quite a while now and have no problems out of it. I have purchased this new one simply because one of my children has become a fellow book lover and has been snagging my light lately. So, it was time to add another one to my bedside drawer.

There are a few things that make this book light my fave and make it better then the others I've owned :

1. The ability to stand on its own :
 This is a biggie for me, especially when reading my paperbacks. I have never liked having to clip a light onto to my book, its too heavy and weighs the book down and I don't like having to unclip and move with every page turn, as most of them aren't stable enough when clipped only to the cover.

2. The 2 light feature:
This is great, as it gives you the ability to customize the lighting to your needs and not waste extra battery power if the extra light is not necessary.

3. Brightness:
Speaking of the 2 light feature, this is one of the brightest lights I have owned when on the 2 light setting. Some book lights I have had start off bright and fade over time and repeated use and some just aren't very bright to begin with. This little sucker is plenty bright! I never have to move it over to see the next page or shuffle it around to try and chase the words around the page, yeah been there with those weak little book lights.

4. Wall adapter :
This is a very nice feature. Its great for those times you run out of batteries in the middle of the night.

5. The Flexi- neck :
Or should I say, the flexi-neck that actually works. Yes, most of the book lights I have owned have some sort of flexibility option, but not all of them work properly. Some of them are too stiff to actually provide a large range of motion or the last one I owned prior to finding this wonderful light was just the opposite, too loose. If I tried to arch the neck over like a goose neck, it would flop over, It would only stay up if it was straight up, meaning that the light was facing down at the book.
 With this light, If you are using the self standing feature as appose to clipping it on your book, you cannot bend it too far on either side or it will fall over, but you can bend it all the way over in the front and it still stands fine. This has not posed as a problem at all for me and shouldn't for anyone else either, as the light output is bright and radiates far enough that you do not really need to bend it different ways too be able to see, like is necessary with some book lights.

The battery life seems about average to me. I have had many that do not last as long,and seemed to go through batteries rapidly. but have had a few that do have a little better battery power life. The wall adapter makes that a non issue though.

OK, so I know this was a rather long review for a $15 book light, but for us book lovers, our book lights are a very important essential. I use this light on a nightly basis and it offers me my escape for the day. After a long day of being a mommy to 4 children, a wife and helping my hubby run our business we own, reading is my respite.

I would definitely recommend this light for any book reader.",5.0
"This light is wonderful. The light covers the whole page; the clasp holds onto the book well, and it's light-weight. I love this light.",5.0
I was going to purchase a magnifying glass before I read about this.  Having enough light on the page really makes a difference especially when one is 74.  Most places where I read don't have enough light.  The BART trains  go through tunnels and my page illumination remains constant.  I am getting more as gifts.,5.0
"I read a lot, especially at night, out on the patio.  This light is perfect.  It's lightweight and doesn't get in the way of reading or turning pages.  The light is bright enough that I can read very well, even in total darkness.  A great purchase at a great price.",5.0
"I have been a fan of mighty bright for a while, so I ordered this knowing it would live up to my expectations. This book light is very small, making it one of the cutest lights I've seen. I love the flexible goose-neck it has, making it very flexible and able to see from several angles.",5.0
Getting to where I can't read small print at night.  This light is great.  Like that I have the double bulb option.,5.0
"I bought this with very little expectations and now I must say, I LOVE IT!

Built to last, the light is perfect for reading; not too bright, not to tenuous; and the two way light is a great feature. I can totally recommend this anyone who enjoys reading at night, before going to bed like me.

But this is not only for reading purposes; you can use it for ANYTHING due to its size and twist neck. From drawing, sewing, even fixing something beneath your car. 100% recommended.",5.0
"I like the one or two light button on this book lamp. Since it is LED, the batteries seem to last a long time (insert a plug here for ""eneloop"" rechargeable batteries).Yeah, the clamp on part moves a bit, but it is a small price to pay for the positives of this book-light (did i mention how lightweight it is?). I liked this light enough to buy another for my mate. As a bonus, it is small enough to use it as a travel light. Five stars!",5.0
Best booklight I have found.  Really bright and provides excellent coverage.  I also like that you can choose for both LEDs to be on or just one to save battery life.,5.0
"This is a terrific light, I've been using it in the evening when I don't want to turn a lamp on to work on crochet projects at home.  Both the higher and lower settings give off a good amount of light.  The fact it uses batteries is even better because I can take it with me for anywhere I might need more light.  The clip is a great size also, have been clipping it to the edge of a table and the edge of a desk, it stays put even when the cats are chasing each other over the furniture!",5.0
"It's Long enough to hover light on the whole page of your book, hardcover to paperback, flexible enough for people who hold their books with one side folded behind the other, and bright enough to let you see a dark room at night.
The brightness depends on the battery's power, if it becomes dim, it's  time to change the battery, I recommend energizer. And it does a 360 flexibility but sometimes it won't go all the way around or it will retract abruptly. Overall Love it!",5.0
"When my first one died, I knew Ihad to get a new one. Even though I don't need it for bedside reading anymore because I got a Paperwhite for that, I like to use it as a nightlight until I get settled in with my book since my husband usually goes to bed before me.  I like that it has two levels of light (I bought a replacement for this and ordered the wrong one, and while it is nice as well and did keep it, I wanted the dual light like I had). It's great if you need it for your books too if you don't have a lighted device. I got an extra one for backup in case this one becomes extinct. I don't believe you will be disappointed.",5.0
"Now that it is getting dark earlier, I like to read my books on my enclosed porch. This little light is great. It has a sturdy clip and a "" mighty bright light to read by"". It also has two light settings to control the brightness. I had an old Mighty Bright Light that I had for over 5 years. I would still be using the old one, but I dropped it on concrete and the clip broke. The new one is lighter weight, the neck is more bendable, and the light is much brighter.",5.0
"If what you want is a pretty bright, relatively long lasting lamp to read by.  It clips onto a book or sits on a table by itself so it is great for those of us who have a cabin in the woods and like to read after dark.  Not a big demographic but a grateful one.  Also good for reading in bed and not waking up your husband.",5.0
"This is a great little kindle light. The led is very bright, but the fact that you can angle the head means that I can read at night without disturbing my husband!",5.0
definetly serves its purpose and my favorite part about it is that it wasn't expensive. works good and also a good price. would recommend !,5.0
"I use this at night to read or use my laptop in bed so it doesn't disturb my wife.  Works as advertised.  Has three settings- off, on, and extra bright.  I've been using it sparingly so no comment on the lifespan of batteries or led.",5.0
I use this light maybe half of the week... Its bright but not too much. Clips on easily and id very light. Stays were it should. Great buy,5.0
These lights are awesome!  I bought 2 of these to use for my mobile DJ setup.  They clip on and stay on.  The lights are bright enough for me to see everything.  I highly recommend these.,5.0
Had a prior Mighty Brite that we liked and tried another. This one is even brighter than the last. Good deal.,5.0
"This light is very bright, stays clipped well and uses AAA batteries.  So no having to find a specialty battery when it starts going dim....which is going to be a while.  Great light!!",5.0
I am very happy with my light. I can read in bed and not keep my husband awake. I use mine plugged in so I do not have to worry about batteres.,5.0
"When you are reading a book in the evening , you do not disturb the person sleeping next to you.",5.0
"I purchased this one based solely on the reviews, and WOW, they're right! It's a great light, strong clip, and quite bright. Does everything it's supposed to do, and at a terrific price! This will make a great gift for your favorite book lovers.",5.0
"I really appreciate this so I can read in bed after the kids (they co-sleep) and or my husband go to sleep and not disturb them. It is bright, but I prefer that. It has two settings: one bulb on or two bulbs on. Very pleased with purchase and much cheaper than an ipad or tablet for reading too! I also use it to help slow down the kids pace and draw attention to Bible story time before bed too by it being the only light on as we do story time together.",5.0
great,5.0
"Love it

- Light weight
- Clips on easily
- Looks nice
- Bends easily in any direction
- Has a nice and cool LED light",5.0
"Bought this for my son so he could wind down at night, and read in his bed. its Nice and bright, clips on well, soft white glow, easy on the eyes, wouldn't change a thing!",5.0
"This thing is terrific!  Love that it is plugged into the wall most of the time, but has battery option (if power is out), or not near power source.  Nice bright light, and goose neck directs light as needed.  Best book light I've found.  Had it a few years and not replaced any bulbs either!!  Yippie!!",5.0
"I had one before and it was broken by our dog.  Bought another because the first was so good, especially the ability to switch for one or two bulbs for brightness.",5.0
"We have slats on our headboard for our bed, very convenient to clip onto that and read. Light is good and bright. Might be heavy to clip onto a book.",5.0
"One light works just fine for a small book, i cant imagine needing 2 unless you just particularly like VERY bright light. One light is almost but not quite enough light on a large book, good thing theres two!

Clip holds tight to any number of pages and the neck is firmy even if you flop the book around more then you would while reading.

I had simple expectations for a book light... this managed to exceed them.",5.0
"This light is fantastic!  It's not too heavy, I use it on paperback books which I hold with one hand and it doesn't strain my wrist or anything.  The lights are very bright and you can opt to have one or both on.  I usually opt for just one.  It casts a lot of light on my book, I can read both pages without having to adjust the light (I'm reading standard size paperback books), however that light doesn't spill over and disturb my daughter.  The neck is extremely flexible and can be finely adjusted, yet it holds its shape wherever you put it.  I would highly recommend this light.",5.0
"My husband goes to sleep earlier than me and I like to read a bit in bed so this has served the purpose well! It covers both pages and you can bend the arm in any direction. This comes with a power supply cord, but you can also use AAA batteries.",5.0
Recommended to me by a friend.  It lights up my kindle and paperbacks and makes easy reading on my outside porch at night.,5.0
"Got this awhile back and seriously I have given this thing a beating and it still goes. I got this for school and alternatively as a car light to use around at night. It is very bright, almost too bright in bed. I could see that being an issue if someone next to you was easily bothered by light. It has two bulbs and two settings: 1 light or 2, but 1 is all you need and there's not too big a difference between having 1 or both on. Its seriously rugged too. I keep this in my book bag and it has been slammed, beaten and crushed more times than I can count and still runs fine- I know this because every time I open my bag after carelessly tossing it around I find this light on and plugging away. Thats seriously prob my only issue is that if you put this in your book bag it will most likely get turned on and drain your batteries so try to find a safe place for it other wise really well-made book lamp for a really good price.",5.0
"Great lamp for night readers and travelers. Nice light, good flexibility and batteries last forever. The only concern that I have with this lamp is based on my experience with the same model bought few years ago (and still in use): seems like the light switch can go bad and it few clicks might be required to turn on/off the light.",5.0
"I love this night light. I'm not allowed to turn on lights in the bedroom to read.  My husband complains.  If I go to another room, my 3 dogs follow me.  So that's no fun.  Now I'm able to read without disturbing anyone.  I can read in comfort.  Yay!",5.0
"This is my 4th and is by far the best. 1) Bright LED light, two settings (half and full brightness.) 2) Bright enough to light both facing pages at the same time without repositioning. 3) Gooseneck stands high enough to allow page turns without repositioning every time. 4) Clip-on is shallow enough to nestle in the book spine, even when the book is closed, without destroying the binding. (Means you never have to reposition it, even between sittings.) 5) Uses 3 triple A batteries, lasts much longer than book lights using the flat 2032 batteries. 6) Did I mention the bright white LED light? Far better than the older incandescent bulbs. Also throws a wide spray (I have another booklight with an LED light, but the area covered is not much bigger than a silver dollar, Ugh.) Highly recommend this one! Costs a little more, but it puts the first three I bought to shame.",5.0
"Perfect product.

Been working great for 3 months with no problems.  Haven't had any problems or complaints.  Perfect for reading in the car!",5.0
"Very light, very bright, but can be dimmed down one, attach it to your book or your bed or your pillow even and just guide the flexible neck of the light where you need the light to shine.",5.0
I JUST LOVET IT! AM AN AVID NIGHT-TIME READER BUT ALWAYS FOUND IT HARD TO TURN OFF THE LAMP ON MY NIGHT TABLE (HAVE A BAD BACK !!) THIS LITTLE LIGHT IS SO EASY AND GIVES GREAT LIGHT ON BOTH PAGES OF WHATEVER TYPE OF BOOK I'M READING...BE IT PAPERBACK OR HARDCOVER..EASY TO ADJUST.. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!,5.0
This light is the best that is out there right now - it's inexpensive and lights up both pages evenly while being flexible enough to position wherever you'd like it!,5.0
Te beautiful thing about this book light is that it produces a pure field of bright light without any hot spots. It has great battery life too. The neck is easy to adjust but firm enough that it stays where you put it. You can also stand it on a table. Quite simply the best book light I've owned.,5.0
"Maybe even too bright. I got this to read in my baby's room, but this wakes her up. I will have to stick to reading from my phone. This might be good for reading next to a spouse who is not to sensitive to light.",5.0
Worked well right out of the box.  Allowed my spouse to read as late into the night as she wanted without disturbing me.  Now that we have both moved on to backlit ereaders I use this light on my work bench to highlight smaller jobs.,5.0
"This light is very bright, reliable and not too heavy.  It has two settings, and so far I have only needed the dimmer of the two.  The light is very concentrated also, which is good if you don't want to wake someone else in the room up.  Would purchase it again.",5.0
"I love this light!  It has two settings, and it is both very bright and very directed, allowing my bed mate to sleep soundly while I read into the night.",5.0
Wonderful. Lights up the page nicely and no longer have to sqirm around in the chair to get the correct lighting to see what I'm reading. Tops.,5.0
My front seat passenger needs to illuminate her clipboard without affecting my vision. This attaches easily then does exactly that.,5.0
I had a different book light before this one.  It was too dim and it didn't cover the entire page I was reading.  This light is perfect.  There are two different light settings which is nice.  It stays put on all of my books and so does the adjustable arm.  The best thing about this light is that it takes batteries.  The ones that come with it don't last long though and you will notice the light dim.  I put new batteries in it and it is much better.  I know the LED lights last a long time too so I am set.,5.0
Two brightness settings + lenses evenly distribute light + LED bulbs last forever + uses standard batteries + sturdy bookclip + infinitely repositionable gooseneck = happy reader,5.0

"Works great, flexible shaft and I can choose the level of Light for my needs.  Sometimes I use it as a flashlight",5.0
I bought this light because my daughter likes to read in the early morning hours. Since it's too early to turn the light on I hoped this lamp would be bright enough and it is. I've also borrowed the lamp a few times when I'm doing my needlework and need a good bright light.,5.0
"My husband has gone through many book lights.  This was one of his first, until the kids disassembled it, and after quite a few book light failures after, we ordered another of these, and it is still of high quality.  It has a great neck, a strong clip, bright lights that don't fade or blink, multiple brightnesses (two bulbs, three lighting choices), and was a decent price for one that we expect to last a while.  Coming from someone who has bought many book lights, I would recommend the Mighty Bright lights over less-expensive lights- in this case, you really do get what you pay for.  Cheaper varieties left me disappointed.",5.0
THis is a great light and works really well. It's bright but not glaring. I did notice a little bit of screen glare but I think that would be the case with any light.,5.0
"Bright, but has 2 settings which is exactly what I was looking for. Casts just the right amount of light. I would recommend this to friends.",5.0
"This clip on light makes it easier to read in the dark. If reading a book, it casts light well enough to cover both pages. It has low and high settings. I was so used to reading in bed with my Kindle, when I had some hardcover books to read, I couldn't disturb my husband with the table light. This really resolved my problem.",5.0
"I got this to use while on a flight and loved it.

For those who do needlework, this is lightweight (not heavy like you may think), fits on a qsnap and the flexible light is quite handy.  Would definitely recommend.

Not sure how long the batteries will last; but I think that I saw where a rechargeable adapter could be purchased...",5.0
Bought 3 for my family. They all liked it and said it's really a bright little light! Nice it came with batteries!,5.0
"Its small, portable & flexible. I can study without disturbing others. Light is very soothing for eyes. I will carry it while in journey.",5.0
"Works great and lasts a long time! This is my third Mighty Bright. Two for me and one for my granddaughter. I am a night time reader and fall asleep with the light on, so the lamp is lit all night. I bought the plug in adapter to save on batteries.
Love it.",5.0
"The lighting in my house seems terrible, at least for me.  Additionally, at night, I was unable to use a lamp if my wife wanted to go to sleep and I wanted to continue reading.  This little gem now allows me to have perfect lighting to read at night and not disturb my wife.  I ended up purchasing a portable desk, also on Amazon, and this clips perfectly to the desk so I don't even need to clip it to a book.

There are two settings...high with 2 LED's on, and low with 1 LED on.  I like using high when there is other light in the room, but inadequate light for reading.  I like using low when the room is completely dark.

I've also attached the light to a ""normal"" desk to give me some well-needed light in my music studio.

If you want, there is also an AC plug for an adapter (not included) if you didn't want to use the batteries.

The gooseneck is very flexible, but sturdy at the same time after positioning it.  Very happy with the purchase.",5.0
"I've never been much of a reader until recently. I have this set-up right next to bed stand, unattached with the big plastic clip. It works perfectly. Love the two light settings so I can decide how much light I actually need. Not to mention it can be plugged in. I recommend this product!",5.0
Love this book light.  It is nice and bright without being annoying to others in a dark room.  Love the feature where you can control how bright the light is.,5.0
It works great and it lasts a long time on one set of batteries. My son uses it every night to read books in bed.,5.0
Now I don't have to keep my husband up at night with a big light on in the bedroom.  I lovely!,5.0
"... not sure why it's in ""kitchen"". He's tiny but powerful little guy. It's great to hook onto my headboard and, not that I have anyone in bed with me, but it would not disturb your partner. As it is powerful but pretty exact. Highly suggested!",5.0
"Light weight, portable, provides good light for reading.  Easy to move due to flexible neck.  Can use stand alone on its base or can clip onto reading material.",5.0

"I use this light every night to do my Kindle reading.  It is very bright, and features two bulbs, each of which can be lit on its own, or you can use both (like me).  This really does the job.  I highly recommend it to e-book readers.",5.0
I am happy with this purchase and which that I had bought two.  Good light .  Keeps both pages in the light.,5.0
"This book light is FANTASTIC!!! It comes with an a/c adapter, and you can also run it on batteries, so you can take it with you on-the-go. It shines really bright! It clips on your kindle cover or onto a book. You can even purchase a Mighty Bright 80910 Bright Light Cradle, which the light connects to so you can set light on table to use. It`s really great! Also, it fits in my purse so it goes with me wherever I go. It`s available at amazon.com  Great quality! Best deal!",5.0
I love love love this light! It is super bright which helps me stay awake when reading. I use it as a night light also it easy clips onto everything!! The battery last forever (left it on one whole night & still has yet to die). It is amazing. I love love love it! Highly Recommend.,5.0
"This ""simple"" unit will replace a similar one that I have had for 15+ years.  I use it as a night light, by clipping it to the shade on the lamp on my night table next to my bed.",5.0
"I love my lil light. I've had it for about a mo. can't believe how much light it gives off. It offers 2 settings.  1 light or 2 lights. i usually just use 1 light.  the clip is firm, moves just fine. I'd buy it again.  The price is a steal.",5.0
"I was tired of using headlamps to read at night. I ordered this book light, not expecting much because I have not had much luck with them in the past. This light surprised me by far exceeding my expectations. It is very bright and a lot smaller than I was expecting.",5.0
"What can I say, this does the job just great. Firm light holder with a long arm so I can position it anywhere and it stays. Clip is strong and have had no problems on paperbacks or hardbacks. Light is BRIGHT, almost too bright. I always keep just one light on since I read in bed while husband is asleep. I like that the batteries are standard and I don't have to go hunt for those expensive watch batteries for replacements.",5.0
"When travelling, there is not always that handy bedside lamp.  This light works really well, clipped on to my book and with two light intensities and a bendable coil lamp, all that I could hope for in a book light.  Just ordered another for my daughter who has been coveting mine.",5.0
Good reading light in the dark.  Like the 2 brightness levels.  Well worth the price.  No complaints on this one.,5.0
"Wow, great light, very bright has two setting, and easy to use, allows me to read in bed without distrubing my husband, and the neck is adjustable, strong clip to hold pages.",5.0
I have now tried at least 5 different bedtime reading lights. This is by far the best. The clip is strong and stays in place. The light is very bright even on the lower setting and the arm is long enough and flexible enough to be moved to whatever position you need. I would absolutely recommend this light.,5.0
This arrived on time and packaged very nicely and it is a fantastic little gadget. I really like it and use it not just for reading but if I just want a little more light on something. Have used it for photography too.,5.0
"We got one for my wife's Kindle, she loved it, so we got a couple more for our lap tops. The light is adjustable, very bright, and the batteries hold up for a long time.",5.0
"I have had an old clunky book light, with a battery attachment for years. It finally had the wire split off, so no longer fixable. I love this book light.",5.0
".....and gave them as Christmas gifts.  Everyone was thrilled ... they travel well and live in the kitchen, bedroom, living room, anywhere you  need a quick bright light.",5.0
"This was cheaper than a new kindle cover with light.

The two levels of light work well and the batteries last a long time.",5.0
I am very happy with this light.  I really like that the light has two levels for lighting.  The base works well with both being clipped on a book or setting it on a flat surface.  I also like that you have the option of using a power cord (sold separately) to operate it.,5.0
"I got this for my girlfriend and I think I'm going to get one for myself. The intention was for her to use the light to read while I sleep, but I've found it to be so helpful in providing flat, even and powerful illumination that I use it even when I'm alone! The light really is very, very even with no fall-off or shadows within the beam. It easily covers facing pages of a hardcover book, and it doesn't quite illuminate all of a textbook. The light stops pretty abruptly at the edge, which is a good sign - there's no fade off. After so many years of using b-list, subpar book lights, I didn't think I could get one for less than $50 that would be any good. Totally wrong!",5.0
"I am very happy with this light. I bought it so that I can sit outdoors and read at night. It is plenty bright, even for my middle-aged eyes, and the clip works well for my purposes (I've tried clipping it to the case of my Kindle and to a book).  This Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 is identical to the Kindle version, EXCEPT that it is cheaper and includes the three required AAA batteries.  Buy this version!!!",5.0
"This light works very well for books and newspapers. Like most led's it creates some glare on glossy magazines, however it is not bad and was advertised as a book light, not a magazine light.",5.0
"I have this in my bedroom to read when my boyfriend falls asleep. It is bright enough so I can read easily, yet doesn't wake him. Fits perfectly on my Kindle's cover.",5.0
"My first light lasted 3 years of nightly use. My husband won't let me use the night stand light, so I love Mighty Bright",5.0
Got this for my wife who likes to do crossword puzzles before going to sleep. Works perfectly for her and I can sleep without being disturbed!,5.0
"So glad I bought this book light. It uses regular AAA batteries (3), instead of watch type batteries. It's bright enough to read both pages on the book on the one light setting and seems to last longer than the watch-type book lights. It also can clip on the cover I use with my kindle. And the neck has good flexibility to bend it to best position over the book.",5.0
This light is the best!  Good battery life and I thought it was the perfect amount of light for reading in bed at night.  If it is too bright you can use one of the bulbs instead of both.  It's the perfect little book light.,5.0
"This book light works just fine. The neck does not move and adjusts anywhere you need it to go. The clip is strong and fat and hold the book securely. I like the option of a high and low setting. The buttons are nice and crisp.
It seemed to work best on non-glossy paper. I had no trouble using this with regular paperback books. When I use this with a E-ink or a glossy page, such as a comic book, it has a lot of glare. I wish the light had a dimmer wider pattern setting for these sorts of books. You can usually find an okay angle with E-ink. This can be very frustrating with comics since you are continuously looking in different areas. I have the same problems with lamps and room lights in general so it is not just the book lights fault. It's easy to move a book when your by a stationary lamp, but when the light is attached to the book you have to move the light. This is my only complaint with this light and if they would have solved this problem it would be a perfect and amazing product.",5.0
I like the two brightness settings.  And the flexible arm is great.  I use this in bed every night before going to sleep.  My spouse is not bothered by the light because it's focused on my book pages and not illuminating the whole room.  I also like that I can change the batteries and they are AAA instead of some expensive 'watch-type' batteries. Perfection!,5.0
"It was bigger than I expected but I love it. Great light, it's cool that have 2 lights. I wanted to carry it  with me to read on bus but is too big for it.",5.0
"I didn't/don't have high expectations for this but so far, am quite happy with it.  It stays put, and sheds plenty of light, and I feel all snug and cozy reading in bed now because the rest of the room is dark and I don't have to get up to turn out the light.",5.0
I bought this reading light based on its high Amazon rating and I wasn't disappointed. It is small and practical. No complaints.,5.0
"This is a life saver! The light is bright and even keeping the batteries in (though it suggests you don't) for a while it keeps its batteries good and can be used a long while before changing them out. I've used it on paperbacks and on my kindle (standard kindle, no back light) and it works good on both with no problem. The clip is strong and doesn't move all over the place. You can move the bendable neck all over the place as well as the actual lamp too. I was skeptical of the other reviews about being able to be in total darkness and read but its true! I've even used it as a flash light. I love that you can either use one or both of the two lights as well. I would definitely purchase more as gifts or as a back up!",5.0
"Best clip on light ever.  Light is perfect, clips on the headboard or book, swivels totally out of the way.  Perfect!",5.0
I had to find a way to read my kindle at night without keeping hubby awake and this is the perfect solution. It works great and was a great price. I plan on buying another as a gift.,5.0
"Because after you see how great this thing really is, you will want more.  I'm thinking of using them as picture lights also.",5.0
Purchased this as a gift for my Mother.  She uses it for her Kindle and loves it. SO happy with the color choices.  The pink is even prettier than the picture.  Great product!,5.0
"You can use this bright light with batteries, but having the adapter makes this a better light because you save money on batteries. You can clip it on a book to read and you can click it on for bright and click again for even brighter light. The goose-neck makes it easy to move in just the right position too. I have even used this light clipped onto one of my sewing machines to get more light on my sewing. Not all sewing machines will have a place for the clip though, but I imagine you could stick it in place with some of that peel and stick adhesive if you wanted it for that purpose.",5.0
Gives plenty of light to read in bed with other lights out.  Battery lasts a long time and clips very sturdy to books.,5.0
"I bought this book light about four months ago and use it four or five nights a week. It is wonderful. The light is bright but not harsh to the eyes. The clamp is strong and easy to use. The flexible gooseneck is an especially nice feature. I've even found that I can keep this light clipped onto the headboard of my bed and it makes a nice night light, available at the touch of a button. When clipped to a book, it illuminates both pages of the book at once so you can forget all about it and enjoy your reading! I would recommend this to anyone- it is worth every penny!",5.0
I loved my white one so much I bought the purple one for my mom. she loves herse so much too. :),5.0
"This lightweight dandy is great - flexes in ways I didn't think possible, has two light settings and the clip part really holds well.  I am researching rechargeable batteries for it, because I use it so often and don't like adding batteries to the landfills. Other have mentioned ordering a cord which plugs into an outlet, but I haven't seen that (yet, need to search better) in the places I looked for this light.  I also ordered one for my husband, who loves it as much as I do.

As for the quality of the light, you just can't do better, imo.  I love the two setting and use them both, depending on surroundings and the size of the type I'm reading (can we say reading glasses, anyone?), but with either one, you get good, bright but not blinding light.

And okay, this won't matter to most people, but I love purple. Ha, who knew there was a purple reading light that not only works but works wonderfully well?  Win, win for me!",5.0
I have used this light a million times and it functions just fine. Rough movements can cause it to move a little but its no problem to readjust. The two brightness levels are great but I always use the single bulb setting. It gives off plenty of light. I have yet to change the batteries and there is no sign of dimming yet.,5.0
"I love to read at night, and this little book light helps give me the proper amount of reading light after I've turned all the other bedroom lights.  No problems.  Hope it lasts.",5.0
"This book light is great, I love it.  I purchased one for myself & my daughter and ordering another one for my son.  It gives great light to read at night in bed.  It also has 2 levels of light.  The clip is strong and sturdy.  I highly recommend this light.",5.0
"We have at leat 10 book light of varios styles and they all seem to have the same issues, they cause excesive glare and only light up a part of the book so you have to keep readjusting the light.  However the XtraFlex2 is great, Wide beam of light and the neck is long enough to be adjusted to eliminate glare.  Although it has 2 LEDs we only use it on low and it still lights up the room.  Definitly a Buy It !",5.0
I wasted my money on pleanty of cheep book lights before I stumbled on this one.  We use it every night to read to our son and he uses it too.  Don't waste your time go right for this light.,5.0

"My son is what you would call a quintessential procrastinator.  He waits until the last minute, when we need to rush out the door for one of his activities, to do his homework.  Or remember that he has any.  So, he'd turn the light on inside the car while I was driving, distracting to no end!  I got him this for Christmas, thinking he would grumble at getting such a lame gift.  But he loves it!  And now, we're both happy! Well, happier, I'd be happy if he wasn't procrastinating any longer...",5.0
"Remember when things like this were $30.00? It's inexpensive and works terrific. Tip: if you are travelling and don't want it turning on in your bags, just take one of the batteries out. Even works good to illuminate your laptop keyboard!",5.0
This a great reading light! It features two levels of brightness and the stream of light is really concentrated so that it hits my book while leaving my husband's side of the bed dark enough for him to fall asleep.,5.0
"Now I can read without the voice of my little sister saying that I should close the lights !!
Great Idea Nicely done amazing Look !
The light is Perfect not that hurt your eyes or that you don't see ! Just perfect
But it king of annoying that in every page I have to remove and stick it to the new pages !",5.0
"I have a favorite chair in a nook that I read in....until the light fixture died.  I went out hunting for a good book light that I could use that wouldn't disturb anyone else and, let me tell you, there are thousands of them out there!!!!  I saw this one and, even though it was a bit more expensive, I decided to give it a try.  I didn't want something that was too heavy (for paperbacks) or so bright that you couldn't read the page or didn't put out enough light to be able to read.  This one works perfectly!  It's nice to be able to switch from 2 lights to one and it's not too heavy (even with the batteries) to clip onto a paperback!  It distributes the light evenly and the bendy neck makes it so you can adjust the light to the size of book you're reading.  It's a great little item!  Thanks Amazon for carrying such a wonderful assortment!!!",5.0

"This reading light is great.  I bought it for my daughter who refuses to go to sleep, so I figured she could use it to read and not disturb everyone else with her bright lights radiating down the hall.  It clips right to her bed and is super flexible so you can bend it however.  It also has 2 light settings - one brighter and one a little less bright.  I steal it from her constantly to read in bed.  Love it.",5.0
"I bouight 4 of these lights - 3 for my granddaughters and one for me.  They range in age from 6 to 10 and love reading and writing stories.  To further encourage reading, I decided to buy lamps for reading, and when I saw the colors the XtraFlex2 LED came in, I decided to buy these of them in their favorite colors -- also there couldn't be any questions which one belonged to who.  I love my light, especially when you don't want a bright lamp light on.",5.0
I have a similar light from Fulcrum that I use for a nightlight and a flashlight when necessary. I love it and was going to buy another. (Their giant so-called BBQ light is on my bedside table too but I do not like it at all. It gives off very little light and constantly needs new batteries). I was tempted to buy this one because I am in love with the color blue. The title of my review explains why I think it was a good deal and will probably buy another one some day.,5.0
Worked just as I expected.  Our priest even used it during the Easter Vigil when the lights were and it worked out great!,5.0
"Sturdy clasp,high and low LED light,thin flexible neck. One feature I like is that you put the three batteries in side by side.

"Perfect for reading. I had one that gave out no light- Not this one! It  is not only long & flexible, it can light up both pages.
I am glad I listened to those who gave good reviews. I am happy with the purchase & the price was great.",5.0
"Nice, bright light - a wonderful change from the crappy book-lights I'm used to. Feels really durable, like it will last. Adjustable neck is strong and easy to shape. The spring-clip is strong but is a touch slippery. However, I haven't had too much trouble with that (even works on the Kindle). Battery went a little faster than I expected, but nothing to worry about. Plus, it's nice to know it can take a wall plug. Great product; recommended.",5.0

I have terrible lamps in my living room for reading.  This light is great with just the right amount of light.  It has a switch for using one or two lights at a time.,5.0
"I've had other book lights in the past and have ended up donating them or throwing them out due to insufficient light. This light is bright (without being too bright) and shows both pages. I hate when I'm trying to read at night and a book light only lights a little of the page, requiring me to move it from top to middle to bottom and/or to the other page while I'm reading. Or when they're not very bright so I can't really see the pages. So annoying! This one shows both pages and I never have to move it. It's also plenty bright to read by, and has two brightness settings. This is my favorite book light ever!",5.0
"When I first opened the pkg. I was a little disappointed as to the size (so small) BUT.... the led lighting is great! and I can clip it to my book as I read in bed at night, as well as it clips to my headboard, which is even better!!! There is no bulky lamb shade hanging over my head at night....it maneuvers so easily that I can tuck it behind the head board !!  I JUST LOVE THIS LITTLE LIGHT!! I would highly recommend this light to anyone looking for a reading lamp! Thank you so much!!!!",5.0

"I purchased two of these to use back stage at a dramatic presentation.  The clip/battery pack is large so it can be clipped to most anything (I clipped one on a step edge).  The switch allows you to choose having one or two LED's lit and the light spread is bright, wide and equal across its view.  The flexible ""goose-neck"" is sturdy and stays in the position it is flexed into.  The quality of workmanship seems excellent.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  They also arrived on time as promised and were packaged securely.  And it even came with batteries!  Cheap ones, but so far I've used them for about 10 hours and they're still going bright!",5.0
I'm using this to light my baby back sit when we are on the road. He now can read his books.,5.0

I am a college student and like to review a chapter in bed so I can soak it all in hopefully. I share a room with my daughter so turning a light on isn't an option. This little light clips to my large text books and lights up both pages! Not sure how this would work on a regular sized small book though...I mean it isn't huge but it might be a bit of an over kill? Live the way it can bend and how bright it is even with just the one light one. So glad I made this purchase!,5.0
This is a good reading light with a couple of different light settings depending on how bright you want it. I approve!,5.0

I immediately went to Amazon.com and found the Mighty Bright in blue; my last one was green. I ordered it and it arrived in a timely manner. I am now a happy camper again. I can see both pages at once and the light makes reading in bed a pleasure. This is the light to own or give as a gift!",5.0
I got this for my sister who likes to read at night. We tried it out in a pitch black room (around 10:00 p.m. with all curtains closed) and it lit up the entire book and almost the entire room. It's small and doesn't give off a lot of heat.,5.0
Exactly what I wanted! The product came in very fast time and was great condition when I opened the box. This light is super bright! Thank you very much!,5.0
It got here on time and I needed it very urgently because I was moving out of state.  I thought it was gonna take too long and messaged them.  They got it to me the next day,5.0
I have vision impairment and need a bright light in order to focus properly.  I put one of these on my exercise bike because I couldn't see the LED display.  Solved the problem!  I also put one on a book stand where I keep my big dictionary.  It is easy to turn on and off and has two light levels.  Great little light.,5.0
"I bought this for my wife, and need to order myself one now too. What a great light. Puts out plenty of light, the stem is plenty long so that you can light up the entire page. Great Product. I love it",5.0
GREAT LIGHT PERFECT BRIGHTNESS ABLE TO ADJUST 1 LIGHT OR 2 VERY FLEXIBLE AND LIGHT ABLE TO USE ANYWHERE ALSO MAKES A GOOD NIGHTLIGHT,5.0
I bought this as a gift for my 7-year old granddaughter who loves to read.  She thinks she is really special being able to read in the dark now!,5.0
"The clamp on this light it padded, so you can use it on a tablet as well as a book.",5.0
It clamps easily on my book or Kindle and stays put.  The light is bright and doesn't use much battery power; the battery lasts a long time.  Great product!,5.0
"This light is great!!! I have tried several book reading lights and this one far exceeds my expectations. If your reading needs include good lighting, I highly suggest you give this light a try.",5.0
"As  most people seem to agree, this is a really bright little light, but what I really like about it is that the clamp on it opens wide, and grips well. I used it as a light on my drill press, and it is perfect. I can clamp it in several different areas, and it holds. It is also long enough that the flex-neck lets me aim it at any angle I need it. It is better than I expected it to be!",5.0
I bought this because I like to read before going to bed and it works perfectly.  I can hook it even on my Nook (the one that has no light).  I recommend it.,5.0
".  This product works great, I like the 2 levels of light, the arm can move to where you need it to shine, and it will stay put once moved into the position you want.",5.0
"Great quality, good size, nice LED light for reading in the dark.  My boyfriend loves it and uses it often with no problems so far (had it for about 4 months).",5.0
"This little led lights are great, you can read while your spouse is sleeping without bothering her with your night table lamp. It has two leds, which makes quite bright, so I use only one at the time, which hope will extend its life. This one can be attached to the book's body, or clamped to your bed, and the flexible neck will allow you to narrow the spotlight even more.",5.0
Good little light! I've only had it for a couple weeks but overall love it! I just hopes it lasts.,5.0
Great for reading in bed at night.  Just flip the button off and go to sleep.  Don't have to get up to turn off the light.,5.0
"This is so useful, I have taken it on vacation and to the hospital.  It can clip to your book or a shirt pocket.",5.0
"I have very low light in my living room which makes ready difficult.  This light is exactly what I needed to solve this problem.  I no longer have difficulty reading.  Also, it packs easily so it is nice when traveling.  I would highly recommend this products.",5.0
Great small light for reading in bed and a great price.  Small to pack in your bags or take in the car.,5.0
"The light has a strong clip that stays on the book.  The neck is very flexible and can bend to any position and it works well on a hardcover or paperback.  The light has two settings - full bright and half bright depending on amount of light needed.  It is perfect to read a book in bed, camping or low light places.  Batterys that come with it do not last as long as better quality batterys but was happy it came with batterys so can use it right out of the package.",5.0
It works. If it's worth the price for you than buy it because it's exactly what it looks like. =D,5.0
"We have had the green one for a year and it works great.  We just ordered one in pink and even though on the box says it's pink, the color looks more mauve and purplish which is still a nice color but not like the color pink shown on website. Battery life is good and 3 AAA batteries are included, also can be used with adapter which is not included.  It clips on better to hardcover books but my son has not complained about use even with paperbacks and great for travel in use on car rides.",5.0
"This little product is amazing. The LEDs are so bright, they can light up a whole room! They aren't an annoying bright though, which is great. Would recommend to someone. I wish it was under $10. It's worth it",5.0
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She showed me the difference between this one and her old one and I couldn't believe I how bright this one is! She even uses it as a nightlight to get to the bathroom. I had to order one for myself! The price is spectacular for the product.,5.0
this is one of the greates products that i've bought from Amazon. great reading lamp on the bedside. i'd recommend it to all.,5.0
"works great i have bought several other lights that just didn't peform well,but this little light is perfect.. and the price is great.",5.0
"When everyone else's lights go out....you can still have yours on without bothering anyone.  Great, bright light for after hours reading.",5.0
This light works perfect for reading in bed. I'm an avid reader and I love this light. I had two but they got worn out (lasted for years). You don't ever have to change the bulb. The light is bright and there's 2 bulbs. You can use one or both. The flex works great when I go from page to page. I purchased two (different colors) because they're hard to find and I can't imagine not having one of these handy book lights.,5.0
"Very well made light and bright too! It's plastic but what isn't these days. Not too cheap at all. i use it as an inexpensive rack light for my stage amps. I love that I don't need to plug it in to get bright light. My eyes are getting bad and I hate fumbling around on a dark stage trying to plug stuff in the right place (if you know what I mean). But NO MORE. I've got a nice bright light whenever and wherever I need it. Battery life seems good so far, still on original batteries. I would buy this again if it got lost or broken.",5.0
"Easy to apply, center, adjust...
I did it in stages for about a week, starting with the keys I used most down to the really obscure keys, such as Scroll Lock",5.0
Works great! Especially helpful during recent power outages; puts out plenty of light during total darkness.  Really appreciate the option to use one or two lights.,5.0
"This is my second buy.  I had one for myself and after using for quite a while, my wife discovered that she needed a light for her kindle when we went on a trip.  Needless to say, I got little use of it.  That spurred me to buy a second, pink one, for her.  Got mine back and she is happy.

The one I purchased has been going strong for over a year now.  One minor issue is that it does use batteries a little faster than I would like and as the batteries go low, the light diminishes.  I minimize that by using only one bulb until the light begins to dim, then switch to two.  It lasts pretty well that way.

Good light and fits well on my Kindle case.",5.0
I bought this for reading books at night or when there's not enough light. It's a great little light. Just clips on and has 2 light settings. Takes 3 AAA batteries.,5.0
"This is perfect for if you have an ereader because it covers the perfect amount of space.

Where there was a blackout here, I used the light to walk around with instead of a flashlight and it worked just fine.

I also find it great for doing your nails or tweezing your eyebrows.

The clamp is awesome because you have so many options or what to clip it too comfortably.",5.0
Works perfectly while doing crosswords or word find puzzles.  Better than having to turn on the big overhead light in the room just to see my book.,5.0
"Have had a Kindle light before that was just ""ok"" ... this is more than ok ... recommend it for any portable light usage including Kindle.",5.0
"I bought this to attach to my dream notebook.  When I awake from a dream it is easy to feel for the switch and grab my pencil and write.  The light disperses over the whole page which another cheaper model I had did not.  I love the gooseneck feature, too.",5.0
I bought a couple of these for my children to use for bedtime reading. They illuminate the book extremely well. I've used other lights in the past which did not fully illuminate both pages of the book. This light illuminates even the pages of a large picture book.,5.0
Love it.  It gives plenty of light when reading in the dark.  I would highly recommend it to readers who like reading without having lights on.,5.0
"I'm impressed by the easy flexibility of the ""stem"" of this little light.  Adjusting it can be done almost with just a finger.  The two small LED lights are bright, and in the middle of the night using one of those lights is very comfortable--when two might be too much of an adjustment to brightness.  Just tap the button on the top of the head to change from two to one to off.  The clamp is strong and wide.  My only small complaint is that the logo on the front is ever before one's eyes.  There is a logo on the back as well, so I think they could do without the distracting one under the light.  I plan to black it out with a permanent marker.",5.0
"This has been key to reading on my Nook at night. Light is very bright, but not obnoxious like some others that I've seen. Battery lasts forever. This is a great quality light that will clip onto just about any book or e-reader.",5.0
This little baby sure brightens up your book and the entire room!! Really impressive and does an amazing job. !!,5.0
"My Mighty Bright works wonderfully on both powers, low and high. My only caution would be that one needs to carry around a lot of batteries if one reads for any extended period of time! This sucker really takes up juice. You don't notice it until the brightness begins to fade slowwwwwwly and one begins squinting to see. Plug it in and forget it. Works great at night so my wife doesn't wake when I decide to read at 2:00 a.m. (C'mon, I'm retired!) Buy it and enjoy bright light reading!",5.0
Simple usable in multiple locations these lights work as flexible sources for more than just books.  I use one in a  hallway to light in the night.,5.0
"I bought this approximately four years ago when I had a professor insist on using Power Point in class with the light off and expecting us to write our notes in the dark.  I found it ridiculous and unhealthy so I searched for a bright booklight instead.  I love that this stands by itself but the clip certainly opens wide enough for the average school desk as well.  In a dark room, it gave me plenty of light for my note-taking with extra for one or two neighbors to make do.  When there's a blackout, this light is easy and bright enough to point up and light up the room to see your way around.  I use it as a makeshift lantern when walking around the house at night as well.  And of course, it's a great book light for when you don't want to blind anyone else in your bedroom.  Pretty durable as I had it unused for at least a year before digging it up again and it worked good as new so I know for a fact that it lasts.  For how multi-functional it is for me, I give it five stars.

Update: As of yesterday, March 30th, 2013, the clip broke.  Apparently this has happened to several people who purchased this.  I just noticed that it was suddenly bent while holding onto my book and hanging by a sliver of plastic and then it fell off.  No dramatic snap sound or pieces going flying so at least there's no injuries or anything. I suspect that the Mighty Bright's grip is a bit too strong for the plastic in the long run. The light itself still works just fine so I suppose I can use it as a little standing light on a table but unless I can glue the clip back to the main piece, I won't be able to use this for reading in bed anymore.",5.0
"I bought it for my son who likes to read before bed but forgets to turn off the floor lamp. The only thing, I was concerend about it is brightness. It is really bright and serves it purpose.",5.0

I bought this light and was wrapped the way the way it was packaged and sent to New Zealand. This is a great light and has 2 settings on it helps me to read at night so i never have to put my kindle down now. Would recommend these lights to all.,5.0
"I purchased the book light for reading at night and for illuminating my lecture notes.

The large clip is perfect for clamping to the .5-1"" edge of the lecturn, and provides excellent illumination. There are two settings, high and lower, with a suitable decrease in light for each. I keep this light in my bag now, and it never accidentally switches on.

The neck is flexible, but holds its position. That's a difference from most book lights, which are very flexible and are always moving around when you don't want them to.

Highly recommended item!",5.0
"My 8 year old son needed a light to read his books in the mornings on the way to school, he loves it; it is perfect!",5.0
The clip holds very well and the light is very bright.  This was a Christms gift for my wife and she really likes it,5.0
Nice not glair light provided by this product and the book clip is nice and sturdy. I would recomend this product,5.0
I've used several different types of reading lights and the manufacturer 'Mighty Bright' seems to always have the best. This product is just wonderful. Received in just a few days it brightens the screen of my original Kindle just right for night reading. It has two levels of brightness and quite frankly the lesser intensity does the job just fine. Highly recommended.,5.0
"Does the job.  It is universal and bright.  like the two level lights. It is compact, bright, and very useful. Can't beat the price either.",5.0
"My first book light.  Very convent, uses regular batteries, bright light.  Gives you light anywhere and any time you need it.",5.0
I bought them to put on top of my wall hung jewelry cases...the cost of the LED lights that were advertised with the jewelry cases was much more expensive and they were not adjustable...I also use these for reading...great buy!,5.0
"As other reviewers have stated, this is an awesome light!  So bright with 2 settings, easy to clip to a headboard 1.5"" thick.  Cool colors available.  Got one in purple too.",5.0
"My husband and I love having these lights. My kids loved them, too, so much that they kept taking them from our rooms, so we finally got them their own. NOw we all have them and love them.",5.0
This lights up the kindle and anything that size and works everywhere. The light is only for the user and foes not annoy anyone riding or sleeping nect to you.,5.0
"Works great! Perfect for reading with low light and/or in bed. Doesn't bother my wife if she wants to sleep (she has the same light herself on her side) ordered from amazon, showed up on time just as expected. No regrets.",5.0
"It has two settings, one bright and one dim, so you can change how much light it gives off, depending on the situation.  Also, keep in mind that this is LED, so it gives off no heat.  Perfect!",5.0
"I bought this on Amazon (free shipping because I added another eligible item) in December 2011. I never regretted the purchase. I am an inveterate night-time bed reader. Been one for too long to remember. I can't say of reading lights that I've tried them all, but they've been very numerous. A lot of them have been your run-of-the-mill battery-only jobs, with the faults or weaknesses that come with those (unless one has stock in Duracell or Rayovac). I have of course also used various makes that use AC adaptors. I'll make this short. For me this light provides very bright light (always the adaptor, never, ever batteries). A nice white light. Two brightness settings. Never had a malfuction; switch always works. Regarding those reviewers who gave 1- and 2-star ratings because of switch (or wiring?) problems, that's unfortunate. It sounds like they got a lemon. I bought this, with some trepidation because of frustrating past experience, because of the predominantly great reviews---over thirteen months ago. And, as I said, have never regretted it. I might even say it is the best reading light I've ever owned. Happy reading.",5.0
This light is exactly as advertised. It's a great little light. It puts out a lot of light and clips on tight. Appears to be well made.,5.0
"This is my favorite book light. I discovered one a few years ago at a local book store, but when I needed a replacement they didn't have the kind I wanted. Of course a quick pop onto Amazon and my problem was solved. Liked it so much I bought three of them. Yes, I really did.",5.0
"Very nice and bright, as advertised.  Why do we need to type 16 words ? ? ? ? ? ?",5.0
"I purchased 2 of these and am very happy with them. They are great for reading in bed....or clamping on the work bench by my vise for when I need a little extra light on my work projects. It's just a great little light. Works great and puts out a decent amount of light. Also...they are nice in the car for when you want an adjustable ""map"" lamp.
  I have left them on at times...and after a couple of hours...turned it off. It was still burning pretty bright. For what its worth...I have been using the Sanyo Enerloop rechargable AAA batteries...and it works fine with those batteries (even though they are 1.2 volts and not 1.5 volts each)",5.0
Bought two of these. My wife loves to read in bed late at night. She is absolutely thrilled with this product. Plenty of good reading light. Doesn't light up the whole room. Can be used anywhere. Works well on paperback or hard cover books. I would highly recommend this product,5.0
This light provides plenty of light to comfortably read at night.  As others state in their reviews the lens does diffuse the light so that the entire page is illuniated equally.  Good purchase.,5.0
"I am a night owl and love to read late into the night, but I was always bothering my sister who I share a room with. This light is just enough to give you light to read a book, but won't bother anyone you share a room with.",5.0

"I love this little light!  Sometimes I think it's too dim, but chances are it's time to change the batteries when that's the case.  I use it a lot so the batteries do wear out, but I use rechargeables so I don't mind.  Definitely more than bright enough for reading, I usually just have one of the two bulbs on a time.  Definitely recommend!",5.0
"These are just great.  We have 2 in our house, and bought another for my mom.  No more getting up in the middle of the night to turn off the light because you're reading in bed with this light.

"I got this to clip onto my ereader and it works really well. I use it at night (obviously) when I'm in bed so I can keep husband awake while he tries to go to sleep.

"This is the best little piece of equipment to have around when traveling, especially to a home rather than a motel.  I love the choices of intensity of light, the handy spring clip that works on a book or even clipped onto the headboard of the bed, and the size.  It's completely foldable and tucks neatly into a little corner.  Batteries seem to last a long time.  Nice!",5.0

Makes a great light and the included batteries make for a far more convenient delivery so you can get reading when it gets here,5.0
This is great for dark rooms or bedtime reading.  I like the 2 settings of brighter and not as bright.  It's great to flip through magazines when your watching tv in a low lit room and you'd rather keep the lights low and flip through your reading materials while your spouse watches a poor selections of movies.  The lower level is good when you're in bed reading and don't want to disturb anyone with the brighter setting.  Very solid and sturdy clip too.,5.0
"When I bought my wife a Kindle a couple of years ago, we realized that a reading light would really come in handy.  I looked at many different ones, and this one seemed the best.  We weren't disappointed.  The flexibility of the positioning, the versatility of light strength, and the strength of the clip make this the perfect reading light.

When we bought my Kindle this year, there was no question what light we were going to get with it, and I am still not disappointed.  You can find cheaper, you can find more expensive, but this one is simply the best value.",5.0
"My girls (8 and 10) received these for Christmas this year.  They like to read before they go to bed at night and these work perfectly!  I actually attach the clip to their headboard and it works great.  These little lights put out quite a bit of light, I was impressed.  There is a button on the top of the light part that you click once for 1 light and click again for 2 lights (brighter), then you click it again and it turns the lamp off.  I love the ""snake"" neck as it is flexible enough to move around but will stay in place and not droop.  would highly recommend.",5.0
"My son loves to sketch and draw - perfect little light to attach to his tv dinner table to do just that.  Enough light for just the tray area, no chords, takes double AA batteries.

"If you love to read, then you know how important a good reading light is. I had a reading light that I picked up at Barnes & Noble years ago that I really liked, but it finally went kaput. After some research, I picked this one up and it is great.

* Clip works great for paperback or hardback.
* Light is very bright.
* Light is white - I prefer white light over the yellow or natural light for reading.
* Flexible, easy to use for any book.
* Very good battery life (a big problem for other lights I have owned)

One of the best products on Amazon for the money - buy two. Highly Recommended.",5.0

I just clipped this thing onto the headboard of my bed and it works very well. I'm also excited to use this in my car, since the built-in light I have in there is relatively dim. This is the first reading light I have ever bought, but I'm already very glad I did and I'll be coming back for more if this one ever breaks.",5.0
Does exactly what my spouse needed it to: shine on the book and not keep me awake while reading in bed :-),5.0
Perfect light to read with or for the grill.  Has two setting (medium light and very bright) and the name says it all...might bright.  Would buy again without hesitation.,5.0
"Purchased both lights for my daughter and her husband, they were thrilled, she the blue one and he the black one.",5.0
"I bought one for each of my 3 kids so they can read at night without having a bright light on.  They are really bright for such a little light.  The neck is very bendable and has lasted after over a year of heavy abuse from the kids.  It also has two brightness levels, which is a plus.",5.0
This light might be small but it puts out a mighty powerful light! Highly recommend this light if you have a Kindle without the lighted cover.,5.0
"Since the Kindle cover she received this year didn't have its own light, we got her this great little reading light to accompany it.  We now have 4 of these, one for each of us.  We really like them.  Throw good amount of light and don't suck down batteries, even rechargables.",5.0
"I've bought many reading lights, but this one is my favorite.  I like that it takes AAA batteries instead of the expensive watch batteries.  It also has 2 brightness settings.  Fits perfectly on a book or my kindle.",5.0
If you want to read at night your kind this is the best option to do it and you really are going to enjoy ir,5.0
"I have tried a number of book lights, but I always swing back to the Mighty Brights. I read so much, especially in the middle of the night, that I go through batteries quickly. When I discovered this one that has an adaptor so it can be
 plugged in, I couldn't wait to order it.  It has the same wonderfully-bright light that the brand  is known for (it can be dimmed as well), and being able to plug it into a power strip by my bed, makes it one handy light. When I travel, I power it with batteries. Two thumbs up on this one!",5.0
"I originally bought this for my then 4-year-old son to have clipped to his bed at night so he can look at books before he falls asleep. He is not gentle by any means, and though he eventually broke the clip and nicked the bendable arm, the light has continued to hold up for well over a year and he continues to use it. The LED light is bright enough for reading without being too bright, lightens a large enough area to see the whole book, and even has two brightness options. The on/off button is easy to find and use. The fact that it takes 3 regular AAA batteries instead of the tiny batteries like too many other LED products is also a big plus. And the batteries hardly ever need to be changed. I liked this light so much I bought one for myself. I bought my second son a different, cheaper light and it isn't nearly as good; it's not as bright and the on-off switch is harder to manipulate. When his light fails, I will replace it with this one.",5.0
"I love this little light!  I like to play video games in a darkened room, so I can see all the little details on the screen, even in dark backgrounds.  I also like to use a guidebook.  With this little light, I can illuminate the guidebook well enough to see and use it, but there is very little extra light in the room to spoil the video game experience.  I like this light so much I bought a couple of extras for Xmas gifts, and the recipients love them like I do.  5 stars!",5.0
"Great light, comfortable light to read under, and I'm impressed with the quality of the flex/adjustment cord..very nice...glad I picked this one.",5.0
This is great for reading at night.  My kids use them on their bed posts to allow them to keep their light off at night.  I would recommend these.,5.0
I have it hooked on my floor lamp and whenever the power goes out - often here - I just reach up and turn this on and can easily read with it.,5.0
"I would definitely order again as they are very sturdy & the light is bright & the fact it has 2 bright options is a plus. Also the clip is wide enough to use on a thick pad, etc. & I like the well made flexible arm as you can move it very easily.

I woud definitely recommend this particular light.",5.0
Daughter uses it and loves it.  Very nice for long auto rides and plane flights.  Very bright and long battery life.,5.0
I'm so happy with this light! I use it also for doing sewing - it's very handy & just the right amount of light! I'd recommend it.,5.0
"I have tried several booklights. The tipping point on this one is that it uses regular batteries, which I am much more likely to have around as opposed to the flat circle batteries. It is very bright. When you put in fresh batteries, you can turn off the second bulb because you don't need it. The batteries last a long time. I have three children who sometimes leave it on for who knows how long... I have found it under the bed after it had been missing for a couple of days and it is still decently bright. I have two of these booklights, and will soon need a third as my second child is beginning to read on her own. Also of note, we have used it for more than just reading-- bike repairing, hide and seek, shadow puppets, etc.-- and it has endured for several years.",5.0
"I use this with my kindle (keyboard).  The light is bright, and easily positioned on the cover for best viewing in bed.",5.0
"I originally purchased the Fulcrum book light from Walmart, but wasn't satisfied. Spent a few more dollars on the MB Xflex 2 and am completely satisfied. It has a press button for bright and less bright. I use the lesser light and it's plenty bright while reading in my dark indoor porch. It's lightweight, sturdy, and has padding on both clip ends. All the colors are neat, but settled for the black matte color, which goes with everything of course. Buying one for my mom, whom does a lot of bookwork at night.",5.0
"My husband and I each have our own and we love them. They take three AAA batteries, so we do go through quite a few of those if we're on a reading binge, but worth it. I have had to replace mine once because the black cord lost it's form and became too flexible and would keep falling against my book. I would recommend removing the batteries when traveling because it's too easy for the button to be pressed while in your carry on bag and that's a good way to drain your batteries.",5.0
I purchased this great little lamp to serve as a dial light for my 1950 Zenith Trans-Oceanic G500 radio. This vintage radio did not come with a dial light when it was manufactured 62 years ago and this super nice blue lamp does the job perfectly in low light conditions. The base clips perfectly onto the radio's carrying handle and looks pretty cool as well. The lamp is very well made and I like the fact that it has two brightness settings along with the bendable arm. Also my package included the three batteries which was appreciated although not expected because the description says batteries not included.,5.0
"It provides good light for reading (great for reading in bed without the bedside lamp on).  It clips on easily.  I have used it to light books, a kindle and my computer",5.0
"I clip this thing to the side of my laptop when writing in a dark room, to the headboard of my bed when reading there, or to the book itself. The clamp has rubber inserts to protect whatever you're clamping it to, and it will stand on its base as long as the neck isn't bent off in such a way as to off balance it. Love this little thing. I have had the slightly larger, two led, two battery versions for years, and as much as I loved that one, I prefer this hands down.",5.0
"We had a smaller clip-on light that worked fine for a book, but too small/weak for a headboard. This one is just as small but the clamp is wider and fits perfect on the headboard! It is definitely bright enough on both settings and now my son can turn the light off himself at night! Perfect!",5.0
"I use this as a nighttime light for my laptop computer, to help me see the keyboard.  Clips on to the edge of the screen, works great.",5.0
It is a great LED light. My mom had a hard time seeing her kindle and she loves this light. She even uses it as a flash light!,5.0
"I got this today and I am sooo happy with my purchase! It is just what I needed! I got it in purple and it came with the batteries! The light is bright enough, but not overly so! It is handy and perfect in every way! I highly recommend you buy this one, if you are looking for a book light that can be carried along in your travels too! I am certainly going to buy another one for myself! :) i would give it a 6 star if I could - it is that amazing! :)",5.0
"I can't stand clipping a light on the book, so I was looking for a light that would attach to the headboard. I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.

It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.

If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.

I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet. Battery life appears pretty good. Overall, this is THE BEST reading light I've found and if this one ever wears out I will be buying another just like it.",5.0
"This is light, flexible and functional.  I liked it so well that I bought another one. The price was right too",5.0
This is a great little light it is bright enough to either read by or do crafts by in low lite areas.,5.0
I use this light for reading and stitching.  I can attach the light to my book or hoop and it gives me enough light to see what I am reading or stiching even when the room does not have much light.  It is very easy to use and can be packed up to bring anywhere.,5.0
I bought this for my mom for her kindle.  She loves it and says it is perfect for reading.  Not too bright.,5.0
"Yes, it's mighty bright, durable, easily transportable and absolutely ideal for reading.  p.s also pretty useful for shining on splinters stuck in fingers !",5.0
My kids got this over a year ago as a present for their nighttime reading in bed.  We love these!  The light is definitely bright enough for reading in bed at night.  The clip is strong and sturdy and has withstood the test of a year's worth of use.  And the flexible neck is great as you never know what you are going to need to clip it to.  Highly recommended.,5.0
A great product for trips or by the bedand the LED lighting really makes a difference. Would definitely purchase more of these in the future.,5.0
"I was impressed that this light came in so many pretty colors. The light is very bright, the neck is flexable (not flimsy), and the clip holds tights to book pages without slipping! Takes 2 Double A batteries and lasts a long time!!! : )",5.0
"The only thing I wish is that the lower level of light was a bit lower.  The neck moves easily and quietly, stays in place, great to relieve eye strain while reading.  Doesn't take up much room - s opposed to other book lights I have had.  Clip stays on the pages I put them on.  When light runs out, I'll be getting another one.  I've used it over 30 hours and batteries are still going.",5.0
Needed to illuminate pc keypad.  Clips on edge of desk and does just what I needed.  Would recommend anywhere you need a little xtra light.,5.0
"I have to agree with another review - it's almost too bright for nighttime viewing with both lights on. Fortunately you can turn a single LED on and it works fine. Because the clamp holds 3 AAA batteries, it's rather large. It works better to clamp it on a surface other than the book, like the back of a car seat. I like having standard batteries and will use rechargables in the future. Back to the 2 LED discussion, with both lit, it's good as a small flashlight.",5.0
Great price for a great product.  We use these instead of night lites for our kids and the battery lasts forever and the girls love to read at night before falling asleep.,5.0
"When the time shift kicked in and it was suddenly dark on our drive home from daycare, my daughter decided 6pm was the new naptime (not conducive to an 8:30 bedtime). So I purchased the mighty bright and starting clipping it onto her carseat--it works great! It lights up her area of the car without blinding my night vision at all--it's great for reading books and playing with mom's kindle on the drive home.",5.0
I have had my light for 2 years now and its still working great!  It's very bright so it really does light up the page.,5.0
This is perfect for someone that likes to read at night but doesn't want to disturb the person sleeping next to you.  It clasped onto the pages of the book really well and really provided the perfect amount of light on the page.,5.0
"I bought these to clip on to my loft bed for some nighttime reading. I was worried that the clip would be too small to clip onto the railings of my bed, but it was perfect. So if anyone else is also for a light to clamp onto their loft bed or bunk bed, this would be a great fit.

The lighting is bright and even, just the way I like it.
I also love how it's battery powered, so I don't have to try to plug the wire in from my bed way up high to the ground.

Overall, this light is a bit pricey compared to the other ones available, but it's totally worth it.",5.0
"Love these lights. I use them in an off the grid house over beds, the stove and sink. They clip any where and give a lot of light.
The batteries last a long time. The Mighty Brights  were wonderful to have  when the power was out for 10 days  after a major storm. I have given them as gifts as part of an emergency kit. Even used one to walk the dog when I could not find my flashlight.",5.0
"After much research, many failed book lights, I have found the Best of the Breed with the Mighty Bright Xflex 2. I got a silver and the wife a blue. Both are great, work very well at staying in place and lighting both pages without moving the head around. The dim setting is great for night reading while the bright setting truly makes the pages pop.
Highly recommend!!!

EDIT: After using these a while, they seem to consume batteries faster than other units we have used. I am still very please with this; just be warned you will have to feed them more ofter.",5.0
"I ended up getting my daughter her own because she would use my Mighty Bright when I needed it. I'm very pleased with the battery life, the clip strength, light position, and the light quality (brightness options).

No problems with the on/off switch but I could see that as a potential if you carried it in a bag. One could rig a cover for them to prevent this.",5.0
I got one of these at another store several years ago after going through many different book lights. These are the best I've ever hard. They take regular batteries and are really bright. I got this one for my son and another for my daughter. If you need a book lite this is the one to get!,5.0

I use this as an auxiliary light for my optical microscope and it performs well. The light level and pattern are well suited for my application.,5.0
"I've tried several book lights, and the Mighty Bright-Blu-Xflex 2-Light is the best.  The light covers both pages of an open book, and is adjustable between two brightness settings.  The amount of light escaping toward my sleeping partner is minimal and does not disturb her sleep as I read late at night.",5.0
"This book light is very bright. It creates a spotlight varying in size depending on where you put it. The neck is easy to adjust and the clip is sturdy and easy to use. The light is pleasant and uniform as advertised. Batteries were included but that is not advertised; I don't know if everyone receives them. At the time I bought it, I didn't know about the adapter that is sold separately. I may purchase the adapter if this small book light does well over time. 4 stars because I've only had it for a few days. I'll review my rating at a later time.

Update: It's been 8 months since I purchased this book light and it still looks and works as new. I'm very happy with the quality of this item.",5.0
"I bought this two years ago for my son, as he's an avid book reader, and often finds himself in one vehicle or another straining to read as the sun goes down. It's proved to be a great light -- its bright white light is perfect to read by, yet not distracting to others.

Although he's been using it regularly for two years, it was only recently that I noticed the light appeared to be dimming. A quick change of the batteries, and it was back to its old self. (Note this was the first battery change in two years' use.) The light's neck is flexible but strong, the clip is sturdy and doubles as a stand if you're not clipping it on anything. We highly recommend this light for anyone that needs a reliable book light, keyboard light, or needs a little extra light for any of life's dark spots.",5.0

It has two LED bulbs, and has two settings - the first lighting both bulbs, the second setting lighting only one bulb. I typically read with just one bulb lit -- that is plenty of light. The clip is very strong and stays in place, and the flexible stem holds its position well, even after extended periods of reading. Excellent lamp -- I would buy it again.",5.0

I bought 2 others before buying this one again and they both sucked! I finally got on Amazon to see what they had and I found this one, the same one I always had and knew I had to buy it.

"Everything everyone says about this great reading light is true and then some. It is a fantastic reading light. But we recently found another great use for this light. Our power was out for several days due to Hurricane Sandy and this served as our primary night light, lighing up our staircase all night long. It lasted for several days on one set of batteries. We used the clip to attach it to our handrail bracket and that was it. No candles burning unattended, no flashlights burning out in an hour or two. It's nice to be able to leave a light on all night and know it will still be burning bright in the morning. Batteries last forever in this thing. I'm definetely going to buy a couple more to have on hand. Useful in so many ways - even as a handyman light to light up a dark work area like under the sink. With a handful of Eneloop rechargeable batteries on hand, this light will last for weeks.",5.0
"We have one for each kid in each car, so they can read and do homework in the car at night.  It clips to the pocket behind the front seats.  Their friends love it, too!

"I had purchased the dual led ""Mighty Bright"" flex light and it was perfect for reading a Kindle in dark places. However owning multiple Kindle readers for family members required more of these lights. I opted to get an off brand dual led and it was cheaper but it's performance was poor.. not staying on and inferior quality materials. My wife uses the Dual Led mighty bright and borrowing it several times I found for my reading I only needed one of the two lights on. So I decided to replace the cheaper lights with a single LED mighty bright and they are just fine. Reliable and better quality.... Just what was needed.  You do get what you pay for!!",5.0

"I got a Mighty-Bright 2-Light about 6 months ago, and I just loved it for its bright light.  I'm often a passenger in several-hour-long car trips that go late into the night, and I love having this light to read by (I don't get carsick reading in a car like many people do).  I like the light so much that just a couple of weeks ago, I bought another one as a back-up.  And I'm glad I did.  The LED lights are so nice and bright that my husband and I used these booklights throughout Hurricane Sandy, after our power went out, not just to read by but to use as we moved throughout the house, and also when we took the dog outside after dark.  Both lights were on for hours and never seemed to lose their power.

I also love that these Mighty-Bright 2-Lights run on AAA batteries, which are inexpensive, easy to replace, last a long time, and you can even get rechargeable AAA batteries these days.  This is in sharp contrast to booklights that run on button-shaped batteries which I've found to be unreliable, don't last very long, and that their power gradually fades so that most of the time the booklight doesn't produce a crisp (or even usable) amount of light. And those button-shaped batteries are expensive and not rechargeable.

I gave the Mighty-Bright 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it's overpriced for a booklight, but it's durable and the LEDs are great.  Recommend.

UPDATE:  I am now upgrading this book light to 5 stars because I feel it's worth it in spite of its high cost.  I just replaced one of the 2 lights I initially bought because my dog got hold of one of them and chewed it to pieces. I value book lights so much that I can't stand the thought of being without one on one of our long night-time drives, and these book lights have held up so well (except for the dog chewing up one of them).  Thus I decided to replace the one I lost with the exact same model.  The problem I have is because I married a New York driver, which could make anybody's nerves raw.  Reading a book in the car at night (or in the daytime, for that matter) keeps me from watching the road while he's driving and thus keeps me from turning into a nervous wreck before we reach our destination.",5.0

"You want light? Buy this light!
This little device is bright enough for two kids to read under, side-by-side in a dark car.
We clipped it onto the headrest post so that the light would be right between the two rear seats (in a 2001 Saab convertible with black interior).  The kids really enjoyed reading their respective books, and never complained about needing more light.  We ordered another, so that they can each have one to themselves.  The two-level brightness is a nice feature (probably works well with a non-backlit e-reader), and the goose-neck is soft enough to bend with fingers, but firm enough to stay where you want it.  Well built, and uses common batteries.

It would be great if they had a model that is specifically designed to be clipped onto a headrest post in a universal manner, and have a longer goose-neck for that purpose.  However that is just a ""wish"", and this product works well enough.

Will not interfere with the driver of a car, as the LEDs are very directional.
The only issue may be that the user's eyes need to adjust to the dark when stepping out of the car after using this light for any extended period of time; It's that bright.

Should make out to be a great gift for the bookworm in your life - even if they already have one!
Note: we've only used it a few times, so I can't say much about the durability, but we'll just have to see.",5.0
"This light is an engineering masterpiece. It is the perfect solution for lighting up my laptop keyboard. I've also begun using it for the few books I read that aren't on Kindle, including one on keeping produce fresh. Like other reviewers, I've already ordered a second one and can see ordering more, in black or other colors, for other uses and especially, for holiday gifts.

LATEST DISCOVERY: I didn't realize why the clip worked so very well. It's because it has small, soft rubber pads inside the mouth of the clip, which ensure even better grip without so much pressure. It clips onto various places on my laptop or sits with the tiniest footprint on its stable base (because of the battery weight), right up against the keyboard.

The three light settings are more than enough to light up my 17-inch keyboard without glare and with its tiny head and thin flex neck, it's easy to position the device so as not to block your field of vision to the screen.

To sum it up, this light gets top marks on the overall design, the clamp, the base, the neck, the soft and sure light switch, the lighting in either light mode and its general very low profile.

I would pay $20 or $25 for a Mighty Bright without blinking an eye. I believe what Amazon buyers are all benefiting greatly from is very low prices based on mass sales generated by listing beneath the great Amazon name.

Additional info: This light replaces an excellent, but quite bulky light I've used on my laptop keyboard, SE FL89020L 20 LED Silver Lamp Light, for $9.17 on Prime. I'll find other uses for the FL89020L, including duty holding down a tent flap in a gale.

I will also include my stock comment about batteries: All batteries, including button style, are so affordable now with Amazon as not to be a factor in the vast majority of battery powered gadgets. When you can get five Sony button batteries on Amazon prime for $3.18 total, cost is no longer an issue, IMHO.

**May come back later and update. I've ordered over 100 items in the last 3-4 years on Amazon and would rate this light in the top 5 products overall. Amazing.",5.0

"I'm the kind of person that truly counts on reviews to guide my selection.  Hence I felt compelled to review this light for others as I'm so pleased with this light.

I basically bought this for my wife because she liked to read at night to fall asleep.  I know how much she enjoys reading at night, yet it would be very irritating for me, especially if I had a long day and just wanted to fall asleep.  So that began my search for a reading light.

For our use, I needed:
- Something that would clip onto the headboard - and stay on.  The headboard shelves are about 3/4 inch thick. This light clips on and could probably clip on shelves up to an inch.  It stays put even when being adjusted. Bonus, it clips on thick towel racks too.
- Adjustable so that light did not shine on me (about 2 feet away in king bed) whiles she reads but doesn't cast so much light as to light up the rest of the room (it meets both criteria).
- The neck is quite long, easily adjustable and stays in the configuration it was adjusted to (it doesn't change shape after adjusted)
- Bright enough to read comfortably from about 2-3 feet away.  The light has two settings and a double-bubble type lens over the LED bulbs.  One or both bulbs can be turned on.  From 3 feet away, she still prefers the lower setting (fine with me, saves battery life)
- Uses standard batteries (it takes 3 AAA) batteries.  Both NiCd and NiMh rechargeable batteries work great too.  We're using 800mA NiMh low-self-discharge (LSD) batteries  (made by tenergy).  So far, we haven't recharged them even after about 30 hours of use. But even cheap NiCd rechargeable would probably last over 20 hours.  No tools are needed to change the batteries.

Now for the pleasant surprises:
- There is no banding from the bulbs or lens when reading.  It's a pure, smooth, tranquil, consistent light (white LED light, not warm like an incandescent bulb or candle - which we like)
- It's tough!  My two year old daughter ripped it off the headboard a few times by its neck.  It still holds its shape and shows no trauma
- The push-button switch is on the head, so my wife doesn't have to reach far to turn it off
- It's surprisingly useful around the house and outside.  I've `borrowed' it a few times to work on the car, it clips right on to the hood or the stick shift for working under the dashboard etc.
- I `borrowed'  it again to work on the sump pump by clipping it onto a shelf and aiming it at the pump
- I find I `borrow' it more and more.  I used it one night for just enough light to treat and remove a yellowjacket nest (best done at night when they are dormant)
- Finally, I've read that if you wake up in the middle of the night, turning on lights can make it harder to go back to sleep.  So I took it into the bathroom, clipped it on a thick towel rack and read until sleepy again - without having to turn on the lights.

So, I'll be ordering at least 2 more for reading and more for use around the house so that I don't have to borrow my wife's.  I'm sure there are better options out there for more of a utility-type light, but this one is handy for reading and working, lasts forever on rechargeable batteries and is tough.  I'm thrilled with it.",5.0
"This is a high value purchase for book lovers. I have a 3 month old and the only time i get to read now is at bedtime. However, a bright overhead light is not an ideal sleeping situation for my little one. So I dug out my mighty bright book light, and it still works! The last time I used this light was almost a year ago. Love it.

This light is so bright, I have used it as a flashlight on many occations. The clip works well when clipped to the book, but it also works well when set on a flat surface. I used my mighty bright during a 14 day blackout after hurricane Ike to read and play games with the family after dark.

This is a great buy, you have to get one! Trust me.",5.0
I'm surprised how bright this mini light is. I really do love the choice of picking a high or low brightness depending on my mood. It easily illuminates both pages with no problem. You can't avoid the 3 AAA (included) creating some weight which isn't a problem for a hardcover book.  Depending on how thin a softcover is you might need to use a mini clipboard or something to help hold the light in place to avoid the book from flopping over. The clip can open wide enough to fit various thickness. Inside the clip it's padded on both side so it doesn't scratch your book. I like the idea of having to option to get an AC adaptor. I haven't owned it long enough to see how much batteries it eats. Time will tell.,5.0
We bought this book light for our daughter for her 6'th birthday and she loves being able to read at night.  It's bright enough to be clipped to the side of her bed allowing her to look at her books without the awkwardness of having something clipped to the actual book.  We just ordered a second for our son!,5.0
"I have bought almost every book light on the market.  They all take expensive batteries, don't shine bright enough, shine to bright, won't adjust the way I want (hate them all).  This one is perfect!  It takes triple A batteries, I use rechargeable, it also has an adapter with a long enough cord that it doesn't get in the way, it has two settings, light up the entire house and perfect light for reading in bed, and it will adjust any way you want to.  Wish I had found it a long time ago, could have saved me hundreds of dollars.",5.0

"I went looking for a book light so I could read at night but still not bother my fiance sleeping next to me.  And boy did I find what I was looking for!

Not only is this book light lightweight and easy to pose, it is very bright!  I was able to read while the rest of the room was dark and my sweetie was asleep beside me.

I recommend this for all readers who like to stay up late at night reading while the rest of the world sleeps :-)",5.0
"I received a keyboard Kindle last Christmas, and even though it does not have an internal light like the Kindle Fire, I have thoroughly enjoyed the new electronic reading experience. The only drawback is that I read in bed every night and was having to position myself so the light would fall just right, and it was becoming tiresome.  I looked at the portable lights on Amazon and after reading the customer reviews, decided on the Mighty Bright Xflex 2-Light model and I'm happy to report it was ""just what I needed"".  It clips on easily, I love the high and low light options, and the flexible neck allows you to move the light so there's no glare. I've had the light for a month now and I would recommend it to family and friends with 100% confidence that they will enjoy it as much as I have!",5.0
"We really like this light. In fact, we bought one and then bought another. We use them for changing & feeding our baby at night, and one is at the bedside and one is on the changing table. The low setting is bright enough to see what you're doing but not bright enough to jar either us or the baby into total wakefulness. The high setting is, well, higher than that, but we don't really use it.",5.0
"After reviewing many book lights online, I ordered this one which had the highest rating for the most moderate cost.  I can't imagine there could be anything better out there.  This light easily clips onto my books, and offers 2 settings: high (2 LED lights) and low (1 LED light).  I have been reading in bed every night for a week now, and the husband has not woken up once.  The light is actually so bright, I only need to use the low setting in a pitch black room.  It is flexible; you can make the area of light as big or small as you could possibly need. Best yet, this light uses 3 AAA batteries - no expensive specialty ones.  This is an awesome light for an great price. I have absolutely NO complaints.",5.0
"This really is a good light, however, it is quite big!  Didn't realize that it was as large as it is, and not really good for traveling!",5.0
I purchase these for a musician friend.  The light has an on/off button.  Push it once and two lights come on.  Push it a second time and one light goes off (leaving one light on).  Push it a third time and the light turns off.  Simple design.  Very intuitive.  The two bulb design allows you to have a select the correct level of brightness for the situation.  The flexible arm allows you to angle the light just right.  I purchased two of these and my friend just loves them.,5.0
"I really liked the Mighty Bright-Pur-Xflex 2-Light.  I was surprised when I turned it on because it was so bright and that it had two lights.  It is really flexible, not stiff like other products.  I definitely recommend the Mighty Bright Lite.  I bought one for my Mom and she really liked the brightness, it's so easy to read your book.  I use it daily.",5.0

"I found this light an excellent companion to paperbacks and my pool float.

The build quality is excellent.  The 2 modes of light provide good lighting.  The single light is most comfortable for me.

Most importantly the clip is excellent.  It has a rubberized material that together with its strength prevents slipping to a large degree. Very few adjustments are necessary.  It's weight is not significant.  The neck stays completely sturdy.

All in all, this light does exactly what you want it to do - fade into the background as you read.",5.0
"I use this light to illuminate sheet music or audio equipment.  Battery life is excellent, the light is good, it's light but fairly sturdy. They also make a 2 lamp version that covers a wider area.",5.0

"This is the only light you will ever need to buy. It lasts for hours and hours on triple A batteries without dimming. It has two settings dim & bright, both of which are outstanding. I use this light on my patio at night to read, play chess, and I also use it around the house as well. The clamp is very easy to open and is a good size for books, ereaders, or to clamp on to just about everything. The neck of the light is also very easy to bend the way you want it without the weight of the head or clamp affecting it. Its designed super well. I read all the reviews about all the different lights you can buy. Trust me when I say, buy this light!",5.0

"I just received the Mighty Bright Xtraflex 2 LED Book Light. I really haven't used it yet but I checked it out in a dark closet this morning and it seems like a nice light for reading when the power goes out. It's much brighter than my other book light and I really like that it takes AAA batteries and not button cells that I never have on hand! My only complaint...the batteries it comes with (yes, they're included) are wrapped in shrink wrap so tightly, they're almost impossible to free!",5.0
"This is one of those products that you only need one of. I bought mine two or three years ago, and I'm still using it. I've only ever had to change the batteries once. I've now given it as a gift to several friends and relatives and they all say that it's the best light they've ever had and they (and I) use it constantly.

It has two brightness settings, a wide clip, and the gooseneck piece actually stays where you put it (those never seem to stay on other lights). It's got a great lens/beam spreader so it covers lots of the page - no bright spot in the middle. This works great with both kindle and physical books.

I don't usually write reviews, but sometimes there are products that are so useful that they become a part of your everyday life, and work, exactly as they did when they were new, for years and years.

This is an excellent product, I have never seen a better book light (and I've tried lots of them before I found this one).",5.0

"This is the best book light I have found. Even, clean light that focuses on the pages of the book. Most book lights I have tried are too short and the arm won't make the turn when I'm reading big hardcover books. This one is long enough, lightweight and bright.

"Like the othert Delta products I have purchased..  I was excited when my new sander arrived. It assembled well, and looked impressive. Until I snapped the power switch and the motor would not turn. Smoke came out of the motor. I shut the unit down, and double checked everything, again! The motor turned freely by hand, but turn it on. and it would lock. Called support, 30 days later recieved a new motor and installed it. This motor started right up and as I almost got excited, it slowed and stopped. Then did the same thing as the first! I boxed it up, and sent it back. 2 failed motors, over 30 days, and I was still not able to use it!  No thank you!  Hope this helps!",1.0
"I have had this clamp for a couple of years. Worked great. Over the weekend, I dropped it on my shop floor. Actually, I knocked it off of the miter saw stand, let's call it 36"" above the floor (Concrete). The handle shattered into pieces. The clamp is now useless. I called DeWalt. Sorry, the warranty is only 1 year- and we don't cover DROPPING it. Oh, and it was discontinued in 2006 so it HAS to be older than a couple of years.

First, this is a heavy-duty clamp that costs a lot of money. It should be durable enough to be DROPPED 36"" to a shop floor without becoming useless. Even most electronic devices (iPhone, etc...) can be dropped from that height without breaking. Second, I understand a one-year warranty on my saw, it is going to wear out, but  a heavy-duty clamp? Warranty it for life.

I did a quick web search and found 14 retailers that have it in stock for sale today (new) so the discontinued five years ago excuse is lame.

I have generally good performance from DeWalt tools and poor customer service from DeWalt customer service. It just happened again.

Conclusion;  it is a good clamp, just don't drop it.",1.0
"LOOK ABOVE, THIS IS AN AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE.

Read the reviews.  Hidden herein, there are several, ""can't adjust the depth guage""... and then people just blow it off.

One reviewer says he had to use a VICE GRIP to adjust.  NO ONE should need a vice grip to adjust their drill!

So, I got mine today.  Can't adjust it, AT ALL.  I don't think of myself as weak, me and another person recently moved a 500lb cast iron bath tub.

So, thinking maybe it's my drill, I go to 3 mass retailers with the word ""Home"" in their name, their competitor that starts with L, and another retailer that has ""Ace"" in their name (because Amazon deletes their competition's names).... at ALL STORES BUT ONE, 8 STORES, the adjustable handle could not be moved, by me or by staff.  One was easily adjustable.

I tested Mikata and Ridgid as well at each store.  All of those were easy to adjust, the DEWALTS were not.  I found 1 I could simply turn, the rest were non-moveable, and there were some huge dudes who tried.

If you are insistent on a DeWalt, then TEST IT FIRST.  More often than not it's not going to move, and being as or more expensive than a Mikata or Ridgid of similar RPM, just get one of those instead.

I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality here.  I was a DeWalt fan until this, reading the reviews of difficulty, getting one that is not adjustable, and testing it at the local ""home"" stores and finding the same thing.

NOT WORTH 100$ for a non-adjustable depth adjustment.  Amazon sells the Mikata and Ridgid drywall guns as well, and as much as I'd hate to, I'd recommend you save yourself the time and get another brand.",1.0
"I bought this because of the deal and dewalt name.  Turns out the item does not operate at a consistent level as far as screw depth.  You may get one or two perfect then a bunch that are not sunk in the dimple.  Bad product.

"The Milwaukee 0234-6 Magnum 5.5 Amp 1/2-Inch Drill was more expensive than other drills I considered. I bought it expecting reliability and extra power when needed. I used only once - I drilled four 3/4"" inch holes through one inch thick yellow maple. It did this without problems. I was happy with the purchase. Eight months passed before I needed it again. The drill had been stored untouched in a climate controlled room but it no longer worked. The drill turns on only when pointing straight up. As soon as the drill is moved, it stops. Maybe I shouldn't complain, after all I can still drill holes as long as I climb under the board and drill towards the ceiling. It may be under warranty but I need it now not in six weeks. None of this seems to matter to Milwaukee customer service. The time and bother of packaging and shipping is more trouble than it's worth.

"I bought this tool in Dec. '99.  I fiddled with the dovetail adjustment for hours but was never able to get it to both slide smoothly and have no play in the mechanism.  So it slides with great resistance but with no play.
I got the model that came w/out chisels and coughed up the extra money for the 1/4"" and 3/8"" chisel/bit sets.  After cutting maybe 30 1/4"" mortises in cherry and mohogany, I started into some oak. Well, the bit for the 1/4"" chisel snapped off.  I have no idea why (I never forced the machine and never got any smoking, even) and Delta gave no reason but were good enough to replace it.
The other night I was using the 3/8"" bit, again in oak, and the round gear in the up/down mechanism spit up 5 teeth.  Utter crap.  As before, I was using one arm and moving slowly without smoke or any other negative indicators.  Inspection of the broken gear revealed that it was cast metal of some sort but very soft and light.  Now, if I had a 3' pipe on the end of the handle and was hanging off the end I could see the thing shearing some gear teeth, but this was one-armed with slow, moderate force.
I gather (from web searches) that this has happened to others' Delta mortisers (one fellow said it happened the night he got it home).  Also, I, like others, observed that many of the allen-head set screws used to change adjustments round out easily.  I've got two screws that are shot.  A small item, but a big indicator of bad quality.  How much did they save on the screws?
In summary, this unit performed reasonably under infrequent use for about 10 months and then broke.  I'll probably look into a multico.

"Hi, I'm for a hollow chisel mortiser and want to know if there has been any attempt from Delta to better their mortising tool after reading the customer's review's.

"I have a number of other Makita tools, and have always held Makita in pretty high regard.  My 7 1/4"" circular saw works great, as does my motorized hand planer, Reciprocating saw, and my plunge router is awsome.  This machine seems more like a toy that a quality piece of machinery. I was surprised to see a little bit of play when the saw was moved into one of the 45 notches. I could pretty easily move it one degrees side to side, unless it was absolutely locked down, and then it was not consistent about being locked down in the same place. When I got the left-hand miter perfect at 45 I could not get the right hand side at 45, and this is a real problem as they share the same fence. I'm not sure if the notch was machined in the wrong spot or what, but it's impossible to cut perfect mitered corners this way.

On the positive note, the dust collection work much better than some other saws I've owned, and I like the supplied hold-down clamp. I also own an inexpensive Ryobi 10 inch miter saw, and at $89 it's twice to machine this is. Heavier metal, and locks down positive--perfect miters. I'm going to go buy another after my experience with this.

Makita really disappointed me with this one. I'm packing it up today and sending it back. I'm actually really puzzled how this saw got such great reviews, as I am normally in agreement with the majority of people. Maybe I just got lemon?",1.0

"This thing is junk.

This sander offers 2 sanding methods each with it's own design flaw:

1) When using the profile sanding plate, the sandpaper doesn't stick to the little rubber blades rendering the ""profile sanding"" claim false.  The sander works great for the first ten sheets of adhesive backed paper, but when you get to the eleventh sheet of sandpaper the blade has become too gummed up.  You can try washing it but it's never really the same as it was new.  Maybe it's due to Lowes selling the wrong type and width rolled sandpaper, but I found this ""tool"" more frustrating than the last presidential election.

2) The second problem is the failure of the adhesive which holds the velcro backing to the mouse-style sanding plate.  This adhesive backing started to fail within the first 2 hours.  After two days use then leaving the tool alone for a week, the first sheet of velcro backed sandpaper completely removed the velcro backing from the mounting.  Sure I could try to find some type of glue to reattach the poorly engineered setup, but why should I need to overhaul a brand new sander with less than 6 hours use on it; this isn't a racecar engine?

I'm getting the Dremel (6000-01 Contour Sander Kit) and hoping it's the right tool for the job.",1.0
"I have a lot of Porter Cable tools and have reccomended Porter Cable to a lot of people. I have their routers, circular saws (older versions), biscuit joiner, nail guns and a lot more. I bought this sander a few months after they came out. It is  the worst tool ever made. They need a better design for holding the profiles. I have used it 3 times and it sanded good as long as the profile didn't fall out. I have decided to use the profiles without the vibrator. I hope someone will come up with a manual type profile sander that you can grasp easier than the little profiles. I wish I would have given it back to the manufacturer, but I have had it too long. I would not reccomend this to anyone unless you want to use the profiles manually.",1.0
save your money period. had i read the reviews before purchasing this product i'd never made the investment. returning this one asap!!!!,1.0
"Like many others I purchased the Porter Cable profile sander on the reputation of the company. I owned it about two hours before I returned it.
The tool is powerful enough though rather bulky. The problems with the sander stem from the poorly designed profile material and the pressure sensitive adhesive used to hold the paper to the profile.
The profiles are made of the same rubber your mother hated for putting black marks all over her kitchen floor.
At least she could remove the marks. Ever try to get a rubber mark off bare wood in a tight place?
With profile sanding it is a given that the sandpaper is going to be fit to a small contour or a point and therefore will wear out or clog very quickly.
With this sander quickly literally means seconds!
It is an enormous waste of time and sandpaper to change paper after every 30 seconds of use.
Machines should be time savers,not trouble makers.
Dremel makes a profile sander that is much easier to use. The profiles do not make black marks as the paper does not wear out so quickly. The paper is industrial quality cloth backed which helps greatly.
The paper is in the form of a hollow sleeve attached only by the form of the profile.
You simply pop the profile off the machine ,roll the sleeve a little and pop it back on. Ah fresh paper cuts so well!
Like the other reviewers I own other Porter-Cable machines which I like very much. PC circular saw,the router/plunge router combo,4"" x 24"" belt sander and a biscuit joiner.
Please save yourself the trouble and frustration of the Porter Cable profile sander.
If someone gives you one as a gift,smile,thank them, and as soon as you can sell it!",1.0
This is the single most useless piece of junk porter-cable ever made. It is a complete waste of money and a huge source of frustration. I cannot believe the company made such a horrible tool. If I was porter-cable I would remove the tool from circulation to avoid completely driving away customers forever. IT DOES NOT WORK and makes more work if you try to use it. VERY VERY VERY DISSAPOINTING !!!!,1.0
"I have a lot of Porter Cable tools, and I'm one of the company's biggest fans.  I love their routers, their circular saws, their biscuit joiner, and I have them all.  But this is without a doubt the worst value in a tool ever.
Here's what's good about the kit:
1) The profiles are handy when not attached to the sander
Here are the problems:
1) First of all, the profiles never REALLY fit what you're sanding, so there's always a point early-on during the sanding where the aggressive action of the sander wears right through the sandpaper and you start leaving black rubber streaks on your material (the profile is now rubbing the wood directly).
2) The machine is not smooth.
3) It's noisy.
4) The profiles won't stay in the holder.  They fall out.
5) PSA paper (uses adhesive).  Not much fun.
So... there's my opinion.  I consistently rate this as the worst purchase I ever made as far as tools go.  Save yourself some money and buy the profiles separately.  All by themselves, they're usable.  Attached to the aggressive sander, they last about 3 minutes before you're burning rubber.
Sorry, PC... I would have loved to have said something more positive!",1.0
"The manufacturer has down sized the 9444VS by reducing the number of profiles from fourteen to nine as contained in the 9444 model; the original package contained the Dust Wand which is no longer within the package; and case size has been reduced (it's black now instead of gray if you care).  Effectively, the 9444VS kit is now the same as the 9444 with the exception of the tool itself.  I was lucky enough to purchase the last kit in the store that was not down graded.
Upon taking the tool to the job site, I have been pleased with the tool's performance and versatility.  The variable speed plus the lengthened stroke found in the VS model warrants the 30% increase in price over the 9444 even after the kit down grade.  I was able to get into all locations by changing the profile accordingly.  The resulting sanded areas did not show grit marks and therefor did not require and touch up, which was would have negated the usefulness of the tool.",1.0
"I have never in my life been so disappointed with a power tool. The sandpaper will not stay on the profiles no matter how clean and dust free the profile is. The profiles will not stay in the holder. I spent more time cleaning the black rubber marks off my bookshelf trim due to the fact that the andpaper kept sliding off or wearing out within 2 minutes of installing the paper. I will never buy another porter cable product, and I have been purchasing woodworker tools for 30 years, and respected the brand name.",1.0
"Instead of a PC product, this is more like a dirt cheap sand casting from a 3rd world country. The ""machining"" is just as crude to boot. For instance, the guide rods are not even parallel in both the vertical and horizontal planes. And those cheap thumbscrews need pliers to keep the thing from slipping. I like the router it goes on, but this thing is a complete waste of money.",1.0
"The belt doesn't stay in the center. You have to keep adjusting it. Because of this, the metal plate under the belt came off from one side. Second biggest problem is the dust cover which doesn't take all the dust for a loose connection with the unit. The power is acceptable but because of this, I had to return to Lowes.",1.0

"Very poor customer service from the seller and Porter Cable itself.

The sander itself is fine, but the zipper on dust collection bag came jammed and unusable.  I contacted the seller and they never responded.  I contacted Porter's customer support and they said they'd send me a new bag.  Problem solved right?  Nope.  They sent me a DeWalt bag that didn't fit this sander.  I let them know about the mixup so they sent me the same DeWalt bag again.  So I told them about the second mix up. They said something was wrong with their inventor and they had to look into it.  3 months have gone by and they still can't figure it out.

Like I said, the sander itself is fine.  Very good in fact.  For example, the tracking control is easy to use and the variable speeds are great.  A dust bag is not a big deal (especially if you're going to be hooking this up to a dust collection system) but this shows how poor the Porter Cable customer service is.  I dread having to deal with any warranty issues with these people and won't be buying anymore Porter Cable or DeWalt tools.",1.0

"This review is ONLY addressing this sander from the prospective of using it and being left handed.  If you are left handed absolutely avoid this torture device.  First of all the ""continuous on button""  hits you right in the middle of your trigger finger. To compound that,  it sticks way out and is particularly uncomfortable.  It is also possible to inadvertently lock the ""continuous on""  feature unknowingly, making this tool potentially unsafe for a left handed person to use.  I sent it back immediately. I also called Porter Cable to complain about this lack of respect and concern for left handed people ........they couldn't care less about the 35 million  left handers in the US.......why?  By the way, this sander is overly heavy and quite noisy.  My front line sander is a Bosch 1274, really quite nice for left handers, but now unavailable.  Rats.!!!",1.0

There is no doubt that this product is top notch as all of my Milwaukee tools (I have TONS of them)are!
But this experience with RFBDirect has me just apoplectic. I realized right after I ordered the light, that it was not compatible with my battery! On a Fri evening, and within 10 MINUTES of placing the order, I tried to cancel. I explained that it was the wrong light for my battery setup.

I guess it was more important for RFBDirect, to capture twelve dollars (spelled out hoping to avoid a price deletion) in revenue than provide a positive customer experience. Never heard a peep from them and the flashlight just appeared at my door today. Sure as hell, it won't fit either my 14.4V or 18V batteries. I know it is my fault, but when I ordered, the memo was, ""order soon, only 1 left in stock"". I figured place the order, run out to garage and verify compatibility, run back to cancel if there was a problem.

"I own a small furniture business and we have about 6 of these sanders, but only about 2-3 that work at any given time. I have returned and exchanged at least half a dozen of these. We use them on a daily basis but they do not get constant use, usually an hour or two a day. Here is what has gone out on these, from most frequent to least.

-Motors spark and lose power, blowing them out helps some times but not always, eventually they just stop
-Triggers go bad, we've taken them apart, replaced or repaired them
-Belts break, internal rubber one, so motor spins but roller does not

When working, they are great! but on average we usually get about 3 months out of one, I started dating them to keep track. I invested in a few of them early on, and have been exchanging them if it went bad, but they no longer want to take them back. I also figured maybe it was a couple duds that I got, but not the case. These are truly not reliable and a waste of money. I will be trying the makita ones in hopes for more longevity.",1.0
"I bought mine 10/17/03 and have used it at the most 30 minutes because it has very little suction.

I have replaced it with a 30 year old CRAFTMANS shop vac that works much better, so for now it is the most useless tool in my shop including the broken hand sanders.",1.0
This sander is the worst I have ever used. The bag does not collect the dust it just shoots it in your face. Spend the extra money and buy a makita. I now use two different ones and they are the best.,1.0
"Received it for a Christmas gift and it sat in my shop for a year. Recently I needed it to sand a counter top I was building, so out it came from the tool cabinet. I cut the plastic bands from the box ,hooked up the dust bag ,adjusted the tracking and started sanding. In about 15 minutes the sander began to slow down and sparks were shooting from the brushes. I also was getting an electrical shock from the trigger. I check the Internet for solutions and decided to change the brushes. It destroyed 2 sets of brushes and sparks were still shooting out of the motor. This sander is a piece of crap and I think the dust collection is garbage. The entire motor housing was filled with saw dust when I was sanding. I'm really starting to doubt the quality of porter cable tools. For $200 dollars, I think their quality control should be a lot better. I think I might try a makita next time. Always try a new power tool when you get it before you put it away. Lesson learned.",1.0
"I just purchased this today (11-17-06). Junk. It's going back tomorrow. The dust bag is the size of a football and you cannot see what you're doing. They removed the 90 degree tube for the dust bag. I am pretty sure this adds to dust everywhere. I can't even hookup my vacuum to it. It tips easily causing gouges in the wood. Very difficult to operate with one hand. This is the 4th Porter Cable I have bought. Three out of 4 have been junk.

"In the first six hours of owning this sander:

1.  Pulled it out of the box and didn't notice the on/off switch was locked on.  Plugged it in, smashed my finger.

2.  Dust collection doesn't work.  The motor/fan spits wood chips at you which happen to shoot at your eyes underneath safety goggles.  I put a vacuum on it hoping the big suction piece at the back would suck up wood dust, but found that the suction went around the motor, not to suck up wood dust.  Probably sucks air around the motor to help with cooling:

3.  I couldn't hold my hand on the metal body of the sander after ten minutes it got so hot.

4.  I sucked the power cord under the belt but I won't hold that against this sander, definitely user error.

5.  Something stripped/broke in the drivetrain as the motor spins now but the belt doesn't.

6.  The dust collection tube needs to be mounted on the other side of the sander.  I couldn't get the sander underneath the lip of the stairs I was sanding because the tube got in the way.

"I see they have added some explanation as to which saws this will fit. That was missing earlier (I took screen shots). When you purchase a new Delta Unisaw this base shows up, it is incorrect. No other Delta bases even show up. The seller said I would have to pay to ship it back. However, once you try it out it is to late. The 600 pound saw scratches it up a bit. I find it funny that I have received emails telling me how much used bases are selling for. I purchased the correct base outside of Amazon (50-257 Current model Unisaw with 52"" Beismeyer Fence).

Just for reference, I bought my saw and base from the same merchant at the same time. I buy allot of merchandise from Amazon, mainly for the security of buying online.

"Wish I could say good things, but Amazon can't seem to get it right here.
Take off one star for the fact that the extension for this base, when assembled, is not parallel to the main part of the base.
Take off one star for the fact that the base comes with no instructions on how to actually mount the saw onto the base.
Take off one star for the  fact that the 50-289 mobile base does not fit the 36-L552 Unisaw with the Biesemeyer fence.  It is even recommended as an ""item frequently bought together"" with this saw.  I even confirmed this with ""Vinnie"" at the Amazon 866-876-8073 ""help"" line.  When the saw arrived, I measured things up and things did not seem right.  I called Delta Tech Support at 800-223-7278 and ""Fred"" advised me that the correct mobile base was the 50-273 mobile base.
From reading other posts, apparently this is not the first time this has happened.

"I bought this blade to upgrade the standard blade that came with my 7 1/2"" miter saw that I bought to carry around to smaller jobs.  BIG mistake.
Don't know why but this blade will not cut anything without kicking back.  It will even take chunks out of 2x pine.  Don't even try it on hardwood or cabinet moulding unless you've got a suit of armor on.
It's not the saw alignment.  It's dead on.  And the saw works fine with the original blade and it even works better than this with some of my worn out framing blades from my circular saws.
Saw in another review where another user had this same problem with another Freud blade.  This is only the second Freud I've purchased.  I bought one for my 10"" Radial Arm Saw thinking it might make it safer to rip with with the anti-kickback feature.  WRONG ! ! !  The kickback I got with this blade dang near destroyed my guards and probably would have killed me if the guards hadn't been up to snuff.
I'm beginning to think that the Freud anti-kickback ""feature"" is nothing but a dangerous sales gimmick.  And I definitely won't be buying any more Freud blades in the near future.  This one's going back to where I got it, too.",1.0
"Unit flexes at the point where extension joins the main base. This leads to an unstable and potentially dangerous operation of saw and router.

"I agree with the review that you should stabilize your saw and not your blade, but at some point you are going to want a blade stabilizer. If you do a lot of crosscuts/miters on your table saw it really helps out to give you that ""shinny"" crosscut. This stabilizer is the worst that could ever have been invented. Who wants to have their blade offset approx 1/4""? There are two stabilizers in the kit and I have yet to see a table saw that you can remove the original flange mounted to the arbor so you don't warp your blade with only one stabilizer. (The stabilizer is larger than most arbor flanges) Freud really should have thought out this design. They make wonderful blades, but this product makes them look like idiots. You have to adjust your fence to compensate. Homemade box cutting jigs are shot. The only nice thing is that they are not as large as other blade stabilizers. I threw this one in the trash and bought the forest 5"" blade stabilizer. Does everything I want. I can use it with my dado. Which is a Freud. DO NOT USE ONLY ONE OF THESE.

"Using both stabilizers takes up a 1/2"" of arbor width.  I didn't have room to install both on my Bosch 4000 bench saw so I installed one on the outside.  Although Freud literature doesn't point this out, these are made to be used only as a pair.  If you install only one your blade gets retensioned away from being flat.  I noticed this because after installing one, my splitter no longer lined up and I had to adjust the blade 1/2 a degree to get it back to being perpendicular to the table.  Perhaps they improve the quality of the cut when used as a pair with a thin kerf blade.  I wasn't able to test that.  I give them only 1 star because Freud doesn't make it clear that both need to be used.  The Forrest stabilizer is made to work as a single unit on one side of the blade.  Probably a better choice for most people.",1.0
"I purchased this drill two years ago when it first came out.  While this drill is certainly heavy duty, it has been a disappointment.  It has a very dangerous switch which is easily turned on when you are working in awkward positions, as typical with right angle drills.  Also, it lacks variable speed and reverse which was not clear in the description when I bought it.  My brother has a Milwaukee (made by Sioux) right angle drill which is hands down better which I would recommend instead.",1.0
"I'm an Industrial Technology teacher and have access to many new tools. I am very disappointed with this Dewalt Product. I still don't understand why they didn't put a reversable switch on this unit. It would have been great for installing and removing Kitchen cabinets. Moreover, when using spade bits to drill through flooring, you periodically need to ""back"" the bit up to remove it when it becomes bound. I think a better purchase would be a temporary 90 degree chuck that mounts to a portable drill. Be very careful when setting this unit on the ground ... it's super easy to hit the start switch and if you've got a large spade bit in the chuck ""watch out!!""

Authentic Delta filters are rated to capture and remove dust down to 1 Micron to protect your lungs.  This thing comes in a bag with nothing to indicate what standard it was manufactured to or by whom for you to verify that it is even coming close to that.

Sure this filter may come off the exact factory line or supplier that Delta gets theirs from.  Or it could be a cheap Chinese knockoff equivalent to fake baby formula filled with melamine, who knows, and how could you tell?

"I recently purchased this saw, and spent the next two weeks in the most frustrating situation I have ever experienced with a power tool.  I brought the saw home, carried all the very heavy components into my basement.  I assembled the legs and attached the saw body and cast-iron extensions.
Then, I opened the box for the rails, and found that (1) there was no hardware; (2) no directions; and (3) the tape was fastened on the rail crooked.  I went back to the store where I bought it, and the owner told me that Jet has some problems with hardware.  In fact, it seems that other customers have been returning Jet saws for this very reason.  I had to wait a week for another rail set.  Finally, it came in, and I took the new rail set home.  But this time, I found that the hardware WAS THE WRONG SIZE!!!!  Back to the store again for another rail set.  I get home, and this time, I decided to take a look at the fence, just to check it out, and I find a gaping crack right along one of the solder areas.  Irate, I open the rails again, just to check, and again, NO HARDWARE!!!!!
Given this kind of horrible quality control, I cannot be sure that the rest of the saw is made properly.  The guide rails and the fence are two things I can visually inspect. But how about the motor, the trunnions, and the gear assemblies inside?
Two smaller problems: (1) Jet only has one set of instructions for three different saws.  This means that you are constantly trying to figure out how your saw is different from the pictures and the directions.  Jet should spend the money to write a separate manuals; (2) Jet advertises that their saws are ""made in USA"" when in fact they are assembled in Taiwan.
This is all very unfortunate, since Jet has a great reputation in with its other tools.  I am very surprised and disappointed in Jet for all of the above reasons.

"I received this unit 4 years ago as a gift from my father.  I have only used it on two projects and while using it on the second project it died.  The problem was traced to the windings in the motor. Terminal for a $100  tool even though it was only used to cut less than 50 biscuit slots.  That  aside, the rocker switch is in a very poor location and the fence  adjustment is crude.  This is not a slam on Freud as I recommend their saw  and dado blades.",1.0
"Looks like it was made in a third world country. Covered in a black, greasy protectant and when cleaned off, was just a rusty casting. Just very poor workmanship, not what I would have expected from Delta. Thumb screw holes were crooked and off center and finished off very little. It could have, at least, been painted Delta grey. It is not at all as pictured. All the parts are there, but that's where the similarity stops.  I realize that it's not a commercial product, but really? For $100 + I expected something better.

The upper rail also tilted down several degrees when attached to the side of my contractors saw, I can't imagine that being part of the design. When I made crosscuts on material results were inconsistent.  Overall quality and performance was poor. If I had known it was an import I would never have bought it.

"The Fein tool is one of the best investments I've ever made in tools;  it has accomplished things that no other tool would, e.g. cutting through 2"" thick 100+ year old heart pine (it pings when hit with a hammer, it's so hard).  Not with these blades, though!  These began to break teeth off within minutes of use on SOFT new pine.  I've had the tool for several years now and used it for countless tasks but, even having so much experience with it, I thought I might be twisting or pressing on this blade somehow.  It didn't matter how careful I was, though, teeth continued to break off until only about a third were left.

These cost over $11 per blade and they bear the Fein brand, so they should be as useful as the other blades Fein makes.  My guess is that the teeth were hardened but not tempered, so they're brittle and will never be able to do what the tool itself is designed to do.

Too late for me to return them, as I loved the tool so much I bought a bunch of different sawing blades to have on hand and just got around to using these.  The quality is definitely not up to Fein quality and it makes the company look bad.  I cannot recommend these at all, consider them a total waste of $36, and wish I could rate them a zero.",1.0

This unit NEEDS carbide blades for the planer. Without them, the unit is relatively useless on anything harder than fresh yellow pine.

"I'm a fan of Makita tools.  I have more than a dozen Makita tools, from cordless weed wacker to circular saw.  So, when it came time to replace my Dewalt cutoff saw, I didn't hesitate to order a Makita.  This ended up being a disappointment in design, construction and performance.  I'm comparing this saw side-by-side with a Dewalt D28715, same price in stores as this Makita.  I'm also comparing it to what I can remember of my lower priced Ridgid, which got stolen.  The only pro is that the Makita weighs less the others, but that's not all good because that weight savings is due to poor construction.

Design: The blade is allowed to go down so far it hits the floor or cuts into your work bench. There is an adjustable stop bar at the rear left, but it's useless.  The plastic wing nut doesn't hold the bar tight enough to stop the arm.  The Dewalt and Ridgid both use a bolt that creates a solid stop.  There is slop in the arm mechanism, which allows the blade to move about 1/8"" side-to-side. Furthermore, there is slop in the motor's bearing, adding another 1/16"" drift in the blade.  The Dewalt has absolutely no play.  I don't recall the Ridgid having this kind of slop neither.  The mechanism to lock the arm down is a stupid chain that hooks to the bottom of the handle.  Most other saws use the same chain lock.  But the Dewalt, has a well thought out pin you simply push to lock, pull to unlock. Adjust the Makita's fence requires a tool.  Dewalt and Ridgid are tool-less.  Makita has no tool holder to retain the fence and blade tool.  Although Dewalt and Ridgid require a tool to replace the blade, they have places to secure the tool so it doesn't get lost.  The Makita's base is narrower than Dewalt and Ridgid.  A wider base makes it easier to stabilize stock.

Construction: The base is made of a thinner steel.  It's so thin the stop lever has already dented the base during shipping.  There is so much plastic I almost feel like this could have come from Harbor Freight.  Although Dewalt and Ridgid also use plastic, theirs feels more solid, thicker, and there's less use of it.  The guard, again thinner and flimsier than others.  The deflector, again, thin and flimsy. Already bent in the box.  Makita has a plastic safety button.  I don't see why a safety button is even necessary.  The button  a lot of play and I can see this thing breaking soon.

Performance:  I immediately noticed the motor takes longer to spin to full speed than other saws. It takes almost twice as long as my Dewalt.  When cutting, it's obvious the Dewalt has more power, despite both motors being rated at 15A, 3800 RPM.",1.0

"I ordered the Freud 8 in. Super Stacked Dado set (SD508). The set contains: dado blades, shims, and a carry case. The majority of this review focuses on the carry case. The first set I ordered arrived with the internal red plastic of the carrying case totally shredded (see photos). In addition, the shims were rusted (see photos), likely because the bag was ripped open when the internals of the case were being destroyed. I returned the first set and Amazon sent me a second set. Once again, the internal red plastic in the carrying case was damaged (see photos), although to a lesser extent than the first box. I am a big fan of Freud blades, and own several. However, given that the carrying case is ""part of the product I purchased"", the quality of the carrying case (and thus the product I purchased), is ridiculously low. I did not return the second set because the quality of the carrying case is so poor, that I am not sure I can actually receive a pristine product via UPS shipping.",1.0
"For carbide tipped blades, it is very important that the carbide tips don't touch or they will chip. So it's important that the heavy blades come with a rugged case to store them in. With this product, the case does not hold the blades properly; it is flimsy and cracks easily as noted by other reviewers - the blades are held apart by a thin layer of cheap, very fragile plastic that crumbles with the slightest movement of the heavy blades. Also, the metal shims are corroded.

I exchanged the first broken and corroded set, and it was replaced with another - same thing. Both cases were broken (no shipping damage, just broken cases), both sets of shims corroded. I called Freud to see if they would be improving the product as there are similar complaints from other customers about this product, they said no, ""sometimes that's just how it is"". So it sounds like they'll continue to be sold with the same poor quality storage case. See attached photos, compare to the Dewalt Dado set case (also available on Amazon for less) which is rugged and the blades lock in.",1.0

"Despite the cheap case and a cheap wrench that doesn't fit my Rigid table saw, this blade works well. Of course, I can't try it for anything larger than 5/8"" inch cuts as it gets too large for my spindle. After reversing the setup, I also had to get a washer so the screws wouldn't hit the motor mount.

In my case the recess is not large enough to get a wrench (socket) on the saw's nut ( the wrench that come with it is for a smaller nut); also, with all the blades on it's too wide for the arbor.

"I wanted a 6"" extension for my 20 year old Rockwell Delta Model 14 band saw, which Delta no longer makes.  After being told by a Delta tech rep that ""as far as he knew"", JET was the only extension which would fit.  I purchased one, only to find it does NOT fit. The dowel pin spacing on the JET extension do not match those on the Delta, and unless you have access to good machinist to relocate the pin holes on the extension, it cannot be used.  The second minor problem I found was the rod for the adjustable blade guard was 15/16"" dia. while the Delta is 1"". It could still be used but would not have benefit of a snug sliding fit within the hexagon opening into which the rod is inserted.  I would have been very pleased with this Jet extension if it did fit.  It is very well made having all the necessary components for a complete conversion and I would have given it 5 stars.  I only indicated 1 star as a flag for someone who may also have a Delta 14"" band saw, which was a very popular floor tool.",1.0

"I have a 3hp Jet table saw that went up in flames last week. Well at least the motor did.
Keep in mind that I have NEVER touched the motor on this saw.
I was working on the table saw and smelled something very nasty. It was not wood or even a hot wire. It turned out to be the run capacitor on the motor over heating and burning up
The next day I pulled the motor out (not an easy chore as the motor weights over 70 pounds). When I got the motor off its mounting plate and outside the table saw cabinet, I pulled the cover of the outer enclosure where the power wire from the magnetic switch connects to the motor. The inside was PACKED with dust. ""Where's the gasket?"" I asked myself. Not good.
So I put the motor on the bench and removed the metal covers from the capacitors. One is the run capacitor; the other is the start capacitor. Once again, both of these covers were packed with dust. There are 2 wires running from each cap to the inside of the motor through a hole and I could see dust inside the motor. Not good. A TEFC (totally enclosed fan cooled) motor - right? Well Jet should call theirs a BEFC (barely enclosed fan cooled) motor.
Anyway, the run cap was totally melted down so I took the motor to a local repair technician that spent 2 hours talking to me and diagnosing the motor. He hooked up a new run cap and bench tested it first. Everything sounded fine but a squeal started emitting from inside of the motor. So he pulled the motor apart only to find the inside full of wood dust. The wood entered through the holes in the case where the cap wires pass through. Then HE said ""Not good"". The windings were discolored. They began to overheat causing more resistance in the windings causing the run cap to overheat causing the cap to catch fire.
He told me run caps hardly ever go bad and that the dust entering the windings were the cause. But he went on to say that the lack of rubber gaskets on the covers was the root cause. Clearly Jet's fault. So I e-mail Jet with my explanation and their response was:
""THE WARRANTY IS OUT ON YOUR MACHINE""
This was their entire response. And in all CAPS to boot!
Now here's the kicker. I am forced to buy a replacement motor from Jet. I wanted to buy a Baldor or Leeson motor. Even a Dayton would be better AND cheaper. But no. Electric motors follow national specifications published by NEMA. NEMA specifies the dimensional characteristics of the mounting plate, shaft diameter, and distance from the mounting plate to the center of the shaft. All critical for a given application, but not with Jet. This motor has all NEMA 56 specs EXCEPT the shaft diameter.
My recommendation:
If you are considering buying a Jet product, check for these gaskets.",1.0
"I bought this saw and it came with a badly warped base. Unfortunately I didn't discover this in time to return it to amazon for a full refund. I sent it to Freud for repair/replacement and got the same base back, only slightly less warped. It won't follow a saw guide because of ""drift"", in other words the edge of the guide is not parallel to the blade. Basically the engineering on this saw is very ambitious but the manufacturing craftsmanship is terrible.

Addendum: Freud eventually made good by shipping me a new base. If I were to rate the saw now that it has been repaired, it deserves at least three stars. It has a nice powerful motor with variable speed, but maybe it's more powerful than it needs to be. It is fairly heavy, and the motor has a lot of inertia so it keeps on running for several seconds after the trigger is released. The dust collection attachment is somewhat cumbersome, but without it the cutting line is quickly obscured by sawdust. If I had it to do over again I would go for a lighter weight saw with a dust blower like the Black and Decker JS600K, and just be prepared to return it promptly if the base didn't line up just right.",1.0
"I must have received a product that is vastly different than the ones getting 4 and 5 star reviews.
Having read many reviews of planes costing considerably more than this one I expected some tuning to be required.
So I chop it out of the package and think the cast iron surfaces are coated with cosmolene, got the kerosene out and washed it.  Nope it's not coated, the cast iron is just that rough.
Ok some sandpaper work is to be expected.  Broke out the 600 grit, hummm its not hardly touching it.  Switched to 400 grit and it ain't getting the job done either.  Tried 220 and now I can see bright spots showing up on the edges but it will take hours to whittle this thing down.
I didn't expect to use my benchtop belt sander to flatten this thing but with a new 80 grit belt I got to work and after considerable effort the sole is mostly flat except for a dip right behind the mouth.
I don't need perfection so I called it good enough.  The 80 grit belt sander left a superior surface compared to what I started with but I when ahead and used the tablesaw top as a reference flat surface some 220 sand paper to polish it just a little more.  Never did hit the bottom of that dip though.
The backside of the blade was almost flat, very much inline with what I expected and I was able to flatten it pretty quickly with 400 grit and polish it with 600 grit.
I used a roller blade guide I ordered along with the block plane and 600 grit sand paper to sharpen the blade.
Now that it has been beaten into submission it works fine.
I really don't think it would have taken any more effort to get a $12 block plane from Harbor Freight up to the level this plane is now at.
After fiddling with it and learning how to adjust/use it I think it will be useful to have in the workshop.
I wasn't expecting a top of the line tool, but I also wasn't expecting to need power tools to get this into working order either.
Out of the box 1 maybe 2 stars, after tuning 3 stars because in the end its just another cheap throw away tool no matter how much flattening, polishing, and tuning you do to it.

Ok, after owning this for a while I am knocking off a couple of stars.
Why the change of heart??  Fair question.
After watching countless Rob Cosman videos and trying every trick he shows I gave up.
I have been fiddling with this repeatedly since February (it's now July) and I just got fed up with it.
Asking it to do anything more than break an edge on a corner is an effort in futility and even then it requires constant adjustment.
So today I went to the local Woodcraft store, bit the bullet, and bought the Woodriver version.
Thankfully it is a completely different animal.
In less than 30 minutes I had checked flatness, honed the blade and was trying it out on red oak.
The Woodriver cost $90 and I paid $32 for the Stanley, I certainly wish I had just bought the Woodriver to begin with and only cried once.
After buying twice I have spent almost as much as a Lie Nielsen block plane would have cost and that doesn't factor in all the hours I put into the Stanley that were truly wasted since I never did get it to really work right.

I am going to return this for a different brand as I have wasted enough time trying to make this work. Buyer beware,1.0

"I was using a Rayobi biscuit joiner quite a bit over the course of 2 years to put together tabletops and thought I would ""upgrade"" to this Dewalt since it would allow me to attach it to dust collection and it seemed like it would be a little more ergonomic to use. I really disliked the handle on the Rayobi.

I take very good care of my tools and this is used in a shop, not carried around to jobs so it should have lasted for a while. It barely made it three months. While I do use the joiner quite a lot and it was more comfortable to use than the Rayobi, it has some very cheap parts in the depth plate/fence assembly that broke pretty quickly. The cast metal housing around the biscuit size selector knob also broke during normal use. However, none of that made the tool unusable but I did have to be careful when making adjustments. The bearing blowing apart was what finally killed the poor thing! I looked it up and it's only been 2 months and 12 days since I've purchased it so it's pretty disappointing. Guess I have to go back to using the Rayobi while I wait to see if Dewalt will fix this P.O.C.",1.0

"I bought this fence thinking it would fit my 14"" Jet band saw, since the description said it would fit most.  Unfortunately, when I started to install I quickly found out that it would not.  My band saw, as I found out later, is a bit too old (around 8-10 years)for this fence.  There is was no guidance available to make it fit my table either.  Basically the engineers at Jet said it was incompatible.  It would have been nice to know that before I made the purchase.",1.0
"I have a Ridgid 14"" bandsaw, and while putting this fence on the saw was no big deal (went on pretty easily, altho I did have to shim out the rails), the clamping pad on the fence itself fell off after just a few weeks.

I'm talking about the little piece of plastic that was POORLY glued on the clamp of the fence itself. It fell off repeatedly, even after I glued it back on repeatedly with Gorilla Glue, hot glue, epoxy, Superglue, you name it, I tried it.

I finally gave up and got the Rockler bandsaw table and fence combo. Now I have a much bigger table and a fence that locks down securely in a T track with no wobble, not to mention a circle cutting guide and a resaw fence.

Don't waste your money, go straight for the Rockler table and fence system.",1.0

I purchased this bag for my DW708 miter saw and it barely captures any of the sawdust.  Most of the sawdust shoots directly out the lower portion of the blade and will not make it up to the higher location of the bag. I  subsequently hooked up a vacuum system with much better results.,1.0
"Supposed to fit the 14"" (was even recommended) but doesn't even come close. Terrible quality. Not only does this fence not clamp down properly to itself, but it is impossible to keep square to the table and blade! Worthless. I wish I could return it, but I waited to install it on my bandsaw when it arrived and I could set them up together. Now I'll be buying another fence, probably Kreg. What a waste.",1.0
"I just tried to install this fence on my new J-8201K Jet bandsaw.  The aluminum fence is too long, about 1.25"" too long.  It hangs over the rear rail and does not hook on as it is supposed to.  I was thinking about having the local machine shop cut the fence back so it will fit, however, there is another problem.  The lever that is supposed to lock the fence in place just flops up and down.  It does not engage with or put any pressure whatsoever on the fence guide.

This is entirely unacceptable.  This fence is advertised as fitting ""all"" Jet 14"" bandsaws.  It clearly does not fit.  Further, it does not lock in place as a fence is supposed to.  Absolutely awful.  If you want $120 for a product, it ought to fit the bandsaw.  Further, it does not even lock in place.  I don't know how Jet can sell something that doesn't fit and doesn't work.

I am going to call Jet's customer service tomorrow.  If they can tell me how to get the fence to lock, I might have it cut down and keep it.  Otherwise, I am going to return it and probably buy the Kreg fence.

Again, if you have a 14"" Jet bandsaw, DO NOT buy this fence.  It doesn't work.  You will either have to modify it or return it for another.

Edit:  I tried to get the locking tab to work on this fence, but it wouldn't work.  The handle/lever turns a cam which pushes a little plastic rectangle against the rail.  The problem is that the little plastic rectangle is just glued on.  Mine fell off in shipping.  I tried to epoxy it back on, but that didn't work.  When you push against it laterally, the piece just comes back off.  It is an extremely poor design.  I can think of a couple dozen ways to design something that would capture the plastic piece better.  Ones that would probably cost under $1 for Jet to implement.  I cannot believe they put something so poorly designed into production.

Since I couldn't get the fence to lock to the rail, I boxed it up and sent it back for a refund.  Amazon made the return easy and fast!  Thank you, Amazon!  I had them ship me the Kreg KMS7200 bandsaw fence instead.  I installed it this afternoon and the Kreg fence is first rate.  I was a little apprehensive since it doesn't have a rear rail to slide along, but holds square and its locking mechanism is wonderful.  I highly recommend the Kreg fence - it does exactly what I want.

TL;DR: This Jet fence DOES NOT fit all 14"" Jet bandsaws.  I tried installing it on a 14"" Jet bandsaw, and it is too long.  Further, the locking mechanism is fatally flawed.  The locking tab falls right off and there is no way to secure it without redesigning the product.  Shame on you, Jet.  Your products should work with each other and the locking tab should be more secure.",1.0

"This fence worked well on my Jet Deluxe 14"" bandsaw for about 2 weeks before it started slipping. Apparently a little plastic piece fell off that allows it to lock to the rail.

"So after some research, I purchased this blade for my new Dewalt FlexVolt Sliding Miter Saw. I had read some great reviews on it.

I threw the blade on my saw for its first trim job, and I was immediately underwhelmed.

First issue, there's a ton of tear out on the rear of the work piece using this blade. The only way to get a semi-decent cut piece is to cut at an extremely slow rate. Even then, it's barely acceptable.  Compared to the Diablo blades, I shouldn't have to baby this, and the results are abysmal for the price tag.

I really wish I could return the blade at this point and try the 100 tooth crosscut blade from Diablo.

I'm sure this blade would be great for framing lumber and other non-finish cuts, but it sure isn't for any kind of trim work. Not recommended.",1.0
"Scroll up to the top of this page.  Does it still say, ""Fits Jet 14-inch bandsaws""?  Well, according to 2 different representatives at Jet customer support, this is not true!  Here is the email response that I received when I complained that the rip fence bar was over an inch too long for my 14"" bandsaw:

<<Thank you for writing and I apologize for my delay in responding to your email. Unfortunately the 708718R is not the correct rip fence assembly for your model bandsaw. This rip fence is for a bandsaw table size; 15x15.  The correct fence  for your model bandsaw will be as follows;

5782171  FENCE 14 VERTICAL BANDSAW
Fits a 14""x14"" table.

We apologize for this inconvenience. >>

WHAT?  Then how come the box it came in says ""FITS ALL JET 14"" BANDSAWS""?  I actually called Jet and spoke to a technical representative about this, but he told me EXACTLY the same thing!  He then implied that this was somehow  Amazon's fault, claiming that Jet has told Amazon multiple times to change its description.  But when I quoted to him what was written on the side of the product box,  he paused for a long time and then said, ""well...I don't know...but that's not correct"".

No kidding it's not correct!  If you read other reviews on this site, you will see that other people have experienced the same problem.  But what I can't figure out is why this product apparently fits some customers' 14"" band saws when Jet themselves say it shouldn't work?  My best guess is that some boxes have different length fences in them than other boxes.  I have come to expect this kind of shoddy quality control from Chinese manufacturers.  But a company that prides itself on its American heritage should have better quality and inventory control than this.  Shame on you Jet!

Every saw I've ever used will cut through a 2x4 just by bringing the blade down while the slide is locked.

I have already returned one set for a refund that Amazon said not to bother sending back BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFECTIVE. So, I went ahead and ordered a second set AND THEY DO NOT WORK EITHER. Quality control is lacking from Shop Fox, or is it Woodstock as the companies seem to be in fact one in the same.

Before anyone thinks these are wrong for a table saw because the green wheels rotate in both directions, the wheels are only a different color, and it is the bearing inside that dictates which direction they will rotate, either clockwise, counter clockwise or both. I don't have kickback issues, but rather want to ensure the wood stays against the fence. Perhaps these WOULD BE great, but since the T-Nuts are defective, who knows?",1.0

"I have an older DW705 (which still has its original bag), and a newer DW716 that needed a bag.  I was wondering how this universal bag could fit ""all"" of their saws, since the dust outlet fitting on these two saws are different, but I saw from the description that this universal bag included an adapter, so I decided to try it.  If I was buying this for my DW705, I would have given it three stars - it would fit that saw fine, although this new bag is only half the size of the original bag, and made of much thinner material.

But unfortunately, it won't fit the saw I needed this for, the DW716.  The fitting on this dust bag, and the dust outlet fitting on the DW716 are the same 1-5/8"" O.D., meaning, the fitting on the bag won't go into or over the saw fitting.  The adapter is useless for this saw as well, as one side of the adapter is the exact same size as what's on the bag.  The only way the adapter could be used is if you turn the bag inside out, cut the zip-tie that holds the current fitting on, and replace it with this one, however, the current fitting is what has the wire supports that keep the bag's shape, so removing that fitting isn't an option.

What I ended up doing is cutting an old piece of 1-5/8"" I.D. radiator hose, which slips over the saw's fitting, and the fitting on the bag.  Works fine, good tight fit, but I shouldn't have to ""MacGyver"" a DeWalt Universal Dust Bag to fit a popular DeWalt saw.  Again, physical connection shortcomings aside, this is a very cheaply made bag.  Very thin material, and half the size of the DeWalt bag on my DW705.  Very surprised that DeWalt was willing to put their name on this.",1.0

Otherwise it seems well made (not a stretch for a dustbag). BTW, I've never seen a dust bag that was great, they're just better than an open port. If you want more efficiency you'll have to hook up your shop vac (or better, a Fein or similar vac that turns on with the saw - but of course, that's how you lose the dust bag in the 1st place)  Note: my saw's dust port /tube has an ID of 1 3/8"", OD of 1 5/8""; this dust bag has an ID of 1 9/16"", OD of 1 11/16"", so doesn't fit either way (inside the throat or over the tube). And, as others have noted, the 'adapter' only fits in one or the other, not both.  I could come up with a workaround (PVC fitting etc) but am returning another product so including this. If not hugely inconvenient, I would suggest making the trip to a DeWalt sevice center to get the right one (and try harder at not losing it :)",1.0

"Overall good idea and good design. But it looks like someone over time cheapened these more and more, the wheels should be made out of rubber or material that would grip the board and pull it toward the fence and the old ones were made like that and worked great.  Now the wheels are made out of cheep yellow, no grip at all and very slippery plastic (you can slide the board away from the fence with no effort at all) they still provide downward force OK but do not pull the board towards the fence as they should.  Dont waste your money,  just use good feather board instead works just as good.",1.0
"Holy cow, what a piece of garbage.  One of the previous reviewers explained it perfectly.  The board you're straight lining can not be held flat on the saw.  Not only that, but if you're doing a board, say, six feet long, then as you slide this along, the bottom of the clamp comes off your saw and then the piece sits flat.  This causes the cut NOT to be true.  You would need to put a clamp every 15"" inches or so down the length of your board to keep it consistant.  And even if you do that, it's still not lying flat.

What a piece of garbage.  I tried it once and threw it in the trash (after smashing it with a hammer since it screwed up my cherry).  Luckily, I took my cherry back to my wood store and they straight lined it for me so I didn't lose any.",1.0

They were not helpful in fully understanding the problem, but they did decide to send me a different adapter that they thought would solve the problem (they were not sure).  They referred me to the local Service site in Hayward, CA and this may solve the problem.  Lia was very helpful, and pulled in a technician who searched the literature and bulletins.

"I bought this biscuit joiner here on Amazon maybe two years ago. Out of the box the flip down fence was probably 9 to 10 degrees out of square. That's right, 9 to 10 degrees. The quality control person in China must have been drunk. I tried to mess with it but quickly realized that it was simply an atrocious casting. I finally took thi tool directly to a Dewalt sales and service outlet in Hayward, CA. The guys seemed nice enough. They said it was a warranty issue and that it would be fixed for free. They said ""give us ten days"". I gave it longer, having had many tools repaired in the past and came back a few months later. When I handed the man my claim slip he said he thought the tool might have been sold.
""Why?""
""When they're left here that long that's what we do.""
""You could have called me.""
""It looks like we still have it""
""I guess I should be thankful"" Dewalt guy notes my sarcasm.
I opened the case and pulled out the tool with a bright A-Okay-everything-is-repaired tag on it and looked at the flip down fence. STILL 9 to 10 degrees out of square.
""You see this?"" I hold the tool aloft for the Dewalt dude. ""my claim slip says; 'fence out of square'""
""What? I don't see the problem.""
""Do you know what this tool is for?""
He gives me a patronizing look.
""It's out of square by a mile man. It won't work this way""
Eventually a guy from the back comes out and fiddles with the tool in front of me for probably ten minutes. I watch as he does everything I tried when I first opened the case. Nothing he does suggests that he knows what this thing does, or that he has ever seen it before. Finally, first Dewalt guy looks up the part number, opens a box somewhere, and pulls out a new fence. The second Dewalt guy pushes the fence on it roughly and hands it back to me.
I take home tool, and its still out of square by two degrees, which makes biscuits out of alignment by 4 degrees. I was hoping this tool would be used for cabinet making but instead it will probably just remain in the carpentry tool pile.

"I purchased a factory reconditioned (with full warranty) DeWalt plate joiner.  Not only was it missing a pin on which the miter swivels up and down, but the blade cut far too deep, no matter how much I adjusted it.  I had to stick a 16p nail in the missing hole to keep the miter from flopping around while working.  It was a good thing I made many test cuts since it cut far deep.  For example, on setting ""0"" it cut so deep that a ""0"" biscuit completely disappeared in the cut.  I was finally able to crank the fine depth adjustment down so that on ""0"" setting I could use a ""10"" biscuit.  I normally purchase DeWalt by default since I have never had anything but good luck with them, but boy did I get screwed on this one.

"At first glance this insert seems well made but it becomes apparent very quickly that Leecraft never tested it on a Delta saw. There are two problems. The first is minor, the screws are not long enough. Their heads hit the top of the countersink, stopping their downward travel, before the top of the insert is flush with the top of the tablesaw. This can be fixed with 1/16"" longer screws or by drilling the countersunk holes a little deeper.

The second problem takes a little more effort to correct. The back adjustment screws are in the same position as they are on the Delta insert. No problems there. The two front screws however have been moved back about 1/2"" from where they are on the Delta insert. This shouldn't be a problem because the ledges below the insert are long enough. It becomes a problem though because the adjustment screw on the front left is directly over what was the lock-down hole (the fifth hole) on the Delta insert. Because the Leecraft insert uses adjustment screws that are the same diameter and thread pitch as the drilled and tapped lock-down hole below it the adjustment screw has nothing to push against to move the insert upward, and in fact, it will thread itself into the lock-down hole with no height adjustment possible. The Peachtree insert has the same adjustment hole positions as the problematic Leecraft but because they use larger diameter 1/4-20 screws the screw doesn't thread itself into the lock-down hole. Leecraft should have either left the adjustment screws where Delta placed them or used larger diameter screws. If they had done any testing they would have found this problem themselves.",1.0

"I am a professional cabinetmaker, so my standards may be a bit higher than the weekend warrior, however, this is probably my least favorite hand tool in the entire shop.  I have previously used a Lamello Top and that set a pretty high standard for biscuit joiners for me.  The Dewalt has some intriguing design features, however, they have been very poorly executed.  The problems are as follows:
  1.) Motor vent on top of machine blows chips and fine dust right into your eyes REGARDLESS of wether you are wearing safety glasses.  Very annoying.
  2.)  Accuracy is pitiful, and you can forget about the factory presets for angles and squareness.  If you like to tinker with tools for days at a time, this is your tool- if you would like to create things out of wood, it may not be.
  3.)  The noise of this little glorified Dewalt grinder is earsplitting and sounds a bit like a high pitched freight train grinding against the side of a glass tunnel whilst a passenger drags his or her fingernails along a continuous chalkboard.
  4.)  You will need to stop your work aproximately every other biscuit to clean the dust port that is undersized with a blast of pressurized air, which a.)will blind you, b.)send chips flying all over your workspace, and c.) slow down your production time by approximately 50%.

5.)  Did I mention accuracy?
Conclusion:  Yes, the low end Lamello is twice as much money.  However, if you plan on using this biscuit joiner a fair amount, it is worth it in spades (not the bits).  If you are a professional woodworker, increase your budget to the Lamello Top.  Yes, it is very expensive for a hand tool, but how much was that sliding compound miter saw you bought?  I, for one, wish I had done that originally, so that my Lamello Top would not have cost me a Dewalt joiner as well.",1.0
"I was disappointed to purchase this saw and later discover it was made in China.  Bosch glosses over this by identifying the country of origin as ""PRC"".  Why pay a premium for a supposedly quality tool only to discover it was made in a Chinese sweatshop?",1.0
"Does not fit all DeWalt miter saws. I have a DWS780 Type 20 and it, nor the adapter that comes with the bag, fit. Also, for those complaining about the bag not collecting a satisfactory amount of dust, that's a dust extraction system design issue, not a bag issue.

Update: I contacted DeWalt and was provided the following product number for a dust bag to the DWS780:  N126162. I don't see this on their website, but a google search turns up a lot of sources to purchase this item. I will edit this review again once the bag has been delivered and tested.",1.0
"The title says it all. I know my review is a minority opinion with this unit but I was very disappointed. I purchased this sharpener a couple months ago on Amazon. I tried to sharpen my joiner blades for hours with unusable/poor results.

For $350 it should be dead simple to use and super precise with super accurate repeatability. It is none of that. It is frustrating, slow, messy and primitive.

Repeatability with this sharpener is terrible. You will never get the same bevel angle twice, you're lucky if you can get a consistent bevel across the blade length once. All the adjustment mechanisms are primitive without any stops or detents or feature that would allow someone to quickly set it to achieve the same bevel angle more than once.

I own the Veritas Mk II sharpening system for the smaller blades on my chisels and hand planes. The Veritas is exactly what a sharpener should be. Dead simple to use, super accurate with precise graduated bevel angle adjustments and great repeatability. Oh yeah, it is fraction of the price this thing costs.

I have an 8"" Grizzly joiner which is what I purchased this Makita unit for. For now I will purchase new (razor sharp) blades from Grizzly at $50 a set once a year or so until someone comes up with something that works with longer blades that is equal to the performance the Veritas Mk II delivers on smaller blades.

I put this thing up for sale on Amazon (used/like new) within 72 hours of unpacking it. I took a $75 loss on the turnaround.

If you find yourself crawling around on the floor with lights behind the blade running the adjustment screws up/down over and over till your back aches from all the stooping and bending you might ask yourself, as I did, why did I buy this thing?",1.0
"I read the reviews and had it narrowed down to two jointers; DeWalt and Porter Cable. I decided that the price was right on the DeWalt and figured it would do the job. I tested a few joints with it and noticed that the wood was a little off. I figured that it was user error and continued on with my project. Then I decided to check for sqareness off the adjustable fence. The pointer lined up just past the ""0"" mark and sure enough it was off. No problem, I thought, since it had an adjustment screw, I could not adjust it to where I needed it to go. I had to file the stop block to get it at ""90"". This failed to fix the problem with the line up of the wood. I finally measured the cut and found that it was a 32nd higher on the right side of the cut. No matter how I hold the tool to the surface it was off. A visual look at the blade and you can see the blade comes out at an angle. Bottom line, the mechanics of the tool are strong, but the machining of everything else hooked to the motor needs more attention. It is going back tomorrow. A 32nd sounds picky, but it sure racks your project when you put all the biscuits in place. Not a good tool for fine woodworking projects.
  Update: Fine Woodworking magazine did a review in their September/October 2001 issue and out of 12 jointers, DeWalt had the worst score for biscuits out of parallel.  Exact quote was, ""although I can live with 0.017 in. out of parallel, biscuit joints assemble with less fuss when the number is 0.007 in. or lower.""  Lamello Top 20 came in at 0.000 and Makita came in at 0.001. The Porter came in at 0.005.  They liked Lamello, Porter, Makita, and the DeWalt even after what they found.  Being a casual user, I think I will consider the Makita because of the cost savings.",1.0
"The most obvious and severe flaw, is the steel backing plate on the stone.  It rusts.  That's right. It rusts. Even if you don't use it often, the stone doesn't dry out for weeks.  And to compound the problem, Makita chose to use a very brittle adhesive to mount the stone to the backing plate.  Because the two unlike materials are held together with a non-flexible bond, the adhesive develops fractures which allow water to seep through to the steel. Steel expands up to twelve times in volume, when it oxidizes. This expansion lifts the stone from the wheel, resulting in a wobble that increases over time. Eventually the stone becomes unusable. Makita should consider a one part polyurethane adhesive, such as that used in the marine and automobile industry. When the stone failed on my first 9820-2, I pried it off of the backing plate and remounted it in a bed of polyurethane caulk. I had no more trouble with that aspect.  The spindle/flange assembly which is driven internally and the stone is mounted to externally is steel as well, and corrodes to the point where the threads disintegrate.  I fixed this by re-tapping the hole, but  threw away the knob because the threads didn't match. This was no great loss because the threads were rusted off as well. Amazing!  No more quick mount. Have a wrench and an assortment of washers on hand to mount the stone. There is in fact, not a single piece of stainless steel used anywhere on the Makita sharpener. Why doesn't Makita use stainless steel on something that's intended to be wet? I am amazed and perplexed by this lack of common sense in design, every time I walk by an armada of stainless BBQ grills or stainless appliances at my local Home Depot.  In addition I purchased the expensive 6000 grit stone, which had a wobble so bad, I couldn't see the edge of my carving tools. This is a polishing phase. You don't need to look for the ""wire edge"" and so I performed this step by feel.  I stopped using it all together, when the up and down wobble became impossible to work with. I now use an 8000 grit bench stone to perform this task. I am in the fourth year of using my second sharpener now, and again experiencing all of the above problems. Makita's earlier models had an issue with the nylon gears not meshing properly, due to the plastic housing impeding moving the motor in its slotted brackets close enough for proper engagement. My first sharpener was just such a model and has afforded me with much knowledge, but my relationship with Makita is souring. Why did I buy another?  It offers a large flat grinding surface, which is invaluable for honing and polishing the backs of chisels and plane blades. It is gear driven as opposed to belt drive, and believe me when you start to hone the back of a plane blade and it starts to ""drag"", you'll really appreciate that.  I can only attribute the positive reviews it has received, to the duration of use. I've been using my current unit four years now.  If you have any doubts, call Makita's toll free number and speak with tech support.  One star for the status quo.  It's sad, because it could so easily rate a five.",1.0

The DeWalt does the job, but along with the  non-precise travel after adjustment and tightening in the fence I would  recommend the PC or Lamello.

"My impressions are just about like most of the other negative reviews. This thing is nothing by a cheap, flimsy piece of plastic. The fingers are way too lightweight to provide any kind of significant pressure against a workpiece, and they don't even line up in a straight line.

I'd pay the money to get a better featherboard.",1.0
"I own many Freud router blades and saw blades which I am very happy with.  However, I would recommend that you AVOID this router.  If you are mounting the router in a table or using it at a fixed depth (such as along an edge),  it works fine.  However, it is impossible to make an accurate plunge cut  with this router.  As you plunge the router you will find that the motor  housing and bit will rock sideways relative to the base.  This will throw  your cut off to one side.  The deeper your cut, the greater the error.
I  assumed my router was defective and returned it to Freud for service --  twice.  Both times, however, they sent it back to me and said it was within  the tolerances acceptable to Freud.  However, these tolerances are not  acceptable for good woodworking.  I now leave this router mounted in a  table and have bought another brand for plunge cuts.",1.0

"This is my second Dewalt tool (I have their 12"" double bevel sliding compound miter saw) that has serious problems.

Since it's been more than 90 days, I can't return the saw even though the motor bogs down and it can't make it more than half way through a 3x5 without making awful noises and then just giving up completely. I just got off the phone with Dewalt. They said that I'd have to send them the saw at my cost (or drive it to their service station 1 1/2 hours away) where they would hopefully fix it and return it in 3 weeks. After some serious noise on my part, they agreed to pay for shipping. Now I'm ordering the Makita (what I should've done in the first place) and getting one day delivery so this problem doesn't slow my project down. Maybe all their saws aren't as terrible as the one I got, but at the very least, they have some SERIOUS quality control issues. A Dewalt tool will never enter this house again.

From the Manufacturer
Used extensively.......Your kit includes tool with Quik-Lok cord, RAD drive, 9/16-inch open-end wrench, socket wrench, chuck remover bar, side handle, and impact-resistant plastic carrying case.

You can read this in its entirety from Amazon description.  I have found the following:

Missing chuck remover bar
Side handle is just a metal rod, lacking plastic guard
Missing socket wrench.

It looks like a refurbished product with some missing parts.  What a hassle when you have to find other means to do your job while waiting for a replacement from Amazon.

Also, I have read on some other websites that this product is made in USA, but on the tool itself, it indicates that it is made in China.  Milwaukee has prided itself that their products are made in America.  Let's be honest and clarify that some of your products are made in China.  Some people may be okay with that, though at this time, I would prefer to ""buy America"" or foreign products that are made in America.

"The majority of the reviewers have called this one right. It's junk! Don't waste your money. The one I purchased had issues from the start. The greatest of which is that one of the adjustment knobs does not hold tight. Upon inspection, I quickly saw why. The knob has a mickey mouse set up consisting of a phillips head screw in a plastic chase. As you try to tighten the knob, the theory is that the screw will remain in place as the knob threads down the shaft and snugs the plastic adjustment arm. It works, sort of, with one knob. However, on the other knob, the screw simply spins. Solution?.....remove featherboard with your strong hand and hurl directly at nearest trash receptacle!",1.0
"Received it as a gift - like most reviewers I agree that the screws are wrong, they don't fit the slot properly and make it difficult to insert the slider into the table guide. I will probably throw it away and not dissapoint my daughter.

Also one of the turn-screw threads was filled with plastic - took me fifteen minutes to clean it out enough to thread it on.

The push stick is rounded slick plastic and I would have to put some rubber or something on the end of it before trying to use it.

The cheap plastic has sharp edges and must be trimmed and cleaned up for any sustained use.

"I have been woodworking for most of my life, 64+ years now, and have owned, and used, a smaller fixed base router for the past 20 years, or so.  I decided that I needed a larger plunge router and, after about a year's research, that a Freud FT 2000EP would best suit my ""wood butcher's"" needs.  I don't think I need, nor would I use, many of the ""bells & whistles"" found on some of the more expensive plunge routers.
The router was purchased 5/22/01.  When it came from Tool Crib I unpacked it and set it up.  It intimidated the hell out of me the first time I ""lit it off.""  It was so much more powerful than router I'd ever used and it was the first plunge router I'd ever tried.  I thought ""a guy could get into trouble here.""  So I dug into the Freud manual, as far as anyone can dig into anything that skimpy, trying to get myself comfortable with the FT 2000EP's operation.  No Joy here! My careful research had focused on quality, price and the features of the plunge routers available.  I'd not put any emphasis on operations since I thought ""how different can it be?""
After using the router a few times, and making a few mistakes, I realized I wasn't getting anywhere depending on the FT 2000EP manual for guidance.  The manual is so inadequate and devoid of operating guidance as to be useless.  I bought two Patrick Spielman router books and now understand the operations of my FT 2000EP better. (Freud has known of the inadequacy of their 2000 manual for some time; or they just ignore their consumer mail & the reviews here.) If not for Spielman's Router Basics and The New Router Handbook I'd still be floundering with this tool chewing up wood.  I now know how to, at least, set the depth of cut, properly.

"I really like my DeWalt sliding compound miter saw, and got this bag for it when I started using the saw in my garage shop (as opposed to outdoors projects) for dust control. It is only a little bit better than using the saw without it. I would say the dust capture is 20% at best.

I found that I am a lot better off for dust capture if I attach my shop vacuum to the port where this bag is supposed to attach and have active suction to pick up the dust. This captures about half or more of the dust. Overall, though, it seems that there is a reason there are dust hood systems with large hoods to capture miter saw dust into a collector: a lot of the dust does not exit through the blade guard, but spews right off the top of the cut.

"I bought this dust collector in November. It's now mid-January, and I have not yet used it. When first tested, it promptly blew four 20 amp slow blow fuses in succession, on a circuit that I have used for many, more powerful tools. I took it to a Delta repair shop. After five weeks, I got it back with a new motor, at no cost. It still blows fuses. I called Delta's ""hot line"", and was told that a 20 amp circuit is not enough. They recommend 30 amps, or re-wire it for 220 volts. I think I now know why it won't start. The impeller (fan) is a massive thing, rather crudely rivited together from heavy sheet steel. It has so much inertia that the motor can't get up to speed before the fuse blows. Aside from the motor loading, I question the use of steel in a fan that would be expected to handle wood dust and metal particles, due to the potential for creating sparks/explosions.",1.0

"Disappointed, but Delta rectified the problem. They do stand by their products.  I own a lot of Delta woodworking equipment.  I have a 10 inch Unisaw, 14 inch Bandsaw, 8 inch jointer and 13 inch planner, a Drill press, a Belt/disk sander, jigsaw, mortiser etc.  and I love them all.  The Delta 50-850 has been a nuisance.  The 1 1/2 hp 3450 rpm Tiawan motor keeps burning out starting capacitors.  No, I do not overload it and I have not had any jams. I have replace three capacitors since I bought it in late 1997. The capacitors sell for less than $10.00.  On my last visit to my motor service/repair shop (fall of 2003) I observed an identical Delta 50-850 in for a total motor rebuild.  I was advised that chronic capacitor failure is often due to a faulty switch inside the motor.  My dust collect has just burned out another capacitor (June 2004). If you visit the Delta repair parts WEB site you will find they want $310.00 plus shipping for a new motor.  Would a new Delta motor be any better?  That is more than a whole new dust collector from the AMAZON.com.  The good news is that even though the machine was made in 1997, Delta stood by thier product and will replace the motor!",1.0

"Does not fit a 4 inch pipe - it exactly butts-up to the other 4 inch duct - not into or over it.  I bought this item to reduce the 4 inch hole on the PSI Woodworking DBGULP Big Gulp Dust Hood I bought for my table saw. I have had to make so many ""adjustments"" with duct tape to make my dust collection system operational. This fits exactly nothing and the industry seems to need to look up the word ""adaptor"" and ""reducer"" as this should fit either inside or outside a 4 inch hole (industry pick one and outside might be a better choice). I have run 2.5 inch pvc through my garage and have several of my dust makers installed (again duct tape to snug the fit in almost all cases). In my garage I don't need or want a 4 inch pipe.  All that said I blame myself for not looking at all the reviews however, the words reducer are grossly misused.  Providing measurements might have helped some.  It is sturdy hard plastic.",1.0

"Very disappointing performance; I purchased this collector as a direct replacement for a Shopsmith collector rated at 330 cfm because I wanted improved performance. It's connected to a 20 foot long 4 inch diameter PVC manifold with long radius taps along its length with only one connected at a time. Because the Delta 50-850 is rated at 1200 cfm I expected better; it doesn't even inflate the upper bag fully. I called Delta Service and was informed that Delta rates their unit as a bare blower only-no intake pipe or bag! Further, I was told that I was foolish to expect good performance unless used with only one woodworking machine (which I do) and with a hose length of 6 feet or less (which I don't). Perhaps I am supposed to be happy with the extra noise it provides rather than better sawdust collection than the Shopsmith 330. I would not recommend my...mistake to others.",1.0
"I love the tool, but these sanding backing pads are junk due to the adhesive used to glue the pad to the aluminum plate.  Yes, mine are aluminum, not plastic.  I was using the tool and went to change a sanding pad.  It was really stuck to the pad and soon enough the entire pad pulled away from the aluminum plate.  The adhesive was dry and fully attached to the rubber pad with NONE left on the shiny aluminum plate.  So, I went into my stash and found the other brand new pad.  I was happy that the original package contained two pads and I hadn't lost the second one.  I assembled the new sanding pad to the tool, put a sanding sheet onto it, started the tool, placed it gently on the work and the new pad immediately fell off the aluminum plate the same way the old one did.  Clearly, the adhesive used dries out in time and fails.  I wonder if they went to a plastic backing plate so the rubber would adhere better, just to produce the new heat problem described here by others.  Isn't is sad when you pay big for the original tool, made in Switzerland, and it turns out to be just like so much Chinese junk?",1.0
"I tried this with my Fein Multimaster fmm 250q and couldn't get it to fit. Don't know if it requires an adaptor or what the problem is; the center bolt is simply too long, and the sanding head flops and spins around.

These gates where given to me as I first put in my dust collection system and I can see why.

"The trouble with the design of this blast gate is there is no way to clean out any accumulated dust.  Even with the best dust collector, you will always get some stray dust or debris that accumulates on the gate.  Every time you open and close the gate, this dust get packed into the bottom of the gate.  Eventually, the gate will not close all the way.  As more dust gets trapped, the less the gate can close.  I didn't observe this until about a year after using them.  I will have to replace all these gates with the metal version which has cut corners that will not allow any dust to get trapped.  With the metal version, any dust or debris gets pushed out of the corners when the gate is closed.

"The first two packs of these were failing within ten minutes of use, I just stumbled upon the 3rd package of these, along with the receipt from the shipper which I am going to leave anonymous at this time.  I tried one at work today and kept the second one in the original packaging.  It is marked as ""original Fein"", ""made in Switzerland"", etc...  I can't find the email link on the Fein website for customer service or complaints, so here it is.  They have finally cheapened these things to a point where I will never buy them again and I would imagine their sandpaper is going to suffer the same fate.  I bought my multimaster in the late 90's and it was used when I got it.  I have praised the folks at Fein for the past 15 years and I am a professional who gets to use a lot of different tools from major manufacturers.  I can no longer endorse something that has gone the way of total junk.  Either someone in another country is bootlegging these accessories or they have changed the adhesive they use to assemble the pad to the backing plate.  Either way, it's a waste of money and worse yet, time.  As a contractor, I don't mind paying for something that will perform well and last.  Kind of like a mechanic paying for a Snap-on tool.  You can't have something break in the middle of your work day, even if it does have a warranty.  Who wants to stop everything to run to the store?  Since the global patent expired on this oscillating tool and everybody and there brother jumped on the manufacturing bandwagon, the cost of accessories has come way down.  I no longer HAD to buy genuine Fein, but continued to do so because they WERE the best.  Here's a message to the bean counters in Switzerland.  When you cheapen your product to increase a profit margin a few percent, let's hope that you can survive by selling to homeowners (who don't know they are getting ripped off).  Us professionals who built you business by buying (400 dollar) tools and accessories, would like to thank you for turning your backs on us, the ones who supported you all these years.  Do I expect too much?  Maybe, but I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, a blue collar, hardworking town where tools are passed from one generation to the next  If you think you have built a tool that will last, just send it to a major city in the rust belt and we'll let you know how it holds up (in a real world work environment).",1.0

"I am a hardwood flooring contractor. I use the fein tool to sand inside corners--remove old finish, etc. In less than one minute the whole system breaks down because of excess heat. The pad heats up really fast (no, I am not bearing down on the tool), and causes the Velcro pad to literally melt in seconds. When the pad melts the Velcro system breaks down, and the back side of the paper melts away as well. Consequently, the paper no longer sticks to the Velcro pad and the whole thing is useless. Seriously, I can't believe fein even has these on the market. Never in decades of experience have I had a tool break down so quickly and so completely. Total waste of money and time.",1.0

I've tried using less pressure and frequent paper changes (which does help a little) but the fact remains that these velco sanding pads are the weak link in an otherwise stellar system.  I'll still use the tool because it's great, and I'll still buy these pads because there's no alternative, but I'll piss and moan about the fact that one must buy about as many of these expensive things as the paper that goes on them!",1.0

I got my Bench Dog router table and I was super excited.  I've heard how great BD is and that's why I decided on their product.  First off when assembling I found that the metal piece that was used to support the router plate was manufactured wrong.  They forgot to insert the bolts that allowed the leveling screws to go into the metal piece.  After calling the company and sending them pictures I finally convinced them to send me a new piece.  After getting this new piece I spent 30 minutes leveling the router plate.  I COULD NOT level it no matter how many times I tried.  I called them after putting a straight edge and I found the plastic (or acrylic) router plate was warped.  After talking to the phone support they thought it was the plastic router plate.  They sent me another one in the mail.  This was covered in dirt as if it was used before.  I could clean it up but even after installing it and spending at least 1 hour trying to level this darn plate it still won't level.  I made a youtube video showing them my problem and how it tilts.  They blame the screws not being level.  Regardless how I adjust the bolts there is no way to get the rock out of my table.  They refuse to help me any more which is REALLY disappointing.  Stay away.

Bought this to use with my Triton router.  Assembled the table to find that not only are there no predrilled holes for the Triton routers the included insert plate is completely incompatible for Triton routers. Called customer service and they basically told me to pound sand and that they no where state that Triton routers are supported.  Well the included documentation and plate drilling templates includes Triton drilling template instructions! The problem is that the predrilled insert plate holes overlap with where the Triton holes would need to go making for adjacent holes and insecure attachments.  Was also told by customer service that Bench Dog does NOT sell any insert plates compatible with Triton routers but it seems on Amazon there is a pro plate compatible with Triton.  Don't know who to believe other than buying this table was a HUGE mistake and I won't make the mistake of buying another Bench Dog product in the future.,1.0

"Just two things you need to know about this blade:

1. Does an incredible job removing grout. Can't get better than this.
2. Blade only lasts for one 1' x 1' tile!!! So if you're thinking about redoing a bathroom or something, forget it, it's way too expensive.

To me it defeats the purpose of having such an amazing tool if it's not cost effective and practical to use it.

Can't help but feel disappointed. They just want you to blow money on this stuff.",1.0
"This replacement carbide blade did not last for more than a tile or two; hardly able to do the entire shower bottom.  I had been using a grout blade that I purchased as part of a kit that lasted a long time.  The single blade purchased (part no. 6 35 02 118 0 16) looked exactly like the original and was manufactured by Fein, unfortunately it was made with carbide on an aluminum blade. This aluminum blade shed it's carbide and failed quickly. The original was carbide on a ferrous blade.",1.0
"This is a great tool that does lots of jobs. Unfortunately the blades are not up to the task. I use this tool for my remodel and repair business. I have had several different blades that get hot, get dull and don't work for long. I used this blade brand new to remove grout from a 32x32 tile shower pan. Before the job was finish I noticed that ALL of the carbide was gone from the blade. I was not forcing the tool. I don't mind paying more for the blades but I do expect that they will last for several jobs, not several blades per job! Fein has a serious quality problem that needs to be addressed.",1.0
"I borrowed the multimaster tool from a friend to remove the grout around floor tiles in my bathroom. The bathroom is 9x8 with 12 inch tiles, and it took 2 of these blades to complete the job, and I also had to use a manual grout removal tool to actual get all of the grout out. I can't say that the multimaster didn't help at all, but it is definitely no miracle grout removal tool. I used the multimaster to cut into the grout; then used the manual tool to scrape out the remainder of the grout. It took 6 hours to finish removing the grout, and I didn't waste any time.

Both of the blades ended up going from round to almost rectangular once I was done, and more importantly, the star shape where the blade attaches to the tool wobbled out to the point where the blade would not stay tight to the tool rendering it completely useless. I had to take the blade off and rotate it so that it attached via the remaining good points.

If you plan to use it for one tile at a time, then you might get 36 tiles or so use out of it. I my case ($.78 per tile or 2 blades @ $40+) it may have been a bit cheaper for me to just replace all of the tiles!

As a side note, my friend had already returned 2 DOA tools to Fein, and this one started making some not so encouraging sounds after only 4 hours of use. You would expect a tool that costs as much as this does to be a little more reliable.

Just be forewarned that you WILL be replacing the blades often if you plan to do a bunch of grout work. However, it will take some of the work out of removing the grout if you're willing to pay the price.",1.0
"Blade never finished  removing grout from the first tile.  The blade was useless.  The original blade that came with my kit worked  100% better, and it was almost completely worn off.

"This is absolutely the worst woodworking product I have ever bought.  To begin with the package came with about 5 missing pieces of hardware and 3 miss-drilled holes.  It took me a month and a half to get the hardware after the muppets at benchdog failed to return 7 of my calls.  However, the important thing is that this is a poor design.  The main failure is that the mounting and adjustment plate (the most important part of a router table) deforms and sags under the weight of even the lightest router.  This is no big deal if you are doing shoddy or very rough work but if you care about an eighth inch in your work DO NOT BUY THIS.  The only way I was able to fix this is to make a table for the top of the table.  It works well as a cabinet and base for my homemade router table but anyone can make a much better table in about two hours of work and 40 worth of materials.  DO NOT BUY THIS product!!!",1.0

"I should have probably sent it back but thought I could turn it into something useful.  It it is definately not the plane I expected, even for this price which was $30 when I bought it.  This plane is beyond rough - there is a tremendous amount of work to do to get it even usable.  The blade is misshapen, skewed,dull, and the body is rough.  I'll flatten the blade and sharpen it and flatten the sole but for the work it will take, I should have bought a Lee Valley for this one.

Sept 07 - I finally got around to working on this plane.  Took a little more than an hour to flatten the back of the blade (can't get it completely flat) and hone the bevel.  I also lapped the sole of the body.  It works slightly better now, but it's a very crude adjustment.  With more work, I could probably improve a little more, but I felt it was more work than it should have been.  Patrick Leach who is arguably the authority on planes really dislikes this model too.  This one works now, but definately nothing to write home about.  Can't say I would ever reach for it other than scraping glue and frankly, I have a #80 cabinet scraper that does a better job at that.  I'd give it away, but there is no sense frustrating someone else.

"I bought this for an accessory to my Craftsman Shop Vac because I have had trouble with the hoses cracking and also because I wanted the extra reach.  I thought that the swivel nozzle was a great idea to prevent distress on the hose which causes cracking after time.  The first problem was that although it fits the 2 1/4"" OD vaccuum outlet, the nozzle end is smaller, and doesn't fit my 2 1/4"" wands.  I had to go to a different seller and pay $8 + $5 shipping for the correct end, which doesn't have the swivel.  Therefore it keeps coming off when I am vaccuuming.  Beside that there is a ridge inside the adapter that cuts the size down to little more than an inch, so I had to constantly disconnect the wands to clear the debris out of the nozzle.  I could have bought 2 craftman hoses for what I spent on this hose, and it is completely impractical for picking up anything with any size to it.

"I ordered the Jet JWBS-140S / 708113 14"" band saw and Carter Jet 14 Band Saw guide (for 14"" Jet band saw) at the same time, from the same page on Amazon, as the accessories were listed below the 14"" band saw.

"This item, for it's price, was a big disappointment. For me the issue was not finding a suitable trashcan. (Found one at my local home improvement warehouse). My issue was the total lack of design consideration as far as vacuum leaks were concerned.  The basic principal of this thing, I guess, was just to drop this thing on a trashcan stick two hoses IN the holes on the lid and just hope all the air leaks would not drop the efficiency of the system to the point that it would still move some dust.

After one look I decided that this thing needed some rework.  The first thing I did was went to my local home improvement warehouse and picked up some PVC fittings that I could cut, grind, epoxy, and basically fabricate into 2 solid nipples that I could attach to the lid and clamp my 4"" dust hoses onto.  Then it was a simple matter of taking some black 3/8"" weather stripping and applying it to the out side of the trashcan just under the rolled lip at the top. This provided a pretty good seal.  All told all this stuff added an additional $20 to the cost of this product.

When my rework was complete the system works very well. 99% of the dust is trapped in the can making dumping the collector bag a very rare event. The vacuum efficiency is very good. To the point that if all my blast gates are closed it will actually start to collapse the sides of the steel can. Not a big deal but it might be a little worrisome if the dust collector and can are in the other room and you start to hear noises like a depth charge starting to implode.

There are other products out there for similar money that require no rework, Looks like woodcraft has a nice offering (Part #143290), but I have not been able to locate it on Amazon yet.

"I give it a star for price as I purchased on sale at a local Woodcraft store for $16. However, I will be returning it. Woodcraft's website says this fits 2-1/2"" shop vac hoses. Wrong. A standard 2-1/2"" vacuum hose is too small to fit over the connector and too large to fit inside it. In fact, they are similar diameters. ONly the fact that the cyclone's connectors are a thicker plastic than the vacuum hose, make them somewhat different diameters both inside and out. I do not want to take time to force fit or search out adapters to make the connections work. It is also true the lid fits loosely on 5-gallon buckets and you would also need to rig a way to strengthen the fit so dust did not escape and so the lid did not fall off when hoses are moved or the bucket bumped. A total dud in my opinion.",1.0

"Recently I ordered a Milwaukee sawzall to replace my Porter Cable sawzall that had died after ten years of daily use as a remodeling contractor.  I was perfectly happy with the Porter Cable, so I don't know why I didn't stick with that brand.  The tool arrived last Friday and was put to work Monday morning cutting up a roof that needed to be rebuilt.  Within five minutes, the amount of smoke coming from that saw was such that my coworker went and grabbed a fire extinguisher.  By the time he got back, the tool had died. One minute, shiny new saw, five minutes later, a smoking mass of melted sawzall.  I got on the phone with Milwaukee.  Their response: Take it to an authorized repair center and have it fixed under warranty.  #1- This is a brand new saw!  I don't want it fixed, I want it replaced. #2- I need a saw now, not after it's repaired.  So, I called Amazon.  They were great. Need a new saw? We'll send it out immediately with two day shipping.  Just send the old (new) saw back within 30 days, we'll pay the postage.  Great.  Got the new saw, two days later, I thought I was back in business.  Thought I'd run this saw for a minute before climbing on the roof with it.  Didn't even take the twist tie off the cord.  Trigger on this saw is no good.  Runs intermittently.

"I have to echo the other complaints given here.  At first glance this looks like a high-precision piece of woodworking equipment.  When you get it home however you find it doesn't cut square-- in any direction.  I tried cutting a 2x2 block at 90 degrees, it was off by about 2 degrees it both vertical and horizontal planes.  The miters are off by the same amount as well.  The saw provides no ability to fine tune the adjustments; they are cast into the base.  I also tried the compound model hoping it would be better-- it was worse. The blade flexes too much to cut a miter on the flat side of baseboard, and there is no support on the back of the table to miter baseboard standing up.
I really didn't want a power saw, but I'm afraid that is what I will need if I can't find a replacement.  I will try Jorgensen first and see if they can help, otherwise the saw goes back.",1.0
"When I first got this saw, I liked it a whole lot. It cut very well. It could use a couple more clamps though. Then the handle broke, sort of just snapped in half.

I am very dissappointed and I will now buy another brand",1.0
"This saw is quite a disappointment.  After setup I cross-cut a square test  piece and found that even though I got a clean 90 degree cut across the  wood I didn't get a 90 degree cut down the wood.  The guide bars and their  mount are a few degrees off vertical.  After taking the entire saw apart  and reassembling 3 times - and having exactly the same problem - it became  apparent there doesn't appear to be any adjustment possible to correct  this.
Some other issues;
1. The base isn't flat, and this contributes  to the above  problem (but isn't solely responsible).  A straightedge  rested across the base shows about a 1mm gap towards  the middle of the  table.
2. The one work-piece clamp tends to slide back up its  mounting  stud as the clamp is tightened onto the work.
3. The maximum cut height  before the top part of the saw leaves  its guide is about 1.5 inches.  Any cut on material thicker  than this will require the user to hand-hold  the saw in a  vertical position.
Without the manufacturing defects the  saw would have fitted my needs perfectly.  The saw delivered to me is  basically unusable.",1.0
"I bought this bench top router table only because I did not want to take the time to make my own. I already had too many projects going on in my limited work space and I needed a table that would be compact and get the job done. I have several other Porter Cable products (including a router) and I've always found them to be well built and reliable. Well, I guess there is a first time for everything. First off, the fence system is a serious pain in the neck to deal with. It comes with one of those plastic guards that you normally see on table saws. It was so cumbersome and perpetually in the way, I felt it made using this table more dangerous rather than protecting me. So I had to remove that. Next was the fence itself. Since it is made of two pieces of wood that move independent of each other, trying to get the thing to sit in a straight line is a bit of a chore. And once you think you got it right, it moves just enough when you tighten it down (via two separate bolts, 1 per section) that your work hits the edge of the next piece as you pass it along the fence. Having to reposition the wood mid cut is not safe it is messes up the job. So to fix it, i screwed a piece of hard wood to the top to keep the fence true at all times. Unfortunately, the deck of the table was just as poorly designed. The extra wide hole (presumably designed for above the table bit changes) was uneven and the wood would hit the other after passing through the bit. I would have to lift the wood to get it to keep moving, making the depth of the cut uneven. I fixed this by screwing a piece of ply wood to the fence and cutting slot in it for the bit. The amount of time I spent fussing with this hunk of junk, I could of well been on my way to making my own. The lowering system, dust collection, and power switch all worked fine, but that didn't make up for the unsafe and poorly engineered design of the fence and deck. Pass on this one folks, it aint worth it.",1.0
"I chose to get this table in spite of the negative reviews, based on the several good reviews, THAT WAS A MISTAKE.  One of the reviewers said that Porter Cable dropped the ball on this piece of equipment--that is a vast understatement. I cannot find a single positive thing to say about this table. The Craftsman table I bought this unit to replace is better, cost half as much, and included a router!
The specifics:
1) The top mounts to the brake formed legs on four cast posts on the table. There is really no other stabilizing surface to keep the approx. 14 ga. legs from flexing from side to side. Shoddy design.
2) The milling on the top of the table ridges is full of burrs and very sharp edges that will cut you if not removed,  not to mention ruin your workpiece.  A simple swipe with 320 grit sandpaper will NOT, as one reviewer suggested, solve the problem.  I spent over an hour with files and surfacing stones de-burring the through holes and hundreds of ridges on the work surface.
3) The table must be drilled to be able to use the optional Porter Cable # 75301 above-table height adjustment accessory on the #890 Porter Cable router. This entails drilling from the bottom of the table through the ridged top which is no easy task even with a drill press. You would think that the holes for their own router would be provided.
4) The fence consists of two individually adjustable cast aluminum brackets  with wooden pieces for the faces. Very cheesy,  and bound to be cumbersome to adjust accurately.
5) There is no provision for handling the excess cord from the router to the on/off switch. You must either live with a gob of power cord hanging willy-nilly about the table, or fashion a system for containing the excess cord. I used a pair of small robe hooks mounted diagonally on the outside of the rear of the legs.
6) The description states ""machined aluminum top with cast-in lip to support table extensions"". There is NOTHING to support table extensions, unless I am completely in the dark about what a table extension is. This was a feature that caught my eye as I regularly work with wood over 30"" long.
For the cost, this table is NOWHERE near what Porter Cable quality should be. Don't waste your money unless you want to spend hours making this table usable.",1.0
"Update - 9/28/2012 - A month ago, Amazon had the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bosch-RA1181-Benchtop-Router-Table/dp/B000H12DQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bosch RA1181 Benchtop Router Table</a>&nbsp;as a Gold Box special, so I bought one.  The difference is amazing.  It's like comparing an Easy-Bake oven to a Thermidor.  The Bosch is solid, with absolutely no play.  It has a solid, one piece, extruded aluminum fence, versus the two piece one on the Porter Cable.  The top is bigger,  The power switch has two sockets - one for the router and a second for a shop-vac.  It has a cast aluminum router plate that's adjustable so it's level with the table surface.  Putting it politely, it blows this out of the water in every single dimension.  And since they're roughly the same price, I see absolutely no reason to purchase this instead of the Bosch..  Here's my original review:

*******************************************************************
Although usable for some things, this router table has too many flaws to be useful for precision work.

- Fence:  The two sections are difficult to position accurately.  Tightening the knob that holds each side to the table tends to move the fence slightly.  Because they are independent, it's a pain to line them up straight, tighten them down and get the cutting depth set correctly.  If the fence halves are not aligned with each other, the out-feed side is (by definition) either in front of, or behind the in-feed side.  If it's in front, the work catches.  If it's behind, the router bit carves a bit deeper as the work leaves the in-feed fence and creates a divot in your work.

- Table: A bit of roughness in the casting surface was easily fixed with some sandpaper, but shouldn't have been there in the first place.

- Router mounting:  The router base is screwed securely to the table, not to a separate plate.  The holes are obviously spaced for a Porter-Cable router...I use an old PC 690 router.  There are a number of different inside diameter metal rings (like overgrown washers) that fit into the circular hole in the table...you pick the ring that best fits the bit that you're using.  The top of the rings, though, is slightly below the surface of the table without any way to adjust them.  That's not much of a problem with a long board, but try cutting an accurate tendon when the height of the table changes around the cutter.

- Legs: There's no appreciable front to back wobble, but the legs have little rigidity side-to-side.  Feeding a board through the router shouldn't also move the table sideways by 1/2 inch.  (Each side is bolted to the table top through two posts that project slightly below the strengthening ridges on the bottom of the table top.  That provides them an excellent axis for the legs to wiggle.)  Drilling a couple of holes and bolting some bar stock (a piece of wood would work just as well) between the bottom of the two legs helped stabilize it.  This obviously isn't a problem if you clamp the entire thing down as the manual recommends, but poor design is still poor design...you'll notice that competing router tables all have something that connects the right-side legs with the left-side legs.

In summary...I'm an occasional woodworker and I don't use this router table very often, but every time I do, I wish I'd bought something else.  There are better ones available in the same price range.",1.0
I bought this table figuring it would be the same quality as my other Porter Cable tools. Boy was I wrong. The miter slot is so sticky (a poorly milled warped table) that movement to the center of the table is not even possible - it stops half way. The table is so rough from the milling process that it will mar your wood. This table is being returned.  I'm ashamed to even put this in the tool category.,1.0
This does not fit the 2/12 inch hoses or connections on my Craftsman shop vac and it fits way too loosely on the dust port of my chop saw. The inside dimension is 2 1/8 and the outside dimension is 2 7/16. Both ends are the same. Not worth returning.,1.0

And there is nothing in the box saying where or how a drill guide could be purchased. My advice, purchase clamps that include a drill guide (as these should!)",1.0

"This clamp grew rust blooms the first time it got sprinkled upon. The metal trigger rusted much more than the metal guide for some reason. They both had the same finish, if you can call it that. It looks like an anodized finish but instead is a thin paint. These accumulated so much rust that I chose to throw my Irwin clamps away after 10 months use. I wonder if the Chinese factory is substituting a fake finish in place of anodizing or a similar durable treatment specified by Irwin. The equivalent Milwaukee clamps that I own had chromed metal parts instead and are of much better construction.",1.0
"I didn't read the reviews before buying this since it was recommended of a woodworking magazine plan.  I wish I had. The bulge in the middle means it does not lay flat and it completely messes up the dovetail joints I have tried to make on this.

I'm impressed with the batteries &  the charger. I wished I received that screwdriver, I know it will satisfy my purpose.",1.0
"I have larger Irwin clamps and they have worked well for many years. This small model is junk. The steel bar has a dimple pressed in it about 3/4"" from each end. The dimples are to keep the moving jaw from sliding off, even when the fixed jaw is moved to the other end to make a spreader. The problem is the dimples are pressed too hard, or without support for the bar, so that they cause the bar to bend about 5 degrees. This makes the fixed jaw skewed in relation to the moving jaw, and results in uneven pressure on the clamping surfaces. Further, the fixed jaw rocks on the bar on the bar under the lightest clamping force resulting in a V shape to the clamping surfaces, and even worse distribution of the clamping force.

I'll have to decide whether to return it, or try to bend the bar and shim the fixed jaw to make it work like a decent clamp.",1.0
"Cheap, ineffective, and not worth a minute or dollar.  Feels like something out of a toy-vending-machine.
If you're look for cheap clamping solutions, I'd recommend light-duty steel bar clamps.  Bessey 4"" is under $5 on Amazon.",1.0
"I wanted to find the best quality clamps of this style on the market and had very high hopes for these, as I had read on a contractor's forum that the Irwin Quick-Grips are of superior quality & function in comparison to other plastic clamp/spreaders that have a similar appearance.

To see for sure, I ordered one of these, a Jorgensen 33804, and picked up locally both a Dewalt microclamp, & one from Harbor Freight.

In comparison to all the others, this Irwin is a poor quality product. When clamping small items, the bar begins to deform with pressure & the jaws angle open from the item being clamped.

I did not give the Harbor Freight clamp as much use(maybe just from a mental block of it being $0.99), but I know that I prefer it over the Irwin, as the Irwin, as you can see from the photos, has the thinnest bar, the only bar that bends under pressure at the rivet near the head, the only clamp whose pad lifts at an angle under full pressure, the shortest throat depth, & the second shortest jaw capacity. This makes me not even want to consider Irwin for the larger clamps, unfortunately.

I found myself reaching for the Jorgensen & Dewalt clamps for most of the glue-ups of the small parts. The Jorgensen is definately the most robust of the 4, has the best ergonomics, and easily the largest pads. There is a lot more product for the money put into the Jorgensen clamp! The dewalt is also excellent in function, as it clamps well, pads stay flat, has the largest throat depth, tied with the Jorgensen for max jaw capacity. I did not notice any functional difference due to the smaller pad surface area on a clamp this small. The Dewalt's are not as ergonomic as the Jorgensen clamp, but the smaller pads DO allow it to fit the 1-1/4"" dog holes in my workbench, while the Jorgensen's are too bulky to fit through the holes.

Again, I did not give the Harbor Freight clamps a fair run-through as I did with the other 3, other than just enough to know that I prefer them over the Irwin clamp.

In summary, if you don't have any use for this size clamp with dog holes like mine, the Jorgensen is the best micro-clamp in this category on the market. If you do need to use them in 1-1/4"" dog holes, then it's worth it to get the Dewalt(though they take more ""fiddling with"" than the ergonomic Jorgensen).",1.0

"I bought this one hoping to save $20-30  from buying Rockler's base plate that is pre-drilled for your router. I was making a router table.

I drilled it on the drill press for precision. It didn't matter, the 1/1000 it slipped was enough to make it warp whenever I mounted my router to it. Ended up being a disaster!

There is no way for me to get the plate flat with the table and buying a heavier router is not an option just to see if it will flatten out my router plate. It doesn't really matter if any of the other features are good or not if its an unusable product.",1.0
"I would not buy this plate.  I bought one, and it was not flat.  From the center to the edge the plate drooped at least 1/16th of an inch.

He opened a third, and it was also not flat.

I can't imagine this was designed this way.  Just for kicks I took it home and installed it on my router, and put it in my router table (the salesman was interested in the little experiment I wanted to try).  It did not flatten the plate.  I had some problems with the test cuts because the plate was not flat.

I typically do not right reviews for products unless I am not satisfied.  The store let me exchange the third plate for a different brand made out of aluminum.  I checked it for flatness before I left the store, and it was flat.

They fit extremely tight though, and removal without a hammer or pry bar was not really possible unless you modified them. Needless to say, I returned it. I purchased a very nice machined 1/4"" aluminum plate from Rockler instead that it IS flat, and has an very nice anodized coating. It works excellent!

After 20 years, I had to replace the AEGs. I chose the Milwaukee, because I was quite satisfied with the the AEG tool. Unfortunately, while the driver and charger are the equivalent of the AEGs, the batteries are not. The AEG batteries lasted me 10-15 years. The Milwaukee batteries all lasted just past their warranty, a year. After replacing four batteries in a row, I have decided I can no longer afford this tool. These batteries were all purchased at various times and therefore must have been from different manufacturing batches, so a bad production run cannot explain my experience. I tested the charger and it is working correctly. The tool has no noticeable defect, and certainly not anything that can explain the poor battery life. In four years, I have paid more in replacement batteries than the tool originally cost. I no longer have a functioning battery.

"We had house leaks and needed to continue to monitor the moisture level in the wood (ceiling) and drywall. My home inspector recommended this one as an inexpensive alternative to his $400+ Surveymaster moisture reader. However, this device was so inaccurate that made me doubt its usefulness.

Off the dry wall, when the reading from Surveymaster was 22%, this one's was 15%. Two locations off the ceiling wood, Surveymaster vs. Sonin were 18% vs. 8%, and 12% vs 8%. All the readings were done on the same day by my experienced home inspector who used the devices in the exact same location w/ exact same direction (when pining into the ceiling) and tried to use the same force to minimize the error bar caused by mishandling.

Sonin's readings were the same 8% even though there was a 10% difference in the readings from Surveymaster. 8%-12% would be considered ok for wood, but 18% is not. For example, mold remediation company would dry the ceiling wood below 16% before they put on the final coat. W/ such inaccuracy, I found it nearly impossible to have a good assessment on the situation and to take necessary actions.

Another drawback of the product: the pins are not sharp at all comparing to the Surveymaster's. In test, the pins couldn't penetrate into some plywood area under the roof, and hence couldn't get any readings.

I loved this thing while tearing off and reroofing from the rafters up my 40 year old roof. Until the darn thing gave on me and tumbled me head first on to my brick patio! Eighteen stiches and six months of healing bruses  later I have some thoughts on this thing. If you paint or use other glue  like compounds the ladder needs to be cleaned completely after each use or  the latches may not engage completely. In marginal lighting conditions you  will not be able to tell the difference. Don't use it in the partially  raised position--if one latch gives you might have time to catch yourself  if the ladder is extended fully.

"These ladders are quite ingenious.  A very simple plastic fitting and steel pin locks the sections together as they are extended, and they progressively collapse coming down.  I've had 2.

"If you are simply looking to see whether or not I think you should buy this tool, my simple answer is ""NO"".
Here's the long answer:
We used to work for a very large custom millwork company, and for a long time we used the Porter-Cable template. Our boss was careless, and regularly nicked the template with the router. Over time, replacing full single hinge templates got costly, so we switched to the Bosch kit because of being able to replace smaller parts. That kit worked quite well and solved those problems.
Since then, we've left that company and started our own. Using our knowledge from the previous company, we chose the Bosch 83038 kit over the Porter-Cable.
That leads me to my need to write this review.
Upon first impression, this kit comes in a nice, sturdy box. When I took the template out, and tried to get accustomed to it, I noticed that the spacer rails did not fit into the templates. After a lot of filing, they finally slid in. I then found that if you slide them past the opening, they lock up again on the raised lettering on the template itself. After more filing, this problem was fixed.
Next thing I noticed, the top gauge assemblies. The stop tab is made of a very malleable metal, and one actually came out of the box twisted. This doesn't make for any kind of repeatability.
I went to set up my router (a Ridgid router, which I Highly recommend) to mortise. Bosch claims that this kit is fully compatible with the ""competition's"" template guides. While this is true, the provided router bit does not work (safely) with a Porter-Cable style template guide with a ring that screws on from the inside of the router base. In order to get the right mortise depth, the bit has to be inserted with enough of the 1/4"" shaft exposed that you seriously risk bending the shaft and/or throwing the bit. If you plan on using this kit with a non-Bosch router, be prepared to use a longer bit.
Getting to actually using this template kit, I had to make wooden rails to accommodate the windows I was mortising, which isn't a huge deal. after that, I noticed that there is no depth setting for 1 1/2"" thick doors, so I had to shim the template every time I used it.
The spring loaded nails are most definitely stronger that those on the Porter-Cable. The trade-off is that the larger diameter at the top makes it trickier than it should be to pull the nails out with a standard claw hammer, as the cutout in the claw won't fit around it.
I had spent about a day of mortising and hanging windows, and came to one that gave me problems. I mortised it, and when I hung it, the reveal at the top was 1/8"" larger than all the rest were (with the same jig settings). I came to find out that the screw that locks the top gauge assembly had loosened and the gauge had moved. This left me having to hand mortise the hinges 1/8"" higher, and do a repair to fill the lower portion of the mortise.
One of the big selling points of this template is that you can get parts for each of the templates if you nick them. I have mortised many doors now, and work at a pretty fast rate. I've never nicked a template. Just don't be careless and you'll be fine.
All that said, this kit has caused me nothing but headaches. We will be switching to the Porter-Cable kit.

_____________________________

This is an addition several months later.
We now also have the Porter Cable template guide, and I use them for different purposes. I find that the Porter Cable is MUCH more adjustable and accurate. The Bosch is slightly better for 6-8 or 7-0 doors, but I don't like it for any other sizes.
We noticed a large problem with the jamb stop (provides the proper gap at the top of the door). It uses a rivet as a pivot point, so you can rotate the stop to fit on both the left and right hand sides of a jamb. We thought that the metal tab (the part that was rotating) was twisted, as door pairs were not being hung evenly. It turns out that on both stops provided, the rivet is not straight, so no matter what, the tab will be higher on one side than the other.
This may not sound like a big deal, until you see the results. When I've hung door pairs, one door always hangs at least 1/8"" lower than the other. This is VERY noticeable.
I've managed to fix this problem, but it involved serious modification and using the stop entirely differently than intended.

I would not buy this product again if I had the choice. None of the critical components worked the way they should have out of the box. This resulted in many hours trying to fix the problems with the template, and many hours trying to fix the problems this template caused.

It vibrates no matter what you cut.  I've used saws with less horse power ratings that have more power.  It trips breakers all the time on circuits that don't trip when I use my 110v welder.

"I have been using the DW874 in our steel fabrication shop every day for the past three years with great satisfation.
We needed another saw for field work and went to buy another DW874 and was told that they were discontinued. The replacement was the DW871. We bought it and were instantly disappointed.
The DW871 is obviously [less expensive] to build saw. It has a plastic motor housing and a cheap vise. The threaded quick release also known as the anvil is [an inexpensive] cast iron piece while on the older saw it was a machined part.
After using it a few times the cast iron anvil would not engage the threaded rod to tighten the vise. The threaded rod was nicked and chewed up from the anvil not engaging properly. I had to get a new vise assembly.
Also it is neccessary to mark the material to be cut because the blade cannot be lowered to rest on the workpiece in order to measure and cut quickly.
The older DW874 does this quite nicely and because of this we can measure and cut about 10 times faster.
Overall, the new DW871 lasted only a few days before needing repair(and it is still difficult to use quickly), But my older DW874 has not given me any problems in three years!

This produce is very dangerous because unlike a normal stabilizer it can't be secured to the rung and the rail of the ladder. This makes it susceptible to slipping up the ladder or even folding flat against the ladder. And the clamps do not fit squarely into the ladder and this also allows it to become loose while you are up on the ladder. It can't be used on the corner of a roof with rain gutters because it does not hold the ladder far enough away from the roof. I own a rain gutter business and use ladder stabilizers every day.  You can see from the photo I've included with notes added why it is very likely to become loose due to the improper way the clamps fit.  I would not recommend using this stabilizer on any ladder. In my opinion  it rates NO stars but I had to give it one star or I could not post the feedback.,1.0

"I really hate this toolbelt.  I like a lot of Bucket Bros. other products (especially the bucket organizers), but this belt was a real disappointment.
The tape holder doesn't fit a 25' tape very well (too shallow and wide), and its too close to the belt for fasteners - they want to pour out when you bend over.  The pockets are largely unstructured, so your tools just kind of float around inside, banging into each other and making it hard to fish the right tool out.  The outer pockets are too small to hold normal tools securely. Note in the picuture that they've got something like two or three pencils in them (!).
The worst thing about this setup, though, is that the bags have oversized loops that sit over a fairly narrow belt (albiet with some sort of stiffener in it so it buckles less than it might otherwise).  The net result is that when you bend forward, the bags come sliding forward, and when you straighten back up, you have to shift 'em back.
On top of that, the stiff part of the belt only extends about 2/3 of its length, so tools like your tape holder and drill holster end up hanging from a narrow web belt, and drooping down.
I finally had to strap on a pair of suspenders to keep the whole rig from sliding apart everytime I unbuckled the belt.
I have a CLC electricians bag with a velcro on the loops to keep the bags in place, and a Skillers system that uses loops and velcro straps - both systems do a far better job of keeping the bag together (though they each have their problems, as well).
On the positive side, the materials the Builder's rig is made up from are durable, and the price is quite reasonable compared to, say, an Occidental Leather setup.  If you're a homeowner carrying a light load, or invest in a pair of suspenders, you can make it work OK.",1.0

"This B&D workbench is complete garbage. After assembly (let's ignore that the instructions are just horrible), one of the vise crank clutches did not disengage. One side does, the other doesn't. There is no obvious problem with the crank shaft assembly other than that the spring that puts tension on the plastic gear ring is somewhat stiffer on the side that does not disengage. And as a result of trying to get this to work just over the past hour, the plastic (!) belt that connects the two crank shafts is already so worn out (see other reviews) that it slips of the gear ring at the slightest difference in torque applied to the cranks - which means every time you tighten the vise. We are now left with an otherwise useless folding table.

For the record: 1. I know how to put such things together and 2. I own a 25+ year folding B&D workbench that is sturdy and works absolutely perfect to this day. I would have happily paid twice the price for another non-plastic model.

UPDATE: Here is how I fixed all this myself (instead of driving 50 miles back and forth to the service center). I think this is going to work just fine, but TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK and this might VOID YOUR WARRANTY. The plastic belt (that is already worn out on mine on day 1) is keeping the two crank shafts in sync. And the crank shaft clutches (on of which was not working on mine right out of the box) allows you to advance the two gears out of sync. So I took out the plastic belt all together. The belt is still worn out but I don't need it any more. One of the clutches is still not disengaging but I don't need them any more either. I can move the front jaw parallel by turning both handles simultaneously like on my original B&D workbench. And I can move the front jaw at any angle within its normal range by turning both handles separately. Added bonus: I can move left and right crank shaft completely independent from each other, whereas, with the belt in place, they can only move in 90 degree increments from each other. With this mod it is now a lot more simple, a lot more functional, a lot more durable, and a lot more like my original workbench. Still only one star for really poor design, cheap materials, and the couple hours of my life I had to put into it to fix its flaws.",1.0

"I have a great collection of tools but this was one I regretted buying... It was a poorly designed setup. the first clue was that the main attacnment bolt (that comes in kit)that holds the chain spocket to the saw motor shaft. had damaged threads and you can't use the saw without that bolt...can you say Q.A or Q.C ? The beam saw once it was attached and working was not really centered with the Milwalkee worn drive saw shaft,which was bought new with this Prazi beam saw(it was to be a dedicated combo unit)The beam saw would operate with a sort of concentric motion around the center of saw shaft.
The saw kept loosing up locked down saw parts, bolts would back out of the Prazi unit.. I was not impressed with this tool but then again maybe I'm just a picky General Building Contractor.",1.0

"Like many reviewers, I once owned the original Workmate. I loved it, and eventually gave it to my son. I ordered this one with trepidation, knowing that Black and Decker has not made a quality product for several decades. This bench arrived slightly bent, even though the shipping box did not appear damaged. Several parts fell out of the box when it was opened. These were parts that were supposed to be attached at the factory. The assembly instructions were confusing, and nearly useless. The concept of the Workmate has always appealed to me. The execution of that concept in this current product is pathetic. I cannot recommend the WM 425 in any way. Additional observations after a month of use: This workbench is truly a joke. It is so poorly made that I am constantly fiddling with it to get it to work right. As far as I am concerned, it is a disposable item, and that's exactly how I intend to treat it. As soon as I finish the current auto re-upholstery project that I am using it for, I'm going to set it out at the curb for pick-up by the local scrap metal hauler.

To top it all off, when I raised the front bench to make it 90 degrees the first time, the whole orange handle mechanism completely fell off and I can't figure out to get it back together so anytime I want to use the handles the whole thing lifts up instead of being locked in position.

"Compared to the original workmate of some time ago, this new workmate feels very cheap and shaky.

The directions for both assembly and use are very skimpy. The assembly of one particular part was not even included. One of the 3 top boards (jaws) was warped and has to be replaced.

"Handle has changed from the older ones.
I got this as a gift because I love my 20 +/- year old 16oz. straight claw w/ leather handle.
As soon as I opened the box you could visually see that the handle is fatter than the older ones.
The steel plate that retains the washer stack on the end is also way thicker and has a sharp edge out of the box.
The weight of this thing was 1 lb. 9 7/8 oz. my old one measures 1 lb. 6 1/4 oz.

My old one is a superbly balanced work of tool art this new one feels ""heavy"" and ""clunky"" to me.

Longer:  This is an amazingly cheaply made item.  The metal is light gage (i.e., thin), and plastic connections abound.  The wood, which you would think would be solid, is actually glued 'strips' of wood - so don't put your beer on the table, lest the condensate damage the lamination.
The wood is already warped, right out of the box!  Jeez, give me a chance to bang it up first, Black and Decker, will ya?

I know that the Black and Decker 'brand equity' is really worthless now, just a synonym for 'Disposable Chinese Made Junk"" - but this is shocking, even for them.

"UPDATE 8/25/2016.....Tried Porter-Cable bag 78121 ($10 for 3)  and it works PERFECT!  Its a 10 gallon size for 7812 vacuum but no problem.  You are COMPLTELY wasting your money on these 78114 bags offered here.  AGAIN.  Get bag 78121 for cheap!

I've used these bags in my Porter Cable 7810 shop vac for several years and they work fine for what I do...shop garage cleanup..they even work fairy well for sheetrock dust (coupled with onboard HEPA filter) and they hold a boat load right up to the FULL point with fairly good suction.  They are a single layer paper bag and are so yesterday.  They cost almost $7 per bag whose price has increased almost 10% in the last 18 months since I last bought them.

But I will use them no more.

What do home central vacuum systems use for their bags?  They use multilayer synthetic. Why?  They are stronger and don't plug up nearly as fast.  Their cost is about $3 - $4 per bag if bought in a moderate amount.  Do your homework.

The 7810 Porter Cable vac has an internal bag connection of about two and three eights.  Home central vac connections are about two inches (Don't know about Nutone).  BUT.....home central vac bags have serrated cardboard opening and with that feature they can connect up to at least three inch inlets (Just talked to online Vendor of home bags on the phone)

Whats this mean, then?  Start using home central vacuum system bags at 3-4 dollars per bag instead of PC bags at 7 dollars per bag.

I use a 10 gallon home generic bag (2 layers synthetic with serrated cardboard opening) and it takes an extra 30 seconds to fit it up on the vacuum internal connection due to the physics / geometry of the bags opening(They were not meant to connect at the high point of the vacuum) The 7810 is about a 5 gallon volume but the my bag just nests into the space easily.  You might be able to find a smaller home bag but not necessary.

Hope this helps.  You sheet rockers may want to try this.  To hell with Porter Cable and their OUTRAGEOUS inflated price.  I'll be a SUCKER no more.",1.0
"For birthdays and other holidays my Sweetheart, kids and grandkids usually buy me woodworking tools. Even though I usually provide them with a list, occasionally things go bad.

This jig is one of them. One of the legs was bent out of the box, took some creative straitening methods to get it to work at all. Finally got it assembled and working, sort of. This thing is too flimsy to be of any serious use. Doesn't have enough mass to use it on large leg sections. I'm afraid the push tab will bend. Adjusting it by eye is not a big deal, but the flimsy lock mechnism does not instill confidence in a repeatable cut. The whole thing flex's when you push the piece thru the saw. After wasting a couple hours and a few pieces of scrap wood, I decided this jig should go back. Unfortutely it was purchased at HD, who wouldn't take it back, since it had been assembled and used.

I bought this gun enen though I read other people's negative reviews and agree with them that it is poorly engineered.  The trigger mechanism is all or nothing so the only way to control the flow rate is by adjusting the aiir preasure at the compresser.  It doesn't have a mechanical plunger to push the end plug through the tube and instead pumps out the calk with air so every now and then you get a big burst of air in the calk.  I resorted back to a hand gun to finish my job and realized that I had much better control of volume this way.

"...from what these used to be.

Like most products that used to be made in the USA, Black & Decker has seen fit to manufacture the WorkMate in China. And it shows. Those of you unfortunate enough to have bought this piece of junk because you didn't know any better ...I feel your pain.

I still have my old original WorkMate table (a model 300) that is fast up on the quarter century mark. And it works better in every respect than the 7 year old model 425 I received as a gift. The steel on the 425 is rough edged and thin, all pivot points are pop-riveted and, after seven years of use, so tight it is still difficult to open the table. The ergonomics of the opening latches are such that you have to push down on them while trying to pull up on the table to release it ...nothing beats third world design. The larger bamboo wood table insert warped within a year. The overall fit, finish and function of this WorkMate is rough and cheap ...such a far remove from the originals. Had this not been a gift it would have been returned. I certainly wouldn't recommend this waste of steel to anyone.

What a shame.

B&D invented the WorkMate (or at least brought it to market) and it was a great tool to have for DIY's and Pro's alike. The fact the originals are still around and working is testament to how well they used to be made ...and made here in the USA.

My advice if you want a *good* WorkMate? Find one of the old originals in the aisles of everyone's favorite auction site or score one from a garage or estate sale. As long as people keep buying the cheap Chinese-made junk U.S. tool manufacturers are footing ...the manufacturers will keep making cheap Chinese-made junk.",1.0
"I bought this blade for my local Habitat for Humanity chapter.  In fact, I bought this one and a Diablo from another vendor at the same time.

So out came the Bigfoot brand blade.  First thing we noticed is it was made in China.  Then it would not fit on the saw.  No diamond arbor knockout.  Said it had one in the product description and on the package.  But only had a 5/8 round hole.  I asked the vendor to replace it as it was new in the package.  They said ""no"" as it had been over 30 days.  I understand the return policy, but really, it was the wrong blade.  So beware, if you want a ""Made in China"" blade, buy this one.

"I knew going into this purchase that it was going to take some time and effort to set up this plane. However, I wasn't expecting what I got.

1) The sole and sides needed to be flattened and polished (expected for the price) - cupping and extremely rough sole and sides. I honestly think I could have used the plane body w/o the blade to remove wood from a project. I recently set up an old Stanley #3 smoothing plane and it took a few hours. This would have taken quite a bit longer.

2) The throat had a machining gouge on one side. What was required may have altered the bedding of the blade too much.

3) The lever cap had one huge and one small casting bubble. You could see where someone at the factory had lightly ground the tips of the bubbles to allow clamping pressure on the blade. There were two corresponding scratches on the blade, and the aforementioned  throat machining gouge corresponded to the largest casting bubble.  There was a gap of about 1/16th of an inch between the cap and the blade caused by the casting bubbles.

4) Another reviewer noted the screw on the adjustable throat plate broke off after a drop on a carpeted floor. I noticed the plane I received had what appeared to be a copper screw soldered onto the stamped steel throat plate. I have had other cheap tools made of chrome plated copper. They tended to fail.

The blade is stamped ""Made in England"". The packaging for the plane is labeled ""Made in Mexico"". No stamped country of origin identifiers on the body of the plane.

I have to say this is a black eye for Stanley's Mexico manufacturing division.

Suspecting this might be the case, I used a pair of channel locks to tighten the screw as much as possible -- it still gave way and kicked back with tremendous force.

The product is dangerous as sold, so please take my advise and stay away. I was just trying to save myself a little time and ended up with a good size scar and bruise (not to mention a ruined table leg) in return. You're much better of taking the time to build your own.",1.0
"Very poorly made product. I bought this knowing this was a cheap product, and i thought it would be okay for as little as i would use it. I had to re engineer the jig before I even got to use it, it actually fell apart while i was taking it out of the box. I would not recommend unless you want to spend $25 then make a new hinge for it before you use it!",1.0
"I got one of the original workmates in the 1980's, and have been using it happily for nearly 20 years butI was sorely disappointed in this item. over the years I have assembled many, many items, and this was by far the worst, both in terms of directions, and in quality of merchandise.

Minor problems:
3 pieces -- one knob and 2 rubber feet -- were missing.

Major problems:
Directions are missing a critical step -- how to attach the rear and middle jaws to the frame.
One of the recessed hole for the bolts was misdrilled, resulting in significant tearout, which was then filled clumsily with some sort of wood putty, which was not leveled, and fragile -- it crumbled at a touch -- the piece never should have made it into the box
Vise screws were misaligned.
Pivot nuts were turned around, and misaligned -- I had to detach the ribbon connecting the 2 screws so I could match the depth of the 2 pivot nuts. Detaching and reattaching the ribbon was a major project.
The FRONT jaw has a ""V"" groove to hold round objects, like dowels, and the REAR jaw has a ""V"" groove, but the middle jaw does not --what's the point in that?
When I finally got it assembled, the rear and middle jaws would not anchor correctly, and would not seat. they just slid back and forth.
The rear jaw cupped down in the middle.
The middle and rear jaws were not flush -- the middle jaw was proud of the rear jaw, creating a significant ridge.

This piece of junk is going back",1.0
"This is garbage!  I should have listened to the reviews on here.. It's cheap.  The build quality is bad, and it's just not big enough for larger pieces of work.  Typical crappy quality that we are seeing more and more of from guess where....

"I bought this over a year ago to replace one I broke and just got around to using it. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY DANGEROUS!!!!! The adjustable stop with the knurled knob should not be used. The fact that this assembly has a ""hand tighten"" knob assumes the impossible, namely that anyone short of Superman is capable of hand tightening the knob tight enough to keep the stop in place. I just found out the hard way. On the third pass, you guessed it, the knob loosened and the whole mess went flying. The table leg will get a ""dutchman"" because the table is all out of one board and the leg won't match otherwise. I admit I WAS STUPID to have trusted this set up. YOU ARE FOREWARNED!!! I put the stop back on and tapped two cap screws to keep it in place. If I want to ""adjust"" it I'll move it and tap it in the new location. DO NOT USE THIS WITHOUT USING AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF ATTACHING THIS PART!!!!",1.0
"After reading the positive reviews on Amazon.  I decided to buy the workmate portable workbench from Amazon.  Amazon Prime is GREAT.  Got my product within a few days. I bought this with the intention of using it as a portable rifle cleaning station.  The concept is great.  Having a table that can be taken down and put away easily is ideal.  When the package came, it was in bad shape.  The box was partially torn on top during transit.  I opened it up and noticed right away that the spring on the handle to lock the table up was missing.  I search around the box and couldn't find it.  I am guessing it was knocked out during shipping.  I also noticed that it was missing one of the table top.  That was the end of it so I figure I would return it and get a new one.  However, as I was examining the table I noticed how bad the workmanship is on this table.  A true POS.  Cheap Plastic was used for the chain mechanism to open and close the table top.  I can imagine this falling apart after a few use since the plastic chain looks so flimsy.  I decided to get a full refund.  Don't waste your money on this.  I need to start looking for something else.",1.0
"My old Workmate worked easily.  This new Workmate being top of the line, WM425, should be at least as good. It is crap. The top is cheap, thin  material, not even cut to square. I could replace the top but the vise is flimsy and so poorly designed and manufactured that I have to crank it with both hands. I took it to a B&D Service Center to ask if I can substitute a top from an old Workmate. They young man there had never seen a Workmate and had no idea what it is for. Do not buy.",1.0
The rivet that that held on the stamped steel cam (pictured as cast) broke immediately after it was no longer returnable. If that were the only problem I might fix it but rough castings and warped sole make it not worth the time to repair.,1.0
"I will have to advise you not to buy it. It is unusable as manufactured and the average woodworker won't be able to make it work. You will need some mechanical and machining expertise to do so. I ordered it because I trusted the Stanley name. I should have read all of the reviews. I had a similar plane, not a low angle, but the same style, and simply loved it. It was my go to plane for close work. This one was made in Mexico I believe. It is still heavy, nearly two lbs I believe. It it is made of high quality materials and well built and finished, needing only the average tune-up for a new plane. It looks like the one I used to have, It looks like a quality Stanley product. That said, it doesn't work! Even with the front gap adjusted fully open and the blade fully extended it won't produce a shaving, the blade can't extend far enough. I didn't return it because it is made of high quality materials and I believe I can make the necessary adjustments for it to perform correctly. I also like a challenge. I will update this review after I have a chance to make the modifications I think are necessary. It is very sad, I have always trusted Stanley for quality tools at a fair price, but after reading many reviews on different sites it seems Stanley has given away their quality control fro some unknown reason. I hope this is temporary and they can correct this issue and regain their trusted name.",1.0
"I have used Shark Pry Bars and Nail Pullers for over ten years and they have been excellent tools.  When I needed another set for a carry bag, I had no hesitation in ordering the same tools again.  My original set of Shark tools were made in Japan with excellent quality and finish.  What I received (and returned) is made in China of what looks like pot metal with a poor edge grind on the flat part of the blade and a very rough edge.  What makes these tools indispensable is the sharp smooth blade which allows for sliding between trim and the wall or baseboard without damage to either. The ""new"" version is not worth the time to regrind and fix. There are better choices than the current Shark brand.",1.0
shark grip prybar is wonderful unfortunately I received dascopro model 103-0 instead of what I ordered,1.0
"Shark used to be great tools, but sadly that is clearly not the case anymore.  The prybar I ordered had the v-notch in the nail pulling end milled off center... Way off center.  The result was that the left 'leg' of the puller was about 3/16"" longer than the right one.  I didn't even try using it, but know from extensive experience that this would have made a disaster of any board that I had actually tried to pull a nail out of.  These tools are now made in China, and the quality has taken a serious nosedive.

I have many Orange Box Store and Blue Box Store pullers, and none of them have milling anywhere near as sloppy as this one.  What a disappointment!  They've got better nail pullers at Harbor Fake, and a lot cheaper too.

Amazon's return process, however, was quick and easy.  It's the first time I've ever had to return something (and I've bought thousands of items over the years).",1.0
"Disappointed with this plane.  I have an old one in storage and ordered this out of convenience because I needed one.  Not the same!  The cam lock for the cap is really bad, it is go, no go, and you have to adjust the screw just perfectly to get the cam to lock and then it's marginally set.  I don't know if everyone would even think to consider adjusting the screw to get it to ""lock"". Subsequently, the side to side adjustment moves the cap then finally the blade, so that's all sloppy.  And finally, the sole is so roughly ground and it would take hours to hone it smooth.  You get what you pay for, I just expected more from Stanley,  I guess it's also possible that I got a counterfeit?  I'm going to see if I can send it back, planes are particular and need to be precise, this one is not, and while the sole could be honed smooth, you'd have to live with the cam lock for the cap as I don't think there's anyway to replace or change the way it works.",1.0

Stanley should be ashamed of themselves.  I have older versions of this plane which were excellent performers.  I bought one for a gift and was ashamed to present it to the intended recipient.  It took about three hours of intensive work just to get the plane to work.  The castings were extremely rough.  Spend the extra money and purchase a Lie Nielsen 60 1/2 or go to e-bay for an older Stanley 60 1/2.,1.0
I could not believe that this was actually a B&D product. It is cheap and flimsy and the assembly instrucions are nearly impossible to follow. The jaws do not close properly nor do they fit tightly. The plastic assembly wrench is totally useless. What a piece of junk.,1.0

I have the 12 oz leather handle rip claw hammer I had for several years and decided to purchase the 16 oz hammer and well when it arrived it looked good but I noticed that the thing felt no heavier than my 12 oz and after weighing it on a set of good scales it was only 1.6 oz heavier than the 12 oz hammer just the handle a little longer and after contacting Estwing they don't want to do anything so if you are in the market for one don't expect it to be 4 oz heavier like it should and Estwing does not really give a hoot.,1.0

Purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone and am glad that I decided to assemble it. They instructions did not match the version of the product in the box and it had lots of missing parts. I RETURNED IT.,1.0
"The package of parts is missing the 2 vise screws, the 2 pins, the 2 pivot nuts. In addition, the instructions are not clear --- I never did even get through this one, the second step (the first step is to empty the carton <g>): #2 Assemble two top blocks to the underside of the rear jaw by fitting the raised posts on the top blocks into the smaller holes of the rear jaw. Insert bolts through the rear jaw and into top blocks and tighten with supplied wrench. (fig. 2)""

It was not clear until I checked back on the Amazon photo which was the ""rear jaw"". Guessing that it was the largest of the three wooden pieces, I found that the ""raised post"", the only one to which the bolt screws in, does not fit in the ""smaller""- not the smallest - of the five holes.

So, this ""workmate"" is useless and disappointing.",1.0
"The WM425 has lots of ingenious features but they are made so cheaply-- with plastic and thin metal-- that those features are more of a marketing ploy than part of a quality Workmate.  My original Workmate, which is probably 20 years old, is working like new.  My WM425 is already broken-- one of the handles broke off.  The WM425 takes me at least twice the effort to perform tasks that the original Workmate can do because the screw length of the WM425 is so short you often have to remove and shift the back two bamboo platforms in order to clamp wood between them-- going from 1 1/2"" to 6"".  Also you often have to find a place to put the center/rear platform that has to be removed at times. The platforms use plastic parts that slide into notches in the top metal rails.  The fit of the platforms to the rails are cleaver but I do not believe they will last long-- especially if you need to clamp down hard or move/change them.  Which, brings up the point the WM425 Workmate does not clamp down as well as the original Workmate.  And, the one handed tightening feature is poorly made and does not work well.  The original Workmate sits well on its side when folded up.  The WM425 falls over in the slightest breeze.
  I called Black and Decker just after my WM425 arrived because one of the plastic pegs arrived broken.  The customer service at Black and Decker is excellent and she sent a replacement peg to me on the spot.  I told her that the WM425 seemed cheaply manufactured but I would keep it because sometimes things that look cheaply made actually work fine anyway.  I also mentioned to her that I would pay much more for an original workmate if they were to manufacture them again-- since I know they last a long time.  Also, although the box looked fine, the Workmate arrived twisted so the pull bar did not function.  (By the way, I twisted it back-- the metal is so thin it twists easily.)
  Well I've had the WM425 for about 6 months and hardly use it.  I am using my original Workmate about 100 times a month and I still could use need another quality workmate.  But, the WM425 is such a disappointment that I'm using a sawhorse instead.  If you own one of the original Workmates you are most likey going to hate these new ones.
  I do not often write reviews, but these are so bad in comparison that I hope to prevent others from making my mistake.  At the very least, try one before you buy it.",1.0

"Stanley used to make a good plane.  In fact, I bought this plane as an addition to a Stanley block plane I have owned for 30 years, which has given excellent service all that time.  This plane, however, is a piece of junk.  The casting was so poorly done that the sole of the plane was not flat, and spurs left over from the casting that had not been machined off prevented the plan from nesting in the plane body so that the blade had adequate throat clearance.  I sent it back to Stanley for a refund and bought a competitor's plane.

If you are, like me, a carpenter and cabinetmaker, and need a good block plane, don't consider this one.",1.0
"So, I liked the stand for the first 5 months then it just started falling apart. First the rollers started coming out because the 1/4 rod just slides around inside of the rollers. You have to weld it in place. Then later the legs tore off. Had to weld them.

Yesterday I went to tip it up to colapse it and the rivits pulled out. (The hinges)  My saw flipped over and landed up side down.

Now I am a trim carpenter. I use it everyday. So If your a home owner useing it to buid model air planes you will be fine. Not for the contractor for shure. But maybe you could order a welder from Amazon to fix your new saw. It will list comen things bought when you bought this product. The welder will show up.

So to top my disapointment. I called Trogen. This guy didn't want anything to do with me. He sells a product and won't stand behind his product. He tells me he only make 20 dollars off these stands. He said I would have to ship mine back 80 dollars and he would fix it. Im out 80 bucks for his bad product. Or he would sell me one for  292.00 so I would save 7 dollars and loose out my 80 dollars. Then tells me list price is 439.00 . Righ t I could buy 2 for that from Amazon. So I gues Ill Just keep welding or buy someone elses product. Not happy with this at all.",1.0
"Very poorly constructed.  Flimsy sheet metal.  Catches on the underside of the jaws do not engage securely into the holes in the frame.  Adjusting screws were poorly aligned so that the first attachment of the moveable jaw left it crooked and required some disassembly and adjusting on my part.

Next time I would look for something much sturdier.  Made in China.",1.0
"I recently purchased a Stanley 12-960 Contractor Grade Low Angle Plane that is poorly manufactured. I'm sure a ""Contractor"" would just chuck it. On first inspection, it is evident the base casting finish is quite rough. (I did expect to have to ""tune"" it as is nearly always the case with new planes) The bottom surface of any plane must be both flat and as smooth as possible for it to work well. I started by dismantling it and cleaning out some machining dust and then just re-fitting the adjustable mouth. I then ground the base sides and bottom using abrasive cloth on a surfacing plate. It then became apparent the adjustable mouth plate was not level in the plane sole. A check showed the rebates that the mouth plate seats on were 0.25mm different,side to side, and also sloping front to back, so only one side and the front of the mouth plate were flush with the plane bottom. By now I realized the job was going to be bigger than I had expected and I had blown any chance of a return as a faulty item. Someone might wonder whether just 0.25mm is significant. It certainly is! If you can measure the thickness of a fairly heavy shaving made by a large plane you will find it to be probably less than this, and these planes are made for fine work. So, I'm disappointed with my purchase as I will now have to get the plane base surface ground in a machine shop to enable it to work as it should.",1.0
"Received my 12-960 this morning. Easy to open the packaging--it was secured with one staple. Hmmm. The plane was oiled and the cutter showed signs of hand sharpening. Double hmmm. I guess the previous owner wasn't too impressed with the plane. I spent about 40 minutes truing the sole, then discovered that regardless of bevel orientation the cutter won't extend beneath the sole of this meticulously engineered device. So much for Stanley planes. I give it a one. But it gets almost a three as a kayak anchor.",1.0
"I received this plane as a gift and couldn't be more disappointed in the fit, function, and finish.  Major problem with it is that the blade does not extend past the base so it doesn't cut anything even at full extension.  It appears that they didn't finish machining the base where the blade rests.  Second problem is that the base is very rough.  Looks like they finished it with 20 grit and this is supposed to glide across a wood surface?  I don't think so, not even close.  This one is going back for a refund and I'll try another brand.  I am afraid the Stanley name is now meaningless when it comes to quality image.",1.0
"I needed a small block plane, so headed to Lowe's to pick on of these up.  They had 2 in stock:  one was cracked on the side, and I purchased the other.  When I got my purchase home, it had a pit in the metal (an obvious defect), and I returned it.

2 weeks later (and being desperate), I looked at Lowe's again, and found another one of these planes with a crack in the metal.  Don't think I'd recommend buying this one.",1.0
"One of the reviewer said, ""You get what you pay for"".  In this case I am sure you don't even get that.  Stamped parts, and very soft metal make this plane useless junk.  After more than an hour of tuning and sharpening, the blade edge just folded over on soft fir end grain.  Take some time to find an old plane at a yard sale.  I gave it one star because the Amazon rating system requires at least that.",1.0
I am not giving my age away but some of the tools I have purchased new and still use are now listed as antiques. I receiently purchased a low angle Stanley block plane to replace one that disappeared from my shop.  I am not sure what country Stanley of England is importing them from but the quality is not the same as the original Stanley tools. The sole looks like it was hand ground with a 30 grit belt sander and the low quality steel blade was not ground at 20 degrees. The adjusting levers are made of poor fitting soft stamped metal. But the shiny brass colored knobs look good.,1.0
Poor design you have to flip it over to cut opposing mortise so now your referencing off two points that are adjustable so it's too easy to have miss alignment in height,1.0
"The fit and finish is very poor. The adjusting plate was frozen, requiring the use of a pair of pliers to work it free. The moveable throat had numerous burrs that had to be filed off. The sole required 1 hour of lapping to get it flat. The blade was ground askew, requiring a 1/2 hr of grinding and honing to get it useably sharp. And the piece de resistance, after 2 hours of tuning and setting up, the brass knob that adjusts the depth of the iron fell off while I was increasing the depth of cut. The adjusting mechanism consists of a very soft brass knob press-fitted onto the short splined end of the adjusting bolt. If you adjust the cap to exert adequate pressure to keep the blade from chattering, it results in enough pressure to work the knob right off the splined shaft.

There are numerous alternatives, but the Record version suffers from the same adjuster problem, so I would stay away from it. If you absolutely have to have a Stanley low angle block plane, then be prepared to modify the knob by drilling a 1/16"" hole through the knob and end of the adjusting bolt and insert a spring pin to secure the knob. Otherwise, your plane will not make it to the end of its first week.",1.0

This is the real problem that I have been trying to resolve:
I just purchased a brand new Porter Cable Hinge Butt Template, Model No. 59381, Type 2. It looks excellently made and gets great reviews on the internet. Now I want to buy all of the optional Jamb Gauge sets (Model Nos. 59825, 59826, 59827, 59828, 59830, 59831, 59832) so I can route hinge butts on doors where the jambs are already routed.
I am disappointed to see on Porter-Cable's ServiceNet web site that three out of five of the Jamb Gauge sets are ""Back Ordered"" The 5"" model is ""Back Ordered until 8/15/2012""! Also the 5 "" 59830 and 6"" 59831 Jamb Gauges are not even listed. It would be a lot more efficient if there was an option to buy all of these Jamb Gauge sets in one package for people like me who want their tools to have all of the options and be 100% functional. Even if I have to order them piecemeal at least they should be readily available.

How in the world can a contractor do a job when the tool maker does not keep vital tool accessories in stock? Now my project is delayed at a substantial cost!

I am considering making the Jamb Gauges in my machine shop since I need them quickly, or just throwing up my hands and returning the Porter Cable Hinge Butt Template and buying a Milwaukee. Is there any way for me to actually obtain all of the Jamb Gauge sets now from Porter-Cable?

"I am a framer , sider , and do some additions and remodels. I bought this cord , thinking it would be a 12/3 but is only 16/3. Dont be fooled as I was . This a very poor deal for the money . Also , Only 40 degrees here in the rockies, (yes 9/23 2011) And it doesnt unwind , stays all kinked up . Good for -67 , I don't think so. Avoid this company and products if at all possiable.

Just tried to use it for the first time.  The chipper blades won't fit the 5/8 inch arbor on my Baileigh table saw.  The inner and out blades fit but can't use the set because the chippers won't fit.  Need to return it.,1.0

"I bought this to go with the snow blower I bought on the same day.  It didn't snow enough to use the snowblower and power cord for over 30 days after I purchased the set.  It appeared very sturdy as it is designed for outdoor use.  The FIRST time I used this, the power cord casing split to reveal the inner insulation.  It had not caught on anything and it was not near any sharp objects.  It split just from lengthening the power cord to give more slack for using the snow blower, somehow, the cord twisted and split.  For the price, I would not expect this product to split on the first use.  I called the manufacturer (after much searching for the contact information) and they told me that since I bought it through Amazon, I would have to return it through Amazon.  Amazon will not give a refund or exchange for the product since it was outside of the 30 days, even though this was the first use.  In response to my complaint about this product, I got a form email and a suggestion to go to the manufacturer.  I am very disappointed in the product and how poorly Amazon fights for its customers.  Think twice before making big purchases on here outside of books and DVD's.  I hope Amazon considers adjusting their customer service form emails to at least make it look like the person sending it actually read the original email to them about the situation.",1.0

"I bought this to try and measure angles I need to cut on my table saw. This product is just too big to use for that.

"I looked at this tool in a local store because I'm installing crown in an older house. It is very well made and deserves more than one star, but while I was in the store I found a simple plastic tool for measuring angles called ""mite-r-gage"". It gives you an accurage measurement which you then compare with a crown table that gives you the angle and bevel for flat cuts on a compound miter saw.
I just wanted people to consider this $10 alternative if the Bosch is overkill for how often you'll use it.",1.0
"works well... be sure to ""dry"" fit your pieces to ensure your dado is wide enough",1.0

The Bosch reps don't even know how to use their own product. We contacted several (3) all with different info NONE of which was accurate. It will find angles, but a protractor for less than a dollar will do that. We were also told ours did not work, so we bought a second one. Well it worked like the first!! Save your money.",1.0

"The unit is very heavy and difficult to move around, but the main problem is that it will rarely start up because it causes breakers/fuses to shut off continually. Forget about using an extension cord to get it to run.",1.0
Regulator keeps working its way loose it could use a support bracket to keep it in place when you have an air hose plugged into it.,1.0
"I am not a daily user, but I wanted something for the occasional nailing work. Other than the fact that it is too heavy and noisy for its features, the quality was poor. First, the pressure regulator broke. I took it out and went around it, and then I started having electrical problems - the unit would not kick in and re-fill unless I played with the switch. Last time I am buying Hitachi - This is a low quality unit. They should be ashamed.",1.0
"I bought a like-new Hitachi EC12 compressor from a fellow woodworker. I encountered the following problems.

1. The pressure regulator leaks air. You can hear the air leak when the working pressure is set below 90psi. At higher working pressure, the leak is not as noticeable. It also seems that Hitachi uses non-standard thread as standard 1/4"" hex nipple does not fit. I had to reuse the hex nipple came with the unit.

2. The unit does not hold pressure. Over a 12-hour period, it lost about 20 psi of air. I have noticed the unit will refill the tank periodically even though it is not being used.

3. The unit fails to run sporadically. The motor makes a humming sound but the compressor will not kick in. The motor will stop in a few seconds and the same cycle will repeat every few seconds. The only way to get the unit working again is to cycle the AUTO/STOP switch.

I am really disappointed by the quality of this Hitachi air compressor.",1.0
"I bought this compressor for its higher output for its size and barely under the warranty period ended i had stopped working. The breaker on the unit pops always, or it pops the breaker in the house. Why cant they make a compressor that will work anywhere?? I want to destroy this unit!!!",1.0
"This level is the loooooow end of the scale, I can do it easier with string line level or clear tubing.
Just my opinion but if you want to shoot foundations ETC. spend a bit more $$ & get something usable.",1.0
"BROKE - Despite the lower price, what is the point when it breaks so easily.  After 2 years of light use, mine went disfunctional.  Take the plastic cover off of the pressure relief apparatus and you will see how fragile the magnetic shut off and cheap plastic push button switch are.  I'm debating on learning how to fix, replace or just go out and buy something designed a bit simpler.  My unit keeps cycling and won't hold pressure.",1.0
The Hitachi compressors have an internal circuit breaker that trips whenever there is the slightest (electric) load on the motor.  It trips  every time the compressor kicks on and again when it kicks off.  It continues to trip so long as it is cold outside or if you are using an extension cord.  If you buy this compressor it would probably be a good idea to hire an extra person to stand over the compressor and push the circuit breaker button everytime it trips.  It is without a doubt a serious engineering flaw.  This was my first Hitachi tool and it will definately be my last.,1.0
"I bought this after looking at the specs, It will not deliver what it says. I have the same problem of it cutting off on the safety valve. If I use mine for any length of time it will trip the overload. I would recommend another brand...",1.0
"We sent the Ec 12 in for repair after only six months of use, on April 12.  They still have not repaired or returned the compressor.  Hitachi rep for the NW said that is the best they can do.

"Had this unit for about three years with very light use - occasional tire inflation.  As a previous writer indicated, the gauges got stuck, the pressure release valve froze, it wouldn't start and turned out to be uneconomical to repair.

"I bought one two years ago, and I'd driven less than 250 nails with it before it failed to work properly, so that's about a buck per nail - a great value.  It now pumps up, and doesn't stop until the pressure safety valve blows, then the motor goes into some kind of cardiac arrest.  Now I'm sure I'll be raped at the repair center as I spend >$100 to repair this $200 turd.  Save your money and pound the friggin' nails in with a hammer.",1.0
"Well first when UPS droped off untied the plastic it said on unit MADE IN CHINA, Then when I lifted out of bag I saw pieces of what looked like pot metal in the bottom of bag, What happen was that someone sit it down to hard, busted the motor and compressor from the frame, Metal looked about 1/16"" thick,plus free shipping took 13 days to arrive. Sent back refunded money back all except $9.99 so it cost me $10.00 to wait 13 days to get a china made busted compressor. But it was a blessing in disquise, went and bought a CRAFTSMAN.",1.0
"Didn't get to test the Hitachi.  I was amazed how little packing/protection is provided in the box for the compressor.  I opened the box and was rewared with a lot of little plastic pieces that once were the air filter assembly.  Since there does not appear to be a way for replacement parts to be sent to me, I will return the compressor without use.",1.0
"Based on the fantastic reviews, I decided to purchase this compressor. The box arrived, and when I opened it, I was a little surprised at how little packing material there was - just a box with the compressor inside. I also noticed oil leakage had occured. I read the manual, went to fill the oil reservoir, and noticed a spreading pool of oil on the floor of my garage. The oil reservoir cover was shattered. As Amazon has no customer service number to call, I'm not sure how I'll get satisfaction. This may be a great product, but I'll buy my major hardware purchases locally, so I can return broken products. If a book had arrived with a creased cover, no big deal, but I needed this for a job, and there's no way I can get this replaced in time to do it. If you have the time to track down how to get satisfaction, Amazon has great prices, but if you need to get a job done, buy locally.",1.0

I installed the kit per the instructions, started boring and within 3 minutes (or less) the bore bit sheared at the connection to the chank.

After a few years it became sticky and slimy. It was exposed to no harsh chemicals. It just aged badly. The hose remained reasonably flexible although it was always hard to wind up or coil.

"Paslode markets this nailer as a ""Cordless Utility Framing Nailer.""

Well, a no-mar tip is not included in the kit and you have to buy it as an accessory for $40.  I don't know about you, but when I pay $400 for a nailer, I don't think it's fair to have to pay another $40 for something that should be there in the first place - especially since it defeats the purpose of having a ""Utility"" nailer.

I tried to attach this hose to a hose reel and the fitting was very difficult to thread and only went on a few turns before not being able to go any further, even with a wrench. Also, the hose itself did NOT have the Mit diamond trademark signifying a genuine goodyear hose, and the goodyear markings that are there were put on sloppily and were starting to rub off.

Like I said, the hose may or may not work fine; I couldn't get mine threaded to even try it so 1 star. Others seem happy with it, and that's great, but I don't like to be duped. Don't sell me a harbor freight hose at goodyear prices. The genuine goodyear hose is only eight bucks more so I bought one of those and this one is en router back to amazon for a refund.

Amazon needs to get on the ball with these counterfeit items. I had a similar experience with a belkin USB cable, where it was supposed to be belkin, yet the cable was absolute garbage, extremely generic and anorexicly thin.",1.0

"Very disappointed, especially with all the great reviews.  I bought two.  The hose was fine, but the 1/4 inch ends were the problem for me.  On the first one, the threads were slightly off and leaked air.  On the second one, the threads were also slightly off, plus the crimp area was leaking.  Lost 30 pounds of air overnight.  Sent the first one back already and will likely send second one back.
I've since gone to local farm supply store and bought two of the red Goodyear 50 foot, 3/8 inch, 1/4 inch ends.  Hooked up exact same couplers, zero leaks, zero issues.  Sent other one to my Dad with same couplers.  He hooked them up, zero leaks, zero issues.  Don't forget to use a little plumbers tape before putting couplers on.",1.0
"I have used DeWalt countersink bits for years.  My last set had the drill bits break under moderately heavy use.  I assumed it was my fault.  Now I am not so sure.  My most recent purchase of a week-or-so ago contained defective bits.  the #6 & #8 wobble.  The #6 broke after just a few uses.  It seems the pressing of the drill bit into the 1/4"" drive collar is defective.  If you have ever dealt with the Chinese sales and marketing mentality then you know that a ship container is the smallest unit they sell and ship to the USA.  If the defect slipped past Q.C. then a lot of defective countersink bits have flooded the market.  Even if the defect has been corrected the defective units will have to be sold and purged from the market before the ""fixed"" units will be available (the Chinese don't do recalls).  It is probable that the defective units were on the ship or already distributed around the USA before the defect was identified.

HOWEVER, Amazon has been great, as always!  In an attempt to return the product I received a notice that the item was not returnable.  The note also suggested calling Amazon customer service.  The Amazon rep was courteous and helpful as always - and refunded the purchase price of the item, with having me return the product.  He could not explain why the unit was unreturnable but happily refunded my money.  What more can you ask?

I expect in a few months new product will be available that works as well as the units purchased in previous years.  DeWalt will certainly not allow this to be an ongoing problem.",1.0

The level was VERY inacurate on every bubble, the bubbles in all of the vials were too small in relation to the lines on the vial which made it very difficult to read (even if they were acurate) and it was not Made in the USA.

"Do not buy this level.  It is not accurate.  When the bubble is centered in the horizontal position it is actually not level.  I returned the first one I received and got a replacement.

The one thing you expect a level to do is read level. Not the one I got. Checked this level against several other levels I own and it is greater than 1 degree off.

"I have been woodworking a long time and have lots of blades.  This is the worst cutting crosscut blade I have ever had of any brand.

I tried it with blade stabilizers.  Did not fix the cut problem.

Most Frued blades I have used (at least 25 over the years) have been pretty good.  This one is just plain terrible.

"Initially, I was very pleased with this set.  I was trying to save money by getting an adjustable set, rather than fixed length countersink bits.  I used the #6 and #8 to countersink around 100 holes for several projects I have built over the last couple of months.  However, for the first few projects I was using the same size screws, so I really didn't have to adjust the countersink collet.  When I started having to make adjustments for different length crews, that is when my problems started.  The tightening screw requires a substantial amount of force to stay in place during drilling.  The problem with applying that amount of force is that it is very easy to bend the bit shaft.  You can bend it back, but you have weakened the metal and eventually it will break, very soon after in fact, which is what happened to my #6 and #8 bit.  Additionally, it is impossible to tighten the screw down on the #10 bit, which is why I haven't used it.  I know these kind of bits are expected to eventually break, but mine broke after only two months.  Replacement bits run $9 - $10 a piece.  I will not be buying those replacement ones.  I am just going to bite the bullet and purchase the higher-end countersink set like I should have from the beginning.",1.0
"Not like the picture! The picture shows a bit with matching diameter shank AND bearing (1/2""). What you get is a 1/2"" shank bit, mated with a ridiculously tiny 3/8"" bearing. Bearing only has about 3/32"" of vertical stock-riding surface, and sits about 1/8"" above the flutes. So, you're flirting with disaster if the remaining stock is 1/4"" or less below the flutes, you're likely to get more chatter/bumps due to the tiny bearing, and you're likely to get a groove burnished into the edge of the work (especially with softer woods) from the miniscule bearing-contact patch. All of which could've been avoided if the bit were made to accept a 1/2"" bearing of decent width. Because the top of the flutes are ground to fit the 3/8"" bearing diameter, If you try to fit a 1/2"" bearing to the bit, it lowers the initial contact point on the flutes to about 3/16"" below the bearing. The only 1/2"" shank, 1/2"" bearing, 45 degree chamfer option Freud has necessitates a 2 1/2"" throat diameter. I own a lot of Freud products, very disappointed with this one. Come on Freud, make it like the picture, WITH A 1/2"" BEARING, sitting 1/32""-1/16"" above the flutes!",1.0

"If you're looking for a clunky, slippery, heavy, poorly designed tool, then look no further, the BoWrench is for you!  Maybe for decking this tool is great but not for overhead installation as the video suggested.  The cotter pins repeatedly fell out during use dropping metal pieces right onto my face.  The bar's surface is so slick it will slip off the wood when you apply pressure. Why wouldn't they have designed it with some sort of gripping surface???  Oh and the end caps on the metal bars pop out after about 5 minutes of use.  Oh and the bar does NOT lock in place as they advertise, if you happen to space it just right you can get it to sort of balance in the fulcrum point but it's not a secure lock-off.

I found this product via a youtube video review showing it used to help install tongue and groove V-groove ceiling boards.  I was about to embark on this same project so I bought the BoWrench hoping it would make the job go smoother.

When conditions were right and all the stars aligned, the BoWrench did help compress some boards together but it is such a clumsy tool to wield that I found myself more often than not just hammering a flathead screwdriver into the joist and using that to force the boards together.

So much so that I realized there had to be something wrong with this blade as well, only I couldn't visually identify it like the first defective blade with the bent tooth. Perhaps the whole blade was warped; I have no reliable way to measure such defects.

I have bought & happily used many Freud router bits. This is the first time that I have been disappointed. The solid steel bearing left a burned streak as I used it for the first time. I instantly stopped as soon as it was noticed & have now finished sanding it out. I have just used a solid steel bearing for the first & last time; I will make sure that I never buy a router bit that has a solid bearing again. Lesson learned. The immovable solid steel caused this problem which doesn't happen with the usual movable bearing. I replaced it with a Whiteside bit that worked wonderfully.,1.0
broke after a weekend project using it with the impact driver for driving screws.,1.0
"I purchased the BoWrench after watching the YouTube presentation.  Regretfully the device isn't worth the powder to blow it up if you are installing 2x6 pressurized lumber at a 45 degree angle to the joists.  It even becomes more worthless if you are replacing the deck's flooring and have covered the joists with ""joist deck flashing"" tape because it does not permit the prongs to straddle the covered joists ---- because the flashing makes the joists too wide.

Furthermore when forced over the deck flashing tape the BoWrench wouldn't grip, it slipped and it was more a nuisance than an aid to laying the deck.  I attempted to use it about three times with others looking over my shoulder and then they tried it themselves.  We are all seasoned DYI enthusiasts with about 125 years of collective experience.  We unanimously concluded the BoWrench was a deterrent rather than an aid to installing the decking and resorted to 3/4"" pipes with clamps to take the bow out of the lumber.

This may work fine with bare joists and 5/4"" decking running perpendicular to the joists but if using 2x6 lumber, joist deck flashing and/or installing the decking at 45 degrees to the joists, the BoWrench is a waste of money, time and energy.",1.0

"Do not waste your money on this product. I've run through these sleeves like water. I buy them because this is what they sell at the local hardware store, but they break all the time, the bits get stuck in the screws every other screw.

The stress bearing tube is constructed of aluminum with a steel insert to hold bit. It sheared when I was attempting to remove a Torx head bolt on my plane. The bolt is installed with 18 ft.

"These things are 100% trash. The first one broke and I thought it was a fluke (the extender portion was locked half-way back and the bit was useless). I gave them another chance and bought a 2-pack (large and small) from the local Home Repo store. The short one drove maybe 20 screws and the guide locked back all the way in. I tried to free it with some pliers and it shredded. Spent a day and a half with the longer bit driver and it started to bind up and not glide back as it should, gouging my wall. I held the guide with my hand and spun the drill to free it up and the whole thing went to pieces. I had a handful of bit extender parts and circlips in my hand. Dewalt should be ashamed of themselves for making these. Although I'm a contractor, they all broke under typical DIY conditions. Save your money and buy the offerings from Makita, Bosch, or Milwaukee.",1.0

"The advertised pictures show this tool being used on joists that are not taped. If you plan on rebuilding an outdoor deck and want to last you will probably want to use deck joist tape in which case this product does not work. It just slips and tears the tape.

Then you can straighten anywhere along the board and not ruin your tape! Be sure to use the deckmate spacers as well.",1.0

This item was obviously not new.  There was rust on part of the bit and the blade itself was missing a component as if a separate piece had been glued or bonded to the bit itself.  This appears to be an imitation of a Freud bit.,1.0

Stay away from this bit -- I usually buy Freud but I could not find any set up instructions for the bit. The manufacturer would not even consider a return because I was over the 30 day return policy. I assume they knew full well that the bit was very difficult to set up and doing so takes a lot of stock and time. I will continue to buy Freud but never from this supplier again.,1.0

"Faced with replacing a 25 year old, 1500 s/f deck, the BoWrench looked liked it would be a great help; after all, leverage is one of man's best friends. However, it was a big disappointment. It lacks an adequate grip on the joists, and tends to slip back along the joist, just when you are at a critical point. They need to redesign the gripper jaws to really grip the joist. I'd recommend some type of cam-like action. To keep it from slipping I found that I had to drive a screwdriver or a couple of nails behind it into the joist. The same problem occurs with the ""Adjustable"" attachment for wider joists. All-in-all I would not recommend wasting your money. A crow-bar or heavy screwdriver driven into the joist works just as well and is easy to use. Anybody want to buy a hardly used BoWrench...cheap?",1.0
"Amazon has it all wrong! When I ordered the 2042335 base they sent me a base for some smaller machine (19"" x 48"") yet it said the correct part number on the box. The mobile base was also bent all to hell.

"The mobile base came all scratched up in a torn box.  The mobile base packaging was very poor. It was just loosely thrown into the box.  Paint looked like primer.

"There are NO instructions either with the bits (other than a little chart to show you what thickness spacer to use for various thicknesses of stock), on the Freud website or on the web. There were 10 spacers included but they were not labeled as to what thickness they were. I suppose if I had a precision caliper, I could figure it out,  but it would have been nice if they had been labeled or color coded. I felt like the whole setup was too fraught with the possibility of errors, that is, trying to match up the two bits to get the perfect joint one needs for doors.",1.0

These should be sold as a pair since a single hook is not useful. The second product review indicates that two hooks are included in an order and this is not correct.,1.0
"This product would be great, if, they came as a pair of hooks with wheels. As it comes, however, as a single item, it is not adequate to move a ladder by itself. The cost, which is not insignificant, indicated to me that I would receive a pair of hook and wheels, and a review from a subscriber blatantly told the readers that they came in pairs. That was why I ordered a set, I thought. I returned mine.",1.0
The service was prompt but the problem was; the product was for a different vacuum.  It was too small by about 2 inches in circumference.  I needed it so I had to split the attachment ring and piece the material to make it fit.  It is not good but better then nothing.,1.0
This is the second cloth bag I've ordered for my Powermatic Model 73 and neither bag has fit.  The reason for ordering a cloth is because of the constant problem I've had getting the deposable bags for this system.  I've had to reuse the throw away bags until failure just to keep my shop running.  Powermatic is a very highly regarded company and I don't understand all the problems I'm having with service parts.,1.0
"As PKeith mentioned in a earlier review, the bearing won't come off the shaft of the stile bit. Unlike PKeith, I waited more than a year before trying to use the bits, so I may be out of luck. I emailed Freud to see if they could offer some help, and I'll update when they do (or don't) provide a solution. I have lots of Freud router bits and until now, they've been high quality.

LATER THE SAME DAY:
Decided I could live with the default width for some smaller doors I needed to make. Lost 2 teeth from the paired groove cutter on the stile bit. Second tooth probably came off when it hit the first one, which had buried itself in the rail. Working in oak, but appropriately.",1.0

"....and be willing to sacrifice your shaper for this thing.  And your feather boards.  If not, it makes a great way to murder your friends and a wonderful waste of time.  I've never seen a bit so finicky or attuned to kickback as this, even in a dovetail jig.  Once you get it right, it's best to sacrifice your shaping table to it until the bit wears out, or until you spear some hapless coworker I your shop with a bit of maple like a trendy vampire.  If you are even a 64th of an inch off, it will require filler and heavy belt sanding to round the edge to make it right.

I am going to save this bit until I require a very entertaining way of killing vampires or zombies.  Until then I will stick with beveling with a table saw, pocket hole screws and light finish sanding.  My coworkers spleans' will thank my for it.",1.0

"The Swivel Wheel is a Safety Hazard!! As a contractor, I have been working on steep slope roofs since 1968. On one job, I carried a 20 foot long hook ladder up a 40 foot ground ladder and slid it up a high 12:12 sloped slate roof. I pushed the hook ladder up the roof on the wheel and just before I flipped it over to hook it on the ridge, the top of the hook ladder rolled sideways. I almost lost it. I could have been killed or seriously injured. I was just barely able to regain control of the hook ladder and bring it down. I took the hook ladder down and removed the swivel wheel immediately. NEVER use a hook ladder with a swivel wheel. This is a serious safety hazard. The wheel only has to go up and down, NOT sideways. I have contacted the manufacturer of these defective tools several times. I can't believe they're still selling these things.",1.0

"There are several flaws with this product:
* didn't fit my Werner ladder rungs - the spacing between the caster bolt and the rung off is off enough to make it impossible to put the wing nut on
  the bolt.  Tried using a 2.5"" stove bolt, but that still did not result in a secure connection of the hook to the ladder rung
*relatively heavy for use on an aluminum ladder - they really makes it unbalanced and top heavy
*the caster is too small- may be OK for an asphalt single roof, but is useless for ""wheeling"" a ladder up a roof covered in 5/8"" thick cedar shakes

"My excitement went from 10 to sick-to-my-stomach as soon as I opened the box. I read the manufacturing was a little rough but I wasn't prepared for this at all. Cast iron parts were rusted. The rear rail has spots of rust and bubbling paint. The fence lockdown does not have a complete powder coating. Brackets are so poorly machines there's tear out and corrosion in the aluminum. There's discoloration on the ruler. The alignment window is chipped and poorly cut out.

"I've ruined my last piece of stock with this POS. When you slide it from right to left and lock it down, it jumps left at the far end.  Going left to right, it stays fairly true.  But the real problem is that the lock mechanism is not positive by any means.  If you don't really lean on it (at least on mine), it will move while cutting.  Very dangerous!  For those who have given it five stars...you need to experience the treat of using a real quality saw/fence.  This isn't it.
To those commenters ""shouting down"" the 1 star reviews, your comments are generally attacking the reviewer(s) and  lack objectivity. They sound very much like Vega shills.  I tried to save some cash knowing I was compromising quality to some degree when I bought it, but I had no idea it would be this poorly designed and built.

"Let me start by saying that I own  dozens of Freud router bits and several of their door making sets.  I have used Freud products for years and have been completely satisfied with all the Freud products I have ever owned until now.  I should also perhaps point out that I have been a carpenter and cabinet maker for years and downloaded the directions for this system and studied it thoroughly.  The ""New Premier Adjustable Rail and Stile System""  is rife with inaccuracies.  I encountered two major problems.  The first is inherent in any system of adjustment involving shims - specifically that all shims based systems are far from accurate and never compare to fixed mated profiles.  This  Freud system is no exception.  You find that your stub tenons are either too thin or slightly over size no matter which combination you try.  In the end you have get it just a little too tight and then SAND THE TENONS TO FIT!  No Thanks Freud I do not have time for this.  Secondly,  I found that even the fixed cutting edges were inaccurate.  The cutters  consistently cut a cope in which the profile was shy of the cut on the back of the cope.  In order to bring get the coped profile to mate the stile you have two choices -  crosscutting the back edge of the cope on a table saw or ripping a bit off the back edge off the stile.  There is no excuse for this  - you can't say that this is a problem common to shim systems.  This is just plain flawed and inaccurate work on the part of Freud.  Needless to say -  sanding tenons to fit and fiddling to get the cope and stick to mate is vastly time consuming and frustrating.  I'm currently in the middle of a set of cabinets and will have to finish up using this junk Freud stuck me with, but as soon as this set is done I'm chucking this garbage in the river.",1.0
"I am shocked at how well this fence was rated (as of june 2014). This is the first time an Amazon product that was rated 4 1/2  stars as let me down.  I ended up sending it back.  This company must have some serious quality control issues because it seems like this fence worked really well for many others.  It might be worth rolling the dice.

"Waste of money for me.  First, they won't attach to the top two rungs of an old standard Werner, have to go on the 2d and 3rd rungs.  Second, they came loose and shifted several times just during assembly and testing.  Not secure enough for what they have to do, I'm not putting my life in the hands of two little wing nuts that work loose while carrying the ladder across the lawn.  Third, there's not enough size on the hooks to hold securely on a lower angle roof.  You're on your own for padding or rubber grip material to keep the shingles from getting damaged.",1.0
"My rating is not based on the product.  My rating is due to poor product specifications listed on Amazon's site; nowhere does it say that these hooks cannot be used on a home with a vented ridge.  The product came with no directions except for a small label on each  hook indicating how to install with a tiny, hard-to-see picture.  The last line on the label says the product is not recommended for use on a vented ridge.  Now that I've opened (and tossed) the box, Amazon won't take them back.  Not happy.",1.0
"I purchased this because of the mostly positive customer reviews. My old fence was junk. I like many others found just about all the parts very sharp with burrs everywhere. They can't even paint all the parts. All the adjustment brackets are bare metal, all of them were bent way past square. After leveling everything up, I clamped it and the end of the fence moved 1/16. I took it apart filed the high spots off the moving clamp bar and put silicone spray on the bar and tried again. Not much better. Found that the moving clamp bar has so much clearance that there was no way that it was going to clamp correctly. This is how I corrected all the problems: I filed virtually everything that needed it. On the adjusting brackets, I bent them to a right angle and tapped to 5/16 and painted. I used the next size up on all the fasteners except the bottom screws that mount the front bar. The fence was very, very challenging. I made spring loaded radius buffers/bumpers (keeps constant pressure [to the front] on the bar to the moving clamp bracket) mounted on both ends of the moving clamp bar. This all took about 20 hrs of extra time. I mounted this on a 50 year old, 12"" Darra-James table saw so I had to do a lot of modifications. All in all it probably took about 40 hrs to install. Makes a guy wonder if this product was really made in America. I would say this would be poor quality Chinese.

Nice product. Overpriced.,1.0
"In theory this should be an extremely accurate fence. Unfortunately, when you position the fence and engage either the main or micro adjustment locks, the fence and head rotate about and squareness is lost. If you set the squareness with the lock(s) engaged it rotates in one direction. If you set it with them unlocked, it rotates in the other. And, in either case, it throws the set dimension off at the blade by about 1/32 inch. Unfortunately, there are no adjustment mechanisms as there are on the Unifence and others to correct this. I'm a pro that needs real precision that the micro adjust should provide. But, if I can't come up with a fix, as a precision tool the Vega fence is ""PRETTY MUCH USELESS!""",1.0

"I purchased this fence because it was the only 40"" I could find (50"" or more was just too big for my tiny shop). I have used this fence for 3 years and can say it is without a doubt the worst fence I have ever used in almost 20 years of cabinet making.  You have to lock down both the main clamp and the micro adjust clamp just to keep the fence from drifting or deflecting, and even then it needs to be checked repeatedly.  I have wasted a lot of stock because the clamps loosened and the fence drifted. And with the face of the fence painted black, it's nearly impossible to tell if stock is pulling away from the fence. I can't wait to replace this liability.",1.0
I was very disappointed with this product. On the first board I cut (a soft piece of pine no less) the bit chipped! I don't know if I happened to get a defective bit or if Freud is just a low quality product. I would look to a different brand if I were you.,1.0
"Before buying this item I read a lot of reviews. Those reviews and the fact that it looks solid and easy to use, convinced me to buy it. What a mistake I made. With the exception of the fence itself, and the front rail, the manufacturing of the head assembly, which is void of any quality control at all, renders the whole item a joke.  I can not recommend this item, especially when there is so many others out there to choose from. I was able to modify the head assembly and invent and make two items to go with it that makes it usable. I have many suggestions to the manufacturer, one that would make it much cheaper for some to buy, but they are not interested in any outside help. The factory did send me a new unpainted head assembly as I requested but it only solved some of problems. Without the accessories that I made I would not be able to use this item at all, and would have returned it.",1.0

"I'd heard a lot of good things about Freud tools, but having bought a couple of their bits, I have to say that I'm very disappointed.
I bought this bit a couple months ago primarily to use with my router table as a jointer bit, but didn't have the need for it until yesterday. The first piece of wood across this bit snapped the carbide tip off one of the cutters! A triangular piece of the cutter snapped off and went flying across my workshop! (Luckily, not in my direction.)
The thing that gets me the most about this is...the piece of wood was not up where the piece of carbide broke off! It's like it wasn't brazed on properly and just broke away when the vibrations from running a piece of wood across it started.

So now I have a worthless tool...it is so unbalanced that there's no way I can run it at high speeds in my router without risking further damage to the bit, the router, or both.

"After reading all the reviews on drill presses I decided to buy the top rated Delta drill press. My only concern was the recent move to Chinese manufacturing, but since most tool manufactures have made this move to remain competetive this became a moot point. The drill press arrived on July 9, 2004. The driver was helpful off-loading it, and I proceeded to set it up. At 5'-7"" and 130 lbs I was still able to assemble it by mounting the head while the column was on the floor, bolting the base to the mobile base and tipping it up. Overall the quality of the castings and machine work was good. Installed a forstner bit and drilled a couple of holes. While the holes came out fine, it was not very smooth running. Further examination revealed a lot of belt dust and pulleys that were not aligned. I aligned the only adjustable pulley (at the motor) to the idler (center pulley). Vibration was less but still unacceptable. The idler puller was at an angle to the main spindle pulley. Delta service offered to send a new crank arm but after checking that it was not the problem. The bore for the crank arm was drilled out of vertical. Delta service wanted me to take the head to the nearest service center and have it rebuilt. Called Amazon, they ordered a new one. Two weeks later the replacement arrived. I carefully removed the shipping bands, opened the box and tipped up the head to check the pulleys. Sure enough, same problem, only worse ! Back it went. Delta has serious QC problem. There could be hundreds of these defective heads out there. I am going to buy either a Jet or Rigid press.

"The JessEm Tab-Loc Inserts are undoubtedly a great addition to the JessEm Router Lift, but I wouldn't know.

"The other reviewers are correct about the poor packaging and the actual item shipped. I received mines about 10 mins ago and I am immediately dissapointed. The bits are not the ""red"" bits advertised and one was rolling around loose in the plastic box they came in. Careful inspection revealed that the edges of both bits are chipped because of the loose bit making contact with the other while shipping. The broken chips are still in the box. These bits are now probably not as useful as they are supposed to be. I wish I could retun these but I live outside the U.S. and its a hassel to do such returns...",1.0

"The Jess-Em router lift is a true work of art. The machining is elegant and the fit and finish is impeccable. Which is why it's so sad to be saddled with this ring set. Some of the rings sit flat, while others are proud of the lift's machined surface. In the photos you can see the variation: one insert is about .005"" out, while the other is a completely unacceptable .015"" out. Given that the router lift is designed to raise in .016""  (1/64"") with a quarter turn of the handle, it's hard to understand why Jess-Em would cut corners on such an important part of their product.

Other competing options (General/Excalibur, for example) use phenolic plastic and then machine the plates flat. While more costly, this is a much more reliable manufacturing process than the injected plastic (made in China) that Jess-Em is using. I'll be returning these tomorrow; if I can't find a quality tab-loc ring that works with the lift, the lift goes back too.",1.0
"Sucks. I've called JessEm three times about this, and finally gave up. Two out of the four inserts I received aren't even close to flat. One of the replacements they sent me was even worse.

"Received the router bit on 12/21/2010.  I thought the product mixup from the previous review would have been corrected by now.  I still received the 2 cutter bit rather than the 4 cutter Quadra-Cut.  It appears it is a mix up from the Freud factory.  The packaging and the bit itself were both marked 99-003 which is the Quadra-Cut number, however the bit is the old style 2 carbide design.",1.0
"The first package amazon shipped me, wasn't the quadra cut bit, as is advertised on the website. It was a regular Freud router bit with only two cutting heads. The picture on the site clearly shows four cutting heads. So, Amazon shipped me another router bit. Again, the same bit, not the quaddra cut. As you may be aware, the Quaddra Cut Packaging, says Quaddra Cut, and has a yellow background this does not. It appears that they have either placed the wrong sku with the wrong product page, or they just can't seem to ship the right product, either way over a week and a half have gone by and I still have no router bit and will now have to rush order it from somewhere else.

"The item was shipped in a used box with no packing material - none whatsoever. The box was visibly and severely crumpled and the hard plastic packaging used by Freud to hold the router bits in place had come open. As a consequence, the router bits were damaged (the carbide tip was chipped).  I followed the procedure for the return policy, which provided an email directly to Turtle Tools. I sent two emails, however, neither email received a response.  I also called the phone number, however, the voice mail box was full. As the return policy is 15 days from receipt of the item, I decided to return the item to Turtletools using the address on the original shipping box. I'm out $10 for the cost of shipping the return.  Although the Turtletools return policy states that a Return Goods Authorization (RGA) must be included, they don't tell you where you can find one.  So I made one up that included all pertinent information.  The most disappointing aspect of this whole ordeal is that Amazon does not actively seek feedback on rogue vendors.  How can they maintain the public trust if there is no accountability for bad vendors?  There should be a link on their site to report incidents like this.  Not only do they not have a link, they don't even provide you with a telephone number to report problems. I'm still waiting to see if either Turtletools or Amazon will step up and resolve the situation.",1.0

I guess they want Freud to provide better packaging. It's a shame. I guess I'll have to buy somewhere else.",1.0
i can't evaluate the quality of these bits. They arrived damaged for both the original order and the replacement. It's so easy for Amazon to fix the problem but they don't do it.

"I was all ready to purchase this bit set and read the reviews.  Based on these reviews, there are three losers:

1) Freud --- they just lost a sale
2) Amazon --- they just lost a sale
3) Me --- I can't purchase the product that I want at a good price.

Amazon shipping is still pitiful.  I have made over 100 orders with Amazon, and my shipping and packaging history could fill a book.  Hmmm ... maybe I can write a book entitled, ""When Getting it Right the Fist Time is Not Worth the Cost""

Amazon has ALWAYS made it right by shipping out replacement merchandise.  But they really should get it right and learn how to use more than ONE piece of tape on boxes that are always oversized and poorly packed.

UPDATE: 2/26/2007
I broke down and ordered the set and it just arrived ... the unit arrived intact .. which was quite a surprise.  There were two extra pieces of tape on the blister pack, so it seems that all this negative feedback may in fact be helping Amazon to get it right.  The set is black not, not red as shown in the pictures.  I have no doubt that it will perform as expected -- if not, I can always update this review.

Since I can't update the rating for some reason, I'll just state that it is up to a 4.

UPDATE: 3/5/2007

I used the bits a few days ago.  Really slick. There is a range of cut sizes for the width. I would think that it should be documented.  I'll document the slot width range next time I get out the paperwork.

I am glad I took the chance and ordered these.",1.0
"I purchased the Bucket Boss model 06009 jumper cable bag based on reviews that said it could hold a heavy duty set of jumper cables.  WRONG!  This bag is definitly smaller than I anticipated.

The Bucket Boss model 06100 bag might do the job since it appears to be larger, but check before you buy.  Since mine only cost about $11, it isn't worth the hassle of returning.  I'm sure I'll find some use for it.",1.0

"I imagine that Freud will be offering this set as a reconditioned item in the near future, judging from all those who have received chipped cutters due to the packing issue.  Like others, I too received these bits in a box where the bits had come out from their indivual packaging and were allowed to bang into each other.  And yes, they were chipped!

I have liked dealing with Amazon in the past, but fail to see how they can continue to offer low prices when they continue to not learn from their shipping mistakes.  While many prior shippments have arrived in good condition, this will be my fourth package that was not packaged properly -- two of these were NOT Amazon's fault, as they arrived in the  manufacturers' had packaging.  But Amazon certainly needs to pay attention to how they are sending these bits -- especially when you consider how dangerous it could be using a router bit that has a crack in the carbide.  Let's not have someone injured because of this...

*** Update *** Just received replacements for damaged bits.  You guessed it -- they arrived exactly as the original order, DAMAGED!  Absolutely NO attempt had been made to package these bits in a way to prevent such damage.  What a waste of both time and money for both Amazon and the unhappy customers.",1.0
"Like some of the other reviews, my order arrived with the two bits unrestrained in a box that is way larger than necessary, resulting in chips to the carbide cutters.  A simple wrap of tape around the manufacturer's retail package would have kept it from opening and freeing the tools.  I've reordered but expect that once again I'll have to return them because the likelyhood of the actual shipping location will not get my comments included with the reorder.",1.0
"Bit Set is fine, but whoever designed the packaging should be FIRED!!  Amazon was great about sending a replacement.  Arrived with the two bits rolling around loose in the box in *both* shipments. Bubble Pack has no permanent seal.

Someone needs to let the manufacturer know their packaging is defective.  Amazon???",1.0
"I will begin this review by stating that this is my only disapointment with Freud brand Bit's to date and I would rate it a negitive 1 if it was an option . The first issue is  that the over all height is short by a minimum of 1"" to use with any kind of sled or carriage to safely guide the front and side drawer pieces. Freud warns to collet the bit a minimun of 80%, and I agree. But with a mere two inchs in length and half of that securred in the collet, there is not much height left to work and adjustments or clearences. The remaing height between the top of the collet and the top of the bit will barely allow the use of 1/2"" stock. Don't even think about 3/4"" material or working with safety jigs such as a sled or a vertical carrage. To use this bit without a sled or a carrage is awkward at best and dangerous just the same.

The second issue is that Freud does not include any set-up min / max suggestions.

Finally, do not....use this with laminated stock such as Baltic Birch or red oak plywood.  Any cross grain cutting will ruined the material.

I will eat this experience (time, raw material, purchased price and shipping) and the bit will forever collect dust unless Freud will accept it back. I will go back to using reliable pocket screw and glue methods for now and seek more dove tail education.

"It's a very good hammer, the light weight makes it easy to swing all day especially if your doing hardware or any kind of strap work on a rough framing project.

Edit: after 2 months of rough framing with this hammer I have to say I'm deeply disappointed it let me down in every aspect and it's safe to say this hammer blows. Face went smooth and is virtually useless I guess I have an over priced finish hammer now

Pros: light weight, titanium, absorbs shock well.

Cons: face goes smooth ridiculously fast, claws chip easily and crack.

Titanium is an overrated trend going on right now mainly promoted by retired carpenters or the self proclaimed framers who are actually weekend warriors or over enthusiastic do it yourself guys. The matter of the fact is titanium is over priced and not worth it especially with all the ""save your elbow"" crap going around. If you're elbow is truly that important you can always switch to a 19oz Vaughn which is still very generous to your arm. For framing and form setting or any kind of job that requires to to be banging in nails every day or doing something that constantly requires the use of your hammer, stick with steel!

"I picked this hammer up from a trade-in program at a local hardware store. ""Give us your old framing hammer & get the Stiletto for $50"".

The first month was spent connecting new framing to an old house built in the '20s so I had to use the cats-paw quite a bit. Within a month the head became so loose I had to stop every 10-15 swings and reseat the head. Also, the cats paw wore off the waffles in that time. Not what I'd expect from a $100+ hammer.

When I tried to swap the hammer out for a new one, Stiletto balked, claiming that the head came loose because I had replaced the handle with one that wasn't OEM. I had never replaced, modified or altered the handle in any manner.

After several weeks of hmmming & hawing, Stiletto sent me a new hammer free of charge with INSTRUCTIONS this time warning me not use the hammer to strike chisels, cats paws, or nail sets as this would void the warranty.

I had a similar one on my other saw and it worked fine. this one doesn't stay in the rolling position, the red plastic flaps keep on popping back in the fixed position and I can't do anything about it.
they put some kind of silicone grease where it makes contact with the metal. I that I took off thinking it would make it less slippery and stay in position... wishful thinking  !!
piece of junk.

edit:  see pic, it shows how the metal bracket bent when the red flaps pop out of lock  all the time. The weight of the saw, quite low actually, slams on it and deforms it. Also, only one side of the red flap presses down on the bracket, which in turn limits the efficiency of the locking system.

used it one time for my table saw that is well below the limit. Took two hours to put together an adjust and mount saw onto. when I tried to move the table saw back the next day both plastic foot pieces snapped off...  after reading reviews I see others have the exact same issue.,1.0
No luck at all with this crown stapler. The stapler skips every other time. Not recomended .,1.0
"A) No assembly instructions included, just a 3"" x 3"" diagram with a brief paragraph next to it B) The fastening hardware was rolling lose in the box because it's bag was even made of cheap thin plastic (at least they are consistent) C) One of the two welded tabs for attaching the feet on the base was separated from the unit when I opened the box due to a terrible weld. This thing has about as much chance of safely supporting 500 lbs as my 13 month old daughter. I almost never buy something from Amazon that makes me feel ripped off, but this Chinese junk broke my confidence. After assembling the unit (cussing the entire time) I had to spend another 30 minutes trying to get it broken down and back in the box for a return. Thank god Amazon takes such good care of the customers. I can't imaging being out $60 for this thing. Honestly, I think this is my most disappointing Amazon purchase ever. Please don't waste your money or time.",1.0

"Big mistake -- I saved $20 from the cost of a Jet 708118, an item I bought last year  for my table saw. After spending 2 1/2 hrs assembling the HTC base, a process that was not helped by the minuscule schematic provided and the bazllion nuts & bolts required, I am thoroughly dissatisfied.

The HTC product is simply not worth the effort.",1.0

"This base model actually lifts the entire tool and then abruptly slams it to the floor when you disengage the wheels.  It is worse the heavier the tool that is on it.  One of the wheel lifts on the one I had and returned stopped functioning after about 10 uses.  Also the base comes in a box completely disassembled, so be prepared to put it together.  This is not a great option, you are much better off spending the $30 more for a HTC-3000 base imo.",1.0
"I bought this for my Powermatic table saw at a new shop I was building out. Assembled the base, set the saw on it, set it in a corner, with the wheels locked, for a month while other construction activities were completed. When were ready to set it in place, we unlocked the wheels, and one of the plastic pieces that locks the wheel snapped off. It is now useless. Closer inspection and it just looks like more crap from China. Would not buy again. Would not recommend. I'll build my own with industrial casters.",1.0
"I got a 3 pack of the DeWalt countersink drill bits last year and I love them, use them all the time.  I dropped the 9/64 bit and it broke so I ordered a replacement.  The replacement was not square.  When I put it in the drill and turned it on, it slightly wobbled.  I checked it with 2 other drills and they both wobbled.  I then put it on the countertop to verify and yes, the drill bit was slightly bent.

Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement and the new bit came back with the same problem.  I wonder if Amazon got a bad batch from DeWalt.

My other 3 DeWalt countersink bits are straight as an arrow and work like a gem.",1.0

These countersinks are very poorly made: three in a row came out of the package with a strong wobble and we haven't opened more yet (I bought a bunch at a time.

The stand is nice enough but I KNOW that it will handle a 500 Lb. machine.  I put a 440 Lbs. planer on it and the first time I tried to move it the plastic ears that provide the fulcrum action for the wheels both snapped.  The 440 Lbs was shipping weight of the planer and I don't even have the outfeed rollers mounted on it yet so I'm expecting it's closer to 400 Lbs. in its present form.  Who would engineer a mobile stand that uses plastic levers to engage the rollers?!!  Total waste of money.,1.0

I should have stayed away for a heavier planer. The lever broke after one day, I removed and replaced the lever. But now both lever release every time i try to move it, making it impossible to move. Now, I cant tell you the words I say every time I (try to) move the machine.  I will be purchasing a better unit soon to replace both of mine.  (if anyone wants mine I'll give you a great deal....lol)",1.0
Broke the first time I used it. Amazon would not return the item,1.0
The base works as advertised.  Both of the orange lift levers (made of plastic) shattered the first time I tried to use them to move the drill-press that I bought the base for.  Why the manufacturer thinks that plastic levers will stand up to the pressure placed on them under heavy load is a mystery.  Very cheap and I would not buy this base again unless the levers were made with steel like the rest of the base.  Very unhappy.,1.0
"I cannot recommend this product if you are using it for a power tool that is substantial. I used it for a 14 in bandsaw total weight, and I did weigh it, of 323 lbs.

I will just fabricate a METAL lever that will replace the PLASTIC piece of _______ (fill in your own word). At least the one that I used on another tool still is working, But it's total weight is 147 lbs. only time will tell, but i'm not expecting much.",1.0
"Purchased this base in March 2013 for a 14"" Jet bandsaw. Assembly was OK but within a year one of the plastic levers had broken. The second one broke a couple months later. So, as others have pointed out, the plastic foot operated levers do not hold up.",1.0
"I used this for my 14"" Delta bandsaw (~225lbs) and it was a waste of time and money. It is flimsy and does not sit level so the bandsaw now wobbles. Furthermore, the first time I tried to use the mobile base to move the bandsaw, one of the cheap plastic levers snapped off. The very first time! I'm under half of the weight limit for the stand too. I immediately threw it in the trash as it is too flimsy to even use as scrap steel. You have been forewarned.",1.0
"Plastic piece broke 3 days after we could no longer return it. We purchased this at the same time as the 256 pound bandsaw that we wanted to put on it. The bandsaw delivery was delayed by several weeks so we just got the tool onto it 2 weeks ago.

"I've had the HTC-2000 base for seven months now. I have a 350 pound table saw so I thought that a 500 pound rated mobile base would be sufficient. I was wrong. Today while trying to raise my saw, both foot levers broke. The cam portion of the plastic lever failed. Poor design and choice of materials. Even though I would lift up on the saw to take the weight off the cam lever, the cam flattened so much that the lever will not raise the base. Plastic parts where metal should be. I had noticed each time I raised the base that it was getting more difficult. Now I know why. Every time I engaged the foot levers part of them would wear away. Trulely disappointed. Wasted $60.

"I ordered this machine for two reasons. 1. To plane boards and 2. to make molding. I run a small cabinet shop and thought it would be nice to have the second ability. The planer performs its function as a planer poorly at best. There is very evident snipe on both ends of the boards that pass through. Being that this was the primary function of this machine in my shop it was very disappointing. After more than a dozen adjustments per the manufactures manual,  through experimentation, and the recomendation (singular) of Jet tech support it could not be adjusted out. After further inspection it was found that the planer's table actualy had 1/32nd to a 1/16th of an inch movement vertically on the infeed end and outfeed end. I figure that is the reason for the snipe on every pass. The other major disappointment of this purchase is Jet technical support. Don't bother calling them for help. I asked about the snipe problem and they answered ""yeah, all of these machines do that"". When they were told about the movement in the table they had no response and had to go find an engineer to find an answer. I had no response in 3 days, and had to call them back to try to get an answer. But there was no answer except that the guy who knew about this was away from his desk and they would need to call me back. This was 2 days ago. Maybe I received a machine that was built on Friday right before quiting time? I would not recommend buying this machine to anyone at this point. If you want a planer, buy a planer. If you want a molder, buy a molder. But don't buy this planer/molder.",1.0

"I've owned the Jet 12"" opend stand band saw for about a year now and have had nothing but trouble with it.  I find it almost impossible to keep proper tension on the blade.  It's either coming loose and allowing the blade to wander or its throwing the rubber treads off the upper and lower wheels.  My sense is that this is strictly a ""hobby saw,"" capable of handling only thin stock.  My problems always arise when I'm cutting stock 3"" or more in thickness.  The disappointment is that I spent $... more than I would have to buy the low-end Delta, but am not getting anything more in performance.  My advise is to either buy a cheap 10"" or pay ...[more]+ for a 14"", but avoid this overpriced disappointment.",1.0

"The base's design is pretty bad.  As soon as you put anything on it with a bit of weight, the foot levers are unusable.  You have to pretty much attempt to lift the tool yourself while trying to depress the foot levers so that you can move the tool.  I've tried it with my full-size drill press and then tried it on my much lighter bandsaw, both of which were apparently too heavy for the foot levers to work.

If you're looking for a roller base for a storage bin, this item is for you!
If you want to use it for any other purpose, look elsewhere for a better design!

Pros:
It rolls and holds something

Cons:
You can never get the foot pedals to depress so that something can roll around.",1.0
"I bought this for my Jet bandsaw that is well under the advertised weight limits for the stand.  The stand is cheaply built. The instructions are just shy of useless. It comes with cheap plastic wheels and a plastic foot lever that raises the whole unit. Just two stops (not wheel brakes) that are supposed to hold the whole unit. There is no way the plastic parts will last. It took me longer to assemble the stand than the bandsaw setup did.

"***  NOT A SET OF BITS ONLY ONE #8 TAPPER BIT  ***

"When I assembled this unit i was extremely disappointed about how it functioned.  While the casters, wheels, and frame were all good quality, the basic functionality was poor.  Basically, when you pushed the orange pdals to engage the casters they did not raise the unit sufficiently.  There are leveling adjusters to combat this, but they don't provide the range necessary.  In order for the casters to prop the machine up sufficiently for it to wheel around, it would have to sit unlevel when the pedals are disengaged.

I restored an old Parks planer and the footprint fit none of the dedicated bases

Unlike the dedicated bases, the fixed wheels have no brake on them.  THe machine rests on two small rubber pads and the wheels when ""stationary"" and that does not work out well.  The base is prone to movement as there is insufficient locking mechanisms- if this base had brakes it would be a nice option for odd pieces of machinery.",1.0

"It took me aprox. 1 hr. to assemble this mobile base. It is made of angle iron with 1"" spacer holes, to adjust to many sizes. Perhaps if you were to use it for a lightweight Craftman machine, low slung & lightweight, this would be the appropriate base. This came as the optional accessory for the Powermatic Hollow Chisel Mortiser, which by the way, weights 277lbs. It stands 61""tall & is extremely top heavy. A 1hp motor adorns the crown, a fine machine it is.
This base rides on 4 wheels, the front 2 have a joke of a alluminum cam to raise the machine off the two front screw-in rubber tipped stabilizer legs which were difficult to adjust to level the machine when in use. The swivel wheels had to be turned just so, or the machine was unlevel. When the cam was activated  to lift the base off the stationary legs & allow the wheels to move, it was 1 1/2"" higher in the front then the rear. I found this most unnerving & unssafe. I called the manufacturer HTC & they agreed with me. This was not the proper base. Either the JMB-14CS or HSG 436 are well made, welded bases.

In the past, I had been so disgusted with various non-Stabila levels (particularly M-D, or Mecklenburg-Duncan)  that I once threw one (a M-D) into a freshly poured concrete retaining wall  for additional reinforcement. When you pay that kind of money for a Stabila  level, the idea of purchasing a case to protect it is very tempting. Over  the years, during various promotions at various supply houses, I have  received cases free with my purchase of Stabila levels. Well, save your  money. Just pulling out the level and replacing it at the end of the day  wore out the inside of the case within two weeks, and I was very careful.  The exterior of the case fell apart almost as quickly and the zipper wasn't  far behind. The nylon became very brittle so there was no way of repairing  the case. Very disappointing for a company that is known for a fabulous  product line, unsurpassed in quality and without question the best in its  field. I suggest what carpenters and many others such as tile setters do -  buy a 3"" or 4"" diameter 4' to 8' length of ABS (or PVC) pipe, cap  one end and put a threaded adapter with a threaded cap on the other.

"There are very few choices of a ceiling light with a pull chain.  This one seemed like it would be fine.  However, the picture is deceptive.  The fixture hangs in a way that you see the bare 60 watt bulbs from just about any place in the room unless you are standing directly beneath the fixture itself.  Who wants to look at bare bulbs? I would suggest you save your money and the effort of installing it.  Look elsewhere.",1.0
"I did not like these lights, I didn't like the base to mount them, they don't line up with any holes, it the whole experience was a waste of time and money for me. I bought four of them, so in effect I donated over $100.00 to support a mass producer of junk, just to enable a trusting customer to have to store them in the basement someplace with the rest of my junk.

After my experience with the two that I had working in the back of the house on a dimmer switch started sparking and smoking one day, I removed them all, and I'm quite reluctant to use any of the rest of them again, so they'll remain stored in the basement.

I do not recommend them!",1.0
"Intermatics design, which works with dozens of little on/off triggers, doesn't function as you'd expect. i.e. push one trigger in for on, push another trigger in for off. That approach makes your device turn on and off willy-nilly. Instead you push in as many adjacent triggers as you like to create the duration of time you want the device on.

Yes, it's certainly one way to do it, but it strikes me as a baffling choice to physically map a reversible operation (on/off) this way.

Each time you override the timer with the switch, the timer dial rotates one notch and your schedule begins to creep forward. So the timing just gets more and more screwed up. duh. This ain't rocket science guys.",1.0

"6 Foot folding rule is one of the most necessary tools for my trade. I had bought a case of them to give to apprentices in 2009. All were distributed and I held 2 for myself. I wound up breaking the last one this past summer. A friend gave me his. I noticed the quality was horrible, I thought it was a knock-off version of a Lufkin rule. Lose joints(folds when trying to extend more than 4 pages), very light lamination, slipping/catching extension, this couldn't be the same device I've used my entire career. To my dismay I was incorrect, it was actually a Lufkin. Also removed was the ""Made In USA"" printed directly on rule. So I called Apex Tools and asked why the quality was so low and where they were made. After about 15 minutes I was told they were being made in China and Mexico as the young lady apologized for the poor quality. So now I'm heartbroken and looking for a good replacement, hopefully made in the USA, and if not possible at least something either very cheap (as this piece of junk should be) or of very high quality. At least now I know to avoid any Apex Tools.",1.0

The first segment is a full 1/16th inch short!
The slider doesn't even line up with the end.

"First thing that tipped me off was out of the package, it would not lay flat on a bench, when fully closed.  I pulled out the extension rule, it was not straight.  It is not a solid brass bar, it is a thin ""U"" joint strip of warped metal.

When I extended the ruler around three feet long, one of the hinges wouldn't hold.  Other hinges are also loose, and some are so tight it will snap soon.  You are supposed to oil the hinges, but then the unit would just collapse.

It says assembled in USA of foreign components, it may as well be made in China, because there is no quality control, but then again almost all tools are crap these days, nothing is made to last!",1.0
"Bottom line: I carried around a Craftsman folding rule for over 18 YEARS !! without a problem.  Occasional oiling of the joints and keeping it clean was all I did.  I finally dropped it off a roof and broke it in two.  Sad day.

I replaced it with a Lufkin and it wasn't in service for two weeks before the non-slide end snapped off at the hinge.  Thinking this was possibly due to me somehow, I replaced it with another one from the same source.  THIS one developed a loose joint (probable broken spring) within two months of purchase; I can twirl it around, no grab whatever.

Whatever quality Lufkin may once have had, it appears to be gone now.  I won't be buying any more, that's for sure.  I'm hoping Craftsman still makes 'em the way they used to.",1.0
"An extension rule is the best for carpentry.  I have one that is over 20 years old and works beautifully.  Decided I needed another and bought 2 of these Lufkin rules.  They looked fine but do not work.  The metal extension sticks and must be forced to extend.  You cannot get an accurate measurement if the slide does not move very smoothly.  I have noticed that many tools no longer work.  We seem to be in an era of ""looks like, but isn't.""

Since Lufkin is willing to sell this terrible non-working product, I would beware of their other products.",1.0

"We used this timer for our 30 gallon 120 v water heater. Works great. You set the time for it to turn on and off each day. Simple to use. This is a hard wired timer not a plug in type.

Update: Jan  13, 2016.  Have had this timer since May. It stopped keeping time.  Dealing with customer support is a joke. You have to sign up for an account  online with a user name and password, then fill out your problem then download a form and FAX it back to them.  Who has a fax anymore. It has wasted several hours today and still the timer that runs our water heater does not work.  It seems to be they are making it hard to discourage people from filing a claim.

They have the WORST customer service I have ever dealt with and that is saying a lot.

We paid extra to get what we though was a good dependable timer to run our water heater.  We paid an electrician to install the timer so we will have a added expense to replace the defective one.

At lowes we saw that they carry the replacement clock for the timer, it costs more than the whole unit and it says something that the only part they stock is the clock.  Very disappointed not to mention I had to take a cold shower.",1.0

Now that I placed the back the old one everything is back to normal. I wanted to replace the breaker because the old one has the plastic housing broken and does not attach firmly inside the electrical box. The old one is also a Siemens 200A type QP breaker so it's not about the brand but about a defective unit. Had to return it and look elsewhere.",1.0

But it has only taken several months for the grinding noise to return almost as loud as with the first time.  It works as a timer as billed!  but since it was purchased to be quiet, it has failed.  And since it has failed so quickly, I will be looking for brands other than Intermatic to replace it.",1.0
"I purchased this in May of 2013 to replace a pool timer that lasted 15+ years.  Worked great til July of 2014.  It started by not turning off via the trippers.  Most tips online said the tripper was likely bent and needed to be replaced.  I bought new, genuine trippers and compared them to the existing ones - none were bent but I installed the new trippers anyways.  It worked once or twice.  So I decided to watch it attempt to turn off.  The off tripper moved the 'manual lever' all the way to the off position like it is supposed to, yet the pump was still on.  The contacts never opened.  I found that if I operate the 'manual lever' it turns the pump on and off - but only if you move the 'manual lever' quickly.  If I move the 'manual lever' to the off position slowly (like the timer dial would) the pump would not turn off (contacts would remain closed).

I called intermatic customer support and he literally had no response, other than you need to buy a new timer.  (couple months out of warranty)  I verified this timer is well over rated for the pool motor it is used for.  I took the timer out and the contacts in the back are clean - not pitted or dirty.  The mechanism just doesn't toggle the contacts open when operated slowly.",1.0

I've tried contacting the seller twice and they won't respond back then I tried to return it and they want $6.90 for me to just return it. I paid $16.01  for a plastic piece light that comes with no bulbs that when you move the handles where the lighting goes the screws become loose and it looks like it's going to break. it is pretty much garbage.

"Is chinese garbage now. Still turns nuts, but no where near as nice as the tool was when it was made in USA. bruised my knuckles a few times as the tolerance of the sliding jaw is worse now and there is a higher chance of rounding a bolt if you're not exactly set on the right size, which is never done in practice.",1.0

At 4 1/2 inches long and a 1/2 inch working capacity (I can completely cover them with two fingers lol), they are much more suited for a child's toolbox. I'll keep them and eat the dozen dollars, though I'm sure Amazon would refund without question. It's not worth my time. Having ordered dozens of items from Amazon, this is the only time I received an incorrect item.",1.0
"I normally read 1 star reviews to find problems that may be showstoppers for me. The showstopper here is the T104 model timer has a hole in the door and is NOT weatherproof.  It cannot be used outside in locations exposed to the weather, such as the on/off control for a swimming pool pump.  I urge the seller to make this clear in the product description. I should add, Intermatic makes outstanding products (including other models with nearly identical names that are weatherproof).  Also noteworthy, the seller delivered this timer without problems.",1.0

"These are complete junk. Like many others have said, these work properly for 1 day to a few weeks and then just quit. They will turn on during the day but not in the dark (very useful). They will turn on and stay on all night. They won't respond properly to toggling the power switch to go into, or out of, manual mode. They will work in Test mode but not in any of the real modes. Or they will just plain die. If you like grilling in the dark or tripping on your way into the house, these are the product for you. I have replaced mine for the 4th -- and last -- time.

"i have a old 12 inc crescent wrench that the screw adjuster is worn out. Went in to see about a new one and was told to call a 1-800 number. The woman on the other end said that Crescent has never had a lifetime warranty. I have taken there products in to the hardware store where i bought them in the past and they just handed me a new one. She told me if I got 20 years out of it, it was done. I told her so what if it were a Craftsman or Sk or Snapon they would just hand me a new one. I guess since Apex has taken them over and moving it all to china you can now write these off as a quality made USA tool.  Don't waste your time on one of these get a Craftsman which comes with a lifetime warranty not to mention a tighter tolerance on the jaw and a thinner wrench to get into tight spots.",1.0

The first one died when the mechanical on/off would not engage during the second year of use.

The replacement was no better as the timer wheel stopped turning also in the second year of use.  I'll be replacing this unit tomorrow and it won't be with another intermatic product.

These timers are not cheap and to have to replace them whenever you need to use them is ridiculous.

"I had this piece of junk for almost 2 months when both pins fell to the bottom of the clock face. I called the company where a man told me ""your story doesn't add up"" ""it doesn't make sense"" ""we've never had this problem with this unit before"".

I asked him if he was trying to imply that I was lying to him and he said yes.

There overall lack of concern was stunning. They didn't bother to offer to replace it, send new pins, or anything. Complete lack of concern for the customer.

This unit was professionally installed by an electrician who has installed these timers before, and since calling him about it, he informed me this isn't the first one he's heard about doing this regardless of the lies the company was trying to get me to believe.

So I ask you, who would stand to gain the most by lying here?

I don't suggest you purchase anything from Intermatic, Inc. They won't stand behind their product and are rude to their customers.",1.0
"Don't buy it! I would give a ""0"" star if I could. Please take my words for it as I am not writing this review in anger. I just do not want you to waste $20. This is not a good deal for the following reasons:
1. Cheap plastic. May be it was my mistake thinking it was metal since I did not read anywhere in the ad. I could have missed it.
2. No bulbs. You almost have to use very expensive flood light bulbs to prevent lights shining on the unit's sensor (manual advises against that.)
3. No base. They told you that by-the-way, you need a junction box too (not included!) I had to make a trip to Home Depot to buy one for $6.
4. All the screws enclosed are too short to connect to the junction box. I had to search my tool box high and low for screws and ended up with  screws of different heads and color. The finished product looked awful and I am not at all happy.
5. Worst of all, it advertised 130 degree coverage; it was more like less than 90 degrees. That is what I got, I tried test walking around the light for hours and could not do better, neither would you.",1.0

"It took me 2 1/2 months to finally have the time and install this product, and as you can imagine now I have to deal directly with the manufacturer.
After connecting it; it didn't even work once. Tried different light bulbs, tested the line to make sure there was electric flow, tested different power sources and still nothing.
Product is a typical poorly made and designed product (of course ""Made in China""). Nothing new. In the process now of return it to manufacturer. STAY AWAY!!",1.0
"I used small bulbs in this thing and they still weigh a ton more than the actual unit. It's a low-quality pressed plastic, and very fragile and prone to breaking in the sun, or if you breath on it too heavy. Don't get me wrong, it works... and it's cheap, which is cool. The lower screw on the motion detector pivot can be tightened, but I don't why because it doesn't affect the tightness of the motion box. So in short time if you have it tilted up and it wears, as everything does... it will not adjust where you want it.

I would not recommend this unit unless you are really pressed on budget and just want something short term.",1.0
"I am an electrician and I installed quite a few of these flood lights around my house. I believe the motion sensor is not sealed properly - once water gets inside they stop working. Sometimes they come back to life after a few days of dry weather. I had some success after applying silicone all around them, but overall, the reliability is spotty at best. Right now I am dealing with one that comes on at dusk and stays on all night even though it is set to come on only when it senses motion. I stopped by Home Depot and bought a Defiant motion sensor to replace the old Zenith. I hope it is not the same company with a different product name. I will never buy another Zenith motion sensor again. How hard would it be to protect the electronics from moisture? The cynic in me says they design them with a short life span on purpose, so you keep coming back to the $tore - that's a heck of a business model.",1.0
"Doesn't work very good!! I can't set the sensor low enough as if a leaf blows by 30 ft away it turns the light on!! I have a shed that someone tried to break into about 20 ft behind my home and I wanted it to turn on ""ONLY WHEN SOMEONE WAS IN THE BACK YARD""!!! not when cats or wind blows debris or dust around!! This thing was costing so much more in electric I had to shut it off!! Should have just spent the extra money and bought the Night Cameras that have masking, and at least they don't use a much electric as this thing does!!",1.0
"I'm posting this primarily because the current average rating is 4 star... really America?  Have your expectations for products really fallen that low?  If it had come with some sort of adapter that allowed it to fit a standard US junction box (which it didn't) and if the motion detector had worked flawlessly (don't know, couldn't get it installed), then I might have rated it 2 stars.  I bought an adapter at the hardware store for another $5 and it didn't fit that either.  This is the cheapest sort of plastic junk and not worth the ridiculously low price it sells for.  It might last a year or two in standard outdoor installations before becoming brittle and breaking into pieces.  Everything about it says ""fire hazard"" to me.",1.0

"This product and nearly the entire channellock line are terrible, the feel great and they look great, especially if they are with the set. I looked like a professional...for a little. These tools take dirt and grime and everything else to the handles like magbets, which isn't a big deal, I can live and work with dirty handles. My problem isn't even that the grips while extremely comfortable and large keep sliding off all the handles of the tools I own. Another strike but one I can live with.
My problem is they are made of a VERY soft metal, my diagonal cutters have had the last quarter inch of cutting edge squeezed flat on only one side, my screwdrivers all look as if I've owned for years, flathead's bend at tip from twisting, Philips have begun rounding, channellocks are torqued out, which I've never even heard of before, and my set of needle nose pliers cannot apply any kind of pressure towards the end without bending severly, the teeth like to offset each other constantly and the rivet is lose, I would accept that I was using these wrong if it weren't for the fact that every channellock rivet I have has don't the same thing, making my tools next to worthless. Now that's hard to swallow considering I bought hundreds of dollars worth of these tools and the years of faithful service they promise is actually months of questionable quality, will never buy these tools again as they have severly let me down, but this is not the worst part, I've tried contacting channellock several times over the last few weeks with absolutely no response which I feel is a slap to the face.
Bottom line these products look great, feel great, and preform spectacularly when never used and put in a storage box to be looked at, but if you need a tool you can depend on every day just keep looking.",1.0
"This product came with a soft element that kept bending with ANY reasonable pressure when soldering.  I had to purchase another element (extra cost) for acceptable service.

"The lights are terribly unreliable. I initially purchased 5, 2 of which were dead on arrival. Of the next 2, both worked. After a year, 2 of the remaining 5 stop working (stayed on all the time).

Of those 3, 2 work as they should, and the third works most of the time but occasionally goes into a mode where it quickly cycles on and off.

At least none caught on fire, so they're probably okay if you're planning on putting them in a Boeing airliner, but the average homeowner will probably want to avoid these.",1.0

The third one went bad recently and I ordered a new one from Amazon. Installed it in the exact same spot on the eve of the house, same wiring, etc. As soon as dusk came, the light came on and stayed on about five minutes. Went off. Came back on in a minute or two. Went off after the five minutes. Came on again. It does this over and over for no reason I can see.  There's nothing to cause it to come on. I tried all the settings and adjustments available. Same results. Sent it back and Amazon quickly sent me a another one. The next one would stay off a bit longer but would eventually come on, again for no reason. I sure was pleased with the first three and the service I got from them. Tells me these are not of the same quality as they were years ago. No more Heath Zeniths for me.",1.0

"I have no idea why these are priced so high. Especially when the fault tolerance during the manufacturing process on these is a joke.

I ordered 3 for a project and did it out of convenience as the rest of the items for the project were also ordered from Amazon. I should have read further into the reviews. All three were defective due to the threading in the plastic casing that turns the ""flaps"", securing the box on the inside surface of the sheetrock. After a few turns on the screws that engage the flaps, I noticed something was off. The threading on the plastic casing was WAY small in diameter compared the provided screws.

Instead of using brute force and potentially damaging the faulty Jbox's I went to my local hardware store and set up a return the Lamson B120R.
The local mom and pop Ace hardware (which is usually more expensive) sold a product that functioned properly & had identical specs @ $1.89 each. In OR, that is $5.63 for three boxes that actually work.",1.0

"I have purchased many of these old work boxes which all have the same flipper arm apparatus.  As of late (12/15 - 1/16) all the boxes, whether the cheaper all plastic or the plastic/fiber combo models have defective flipper arms.  The boxes themselves are fine.  It is the plastic used in just the flipper arm which is defective.  Even with minimum screw down tension (driven by hand) they break off.  Many break overnight and the next day the box is drooping out  of the wall.  Carlon has missed the boat on quality control and rendered their product useless.

Have reset it countless times. Also the pins bent.
 Have used two of this style of timer in the same location in the same house for over thirty-five years, so when purchased from Amazon, we had the expectation of no problems. The only option for support from Amazon is RETURN, which would mean the uninstallation and re-installation would be at MY cost.
I believe the problem is with the plastic black timer dial and the three (3) brass pins and (3) steel pins, which must be inserted into slots of the plastic to turn the timer on and off. Electrical interruption is not the problem, or other appliances would also go off. Have checked breakers and corrected the timer dial many times, yet this morning the shower was *lukewarm* due to the disfunction of Intermatic WH21 Electric Water Heater Timer. The machine works, but the timing control system is flawed.
We threw away the original box, because we have had two of these exact same Intermatic timers before and they worked perfectly for decades. Then there was a problem with old the timer and it flipped the breaker in the electric box. The timer on the old one stopped working. It would not turn, so did not change as hours passed.
There seem to be limited brand choices for water heater timers. Sorry, sorry, sorry I did not purchase from a local vendor who might offer Customer Service and Support. Suggest you check out other options. FYI, the pins on this model do NOT interchange with the sprinkler timer by Intermatic. This unit works, but must be turned on and off manually, if one does not want to pay charges for 24 hours of water heating, which adds noticeably to the cost of electric utility. Always the small bits are the killers, what a shame.  :(  UPDATE 10 March 2018: Timer wheel does not move at all. Timer must be turned on and off manually. Cannot recommend this product. We spent 50 bucks to have the same problem as the old timer that was replaced. See photos. The metal pins seem to be of softer metal than they were years ago.",1.0

Luckily, I was home and was able to shut off the power.  I smelled an electrical burning smell when I got up this morning.  I searched around and couldn't find it.  I smelled it a little later in the morning when I got back home and luckily checked this timer.  There was a little bit of smoke coming out of it.  I immediately shut of the breaker and inspected it.  Inside, everything was beginning to melt and burn.  This worked fine for about 6 months, and randomly decided to self destruct today.

"I have never had any issues with Channellock pliers until now.
 These new Channellock 460 pliers have production changes, They made the jaws wider which is good. But now the jaws do not line up together. In the closed jaw position one jaw end is longer then the other, And the jaws are shifted offset side ways.

 I have two other pairs of Channellock 460 pliers that I purchased about five years ago, The jaws line up perfect even after being used for years. The jaws have maybe 1/32"" of side play and they work 100%. The jaws are about 1/8"" narrower then these new production 460s, But at least they are aligned when closed.

The visual difference is; The new 460s are flat on both outside surfaces. The good older production ones are flat on the small side, On the longer sloted side the flat side of the jaw is ground inward about 1/8"".

 The new Channellock 460 pliers are junk!! even the rivet is not staked as tight,leaving excess slop and side shift.

 If you care about pliers lining up on the sides and ends of jaws,Don't buy these. I care about my work and excess marking on surfaces I work with, And my hands getting injured.

 I contacted Channellock by phone and email with pictures,They do not respond.

I purchased one new 460 from Amazon and when received it has these defects, Amazon was very nice and replaced them with another new Channellock 460.  The second Channellock 460 pliers are exactly the same,The jaws do not align on ends or sides.

"I had one of these for 20 years then the internal gears started slipping due to wear. So I decided to get another one because I was happy with the first one. From the time I installed the second one it lasted 2 months to the day, the timer quit and it wouldn't turn the water heater on or off at all. The first one was made in the USA. The second one I purchased was made in Mexico. At the present time I have the override activated.",1.0
Timer wasn't turning off. Had to tweak the fitting on the dial to catch the plastic pieces that would shut off the power to the water heater. Then checked with a meter and the light on the unit is off but still have power going to water heater.

I would agree with other reviewers whom question the longevity of this timer.
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this junk... read other reviews from ppl that waited past initial setup and 1st usage...
It astounds me when we all turn light switches on & off daily/hourly all the time and they work for life statistically,... however when adding a digital timer to perform the same action and function with the same contacts/connectors used in 120V household electric switching and receptacles - it fails after a short time from the very same heat/spark that exists in ALL switching making very little sense to me if adequate materials are used. Purchased this unit because my hot water needs are different on weekends and needed a 7 day timer VS a mechanical 24 hr ""daily"" timer.
Not impressed with the short life, nearly useless installation directions nor the trouble shooting at 3:30 AM tearing apart the water heater to finally trace back ""NO POWER"" from the timer. The timer panel will stay lit and make you think you have power which makes it kind of confusing... one would think the panel light would be on the other side of the coil, but...... NOoooooo! Lame

Update!  Tried another one for grins and it lasted less time and failed also....

The worst thing about this is when the power would go out when it was on.
If that happened when the power came back it would not turn off and over heat the water.

One of my puppies walked on the hot water and got burned.

"Edit 11/1/2015:
For what it's worth, I was able to fix the timer by taking it apart and repairing a solder joint on one of the relays inside.  So if you're electronically inclined and your timer has failed, you might want to check for that issue.

Edit 10/2015:
I'm downgrading my review from 4 stars to one because this thing just died at the ""ripe old age"" of 2-1/2 years!

I didn't misuse it... it was used exactly for its intended purpose, controlling a water heater.  But this morning we had no hot water, I did some electrical troubleshooting, and one of the switch contacts of the timer is open.  So I'll be buying a new timer... but not one from Intermatic.

Original review 4/2013:
The instructions were clear (for someone like me with some wiring experience), the unit was easy to install (likewise), and it works well.

"As a loyal Amazon customer, I take product reviews very seriously.  While the Intermatic WH21 got some negative reviews, I decided to purchase this for my water heater. Installation was straight-forward, but after running less than 1 hour, the timer dial became stuck and wouldn't turn anymore.  There seems to be some interference between the dial tripper and the case of the unit.  I tried for 1 hour to fix the trippers so it wouldn't interfere with the case with no luck. I went back on Amazon and read the 1-star reviews for this timer and saw many people had similar problems with theirs.  This model is definitely lower-grade compared to other Intermatic timers.  Fortunately Amazon has a fantastic return policy so I decided to return the WH21 and replace it with the WH40.  Here's why:

1. The WH40 is DPST meaning it switches BOTH legs of the 240V circuit.  The WH21 only switches one leg.
2. The WH40 is rated for 40 amps.  My GE 80 gallon water heater is dual 4500W elements which draw 18.75 amps.  While technically below the 25 amp limit of the WH21, the extra margin of 40-amp capacity should make the WH40 last longer.
3. The WH21 screw terminals are very small for #10 wire.  It was very difficult to get the #10 wire under the terminal screws. The WH40 has bigger screw terminals.

Spend the extra $13 and upgrade to the heavy-duty WH40.  You won't be sorry.",1.0
this only turns off half your water tank. leaves one element burning continuously! buy the spdp timer. waist of money.,1.0

"This was installed to control electrical usage for a solar hot water system, very good in theory but the the ""professionals"" who installed it put it in an inaccessible location in a vacation rental home. If the weather is cloudy you need to be able to override it or no hot water. Likewise you need to be able to replace the battery easily or when the power goes out it cannot keep time.
The LCD burned out after a year so it cannot be monitored or programmed.
If you use one for solar hot water control be sure it is easy to get at and people know how to use it, otherwise it is useless.

When I was done programing it, and let it do its work I noticed 3 hours later the time was off and the timer programs I had put in where erased. Because it has an AA batery, I installed a brand new one hoping this solved the problem.

Programed the timer again and the next day the same thing. The time was off and could not access the programing area beacuse it seemed frozen. I reseted, and placed it on manual and turned the heater on for 3 days and did not disconfigurate. After those 3 days, i programed the timer again and the same thing happend, lost all configuration. I called Intermatic and they were of no help. Started reading online for ways to solve the issue and some people say it's electric noise that scrambles the information.

This happened while I was on a business trip and my wife had to fix this problem at 455am.  I am not happy.

Worst of all, my house literally could have burned down very easily as a result of this matter.  My water heater is a 240V, 18.8A.

I am hoping someone from Amazon or Intermatic will contact me immediately to discuss this matter.",1.0
"DOA. This new unit was not able to pass through electrical current to the heater. This timer (for a water heater tank) was intended to replace an older similar timer, so the actual process of wiring was simple for the homeowner to follow. Also, I confirmed my install process with the manufacturer who said my method was correct. Their tech support person also added that when such electronic units sit for a long time in a warehouse, they are known for the electronic relay switches to ""stick"" in one position - not switch on and then off as the timer sends instructions. Even in the manual over-ride mode, we could not get current to pass through to heat the water. Amazon should check with such vendor to confirm the age or period of time from date of manufacture to date of sale. If such available units are old (as defined by the manufacturer's standards) then other units being sold via Amazon are prone to also be defective out of the box.

Update October 2012 - I kept my old timer that stopped working and learned it is a blown resistor.  I called Intermatic, Inc. and inquired about the type of resistor so I could fix it and keep it as a spare.  I was told by their technical support folks they couldn't tell me the specs. because the specs. are ""proprietary.""  Unbelievable! They don't want me to fix it so I'll have to buy a new one.

I emailed the company and got no response.  During my search, I have seen stainless steel versions of this prybar out there on Amazon also made in China, but I cannot understand why you would want to use anything but high carbon steel/spring steel to give the tool some flex...it would seem stainless steel would be more brittle and stiff but I'm no metallurgist.

I bought this product to replace the one that was installed in my bathroom but made too much noise. 6 month later and this one is making the same racket.

"Amazon's description is deceptive and fraud-based. The description clearly indicates that this fan has a 100 watt light and a 7 watt nightlight. You find out, however, upon receipt, that that option is only available on one of the 3 options, so the main description is, in fact, untrue. This fan, as shown, has a 100 watt light. There is no nightlight. If you wanted the product that is described, you would have to purchase a round light, which, if you read the reviews, is so noisy, that you have to shim the cover to keep it from rattling. So, the fan that is described, is actually quite a bit more expensive than the fan depicted.",1.0

never could get it on and the extra threads are to large or small.  to late to send it back.  stay with pur or one we know well,1.0
"When I received this product things worked pretty well, though I noticed many flaws that might lead to its eventual demise. Opening the box all was well until I noticed the bag with the cheap PLASTIC fittings to attach to the faucet. I have ordered many brands of filters and the ones that fail always have these plastic adapters that connect to the sink. From then on I knew it was on borrowed time. (-3)
There were various choices of these crappy fittings available to attach it to the sink though the instructions were so vague about which ones to use that you have to kind of have to do some trial and error to find the correct attachment for the sink in question. Speaking of instructions this filter pretty much just gives you the basic steps of ""take it out of the box, find the right adapter, then put it on the sink... voila!"" no real illustrations or contents of the box, nor how to go about assembly. speaks of laziness from the manufacturer. (-1)
So, I went to work putting the filter on the sink. Trouble was how to do it? I start by putting the adapter on first and then the metallic 'looking' nut screw thing (it wasn't metal, I found out later. just plastic that probably was 'plated' in a chemical bath), then put it underneath...well no that won't work... my mistake. try again.
I put the metal 'looking' screw thing on top of the crappy plastic fitting instead. no problem with that. Next is the part I dread, attempting to screw on the plastic fitting. it is no easy task as plastic threads don't have much holding power and I can do as much damage here by my own hand as the water can do later on. I try to screw it on gently, with no success. I then attempt to use, some moderate force, some success as it held on until I attempted to screw it, at that point it fell off. I persist with this for a awhile thinking to avoid using more force than necessary. After about an hour of struggling, my frustration boiled over and said you know what....screw it! I used as much force as I could to get it to hold on to the sink threads, first time no real success... did it again, and again and again! about 5 times then finally after an hour of giving it all I could muster it takes hold... hurray! exhausted I took a break.
5 minutes later, I move onto the actual filter assembly. fortunately, this part is easy and the metal screw thing easily screwed into their apparatus quite easily, though I noticed prior to doing this that their assembly itself was made of plastic threading on the filter itself, leading me to realize that the whole thing is just plastic in disguise!!! (I'd deduct more stars if it were possible)
Initially I had thought maybe there was some metal on this piece when I bought it, but the product description doesn't mention anything about plastic or metal so I had to take a gamble that maybe it was metal. Wish they would describe there product better though, I come to expect such deception from amazon dealers.
I put on the filter itself which is a cinch and called it good. ran water through it for 5 minutes to wash out the carbon granules and then used it.

the water itself is pretty fresh though I do notice some residual taste of lake water that we are supplied with. so maybe not completely filtered. the functions I bought it for was not simply taste related. it does seem to take away the minerals that I did want to filter out since some of them are not good. as well as any potential contaminates... this filter does leave behind some stuff as I noticed some stuff occasionally floating in my water bottles. its only so, so on the filter part might not recommend it to the elderly or those with a compromised immune system. It is comparable to Brita, Pur, and various other named brands. Culligan is much better with filtering in my opinion as I never so much as tasted or seen anything in the water coming out of their filters.
The filters do seem to last a bit longer than average. They do also have a greater flow of water, which is probably why it isn't filtered as well. They might have skimped on the compaction of carbon inside the filter for monetary reasons I assume. Every filter other than this one I have used has a slower flow rate since the compaction of carbon not only absorbs some of the water it also elongates the path taken by the water to get to the spout at the end. basically, its a good thing that it comes out slowly, it shows you that the water is being filtered properly. This brand doesn't do that.

After about 6 months of use, the moment I had been dreading happened. I put my hand on the faucet to turn on the water and noticed a second later that the assembly had slipped off into the sink. I try to put the adapter back in place but it was a no go... even after an hour of repeated attempts, nothing I could would make this plastic adapter hold on anymore. I took a peek at the threads inside the adapter. it didn't surprise me to see that there was pretty much nothing left inside, it was close to smooth inside if there was threads... they had packed up and left dodge.
This assembly now lies in a recycle bin where it belongs... at least the plastic itself doesn't have to go to waste. take my advice if its made of plastic don't buy it. You're wasting your money.",1.0
"Instapure was like the first brand to make this kind of filter.  It's OK but it's cheap.  Connection to the faucet dribbles water even though gaskets are used.  Water flow out the filter isn't smooth making it hard to fill a water bottle.  Likewise with the flow out the unfiltered spout....the water doesn't even flow out perfectly vertical, it's squirts somewhat to the side making you think there is something stuck inside inhibiting the flow.  Filter works well enough though.  Water tastes good.

Update 10/2014.  The gaskets failed and it started squirting water everywhere.  Tightening it more didn't help and I ended up stripping the treads.  This thing is going in the trash.  Instapure is not what it once was. Going to buy a Pur filter.  Look for my review on that.",1.0
"Plastic adapter fitting of amazingly poor quality cracked about five seconds after installation. Since it is a custom fitting, you cannot find a metal replacement, rendering the filter unit useless.

And unlike some filters there is no phone number to call if it doesn't fit. Instead the instructions say to ""contact your local hardware store"".

"Received this item 9-17-12. It Installed easily and worked flawlessly with no leaks...until today, 11-3-12. Today, I turned on the water and the entire mechanism fell into the sink. I tried, repeatedly, to re-attach the unit. It would leak profusely and then fall into the sink. The problem is the cheap plastic piece that fits into the faucet. The plastic has worn away. What really burns my britches is that I ordered the 4 filter replacement pack (which just arrived last week). So now I have a useless water filter system, but at least I have 4 replacement filters for it!!!

Maybe at one time this was a decent product, but no more. If the connecting piece from the filter to the faucet was metal instead of the cheapest plastic, maybe this would be worth it, but it isn't so avoid this product like the plague!!!

Update: This just keeps getting better and better. Turns out the seller has a 45 day return policy! Yay! Of course it's been 47 days! I guess I should change the title of the article to ""Worked Great for 6 weeks, long enough to be screwed thrice!""

Update 2: Contacted the manufacturer and told them of the problems I was having. The CR emailed me back and told me he would send a replacement piece. About two weeks later the part arrived and I re-installed the filter. So far it works but I feel it's only a matter of time before it fails again since the replacement part is the same plastic as the original part. We'll see. I'll upgrade my review to 3 stars and see where we are at again in a month. If it still works I'll upgrade my review.

Final update: Well back down to one star. The plastic piece lasted about a week and failed again. I'm giving up. TL:DR - If the adapter was metal, this would be worth it. Since it's not I can't recommend this product.",1.0
"I just received the filter in the mail today replacing a year old leaky brita filter, I had also tried pure filters which were also leaky and fell off after 6 months to a year.  After reading the man who replaced his 18 year old faucet I decided it was worth a shot.  So I received it today when I got home from work along with new replacement filters and went to town installing what looked like an easy install (and it was after a few tries) which is why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars.  So every washer combination I tried made the faucet leak.  Then I read no leaks with the right washers, July 7, 2009 By Klaus J. Wenger. Re-read the directions and thought for a while, then...it came to me and I hooked it up all over again once...and everything fell right into place with no leaks.

The only other reason I am giving this one star is there is no spray nozzle setting on the faucet.  Im sure there probably are on other models but not this one.  Oh well, still a great product and if put on correctly there will be no leaks at all and even though the fittings are all plastic if installed correctly the faucet will not fall off no matter how powerful the water flow.

very happy with this product after some minor setbacks in installation...now there are no leaks at all and I can turn the faucet on as high as it will go.

Purchased on Amazon

***Update Sept. 15 2012****

After having this product working perfectly for a while I woke up this morning and without hitting it or doing anything but turning on the faucet it started spraying like crazy.  Going over to the hardware store now to see if I can find metal connectors to replace the plastic crap used to build this thing.  This lowers my review to 3 stars maybe two if I cannot get it connected again.  PS the leaking caused the plastic connector to strip on my faucet.  How junky is this thing.

***Second Update Sept 15 2012****

This product is Garbage sent it back broke off the faucet after a week.  Couldn't get it back on plastic casings got stripped and would not fit correctly back on.  Be warned any product that tells you to go to the hardware store and get items for you should be weary of.  Dropped rating to a 1.  Too bad good filter and great tasting water just a junky faucet connection make this product horrible.",1.0
"Unfortunately, this is being returned because it will not in any way stay attached to the sink faucet. With their propriety faucet fittings, which are plastic, you are bound to use them, as nothing in a hardware store will supplement their poor design.

On the plus side, it did filter the water well--took out nasty tastes and odor.  As a test of our City water here, I sacrificed a couple of cheap goldfish--putting one in the regular tap water, and one in the Instapure filtered water. The City water fish lasted 2 days, while the filtered water fish lasted about week--before I just got bored with it and gave it freedom down the toilet. That test right there told me that the City water, albeit apparently safe to drink, killed things.

I wish the filter would stay on the faucet, but this is an inherent design flaw factor, and since I didn't even get a month's use out of it, I can't give it more than 1 star. Had I not been taking the time to keep re-installing the thing, I probably would have enjoyed more water from it.",1.0

My toilet actually leaked worse after installing this 555C.

If you are just repairing a slow leak around the flapper, skip this product, and try this: Get a new Fluidmaster flapper and add some weight inside the flapper hole (pennies, a rock, whatever) or use a water-safe glue to attach weight on the exterior of the flapper...

"I have used this kit on several toilet repairs over the last 10 years. I kept getting it because I found it has the best design for adjusting the length of flush over any other design I have tried. However, after reading Doug's review, I realized that all these years I have been struggling with the plastic chain problem and large hook problem exactly as he has described them.  If you don't want to risk running your well dry I suggest you avoid this kit until Fluidmaster replaces the plastic chain with a metal one.",1.0
"Fluidmaster makes some of the best valves for toilets on the market. In fact, Fluidmaster redefined the toilet tank water valve, did away with the old ball floats and gave us positive water shutoff, all in one compact  upright unit that will work without failure till the cows come home.
Some  major toilet manufacturers have adopted Fluidmaster valves for their  toilets. They must feel that they can't beat Fluidmaster at the valve game,  and so joined them.
This repair kit has some outstanding features. It  will fit ANY toilet tank. It has a little bowl attached to the flapper.  Full of water the bowl acts as a counterbalance and holds the flapper open  to allow a longer flush. You can even adjust the little drain holes in the  bowl to affect how long the flapper stays open. A very functional and  worthy feature, one that illustrates the inventiveness up there at  Fluidmaster.
Why, then, did this formidable hands-down expert on the  insides of toilet tanks add two parts to this assembly that would guarantee  the flapper would fail repeatedly and often? The parts are so incidental  that they could not affect the cost of manufacture at all. They are:
1.  The plastic chain that connects the flapper to the flush lever has coarse,  open links, and it FLOATS. So when the toilet is flushed and begins to  refill, the slack in the chain, busily floating around on the rising water,  often snags on things it encounters. It will even occasionally throw a loop  in itself. These events shorten the effective length of the chain and hold  the flapper open.
2. The large clip that attaches the chain to the flush  lever is much too large for the purpose. It is long enough to get flipped  over during a flush and hang the flapper in the open position. Another  defect in the clip is an end bent out to allow easy fastening of the chain.  That bent-out end often snags a link in the floating chain.
There are  many ways for this item to malfunciton, so it happens often -- once in 20  flushes at least! When it does, you have a wide-open water valve. Once I  left a toilet in this state undiscovered overnight and my water bill jumped  $40 that month. In all, I'd guess my excessive water costs laid to this  product's malfunctions have been over $200, easy.
So, if you take my  advice and avoid the Fluidmaster kit, what do you do? If your toilet is so  outdated that you can't find for it a flapper assembly made by Chicago or  someone else, it deserves to be retired. So do what I finally did and get a  new toilet.
The new 1.5 gals-per-flush toilets can be bought starting at  little over $100 (less than I've spent on water down the drain), and a new  toilet will make you smile every time you walk into the bathroom. You don't  notice how weary-looking something has become until it's replaced with a  shiny new one. You'll no longer have to work in this thing (and  malfunctions have a way of happening when you have company).
Most any  do-it-yourselfer can install a toilet -- a water line connection, two  hold-down bolts (replace with brass) and a wax ring. After installation,  adjust the filler valve until it fills almost to the overfill tube, thereby  allowing it to use another quart or two of water. These new designs throw  the water into a positive swirl to flush much much more efficiently than  the old kind, and do so with much less water. Another advantage to using  less water is that they refill in no time.",1.0

I will never but one of these again and Korky needs to trash this design and make something worth a Sh! t,
I switched to FlowMaster fill valves which are just as quiet, much easier to adjust the water level, and are lasting me years so far without a hint of a leak.  They have a sliding float design which is FAR superior than that of the Korky.

"It is a kind of product designed for particular situation, and for other situations, it probably has to be thrown to trash can if it cannot be refunded.

First, this is not just snap-in type of flapper, but it uses sticky water sealant ring to stick into, so if you don't do it properly, it is a design that could allow leakage.

Let's say you can do that properly. The flapper has to be installed so that it moves different angle than original way as it has its own hinge mechanism. So you need to find space in you toilet water tank that would allow the movement in a direction it is not designed for.

On top of that, it has a bulky timing cup attached on top of the moving flapper, so your toilet water tank has to have even more room, and because of this cup, you cannot just use flapper without the hinge the usual way.

In my regular size toilet, I realize that there is just no room with floater in the tank after I opened the package to try out. I am not sure if I can even refund it after I applied the sticky sealant ring and it would not come off easily. If you are worried about the space, do not buy it.

I tried to replace the old one because the old flapper tries to save water and prematurely shut off water, asking for 2nd flush consuming more water. Does toilet flapper have to be imported from Germany or some foreign country too? Can't they make a really functional one here? I would pay double the price if it really works.",1.0

Recently they all started to run continually. This itself was not noisy like refilling after a flush. But while traveling last week I received a call from my local utility informing me I had used about double the amount of water I normally use in a month. This was on the 14th of the month.

"I purchased this flush valve to replace one in a Toto Drake toilet that was approximately 2 years old.  The original flush valve was also made by Korky, although it had less ""bells and whistles"" than the new one.  After a couple of weeks, the new valve would not shut off (same problem as the old one).  It slowly kept letting water in.  I then replaced the cap/gasket on top of the valve.  This helped for a short time, but then the valve would stick closed after a flush, and water would not fill into the tank.  I would have to take the lid off the toilet and tap on the valve to get the water to run.

I try to buy products made in the USA, but unfortunately, made in USA does not always mean good quality.  Since I have had the toilet with this style of valve, I have done more work to a toilet than my entire life up to this point.

"FIrst set of 3 lasted about 5 years.  I liked them quiet, easy to install etc.  I replaced them all at once (3) with the same model.  In less than 1.5 years all 3 are now failing, They either do not fill and need a tap on the top with something hard like a hair brush or fill very slowly.  Again a tap on the top makes them function.  Very disjointed i am replacing them with  FLUID MASTERS versions  now.  The Fluid master is closer to the traditional design with a float that lifts a valve lever vs. a  air hole that,, once the water level covers it, closes a valve.

"Complete garbage - I will never buy another Korky product again. I bought two of these thinking it would be nice to have quiet valves since they're close to bedrooms.

"That's what we in the HVAC trade call 1"" pleated filters. And these, moreso. The denser they are, the worse they are. They restrict airflow, make it less comfortable in the house, cause liquid to slug back to the compressor (the compressor was never intended to pump liquid). washing the oil off of the bearings. They also reduce air distribution throughout the house.

They make you pay through the nose. $15 dollars a filter to reduce your all important airflow for distribution and compressor health? Highway robbery and outrageous!
If you have allergies or respiratory issues, go no higher than merv 8 (3M has their own rating system...this one is not merv 8).
If you don't have allergies, etc., order the old fashioned fiberglass ez flow filters. Your system will thank you, as will your wallet. And your house will be more comfortable.
Don't be fooled by the marketers. They're making a bundle off of your lack of knowledge. These are not 3 month filters. Again, they are compressor killers, and the more they load up with dust, the more lethal they become.

I should know. I've been in the HVAC trade for almost 40 years. Whenever I go to a house where I see a customer using these, I immediately pull them out. Within a day or 2, I drop off a case of the fiberglass to them. It's that important.",1.0
"Purchased from big box store in the summer of 2013. Started leaking about 1 month ago, and adjustment would not stop the leak. Valve would not shut off fully, causing the trickle down the overflow. This is trash! If it does not last even 8 months, it it worthless. Replaced with a cheap fluidmaster. Kooky, you should be ashamed to sell such worthless stuff!",1.0
not sure what the heck is wrong with these but they are terrible.  After a week or so they start to make noise when the ac turns on and off and its really annoying. I won't buy them again.  The ones from the store seem to work fine.,1.0
"I bought two of these about 6 months ago to replace leaking refill assemblies.  Both have failed.  The first one slowly leaked internally, right out of the box, never completely shutting off.  I replaced it with an identical one and it is doing OK at the moment.  Now the other one is doing the OTHER very common problem, the yo-yo on and off tank fill.

The best way to describe this problem is that during refill, the valve prematurely closes off, stopping flow momentarily, then restarts since the tank is not filled.  It does this until the tank is filled.  I closed off the inlet ball-valve that I installed partially which makes it fill more uniformly, but you hear a much louder flow of water since the line is restricted by the partially closed ball valve (cavitation noise).  The valve obviously cannot handle standard municipal water pressure.

I would never buy this company's refill valves again, especially after reading all the other problems reported by others.  0 for 2 is unacceptable.  It is only a matter of time until the other valve fails.

*** UPDATE:  The new, replacement Korky was bad right out of the box.  It would not shut off period.  I initially set it up per the instructions (and per code).  It refused to shut off.  I then tried adjusting the unit up and down a bit, and it continued to flow without ever shutting off.  No matter where or how it was set, the unit never shut off and water flowed in until it poured into the overflow valve.  I then took it completely out, reset everything from scratch, and it still would not shut off.

Completely frustrated, I brought it back to the big box store where I bought it and asked the Returns clerk if this brand is returned often in her opinion.  She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""This is the third one today.""  Enough said.  I installed the tried and true Fluidmaster, over $2 cheaper, no less, and it works perfectly.  I don't know why I went away from the Fluidmaster.  I've never had a problem with them, other than failure after about 3 years due to tank cleaners eating away at the rubber components, which they are all susceptible to.  I need to get another set of Kaboom-style bowl cleaners which put the chlorine directly into the bowl and not the tank.  However, the chlorine makes the plastic brittle on these devices, so its 6 of this and half dozen of the other, either replace fill valves & flappers, or tank cleaner widgets.  Lose-Lose in my opinion.

I like the fact that the Korky is made in the US, but this product does not speak very well for US quality control.  The count is now 1 out of 5 that worked.  I'm sure I'll be replacing the one working Korky very soon...",1.0
"At first it wouldn't stop filling. After a jerry-rigged the float and the little hole on top it's supposed to cover now it only fills up intermittently. I have to tap it or give it a little twist to get it started to fill up.... I was wondering how they could afford to sell it this cheap. Now I know. Simple to install, but very disappointed.",1.0
"My mistake was installing this instead of returning it when I opened the box and looked it over. My first impression was a terrible design poorly manufactured. It was an absolute nightmare to install and never did work satisfactorily. I happened to notice (from that magical water flow sound) that it wasn't shutting off completely and can hardly wait until my next water bill. I followed their dismantling and cleaning procedure and it was already clean as a whistle inside. I've never had a plumber in my home, or saw one of these fill valves that were designed to require cleaning. The product is simply a cheap piece of ill fitting plastic garbage. They were nice about it, offering to send a replacement, but the one and only one of their products I have had or will ever own is on its way to the landfill where it rightfully belongs. Stick with FlowMaster.",1.0
"I replaced the fill valves on three toilets with this model and all three failed in less than three months. The problem is that when the toilet is flushed the water pulses on and off while filling Again, I installed three of these and they all developed this same problem only a few months after installation. I contacted Korky customer support and they told me they were aware of ""pulsing problems"" and suggested the cause was ""too high water pressure"" - ridiculous nonsense, as proved by the fact that the problem remains even if I partially close the main inlet valve.

These valves are also very noisy. Advertising these as ""quiet"" is simply dishonest -they are much louder than the old valves I replaced.",1.0
"I am a landlord who has owned dozens of rental properties.  I know how to repair a toilet.  I normally go for the cheapest fill valve available, but since this time it was my personal residence -- I decided to opt for something a bit more expensive because it claimed to be the quietest.  What should have been a 10 minute install turned into a 2 hour long nightmare.  The fill valve would not seal against the toilet tank.  I tried every trick in the book from years of experience.  I cleaned both the rubber washer and the toilet tank.  I made sure it was not on upside down.  I tried hand tightening the bolt, and when that would work -- I even tried gently tightening it with pliers, being careful not to crack the plastic.  This product turned out to be horrible engineered, and just a piece of junk which I will be promptly returning tomorrow.

"I bought the Korky water valve based on the premise that it would be quieter than my existing one. Installation was easy, but the first trials proved that it was not significantly different than the valve I was replacing in terms of noise. More disturbing was the fact that even after the water stopped filling I could hear the distinct noise of water flowing ever so slightly. It never stopped. I removed and re-installed it thinking that something was off. Same result, it never stopped flowing at the end of the fill cycle.

I ain't doing this every single week, so Lavelle sent me another. Put that on, 2 weeks later, same thing! Called to tell them that these valves are garbage and I needed to get my money back.

"The Korky 528 toilet fill valve box states that the valve fits all toilets.  This valve DOES NOT work properly in TOTO brand toilets.  Three weeks ago I purchased and installed a 528 valve and it initially appeared to work correctly but then I realized the bowl was not filling completely.  This lack of water during the initial flush subsequently caused our pipes to clog and created a plumbing problem.  I have subsequently found that Korky manufactures a special valve (528T)for TOTO toilets at a substantially higher price ($26).  I no longer have the packaging or receipt for the original valve so there is no possibility of returning it.  I purchased a 528T today.  Hopefully, it will work.",1.0

"Six months ago, when we moved to our house, I replaced inner components of all 3 tanks with this brand (not just fill valve but every single component - all Korky - Levelle). The two had been very problematic and required many hours of troubleshooting. Turned out to be that ""red rubber shut off valve"" was not sealing properly to shut off the water. I replaced them with replacement valves. This stopped the problem for a couple of weeks and the issue came back. So much for ""Made in USA"" and I wasted $60 some on this brand.
Now, I replaced one with MJSI HC660 and in process of replacing the other one with the identical MJSI.",1.0
"I had a different kind of fill valve that was noisy and slow so I bought this to replace it.  The Home Depot guy said it was good.  It worked quietly and fast for only two months before water was running continuously.  It wouldn't shut off the water.  I decided to replace it and get the same one because it had to be a fluke that it quit.  The second one worked for 1-1/2 weeks before the same problem. I emailed the company's customer service and they claim my water must have ""debris"" in it.  Yes, all the water here has minerals.  We all have wells.  Well water isn't as filtered but debris?  No debris.  I would say don't waste your money on this flimsy and finicky thing.  I hope I can find a good old-fashioned valve somewhere.",1.0
"I purchased one of these at a local hardware store after my previous fill valve (a different brand) stopped working.  The first few days it worked great, but then I noticed that after flushing it would not start filling the tank.  To get it to start I have to hit the outside of the tank or take the lid off and hit the unit itself.  Now it's gotten to where when it starts filling, it won't stop!

I have never thought something so simple as a fill valve for a toilet could be so stubborn or problematic.  This is the first and last Korky product I will ever buy in my life, and I would return it but I can't find the receipt.

And as for the ""quite fill"" bit, yeah it's quite, but aren't all new fill valves quiet these days?",1.0
"I purchased a Korky Quietfill valve about 2 months ago and installed it following the instructions.  After about 3 weeks I noticed the valve would continue to run ever so slightly even after it should have shut off.  The running water sound was not a problem with the flapper because it was also brand new. Water was running into the overflow tube indicating the issue is definitely with the valve.

I should mention the second toilet in my house is a Toto.  Toto uses the same valve as the Korky (Lavelle Industries).  I've owned the Toto for 6 years and have had to replace the fill cap on the toilet valve twice.  When the fill cap starts to fail on a Korky it will cause water to still trickle through the valve which was exactly the same symptoms I was having with this new valve.  Thinking my new Quietfill valve perhaps had a defective fill cap I went out and bought a replacement cap at Lowes.  Replacing it returned the valve to normal operation but only for a short time.  After several flushes I noticed the valve was once again still running.  I tried emailing Korky's customer service but didn't get much help from them.  They just told me to insure the fill cap was securely tightened on top of the valve, which it was.  They offered no explanation as to how or why a brand new Quietfill valve would be exhibiting this type of problem.

In an effort to see if something else might be causing the issue I removed the valve from the toilet, disassembled it to insure no debris were clogging it, checked the adjustment, and reinstalled it.  After 3 flushes the problem returned.  Rather than mess with this thing any further I returned to the store today and picked up an MJSI Hydroclean 660 valve.  It's an updated design of the FluidMaster.  The old Fluidmaster I had in my toilet ran reliably for 10 years without a single issue.  I never had to replace ANY parts on it.  Should've stuck with them to begin with.

Having had experience now with 2 Korky valves I can say I just don't trust them.  Nothing worse than leaving your house for an extended period only to discover your toilet valve has been running the entire time wasting water and possibly causing water damage to your home.

Korky still has a way to go to make a reliable product in my opinion.

"This filter made me learn more about heating system than I ever wanted to know.  My specific environment does not handle a filter that filters very small particles.  That does not leave much room for air so in my environment it was significantly hurting my air flow or temperature.  Bought smart thermostats, replaces the Air/Heater systems with high quality and high capacity ones.  When the fan was on, I could not pull these filters out.  The suction was so great.  A heating specialists came and gave me a no name filter and I used it for 2 days now and love the flow I get.  I do not have allergies so that is not a problem here. Get a MERV 8 or at the highest high capacity MERV 11 (next one up).  Get a good no name.  You can get them from any hardware retailer or online.  This is a great filter, however the consumer goes not research this.  They just buy one and this can make so much difference. I know of a very good allergy supplier of filters in California, but I do not think I should give their name.",1.0

"Hi,

I just got this installed and the problem is that the installation is not solid. I can rotate the fixture in both ways and my electrician tells me that is is how it's designed.

The filters were poorly packed and when I got the first one out today, some of the cross supports were torn and were thin and poorly made. The filter part was thin and saggy and not well made. The ridges were not all perpendicular to the bottom edge but slightly slanted. It was not the same product and much less well made than when I previously purchased it. I'll have to buy this somewhere else, off the internet. This is what is wrong with amazon.

"Got my first Case knife from my father back in the early 80's , a black 2 blade jack, something he probably picked up back in the late 60s when he was in the USMC. A real knife.. heavy, well made, thick steel, stout almost immovable back springs...>>FF to 2013 and think of the opposite of all qualities previously stated....even the engineering is poor as the movement of the blades during opening/closing is out of whack as the blades rub each other... The very first time I opened the main blade I immediately noticed wear marks from where it was rubbing on the blade next to it right out of the box. The back springs are very weak too.... And dull as white paint. Overall very disappointed.",1.0
"This knife is junk! The blades not only came dull, but had burrs on the edge. The edge is also ground unevenly. All three blades rub against each other, leaving marks on the blades. The pen blade catches in the nail slot of the sheepsfoot blade, making it extremely difficult to open. The clip point catches on the sheepsfoot and prevents it from closing and it has to be pushed closed. There is a visible gap between the liner and the bolster on one side and the end of the backspring on the same side does not sit flush with the liner. And speaking of the backspring, it's very weak on the clip point. There's just no snap to it.

I've never seen their stockman before, so I had no idea the sheepsfoot blade sticks out so far when closed. It's hideous.

For a knife that is so highly regarded, I am more than just a little disappointed. I expected so much more from a knife that was supposed to be the epitome of American made, quality craftsmanship.

Case should be embarrassed that this is what is leaving their factory.

I will say, however, that the handle of this knife is beautiful. Unfortunately, that seems to be their focus when making these knives. They seem to be made to look at, not to use.

I will never buy another Case knife, nor would I recommend them to anyone.

Edit: I forgot to mention that after receiving the knife, I looked up blade rub on Case knives. This appears to be an extremely common occurrence. And for whatever reason, most people don't even mention it because they don't care. To me, this is unacceptable. I've never in my life owned a knife with blades or tools that rubbed on other parts of the knife. Case themselves commented on a video review on YouTube saying that blade rub just happens and is ""nobody's fault, really"". That is absolutely ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and buy a Victorinox. It might not be as pretty, but the blades and tools are of a much higher quality with a better fit. And nothing rubs!",1.0

In other words it's a dressed-up version of the disposable brushes you can buy for a couple of dollars in any paint store. Lesson learned?

"Having a new baby in the house I wanted to have the best air quality so I purchased this filter locally. Fast forward to 9 weeks after I put it in and the temperature in the house drops to 63, despite the furnace kicking on. It's between 9-26 degrees outside in Dec in MN when this happened. We pulled the filter out and it looked fine, we've had other filters look much more black than this one before without any issues. Thus had an HVAC guy come out, first thing he did was he looked at the filter and put it back in as it looked clean enough. After a bit more looking at the system and the error code, he pulled the filter out again and let it run... It heated to 70 within a few minutes!?! The issue/error code was a block in the return air = filter was not allowing enough airflow. HVAC guy said to just buy the cheapest pleated filters and change them monthly (about 3 dollars each locally). He said with a high efficiency furnace (ours is only about 5 years old) these super restrictive 3M filters can cause the system to error and not run. Lesson learned: more money does not always equal better. Feel so dumb because 3 different adults looked at the filter and put it back in thinking ""that couldn't be the problem, it's pretty clean"" and instead paid over 200 to the HVAC guy to tell us to change the filter.",1.0

"The Heath/Zenith products I bought in the past were well designed and worthwhile, but this DESA International ""Heath/Zenith"" motion sensor light is absolutely terrible.
The advertised range of up to 70 or so feet, along with a rated 180 degree coverage angle, is totally misrepresentative!  I'm lucky if my unit senses motion from 20 feet away,  and with even 70 to 90 degrees of coverage.
Basically it does not even come remotely close to functioning as advertised,  which suggests to me that the company basically has an integrity problem.
More than that, they have virtually no customer service.  I e-mailed them about my unit's flaws and they never responded, and the light's ""operation manual""  offers no email address or phone number (I had to find their e-mail access through their website).
Furthermore, the only comment at all about repairs or customer service in the manual is in very fine print and says that the user has to return the product to the place of purchase.
  This is definitely the worst purchase I've ever made from Amazon. Do NOT buy this motion sensor light fixture....about all this company appears to sense is how to take advantage of the public.

"I'm an electrical engineer with an AEE degree, a BSEE degree and a Master of Science degree in IT. I own a home with 21 outdoor light fixtures on it and a detached garage with 14 outdoor light fixtures on it. {Yes, I guess I like lights} All my motion lights used to be Intelectron by Brightmond and were purchased from Grossmans about 18 years ago when I built the house. The Intelectron lights worked GREAT! I did have a couple fail over the past 2 decades but I bought spares and swapped parts between them to keep them working. I just put an addition onto my home and replaced all my outdoor lighting. I used Heath Zenith lights available from Home Depot, Lowes and Valu. As a matter of fact these stores ONLY SELL Heath Zenith. I used 4 different models of Heath Zenith lights. They are all junk.
  I have called Heath Zenith tech support and spoke with their engineering department to no avail. They have sent me replacement components and had me modify my own lighting to attempt to solve ""their"" problems, all to no avail. Do Not Buy Them.
Problems:
  First, the lights turn on by themselves with no living organism and no source of heat near them.
  Second, when the light turns on, it may not go off for hours or possibly all night even though the light is set to 5 minutes because they falsely trigger themselves to stay on from the heat of the bulbs.
  Third, the lights will not turn on even though a person is doing jumping jacks under the light.
  Fourth, in winter weather the lights will not detect anyone walking near them.
  Fifth, occasionally when a light is triggered on, it will stay on day and night until the breaker is turned off.
Again, DO NOT BUY THEM!!!! They are JUNK!
I tried to find info on Intelectron by Brightmond and I think they are out of business. If anyone know of any motion lights that actually work, please post it here. Thank you and God Bless! Have a great day!  >  Daniel K. 4-13-2011",1.0

I have purchased from this company for years and had very good luck. At least until my most recent purchase of this model. The old Heath lights I have still work, they are fifteen years old.

It all began about four years ago when I bought what I though was a good product for my newly wired barn. I purchased two of them and at the time they were around thirty dollars each. I mounted them (not an easy job as they are 15' in the air under a soffit) and tested in ""test"" mode.

All was well the first two years except they failed to turn off during the winter months. I kept climbing the ladder and adjusting stuff, thinking it was my fault. Finally one unit quit completely. I called the factory and they agreed to send a replacement since the store had gone out of business. Not bad customer service there.

That new replacement worked for one year, actually less than that as I shut both of them down quite awhile ago due to the fact that they never shut down themselves.

Today I climbed up the ladder again and installed an old Heath light I had laying around. I tested it and it checked out fine. I need to purchase another light to replace the other defective unit but it sure won't be one of these junkers!",1.0

Look at the video.  After one push of the flush handle, Korky is back down after flushing for 1.8 seconds, about one fifth of the tank.

For most all of us who have spent our lives pushing the flush handle down once and expecting the toilet to do a tank-emptying flush, this simple-minded flapper is a big step backward to the 1920s or earlier.

I can cut a better right angle on my table saw.  If you want two 4 ft straight edges it will work fine. You will have to have an 8 ft straight edge to hold the two 4 ft sections against while you clamp them together to make this device straight.,1.0

"Flexes too much in the middle . Ends are not cut square .very poor quality control, how hard can it be too do that. Fine for 48 inch cuts but worthless
for 96 inch. Johnson tool should be ashamed to put there name on it.",1.0
The center piece that holds the two parts together has a very loose fit and is just not strong enough to hold the guides without excessive flexing. It's not straight and the two pieces aren't even there is an offset where the two pieces join. I bought Not strsomething similar to this at home depot several years ago and it used a steel piece that snapped in place firmly. It worked very well to bad they don't sell that one any longer.,1.0
"Bought this and returned after using twice. First use was only with one section and it worked well enough. Second use was on longer ply and had to use both sections. Put them together and they were not square, at all. This wasn't a finish cut so I wasn't too concerned. Started the cut and half way in the ""straight edge"" had flexed over an inch away from the line I wanted. No, I wasn't applying too much pressure to the guide. Promptly returned it. Looks like I'll be heading to the steel yard to pick up a piece of 2"" flat.",1.0
"These filters work good on paper, but they reduce airflow drastically and caused a malfunction of my HVAC systems. I live in Arizona and replaced my filters late May in preparation for the scorching summer. At the end of June the AC systems would not reach the programmed temperature of 76F during the day and I scratched my head for a week until I thought of replacing the filters (that were not *that* dirty to start with). With new filters it was back to normal function but I will never use an anti-allergen filter again! Lots of hype, some unintended consequences.",1.0
"probably the worst filter I ever used. it literally went from white to black in less than 4 weeks of use (suggested 2 months use). this is the house with no smokers or any source of bad odor or questionable atmosphere elements that would suggest why this filter goes black so fast. after that the smell in the house was strange, the air felt sticky. I took it out this time for good (had two sets and both showed same results), and got the normal 2200 MPR GM filters in. a little more expensive, but sure worked for many months without any issues for me. I would not recommend this filter to anyone.",1.0

Came totally bent. No wonder they were so cheap. I hope they still work.,1.0
"be very careful ordering this size air conditioning filter. In previous orders, of the 12 inch by 12 inch size, I received packets of 4 each. this order, which was supposed to be two sets of four each, came in a huge box with only two individual AC filters. Am returning because that is not a good price. The filters are fine. Just beware of what you order!",1.0
Good product. Came and was all bent because of how it was shipped.,1.0
When I purchased the first box I noticed a granular white dust and many surfaces in the house....After dusting in a few days the white dust returned.  After I eliminated what could be other possible sources of the dust and changing these filters monthly the dust remained.  After several months of dusting this white dust I changed the filter to a cheaper non Micro allergen filter.  within two days after thoroughly dusting the white dust has not returned.  I am convinced that this granular white dust was caused by these filters.,1.0
"Poor Quality, too small to actualy use the 3 inputs - I was expecting to use the 3 inputs, but with larger power cords it won't just work. It's made of cheap materials, so the connectors are soft and might break/bend etc not very good at all.",1.0
"THE PICTURE OF IT WAS MISLEADING IN MY OPINION, SO AFTER SEEING IT I SENT IT BACK,, MANY OF THEIR PICTURES OF ITEMS ARE NOT REAL GOOD, LEAVE TOO MUCH TO THE IMAGINATION.",1.0
"Bad quality. There is better one in your store sold and made by well known companies. Don't waste your time. It feels like I will break it very time, I plug in and/or remove a plug.",1.0
Was damaged and bends easily  and smaller than size stated.,1.0
Falsely listed as Leviton.  It's actually just a generic brand adapter. Works fine I suppose I just don't like the deceitful listing.,1.0
"Ordered two of these adapters and when my package arrived there was only one in the box. Since there is nothing in the item's options menu to handle this situation I had to spend time hunting down Amazon's customer service number. Then once I got hold of a representative I was told that they wouldn't be able to send me my other adapter so I'd be getting a refund. Waste of my time, should have just gone to the store for this.",1.0
The box that the filters arrived in was crushed on one corner. The filters were damaged and won't stay in place in the return air.,1.0
"I was supposed to receive a 6-pack of Filtrete Allegren Defense Filters 12-inch by 12-inch but only received a single (as in 1) 12X12 filter.

Someone needs to send me the remaining 5 filters.

Unacceptable.",1.0
"It looks like it's missing some connectors in the jack. When plugged into the phone (a basic, corded landline) I can hear others but they cannot hear me.

Sucks.",1.0
damaged in packaging - poor quality control,1.0
Poor quality. We have 5 bedroom house and we have to change it every month . It falls apart when u take it out to replace with new one. I would rather buy good quality filters and change them evry 3 months or so,1.0
"Beware of the difference between the made-up Home Depot rating of FPR versus the industry standard MERV rating. I was sent FPR of 8, which is not the same as MERV of 8 from the seller ""Videojockey"". The FPR rating is whateverthe manufacturer tells you it is, not a standard.",1.0
