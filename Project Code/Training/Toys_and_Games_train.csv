"Very happy with this game and the miniatures in this pack, definately a step up from the miniatures in previous packs",5.0
"I didn't think I would like be game that much, really just bought them for the figures. The game play is really good and worth playing - very surprised.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I are big fans of the Dungeon Command games.  We now have all of the faction packs including this release, which is the newest.  It is definitely noteworthy that ALL of the miniatures included in this pack are completely NEW, not re-releases from the old D&D 3.5-era miniatures booster packs.  The previous Dungeon Command faction packs (Cormyr, Lolth, Goblins and Undead) all featured old miniatures, although many of those creatures have new color schemes.  To some tabletop RPG enthusiasts, the miniatures alone will be well worth buying this pack.  They are EXTREMELY well designed models with VERY nice paint.  We spent about 10 minutes marveling at the figures before we even thought about checking out their matching game cards.

Dungeon Command Veterans: The creatures/order cards from this pack add lots of fun new elements to gameplay and strategy and match well with any of the other faction packs.  In our first game, we pitted the Orcs of this set versus the Undead.  There seemed to be a very nice balance between the power of both factions, playing them right out of the box without customizing warbands.  Now that we have all of the faction packs, I think we'll probably start doing some customization.

If you are new to the Dungeon Command game, this is a very fun strategy board game / Trading card game hybrid where you essentially battle your army versus your opponents creatures until one warband proves victorious.  You draw cards in to your hand during your turn to bolster your creatures basic attacks/abilities.  The game takes about 2-3 minutes to set up, once you know how to play and a match can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on how serious you get (kind of like chess.)  One of the best things about Dungeon Command is that you can easily put it away/set it back up if you need to take a break in the middle of a game.  My boyfriend and I usually play an entire match in two sittings during the weekdays.  If you are in to the D&D world and/or role-playing, you can definitely add as much RP and dialogue as you'd like.  If RPing isn't your thing, don't worry-- there's no dice rolling or paper and pencil requirement for Dungeon  Command, just lay out the board, draw your hand and you're ready to play!",5.0
"In all my years as Dungeon Master, there are some creatures that are always at the heroes heels, threats that doesn't get tired of puting the characters' lives in danger. The orcs are by my personal choice the favorite foes, the ideal enemies that keep pestering the adventurers over and over again. This box contains the types of orcs that I like. Maybe it can be your favorites too, that's a matter of discussion.",5.0
Awesome addition to my rpg GM system.,5.0
"Wish it had a few more sheets, it is good as a stand alone, but purchasing two of this set really gives you some areas to improve on, like more roads and streams.",5.0
Thanks for the fast shipping~!  Item was exactly as described.,5.0
"well worth the money! I was initially irked that I had to pay so much for some bits of printed paper, but these are sturdy, like a baby's board book, and nice quality! I'm looking forward to getting my other sets to mix and match.",5.0
My grandson loved it!!,5.0
Great tiles,5.0
Good,5.0
"The figures are very high quality, as are the board pieces and cards. If you're DMing and you need a horde of orcs, this is the one for you!",5.0
"I loved this game...of course that I am fan of this theme, but the Wizards Team could be create new expansions for this game.",5.0
"Great game.  Value for the price is great also.  My advice, buy one and try it with a friend.  If you enjoy it buy the other 5 as well.  It really is like a mix of warhammer on a very small scale and magic the gathering!",5.0
Great start for any Wargamer looking for Orcs to add. and just perfect for everyone else looking for bad guy miniatures in general.,5.0
I really love this game and I hope they make more.  It is based more on strategy then on luck which I prefer.  My 10 year old son and I play all the time and occasionally invite the 13 year old neighbor and his dad over for four people games.  It is simple enough for younger kids but challenging enough for young and old alike.,5.0
Satisfied!,5.0
Excelent,5.0
I love this game and recommend it highly. Its easy enough to learn and has very clear rules and a cheat sheet that keeps the game flowing. One of the best things is that although each army is customizable most people just play the premade as they are well thought out and it really simplifies and speeds the game up because you do not have to go through the tedium of picking and trying to figure out synergy and which card works best with which. I just wish they would produce some more sets.,5.0
"Note that my review is identical for the three packs we own.

This is another pack for the Dungeon Command skirmish battle system.  For the most fun and balanced battles, you should have a minimum of two of the Dungeon Command packs.  Don't buy two of the same pack though, because half of the fun is making the most of your army with all of their different skills and special attacks.  The game is easy to setup.  This game is more about proper usage of cards than it is about lucky dice rolls.  That is a good thing.  The cards are beautiful and the prepainted miniatures are fantastic.  Fans of Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, and Castle Ravenloft will recognize a few of the miniatures, as some of the molds have been ""recycled"" for this game.  My family has Lolth, Undeath, and Gruumsh, but usually only play one-on-one battles.  You can play up to four players, but you would need four, preferably different, Dungeon Command Packs.  As a bonus, the packs contain cards for each miniature, so that they can be used as monsters in Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, or Castle Ravenloft.  I really appreciated that extra option for using the miniatures.

The Gruumsh command pack is Orc themed and includes the deadly ogre.  I always hate facing this beast on the battlefield, because he is extremely lethal when combined with Vorpal Blade card.  YIKES!  My son owns this pack and battle my undead warriors.  It's always a good match!  As long as I can do enough damage to the Ogre before my Dracolith is killed, I usually prevail.  However, if his Ogre sticks around too long, the undead tend to go to their second graves!

The price on Amazon is fantastic.  Buy it!",5.0
100% ok fast shipping as descibed,5.0
just right,5.0
Lots of interesting tiles in many sizes. Even the box lid could be useful.,5.0
"I ordered this as a ""what the heck"" buy, since I've never had tiles before, I wasn't sure if I wanted to dive into them and the price was irresistible.

This tile set is an amazing set for the price (I got it for just over $12!). The tiles are extremely well printed on very heavy card stock (2mm thick). Just poring over them and looking at the details has got me thinking about how I can use them. Others here have given excellent descriptions as to what you're getting, so I'm not going to repeat them and my set came exactly as all the others described. I am very pleased with what I got. So far I'm having fun just playing around with layouts!",5.0
"We actually get a lot of use out of this set. In the past, we had a big sheet of 1 inch square graph paper - like you use on conference room easels. But this is faster to setup, reusable and better artwork then we usually took the time to provide. Currently playing Thunderspire, which comes with incomplete paper maps. These tiles have been real handy in adding on the areas they didn't print on the poster.",5.0
This a perfect must have set! It really helps my group better plane fights and helps add a lot of eye candy to your gaming.,5.0
Almost infinite possibilities!,5.0
Useful if you don't have a grid to draw on or if you want to add something to your grid.,5.0
Great product.  Can use it for more than just D&D games.,5.0
"I've played all the previous iterations of the D&D Miniatures skirmish games, and this is an outstanding version. Be sure to pick up the other four sets to have all of the options the game can offer, although each set is playable and fully enjoyable on it's own.",5.0
"I honestly just bought this for the minis. It's a great value just for that, but to have the option of a full game as well is great. The minis are typical WotC quality, so you get just what you'd expect. Great way to pick up a brand new themed set of minis for a very reasonable price.",5.0
"I bought these because I play D&D and it's a great price for the minis. I'm very pleased with the quality of the minis. I haven't even played the Dungeon Command game yet, and I'm already satisfied with the quality of the minis for playing D&D. I'll write an update once I have a chance to play the Dungeon Command game to give a review of it too.",5.0
"The miniatures in this set are all 100% new sculpts, and have fantasctic paint apps.
also a few of them are from the new D&D next art.",5.0
"These just make the game come alive. Battles go much more quickly and smoothly. Very nicely designed, and a great way to give detail and depth to battles.",5.0
It floats!!!!,5.0
"These are really great, the only problem is that almost all of the shapes of the tiles are either rectangles or squares. Other than that it's a great way to add flavor to your sessions.",5.0
Great addition to my game. Hopefully we'll get more of these for the new eddition.,5.0
I use these all the time. They are perfect for creating your own dungeon or copying one that has already been published. I have not had a single time when I wished I had a new tile. I use this in combination with the Shattered Keeps Map Pack and I have run 3 quests using only these. They're great,5.0
The product is exactly as the description and pictures. Thats good because I could know what I was purchasing without being worried.,5.0
This is useful for 4th edition where placement of everything matters. it helps visualize the fight and stops the squabble regarding whether or not the spell or ability reaches the intended target,5.0
As advertised good quality. Added some better play spaces then drawing would allow. Going to buy another pack soon. yay,5.0
"Awesome product for D&D fans. My boyfriend really liked this set. The cardboard was thick and came in a good variety of tiles. There are several large tiles, medium tiles, and small points of interest like bushes, a statue, a graveyard, cave.",5.0
"First, let me start off by saying I don't own a battle mat, but I own several Flip-Mats. I bought 2 of these and 2 of the wilderness set. Each box provides you with a decent collection of slightly generic, but useful tiles to create a dungeon on the fly. I'm not fond of the smaller more location specific sets, so to bolster my tile collection I simply bought 2 of this box... twice the tiles, w00t!

I also recommend the Wilderness set...

I do not recommend the City set...
I find the City set extremely underwhelming and ugly, I would rather just use Game Mastery Flip-Mats (Village Square)  and GameMastery Map Packs (Shops).",5.0
Way better than what I expected. Even the box is high quality. Thinking about buying another so we can lay out large dungeons without needing to remove past areas.,5.0
"While designed for use with D&D 4E, this tile set of a stone work dungeon could be used with any RPG.

Quality of the tiles is excellent and most have artwork on two sides.

Scale is 1"" per square.

There are plenty of tiles in this box set, and the box itself is good to use as storage for the tiles making the set easily portable if you are a DM on the go.",5.0
"What a great product, my pc's love these tiles, we have a few sets now after purchasing these. Can't beet the price for how much you get!",5.0
"The best part I see is the box!  What a wonderfully diverse and rounded set for the cost.  I am so happy, and, as the DM, you know that if I am happy, my players are happy!",5.0
"Quicker than I expected, perfect handling and package. All I could hope for. I was surprised by the amount of time it took, I mean, how quick it was than I expected.",5.0
The best for any gammer or player. Fast and easy to us. Strong and still light. Have terrain changes to help in any setting.,5.0
The pieces are high quality and are easy to integrate. It is a very good material and indispensable for those who like to play RPG with miniatures. It's a good choice,5.0
This is a great accessory to the starter set.  I would recommend this to anyone who owns the starter set.,5.0
makes map making easier when creating and adventure for your party. and is easy to set up.  and take down.  I would recommend it to any D&D fan,5.0
"The tiles were exactly as described: they are sturdy, colorful, and will prove to be very useful in forming terrain for outdoor-based encounters. Fits very well with other supplements, especially the Witchlight Fens, which provides needed variety in the water aspect. Altogether a very good value for the price.",5.0
"This is one of the most versaTILE (pun entirely intended) things that I have gotten as a DM.  The tiles can be used over and over in different combinations without seeming familiar.  There are a good variety of generic tiles that will not make a person think ""Oh, I've seen that rock formation in the last encounter.""  However, there are also some unique tiles that give players a sense of importance when they see it.  With the right settings and plot, you could run an entire campaign with just this kit.  It should be noted, however, that this works great in conjunction with the other Master Sets (I personally use the dungeon set as well) to expand your settings.",5.0
"Excellent set of tiles with a good variety of rooms and hallways. A little skimpy on ""furniture"" and dungeon dressing, IMO, but for the price I'm satisfied.",5.0
this is a cool addition to playing d&d.  I can build or rebuild how I want pretty quick. I like it.,5.0
"Pros:  Durable, attractive, useful for almost any constructed
dungeon (not caves), can be built into semi-3D structures by putting books under them etc.  Great value!  Box is two big tiles!

Cons:  Take longer to set up than drawing out a map on a Chessex battlemat.  That's my only complaint.",5.0
"PROS: I like this set more than most. It's my favorite master set and I have them all. The tiles are sturdy and very functional. It makes for a good starter set. Two sets would be helpful, especially for classic dungeon crawls. But one set is fine. The door and pit tiles are great! There are some nice big areas. Good statue and decorative pieces.

CONS: A couple more hallway tiles might be nice. A treasure chest would get my purr up. The only other negative comments boil down to preferences, no more. I would like to see sleeping quarters, kitchen facilities, and maybe a couple rough walled passageways. In other words, more diversity and enough to make a fully functioning dungeon complex. This set is ripe for a ""Part 2"" version.",5.0
"For the price you pay you get a lot of really useful tiles. Each is double sided with one side covered in plain tiles and the other featuring some kind of special room or obastacle. A few are black on the back instead of tiles. These can be used to change the shape of a room by being used as chunks of ""wall""

When you open the box it looks like there isn't much there, but once you punch out all the pieces there is quite a lot.",5.0
"I like these tiles for many reasons.  First they are thick and substantial.  They are also double sided.  Primarily one side is just a woodland scene with maybe a tree or two on it, and the other has more specific details like a camp, fire, lakes, rivers, wagons, chests, etc...

There are a lot of tiles in the set, of many different sizes.  Plenty of large ones and smaller ones that you can use to custom make your landscapes.  I cannot speak to whether or not these are different from other sets as I don't have any of the old ones, but if you don't own any wilderness tiles, these are worth the money.

The box is also nice as it contains the grid pattern on it and can be used to simulate a hill, rise or earthen fort.

All in all, I have been very pleased with this set, and plan to purchase other master sets as well.",5.0
I like these tiles. They are heavy weight and well made. The tile images are well varied. There are a good choice of tile sizes. The down side is that you can only make fairly small areas with one set. I ordered two.,5.0
Absolutely amazing set of tiles. When I first opened it up and laid the sheets out I was kind of disappointed by how few it looked like. But when I punched them out and started to build some encounter spaces I was amazed at how much is actually in the box!,5.0
"It's just beautiful work. And the box is also sort of a tile, so you can have higher ground using the box.",5.0
"I am quite satisfied with these map tiles I buy for the first time, all is just what I expected. Useful, good quality, and package is in 100% good condition, even after all those transportation from US to China.",5.0
"Curti a vera esse novo master set de tiles. Por um &oacute;timo preo na Amazon, tenho v&aacute;rias folhas de tiles onde os lados so bem diferentes, possibilitando o uso ainda maior do material.

Recomendo pra todos que curtem tiles em seus jogos!",5.0

"So, I bought these while running the D&D Essentials campaign, Reavers of Harkenwold.  The second part of this campaign requires your own map building, so I felt this was a good time to purchase this set.  I can't really add to the other reviews, it is excellent stuff.  But I do have a tip.

SAVE THE PUNCHOUT BORDERS!  I have already started trimming some of these up to create walls, barriers, etc.  It's great to stick them down on top of the larger 8x8's when you want to segment a room.  A little blue sticky tack will hold it in place, and it gives the space the slightest of dimension, which helps your players immerse even more.  It isn't a replacement for 3D props, but it is certainly usable for DM's on a budget (like me).",5.0
"This set is a box containing a set of Dungeon Tiles previously sold in separate packs that had no container. The cool thing is that the top and bottom of the box aren't wasted: They're Dungeon Tiles, too!

The box isn't crammed full of Dungeon Tiles--I'm sorry I didn't count how many sheets you get, so that I could tell you in this review--but that just means there is plenty of room left over to add the tiles from one or two of the containerless sets you may have purchased.

Dungeon Tiles are printed on thick cardboard. They are high quality items. If you own any Fantasy Flight boardgames with good components, then you will be familiar with the level of quality here.",5.0
"I was not a huge 4th Edition D&D game fan when it came out.  That confession done, Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro have won me over with their fantastic gaming props.

The entire set of essential tiles are fantastic!

The quality is top-notch.  The tiles are two-sided, and each of the sets contains numerous add-ons that allow nearly endless varieties of terrain for encounters.

Since all of the tiles are done with symetric, equal squares for the grid, everyone of the sets is geomorphic.  You can use the wilderness set with the city set to create a park in a city.  You can use the dungeon set with the wilderness set to create a gothic, evil clearing.

The only limit is your imagination.

Truth be told, I use this tile set with all of my fantasy role-playing table-top games.

For the price, it would be hard to imagine a better deal.

Well done Hasbro!

In service,

Rich

"I have been a GM for some 20+ years and I remember when the very first tile set came out.  A friend of mine picked it up and we used it to plan out maps (before that it was a mat and a dry erase marker).

The one downside to the original tile set was how few tiles it gave you, and how it only gave you one blank dungeon floor tile.

When I heard they were making this set, I was a bit skeptical at first.  I didn't want to put down the money if it was going to just be a reprint of how the first ""dungeon tiles"" set was going to be.

You are given a lot of tiles in this set!  And, on one side of just about all the tiles is a blank dungeon floor!  That's right, nothing is on it!  Now, I can make a dungeon on the fly with these tiles and have the image on the tile actually be a feature of the room, but not everyone can do that.  So, if you want a featureless room, you can make that now with these tiles.

Yes, there are reprints from older sets, such as Arcane Towers and Halls of the Giant King.  But, even if you have those sets, this set is still worth it, for the extra tiles.  I am considering getting a second set so we can have enough tiles for our table.

The box the set comes in is rather durable and can carry the set easily.  Unlike previous sets which had no such feature, you could easily fit this tile set and another ""standard"" set.  It just makes it easier to transport your tiles to wherever you may game with your group.

Now for some bad news; they do give you a few black squares, which seems like a bit of a ""cop-out"" to me.  I could go and just get some black paper and cut squares if I wanted a black square or two.  Also, they give you two ""element"" tiles - both reprinted from Streets of Shadow.  Why you would need a whirlpool or a fire square that big is beyond me.  I personally would have like to have seen the altars from Fane of the Forgotten Gods reprinted, or some of the tiles from Arcane Corridors brought back.

I would still recommend picking up Arcane Towers as a complimentary set to this one.  With Arcane Towers, you can make a circular tower in addition to a dungeon.  Is it necessary?  No, but it helps round out this set.  Still, this set gives you plenty of dungeon tiles to make a dungeon for any game.  I would recommend this set for any GM - new or experienced, whether you already own some tiles or this is the start of a collection for your group.",5.0
"The quality of this tile set was top end. When the description said ""Heavy Cardstock"" I was expecting thick glossy paper. The map tiles are printed on heavy card stock that resembles the material used to print board games on. Even the box is nicely designed and printed. I'm happy and will look for other tile sets in this series.",5.0
"Just got my box in the mail. This set contains over a dozen thick card-stock dungeon tiles and rooms for the D&D4 game. Some are reprints of previous dungeon tiles but no matter, this is meant to be a core-set. If you are new to D&D 4 then you should pick this up, it has enough tiles for a modest sized dungeon crawl game. I'll probably pick up a second box set to expand my tile sets. What is excellent about this set is that the box itself is a large sized dungeon room (both lid and box). While I still use a battlemat this is great for adding more atmosphere for specific dungeon encounters. Wizards D&D are really putting out good quality products with this Essentials line. While touted for D&D this set could easily be used for other fantasy RPG games like Warhammer or Pathfinder too.",5.0
"Lords of Waterdeep is by far one of my favorite board games. It's a worker placement type game, that is great for 2-5 players. This game is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, and while knowledge of the history is nice in that it would will let you recognize more of the land marks, it is not at all necessary to enjoy the game. I've played lots of worker placement games, and this remains one of my favorites as it's a solid middle ground, between rules heavy, and rules light. I highly recommend this board game.",5.0
"Game package well , with easy to read / follow instructions. Expansion add a new level of fun to game. One expansion adds more spaces for people placement ; while other expansion allows for corruption. Players can gain resources for an extra cost ( skulls) . Players have to diside it worth risk to be caught ""skull""handed. We loved game expansion.",5.0
"Or you might REALLY LOVE IT...
Some of my friends dreamed about playing this game after the first few games we played.
That said this game can be addictive and I am glad for that b/c the Girl Friend loves to play it solo with me too.
She is not a big boardgames player or game player and I think sometimes she just plays to be with me but its still fun for her I think.
I would buy this game for all my friends but they would stop calling me to play so - No...",5.0
We like LoW.  Good for two or whole family.  This expansion will be good to add a sixth (haven't tried yet).  Played both modules seperately and together.  they each add some variety,5.0
"Scoundrels of Skullport adds to the original Lords of Waterdeep in almost every conceivable way.  Both expansions included (Undermountain and Skullport) add quite a bit of new material to the game, namely new quests, intrigue cards, building cards, and the Corruption mechanic.  The new Lords, however, are pretty hit or miss to me, with most being boring and one being quite broken.  The ability to play either a long or traditional game adds a lot of depth as well, and the ability to integrate a 6th player is most welcome.

The new rules inset does a good job explaining how to integrate one or both of the included expansions, and also includes a pretty detailed errata which answers most questions that naturally come up during the course of the game.

I really wanted to emphasise how awesome Corruption truly is in this expansion.  It makes you feel dirty and well, corrupt, to pursue such unrestrained power in the context of the game.  It seemed that each game I played with the Skullport expansion was a sheer rush for all players to obtain as much Corruption (and other resources, too, of course) in the early game, and the later portions of the game everyone was definitely managing their corruption and trying to get rid of it (if possible).

This expansion is definitely enjoyable and it's difficult to even think of playing the base game without the expansion now.  Well done, WOTC.",5.0
"My wife and I LOVE this game.  While she was reluctant to play initially, this game immediately took Tzolk'ins spot as our nightly together-time game.  After 20 games 1-on-1 games, its still VERY fun and the outcome of the game is always interesting.  I'm really looking forward to the expansion!",5.0
"It's a great expansion to Lords of Waterdeep, changes up the game in such clever and manipulating ways. It's more than we had expected and most nights, we're up until 5 am playing!",5.0
Adds the perfect amount of depth to an already great game!,5.0
The new favorite amongst the family!!!! Truthfully such an exciting and detailed game!!!!!!,5.0
This is just da bomb board game. Lords of Waterdeep is my fave board game and this expansion adds so much. The corruption tokens and the new spaces really open up a lot of possibilities for the game and enhance the play. I've gotten all my friends hooked so I'll probably be purchasing more of this as gifts in the future!,5.0
"Incredible game.  Definitely worth getting the expansion.  The addition of the skulls adds an extra dynamic to the game that makes it much more enjoyable.  While the game itself is fun, it is a must to get the expansion as well.  Pony up those extra $35 or so and you won't regret it.",5.0
"Update: still Loving this game! A month later and we're still playing it at home from time to time and getting together on occasional weekends to play. Really is alot of fun!

Highly addicting!",5.0
It's awesome,5.0
Great expansion to a great game.,5.0
This expansion improves upon an already great game. My wife and I have always loved the base game and Scoundrels of Skullport has some fun mechanics. There are two playable scenarios but Skullport is more fun for its high risk high reward.,5.0
Lords of Waterdeep is a great game and the expansion makes it even better.,5.0
Great expansion to Lords of Waterdeep.  This expansion adds three different levels of play so you get a lot out of it.,5.0
Awesome worker placement game.,5.0

"Great Game! tons of fun hours, you can play with both extensions at the same time, with 5-6 players, game took 4 hours",5.0
"This is an incredible game. My all time favorite, right after monopoly",5.0
"Love this expansion!

Wife and I really like the base game.  These expansions add all kinds of new strategies without hosing up the balance.  Perfect addition.",5.0
"This is everything an expansion should be - adding fun to the game without baggage, as well as the ability to add that crucial 6th player when you have more friends over than expected.",5.0
"A friend bought me Lords of Waterdeep as a gift and I loved it. Right away bought this expansion. This adds more spaces for meeples as well as corruption. However, you do not need to use all of it. We started without using the corruption and  then added it in the next game. Depending how we feel, corruption will be added in or not. Very good game all in all. Wish there were more expansions.",5.0
This was a gift for my niece and she really loves to read..,5.0
Great addition to lords of waterdeep! very in depth,5.0
"This is an AMAZING add on.  The first time I played Lords of Waterdeep, we played with this, so I thought the skulls and different things were all part of the game.  I was actually a bit disappointed when I played again and it wasn't part of the game.

Lords of Waterdeep is my favorite board game, and this just makes it all the better!",5.0
Best game ever,5.0
"If you love Lords of Waterdeep, you will probably love this expansion.  Lords of Waterdeep is easily in my top 5 favorite games.  The base game plays very well and I will happily play it once or twice a week and don't get tired of it.  In other words - you don't *need* this expansion to enjoy the base game.  (Which bodes well for the game, but not necessarily the expansion.)

So why did I get the expansion?  I mainly got this because I wanted to add in the option to play with a 6th player.  When my sister and her sons come over to play, we're sometimes in the 6 player range and it's unfortunate to make anyone sit out.  Scoundrels of Skullport adds a 6th player as well as two new modules to the game.  You are required (per the rules) to use at least one module any time you are playing with 6 players.  If you're playing with new players, this is easily done by using the Undermountain module.  It adds 3 new buildings to assign your agent to without adding a ton of extra complexity.  There are new buildings, Lord cards, quests, and intrigue cards - but you can simply tack on the extra board and forego all of those.  If you want to use the cards/buildings that come with Undermountain, there will be nothing unfamiliar.  It introduces no new complexities other than some quests which require a ton of ""resources"" for a huge payoff in VP.  This may seem overpowered - but the sheer fact that you're doing those quests means you'll be doing less overall quests.  It really does balance out just as well as the big 25 point quests balanced in the base game.

If you want to add complexity to your game, add the Skullport module.  It introduces a new resource - Corruption.  It, too, comes with new cards and a couple of new boards to sit beside the main board.  I haven't played with this one yet, but definitely think it will add fun dynamics for when we want a slightly heavier 2-3p game.  I won't introduce it to new players until they've played the base game a few times, but at that point I think it could work with 5-6p too.",5.0

"This is the expansion for Lords of Watedeepr&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lords-of-Waterdeep-A-Dungeons-Dragons-Board-Game/dp/0786959916/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lords of Waterdeep: A Dungeons & Dragons Board Game</a>&nbsp;and is NOT a stand alone game.

This expansion is actually two separate expansions (Skullport and Undermountain) boxed into one. It adds in a 6th player option for the core by adding in the Gray Hands faction (with all necessary wooden pieces) as well as additional wooden pieces for the other 5 factions that come in the core game to allow for up to six players. It includes the location boards for Skullport and Undermountain, as well as new Lord cards, quest cards, and intrigue cards for both of the expansions that can either be used with the core game individually or together. Included are rules to allow for a longer version of the game (essentially adding in an extra agent meeple at the start of the game). With the Skullport expansion there is also the introduction of the corruption track - a high reward but potentially high penalty system for obtaining resources in the game.

The expansion adds even more high stakes with not only the addition of the corruption track, but also the addition of 40 point quest cards, further solidifying for the core game that the winner is never really known until final scoring is had at the end of the 8th round. In our gaming sessions, we've had a player win by turning in two 40 point quests over the last two turns, and only winning by a few points.

The have only been two complaints from our gaming group in regards to this expansion. 1) there is a new lord in each expansion that scores by completing missions ONLY from that expansion, and the luck of the draw may not be in your favor when utilizing both expansions with the core set. 2) the physical box, by virtue of not having a big gaming board in it like the core game, will often have its pieces strewn about even with the plastic tray insert.

Other than that, it's a great expansion, and we almost always (like 99% of the time) always use both expansions with the core game when we play.",5.0

"This expansion makes the base game superior in every way, it opens up the fan of options inmensly, the game transforms from making a lot of small effect desicions, to making HUGE moves, that swing the game in the favor of who ever can recognize and take adavantage of them, i played the base game dozens of times and after playing with the expansions a few times the base game feels stale compared with the new level of excitement you get with the expansion.",5.0

"Very good expansion on the original game.  I know several folks have issues with one of the expansion sets, but I really like them both.",5.0
"I loved Lords of Waterdeep and I love this expansion!

First off, Waterdeep was already a great game and didn't need an expansion, but Scoundrels of Skullport just adds so much more to an already great game.  SoS adds two new modules to the game that can be played independently or together.  Undermountain adds in some larger quests and new ways to get resources for those quests, while Skullport adds a new mechanic with corruption.  I really liked the corruption mechanic as it adds a new risk vs reward mechanic take too much and you're gonna regret it in the end, try to stay ""pure"" and you might not get the resources you need to win.

Overall, I rated this a 5/5, everything about it just really enhances the game.",5.0
"Scoundrels of Skullport is a double expansion where one or both parts can be added to the base game to add more worker placement spots.  My group always plays w/ both.
Pros:
-New boards w/ more worker placement areas.
-New Lords, buildings, quests, etc.
-New twist w/ ""corruption"".

Cons:
-Set up and break down of the game is a chore.  For best balance, when playing w/ both expansions, some of the cards are removed from the game.  This means everything has to be sorted before the correct number of random cards can be removed.  You could get around this if you picked your least favorite of these to leave out permanently, but otherwise, these are supposed to be random.
-The Xanathar Lord sucks.  He seems to be a bit handicapped.",5.0
great expansion for a great game,5.0
"This is great if you want to play with 5-6 people as it opens up the game more.

Skullport makes the game a bit more confusing, and our playing group usually doesn't play it.  But we love Undermountain.

Big thumbs up from our group!",5.0
As someone who has spent a lot of time playing Lords of Waterdeep. I LOVE this expansion. It really is three expansions in one. I have played the expansion all three ways and have enjoyed the unique aspects that each added to the game.

"Lords of Waterdeep is a game we play quite often in my house so when we saw that there was an expansion we had to buy it. This is actually 2 expansions instead of just one and both integrate very well into the game. The major selling point for us was that it added a 6th player to the game and since we are a family of 6 that all enjoy this game it allows us all to play without leaving someone out.

I won't go into the mechanics and game play in this review because other reviewers have done that quite well already probably much better then I could.

I will just keep it simple, if you like Lords of Waterdeep this is an excellent addition that will keep the game interesting and adds a lot of extra content and strategy to the game.",5.0

"A must-have expansion set for LoW.  But once you get this expansion, you'll most likely never go back to the original game set.  It unlocks the potential of LoW and really makes it enjoyable.  I couldn't imagine playing LoW without this expansion!  You can't play this on its own; it can only be added to Lords of Waterdeep game for extra enjoyment.

Highly recommended for families; we scoff at games like this in the past, but now our family & extended families are hooked and we play no matter where we visit! Lots of enjoyment!",5.0

"One of the board game review sites rated Scoundrels of Skullport as one of their top ten most essential expansions. They could not be more right. Lords of Waterdeep is already a great game, but Scoundrels of Skullport adds a whole new dimension of playability to the board game. Most importantly it makes it so there are lots of equally good strategies for approaching the game.",5.0
Came as exactly as described. This expansion makes Lords of Waterdeep more fun and more complex.  Love it!,5.0
Awesome expansion... If only it would all fit in one box!,5.0
Outstanding,5.0
"this game requires Lords of Waterdeep to play.  It allows for one more player, but it makes the game so much more enjoyable.  It adds two mini boards to the main board plus skulls.  The skulls allow you to get great rewards which is really helpful, but come at a cost.  It also comes with a bunch of new cards to play with as well (quest, buildings, and intrigue).  Some of my favorite quest and buildings are in this expansion pack.  The expansion rules tell you to take some of the old out, we don't, we just shuffle less.  Everything does not fit in the original box so we keep the game randomly split between the two boxes.  You can choose to only use one expansion board if you like, but then you'll need to sort out the cards that go with the expansion you are excluding.  It also comes with some very challenging Lord cards as well.  WE love this expansion.  It gives you so many more options for play strategy

So if you love lords of waterdeep, bite the bullet and get this expansion.",5.0

Awesome game,5.0
Everything was as promised.  Thanks!,5.0
An amazing expansion to an awesome game.,5.0
"Great addition to the game!  The expansion is actually two expansions in one and allows for 6 players.  I feel that in order to play both expansions at the same time 5 or 6 is the number to play with or the buildings don't really come into play.  The new spaces are quite powerful but do come with some drawbacks to discourage players from using them exclusively.  I lost 81 points the first time I played this expansion, be warned.

The dividers for the pieces isn't as robust as the original and in fact mine came broken.  The color of the cards is slightly different on the back, not too different that they would be noticed from a distance.  The Lords for the expansion are very difficult to get the bonus points with.

Pros:
Extra player
new spaces leading to new strategies

Cons:
Inferior dividers for storage",5.0

Love this. Can expand current game with some new additions or completely change it with the other half the expansion. Has two different expansions.,5.0
Fantastic!!,5.0
This is a must have expansion. The boon of euro style games has brought expansions to base games to the US. Many expansions really aren't that necessary but this is one that really adds a lot of variation to your game play. The base game is fairly basic and is a great entry level worker placement game. With this expansion you add several new gaming elements into the game and make it more of an intermediate game. I highly recommend it.,5.0
Super fun expansion to Lords of Waterdeep. Makes the game longer but adds a whole level of complexity.,5.0
Makes the original game so so so much better,5.0
My husband loves this game.  I even love this game even if I'm not a gamer. I was skeptical at first but now we play this game every day.  Our kids of different age love this.  Our friends and their kids enjoy this game.  We built a game day just for this.,5.0
"Lords of Waterdeep is an awesome game and so are the two expansions included in Scoundrels of Skullport.  While I think that the game becomes 'crowded' when trying to use both expansions at the same time, they are great additions whether used separately or together.  The corruption influence adds a nice mechanic to the game that tends to bite greedy players in the end.  The only minor issue that we have with the entire system has to deal with inadequate scoring and building tokens.  We regularly exceed 200 points before the end game (and >300 rarely) and have had several occasions where there were not enough building owner counters.  Neither are deterrents for such an excellent game however.",5.0
"I'm usually quite skeptical of expansions. But, being a fanboy of the Lords of Waterdeep core game (it's one of the best games out there to be honest - if you like worker placement/euro style games) I kind of felt I ""had"" to buy the expansion.
Guess what? You HAVE to buy this expansion. It's absolutely essential. It brings an intelligent and logical series of additional rules/mechanics that make an already good game, great. I never really felt anything was lacking from the core game in the sense that, ""oh boy, this is only mildly playable but lacks a lot...guess an expansion will be coming soon..."" Which is my main complaint about a lot of expansions (play Lord of the Rings:LCG to understand how a core game lacks key components to fully flesh it out). However, this expansion will make you wonder how you ever got along without it (it's that good - but doesn't feel like ""a fix"" to the core game).
Buy it.",5.0

Great game! Definitely recommend it!,5.0
Loved it! It really brought another level to the game!,5.0
"A must-have for fans of the base game, Lords of Waterdeep. This expansion comes with two ""Modules"", or ways to augment the base game. Each module comes with its own set of buildings, intrigue cards, quests, and lords. There are symbols on the cards to distinguish between ""Base Cards/Buildings"", ""Undermountain Cards/Buildings"", and ""Skullport Cards/Buildings"". Players can choose to play with both modules as well.

The Undermountain module adds a mini-board which provides 3 new locations. The quests involved with Undermountain usually take more resources to complete, but the rewards are greater.

The Skullport module contains 2 mini-boards, one with new locations, and one corruption tracker. Corruption is a new resource with this module. It can help, but it can also hurt.

The expansion comes in a nice box (unlike the base game) and if you remove the insert and put everything in baggies/containers, you can fit everything in the nice new sturdy box.",5.0
"The base game is extremely fun and easy to learn, even to teach to non gamers. I usually don't include expansions when introducing a base game to someone new on a first playthrough, but with this game I absolutely make an exception. This expansion does SO much to enrich the already great experience of the base game, that I would say it is completely necessary to play with the main game. If you have never played lords of waterdeep, you need to, so go buy the main game now! If you have lords of waterdeep, then you probably already have this in your collection.",5.0
I have really enjoyed playing this expansion. It adds a lot of variety and challenge.,5.0
"This is a very well designed and balanced set of expansions to the original Lords Of Waterdeep board game.  Highly recommended add-on for anyone that already has it (and to state the obvious, the base game is required).

This expansion expands the maximum number of players by one and also provides two actual expansions to the base game.  You can use one or both at the same time, however you prefer.  I recommend trying out each expansion separately before using them both at the same time, though.

Both expansions provide additional buildings upon which you can use your agents, most of which are good alternatives to buildings from the base game that tended to be in high demand.  They aren't exact duplicates, however, so there is some give and take as to which may be the best to make use of.  Overall, these lessen the impact that ""blocked buildings"" cause and lets you obtain some resources, especially in the early rounds, that might otherwise by more limited.

The second expansion, which we don't always use, also adds in a sort of ""sell your soul"" dynamic where the buildings provide resources as even greater rates than the base game buildings, but can potentially cost victory points at the end of game.

Both expansions provide new Lords, buildings, Intrigue and Quests cards, and additional agent tokens for not just the extra player, but each of the original colored player tokens.  As with the original board game, the molded plastic is designed to hold all of the items in a specific manner for well organized storage.

Again, I can't recommend this enough to those that have the original board game.",5.0
Great expansion to a great game.,5.0
"This is a really fun game. I can play it with just my husband or with family. My only complaint is the game is a bit long but it is still quite fun.

"I love these expansions. Undermountain contains many big epic quests with high rewards, and encourages generosity when it requires you to place pieces around the board.

Skullport is so lovingly tempting with its corruption. Allowing the big plays to come easy with just a small sidenote of a corruption, it can get out of hand depending on how badly you want some stuff.

The only downsides are the flipped backs of cards and the differences in card sizes. Not a dealbreaker, but I wish they would modify it match and it would just be more seamless in looking better together with the main game.

All in all, each expansion is fun and exciting.",5.0
"Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone. The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability. Everyone appreciates it's pacing as well, as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players. This expansion, Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features. It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game, adding more challenging but more rewarding quests, new lord cards, and new buildings. The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun, and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you've played it often with the same group. All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game. If you enjoyed the base game, this is a must have expansion, and a great value for the price.",5.0
"The box of the base game looks neat, but isn't practical, because you can't fit the lid underneath the bottom. This expansion realized the folly and went back to a normal box shape. The two expansions (Undermountain and Skullport) are lots of fun and add needed variation to the base game. We have played with these expansions dozens of times already, and still enjoy the challenge of each one.",5.0
You can play the expansions one at a time or add then both in for a longer game. If your into Lords of Waterdeep this is a must have.,5.0
Great game lasts just long enough. Great craftsmanship great detail. Not really sure why I waited so long to get back into board games.,5.0
"The Expansions (2 in this bundle), can be played individually or concurrently allowing players a wider range of options. The inclusion of corruption tokens on one expansion board increase agents advantage but reduce overall points means game scores can be a lot higher than with the base game. While the other is just a mix-up of standard board choices. Added buildings and lords add more variables to the game as well, and can bring new life into what might be getting to be a dull game if played too often. As with the base game, good strategy is needed to take most advantage of the added possibilities.",5.0

"LoWD is one of my favorite board games.  I am a hardcore boardgamer...we play games almost every week with my group of friends.

When we tried LoWD with this expansion, it was FANTASTIC!  The corruption added a level of roleplaying none of us expected.  We were saying things like ""I can quit at any time."" and ""I can't help it.  Give me another hit.  I just need it to feel normal""...all the while laughing our asses off.  We would try to screw each other by manipulating how much corruption we had and insulting each other left and right.

Very worthwhile expansion.",5.0
"I used to grudgingly join my daughter and husband in playing ""adventure"" games, but I almost always choose this one if I get the opportunity on a family game night.  More characters, more adventures, more places to gain adventurers and treasure -- plus the added challenge of collecting ""corruption"" points that can reduce your score but help complete more quests -- such a quandary!  This is one of those games that is so much fun to play even if you don't ""win""!",5.0
"I recently played Lords of Waterdeep with some friends and loved it so much I went out and bought it the very next day. The Scoundrels of Skullport expansion adds an additional player (bringing the max total to 6). I mainly bought the expansion for the ability to play with the 6th player, however, I do enjoy the expansion and will play it even with less than 6. The corruption mechanic is a very nice twist and adds a bit of gambling to your strategy. Overall, if you liked the standalone game, I believe you will love the expansion. If you did not enjoy the standalone game, then I think the variety and twists the expansion provides may help you become a fan. Overall, I would definitely recommend it and for $30 it adds a lot of game.",5.0

"If you enjoy the Lords of Waterdeep base game, you'll love this expansion.  With the Skullport and Undermountain expansions it's basically two expansions in one!  While the mechanics are nearly identical, the new cards, buildings, and action spaces completely change the feel of the game.  The Undermountain cards include larger, more difficult quests that can have great rewards, if you can pull them off.  The Skullport corruption tokens can really have interesting consequences.

My wife and I love playing with these two expansions.  We've yet to play with both of them at the same time.  But they're both a great addition to Lords of Waterdeep and definitely worth buying.  Highly-recommended!",5.0
"I really enjoyed these expansions. There balancing can be a bit off, especially with the new lords, but they are still quite nice. Undermountain just adds more options and some variety, but Skullport can really change how the game is play which is always nice to see.

"If you're a fan of the original, you will love the expansion.

As others have described, this is really two expansions. The best of the two is Skullport, which adds a corruption mechanic that changes the game in interesting ways. As we've played, we found it made play more interactive, with a bit more suspense at the end. In other words, more fun all around.

In addition to materials for a sixth player, the buildings in these expansions are more interesting, and provide greater depth to play styles based around the Intrigue cards as well.

Definitely worth it.",5.0

"This game is awesome, period. If you like table top gaming and enjoy the social interaction with friends and family, you'll far more enjoy this game and all it has to offer.",5.0
"LoW the base game has been the *most* popular and replayable board game. It's good enough to play /w 2 people or 5 people.

This expansion (which is really two expansions) makes EVERYTHING BETTER.

You get Skullport (new resource in the form of corruption/-points) and Undermountain (more intrigue, bigger quests) and new lords, intrigue, and buildings appropriate to the new mechanics. You also get a new color to add a new player.

We've primarily played Undermountain and it makes the game MUCH more forgiving when there's more players b/c it's harder to 'lock' a single player out of a key resource. My wife and mother in law don't like the idea of corruption (mom's a little religious/goody goody) so we haven't played it much, but based on reading through the buildings, cards, etc., it adds a lot more volatility to determining who wins in the end.

There's extra agents to play a 'long game' variant, which is nice (broke 200 points once o. O).

Some folks have mentioned issues with the first run (which I think i have). The quest cards are printed 'upside down' compared to the base game. Makes it easier to sort for us afterwards b/c we just sort based on orientation of the back of the card. There are icons on everything so you can easily see which expansion it belongs to.

There's a game mode that lets you play with both expansions, but then you remove cards and buildings from the original expansion, which can give you a lot of different synergies/combos compared to just playing with one expansion.

There are some really cool synergies/combos around certain quests, intrigue cards, and buildings. For example, mom completed a quest that allowed her to draw an intrigue card after she plays one and then there's another building that allows you to play multiple intrigue cards (I think 3) and another quest? I think that gives you victory points for intrigue cards. She literally couldn't use all the intrigue cards she accumulated, but it was pretty fun and cool since we had to change our strategy to try to prevent her from playing intrigue cards.

Finally, there's a intrigue card that allows you to 'steal' resources from an opponent, but then that player gets the intrigue card (so they can 'attack' you back later).

"This expansion pack is a great addition because not only do you get to play with 6 people now if you want you also get new quests that go up to 50 VP in value.

I would say it would be nice if the graphics on the cards were easier to distinguish for when you separate them back out, but that is a minor concern compared to the fun it adds.",5.0
"I ordered this item as a gift for my wife for Christmas, since we enjoy playing the Lords of Waterdeep game together and with our friends. The expansion introduces two new boards, a new faction to allow another player, and there are a host of new quests, intrigue cards, and buildings. There are several new Lords of Waterdeep as well.

We have played four games with the expansion since Christmas, and we are pleased. The addition of the Corruption rules with one of the expansion boards is very well thought out and adds an additional level of strategy. It offers a lot of resources, but if you aren't careful it can sink your chances of winning in the end.

The components are high quality, just like in the original set. As an added bonus, the expansion fits into the original box. If you take the black tray for the expansion out of the expansion box, it fits perfectly over the tray of pieces in the basic box. The expansion lid then fits over it, allowing both the basic game and the expansion to be in one convenient and well-organized box. We were very impressed.

If you loved the original game, this expansion is a great addition.",5.0
"This expansion is great!  It does require the origional game to play, but it adds 2 distinct optional addons and a 6th player (which is key if you have a big family)",5.0

"Scoundrels of Skullport adds a lot of depth, without a lot of complexity. We've been able to play the long game with new players and veterans, and everyone had fun and picked up the rules quite easily. The only downside is that people can get entranced by the corruption locations and dig themselves into a deep hole of points, especially if they are new. It adds additional functionality, expanding the number of players to six, which seems to be much more common in our group these days.",5.0
"I have many of the new games that have come out. In fact, a whole wall top to bottom. Out of all those games, my family and friends have played this one more than many of the games we have. I really really love this game! It is my first pick when people come over to play and they ask what should they play. I recommend this game.",5.0
Excellent game that is fairly easy to learn and has great re-play value. Even my friends that have no idea what Waterdeep is loved it.,5.0
"Lords of Waterdeep by itself is one of the best board games out today.  And if you've had countless hours of fun playing the game by itself just wait until you get your hands on the expansion Lords of Water Deep: Scoundrels of Skullport.
  Its two expansions in one box that  allows you to play with new lords, new quests and a chance to truly get the edge on your opponets.  After getting the chance to play with a few of my freinds and going with only with the Skullport portion we had a game that lasted well over three hours.  This game is also perfect when you want to have six players instead of the standard five as they give you the grey color for the new faction The Grey Hands.  You will never be able to play this game the same way twice ever again.
  Now for the bad news.  I would have liked to have given this review back in August when this game was supposed to be due out.  And after fidning out about a serious amount of delays I didn't get my pre-ordered copy until just this past Monday.  Now this is not in anyway a bashing of game itself.  Its about the long delay and the fact that when this game was open to the public a lot of people were able to get there hands on it.  While those like me took the time to pre-order.  So make sure you check the timetable be fore ordering you may have to wait a while.  In my case close to four months before final getting this oittle gem.",5.0
"My 5 year-old son absolutely loves this game.  He happily plays this over and over (and over and over).  From a parent's view, the storage box is very sturdy, as well as the game pieces.  After a month of daily use, the game still looks brand new.  I would recommend this over the standard Memory game any day.  A must-buy for any little one that loves construction vehicles.",5.0
"Big hit for my great nephew!  Fun playing with him every though every turn was ""HIS"" turn.... LOL",5.0
"Purchased as a gift for my great nephew who is fascinated by equipment/trucks/tractors.  He just turned 3 and seemed to be excited by the gift at his party.  My grandson has enjoyed similar games, and the quality of this one and variety of matches is great and leaves ""room to grow"" mentally as children age since you can add or take away the numbers of cards/equipment you play with depending on the child's ability. .  Good quality and includes some unusual pieces beyond the typical bulldozer and dump trucks.  I would recommend.",5.0
"Great memory game for boys who love construction.  My grandson (3 years) is a little to young to play the memory game yet, but he loves to look at the cards, sort them etc.  The game comes in a nice sturdy box and the cards are good quality too.  I play with with only with 10 card sets right now which is more than his ability.",5.0
"Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game is a quality game that provides far more challenges than conventional matching games.  The pictures to be matched consist of various Cat trucks and diggers, as well as construction signs and equipment/tools used during heavy construction.

The Cat trucks and heavy equipment drawings may be somewhat confusing for those not specifically interested in construction machinery.  However, that was not the case for my grandson who is fascinated by machinery and heavy equipment.  He was thrilled with this matching game and regularly beats the adults in our family who are not as conversant with the subtle differences between various machines.  The particular trucks, diggers, signs or construction tools name is printed on each card of the pair.  The backs of the cards are printed in a black and yellow diagonal stripe design that makes remembering the locations of already revealed items even more difficult.  If you do not concentrate on remembering the position of previously revealed cards, the diagonal-stripe pattern can be even more distracting.

Most matching games feature a maximum of 48 cards (24 matches).  Those cards are flimsy and are not likely to survive childrens enthustic play.  Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game features 72 cards (36 matches); these cards are made of heavy card stock that is approximately 1/16 thick.  The number of matches you choose to use when playing this game can vary depending on the childs age and memory skills.  The box is also very sturdy; it closes using a magnetic flap rather than being a conventional two-piece unit.  Plastic dividers keep the cards organized inside the box.  I appreciate these details since they can add to the games durability.

The card division of Chronicle Books produces Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game.  That company produces a number of different-themed matching games; you should be able to find one that is of interest to your children.  If you are looking for a matching game, you should consider one of Chronicle Books games.  Amazons price is the best I have been able to find for these fine matching games.",5.0
My grandson loves diggers and my daughter is an engineer who supported the Caterpillar account.  This is a perfect gift.  Great fun matching cards and the item is positioned to handle young kids and their rough play.,5.0
We received them today and played right away. We started the matching game by spreading all of them on the floor and picked one to find the match. My 22 months old couldn't have enough of them!  It's a very good educational game. I personally like this game very much because it encourages my little one to speak.,5.0
I was looking for a memory game for my 3 year old grandson and tripped across this.  I can't wait to play it with him on Christmas day. He loves earth moving vehicles. The game pieces are sturdy and the items are labeled-- which is great because I wouldn't want to confuse a backhoe with a front end loader!,5.0

Purchased this game for my son's 3 yo son.  My son didn't think he would be old enough to do it.  He love's it.,5.0
My son is 2 so a little young for the full game. I pull out 10 or 15 o the tiles and we either play memory which some times he figures it out and other times he doesn't.. Which is to be expected. Or else we lay them face up and match that way. I also have him find certain tiles like where is the hard hat. This game is great for expanding their vocabulary! We talk about what each tile is and he repeats what it is. This game will last many many years and I love how many tiles it comes with. You really can make it a challenging game of memory by using all of the tiles. Great game!,5.0
"My 3 1/2 year old grandson saw this at a friend's house and because he is fascinated with construction vehicles, I had to get him one.  I searched on Amazon, my ""go-to store"" and found it immediately at a great price. Delivery was super fast and I can't wait until he opens this for Christmas!",5.0
"The kids love it, dad loves it!

There are too many tiles for my toddlers but we just play with 10 or so at a time and I don't need to stress if we end up losing some so that is to the good.  Also the tiles are thick and durable so my toddlers haven't destroyed them yet!",5.0
The cards are super thick and they hold up to all sorts of abuse!  My little guy already enjoys playing with them so I'm expecting a long shelf life with this game because the pictures are realistic and they seem to be holding up well.,5.0
"Okay, I babysit young boys a lot and bring this along. They love to play it, it's sturdy and has a great box that doesn't collapse. I usually end up playing with about 24 to 30 pieces for the 4 year olds and IF I get to select I pick the items that aren't construction vehicles, like the cone, boots, stop sign, gloves etc. Too many kinds of excavators, shovels, rollers etc for me! But I guess it helps keep the peace since the kids almost always win!",5.0
"Great quality item! Cards are very sturdy, glossy, with great images on brightly colored backgrounds and each item is labeled (""asphalt compactor""). If your child likes construction vehicles, this will be a smash hit. I agree with the other reviewer who said they recommend this over any other memory game. This is hands down the best quality version I have ever seen. The box is nice and sturdy, and the quality of the cards is tops! Definitely a good buy.

My son is 3.5 and can easily play this, but my 2 year old can also play with a limited deck and a short game play time (with help from an adult.) If you're a relative of a kid who likes tractors, this is definitely a parent-recommended gift!",5.0

After the usual round of discussing the rules the game was under way. Shuffle really good or action takes a while.,5.0
"We were a little reticent about this game when we read through the rules.  After a couple of turns it got pretty exciting.  We discovered that a good strategy is to not play land cards as soon as you get them.  It can make a big difference if you play a bunch of them near the end of the game when everyone is tied up fighting for 1 or 2 point lands and you drop and take over a couple of 7 pointers in the last round.

This can be a very cut throat type of game if you play with some aggressive players.  Always get as many players as you can, more players makes a much more interesting game.  Also remember that fates can change at the drop of a hat.  Being achingly close to a victory then having it snatched away by the next player can be frustrating, but then you can do it back to him on your next turn.

Overall a very fun and exciting game that takes more than luck to win.",5.0
"It took two games and a great youtube video from Cat and mouse to understand all the facets.  I played who two people that don't watch the show and were highly entertained.  If you are a fan, the cards actions reference the characters perfectly.  Super fun and can be a quick game if you play the mean/ concerning route.  Lot of different ways to play.  If you love 7 wonders and dominion this card is a collision of both.  Great game!",5.0
"Colorful and full of a simulated adventure, Doctor Who - The Card Game, released by TreeFrog Games and Cubicle 7, is an original design by U.K. game designer Martin Wallace who has been designing games since 2001. Here is a card game that uses cards, Dalek tokens and TARDIS tokens to defend or attack your lands for ownership.

The colorful cards each have very a specific meaning and purpose. The defenders who are The Doctor, Amy, Rory, River Song and even Captain Jack fight for keeping land that you lay down as your property. What land? Imagine every place the Doctor has visited since his run as the 9th through the 11th Doctor (Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith). Lake Silencio, Sardick Town, Silurian City, Bowie Base One, Roman Britain, Luna University and Zarathustra are some of the locations to name a few.

Now the Enemies include the Daleks, Nestine Consciousness, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, Sycorax, Sontarans, The Silence, Davros, the Minotaur, the Beast, Gangers, The Master, Prisoner Zero, the Slitheen and more who all try to take your lands. Oh and watch out for the Dreamlord! He's really dangerous!

Now add the element of support cards to help you fight, defend and in some cases give you special powers and abilities. They are labeled the TARDIS, Sonic Screwdriver, Fish Fingers and Custard and yes they do help immensely!

Cards are dealt out. Then you figure out your lands. Then you place your defenders or attackers and the battle begins. The game is played in turns and what is unique is that you play your hand but you always must have three cards to pass to your player on your right. (Counter-clockwise) The turn continues going to the next person on your left. (Clockwise) In other words you are doing things in two directions. Sounds strange, but it makes for great stagey in playing.

Once you achieved a land, you then place your colors TARDIS token on it. If you are attacking or taking over someone else's land that is not yours, you place your colors Dalek token on it. When the first player gets five TARDIS's or five DALEK's out on table in their color, the game is over and everything stops. However, your lands are worth victory points. Some are low and some are high. The victor is the one with highs points from the lands they have acquired.

It can be vicious and turn on a dime. You could have four lands in one turn and zero the next. It changes with the player and the cards. It's extremely fun and you find yourself acting out scenes from the various enemies and locations you see in your hand. (If you are familiar with Who, of course.)

Its fun for the whole family and you can sit and relax and bring on your `game face' when you are to defend the universe using the Doctor and his companions for help. But beware, enemies abound and trouble is always both in front of you and behind you! Look for it on Amazon.

"First of all, this us a very well made game. The box is very sturdy, the cardboard tokens are thick, the game board is quality and so are the large format cards. The art is also fantastic, some of it lifted from The One Ring rpg, others appear to have been made specifically for the game. The game is very fun and the rules are very easy to learn. I highly recommend this game to any Tolkien fan.",5.0
"Just got back from an evening at the Green Dragon.  I heard some marvelous tales of daring do and adventuresome hobbits.  Lots of fun.  I lured my wife and daughter in to a game, just like Gandalf did with his tale to Beorn.  Before they knew it we were spinning tales with the best of them. The games is very easy to play.  We were all able to quickly use the cards as prompts the store along with hardly a pause or break in the action.

The components are nice with thick stock, nice art, and a sturdy box to carry on adventures.

This game is lots of fun for families.  Can't wait until the next time we visit the Green Dragon.

Lots of fun!",5.0
"This is a great party game! Even though there can only be (up to) five players, it's just as much fun for the spectators because the players are making up tales as they go, and the spectators get to vote on the best tale! A lot of fun, and a great ""pub game"". Highly recommended.",5.0
"As a dad of two boys Im always on the lookout for activities for us to do together.  Something we can all enjoy and equally get into.  We built a Da Vinci catapult, a siege tower, did some exploring with microscopes, geocaching, etc. with varying degrees of interest in one of the two boys.  Dont get me wrong we all had fun, but it was more for one or the other depending on the activity.  My older son, since the day he could, has loved to talk.  He loves to tell stories about things hes done, things hed like to do, or things hes watched.  If he can make a story out of something, he will.  My younger son has, since I can remember, loved to play board games.  There are ones he likes more than others but I don't think weve played a game he didn't like.

I recently became aware of a card/board game by a company out of the UK named Cubicle7.  The game is called Hobbit Tales: From the Green Dragon Inn and it looked very interesting.  Cubicle7 also makes a RPG that takes place in the same world as this game called The One Ring.  The cards in this game can be used with that RPG if desired, so its all very integrated.  The basic premise of the game is that the players are hobbits sitting around a table at the Green Dragon Inn telling stories of their adventures.  The game takes place in rounds (one for each player) and they tell the story with the aid of Adventure Cards (75 of those).  Each adventure card has a story aid, something to inspire the story teller, a title and a Tolkien quote, along with some excellent artwork to really inspire you.  However the other players have similar cards called Hazard Cards (40 of those) that they use to try to throw the story off.  Things like a goblin patrol, or a group of brigands.

This is the real magic of the game, when the players interact with each other in the telling of their (or each others) story.  The goal of course is to score the most points of course but the fun isn't in winning or losing the game at large.  We always count up the points and figure out who won, but thats just sort of a whatever moment.  We really enjoy the interaction and getting to tell a well flowing complete story and the opportunity to interject into others stories to tell a bit of the narrative ourselves.

Of course there are rules that govern when you can play a hazard card, and how you decide if the hazard card was effective, but the rules are so simple it really took no more than a few minutes to get a full mastery of the games rules.  Thats a neat feat all of its own.  Most board games require much more attention to the rules.  Dont I get to shouldnt he  type of questions that make you go back to the rule book and figure out how it works again.  Not so with this.  I haven't opened the rules book since the first read through.

So this game fits both of my boys perfectly.  I cant imagine them liking a game more.  Its a board game and the way you play is by telling stories.  Its almost as if the game was created specifically for my family (Im a LOTR nerd, I admit it).  Ive only had the game for 3 days now and already weve played it probably 10 times or more.  No matter how many times we play it its always different (due to the number of cards there are almost unlimited possibilities).  I imagine well be playing again tonight after dinner.
Oh, and I didn't really get into the artwork on the cards.  It is fantastic.  Some painted; some more like pen and ink drawings.  All of which feels very much like what youd expect in a Tolkien inspired game.  I believe some of it is used in the illustrations in the One Ring manuals as well (the art direction of the game has the same feel even if the game is not the same type of game.

Ive been very impressed by the selections Ive seen from Cubicle7 so far.  Im going to have to look into more of their products rather than just the ones in my wheel house (again, Tolkien nerd here).  But do yourself a favor and find this game and buy it.",5.0

"Oh this is just so fun for child and story teller.  I bought the paperback book, the old lady, and the bean bag animals.  I liked this story as a child and remember it making me laugh, and now I can read it to my 2 year old and laugh with her.  The doll is just like the book and her mouth is wide and stomach deep enough to fit all the bean bags.  The mouth is the only opening so you'll have to remove the animals through there as well.  Although I wish the doll had a velcro opening in her belly to remove the animals.  The bean bag animals aren't very creative, just a picture on a piece of cloth that's cut in near shape of the picture, filled with beans.

Overall I'm very happy and for me it was worth the expense, for everything it came out to $34.77",5.0
My son loves this story and this allows him to act it out.  Comes with an audio CD that compliments the doll.,5.0
"I can't recommend this toy enough! I bought the book and the beany toys to match and it's just fantastic! All the animals fit in the mouth and tummy just fine (previous review told me they didn't) It's unbelieveable the exact replication of detail to the book, right down to the lollies in her pocket.
When I first put all the beanies in her mouth I did have to pull down her underpants to check if that is where they would come out...Haha!...Well you will too!
This is positively the best combination of toys I think I have ever bought.  Books are huge in our family and when you have either puppets or holes or flaps in books it gets kids thinking more want you to read again and again.

It it cloth, about 18"" tall, removable outer coat and has an open mouth that has a very deep throat to accommodate all the the cloth animals that she swallows.

"I really liked this book. Simple statement of fact-I don't know Michael Thal, but I do now know more about deafness and how folks with hearing loss get through a day. I ached for David as he faced new school situations, signing, the aching loss of his music, and growing up in an entirely different way than he'd ever imagined. But, central to my experience as a writer for kids of all ages was how universal Thal made his character's experience. David is deaf, but he's so relatable as we all remember the terror of starting a new school, the pain of losing a friend, the sweetness of a first love, and the `oops' things we all do growing up. How do any of us survive? We do it like David, just by hanging in there, being willing to try something different, and listening even when you can't hear. Kids or adults, this is an appealing book for all.",5.0
"An inspirational story well told.  The story of a teen born with a natural gift, losing that gift, and finding the strength to overcome his loss and live life to the fullest.

When twelve year-old budding violin virtuoso David Rothman wakens from sleep the day after his birthday celebration, he is greeted with a devastating gift.  David cannot hear a thing.  He is deaf. How ironic.
Goodbye Tchaikovsky is the story of Davids journey from the depths of self pity and despair to the height of embracing life.  The story follows David through his teenage years as he turns from his passion, the violin and struggles to cope with his hearing loss while encountering the tremendous pressures all teenagers face. Will David triumph?  Will David grow and embrace life or will he fail?

This story is especially meaningful for all teenagers, who are beginning to face lifes challenges at the same time that they are adjusting to peer pressures and their self images.  I highly recommend this book by Michael Thal, himself a hearing impaired retired teacher.  Michael, who lost his hearing later in life, has firsthand knowledge of his protagonists handicap and struggles.",5.0
"On David Rothmans 12th birthday he was a virtuoso violinist with the California Youth Symphony. His future in music was already mapped out ahead of him, from special schools for gifted musicians to one day playing solo at Symphony Hall. The day after his birthday his world came crashing down around him. A hereditary condition had robbed him of his hearing. Overnight David went from perfect pitch to deafening silence. He was devastated by a grief that nearly destroyed him.

Goodbye Tchaikovsky"" is a coming of age story with a twist. As David deals with the normal struggles of growing up, his profound hearing loss forces him to begin his life all over again. He feels like he doesn't fit in the hearing world because he's deaf and he doesn't fit in the deaf world because he can speak. By learning American Sign Language (ASL) he finds a way to cope and gradually his two worlds come together. But he still must face the hardest question of all. What will he do with the rest of his life?

As someone who is hearing impaired, I feel Good-Bye Tchaikovsky is an authentic portrayal of the challenges involved with sudden hearing loss. In telling David's story, Michael Thal has created a survival guide for young people who are hearing impaired.",5.0
"Michael Thal has written a beautiful novel. It's a must read for middle schoolers and up. Goodbye Tchaikovskytells the remarkable, eye- opening journey of David Rothman, a boy who suffers permanent hearing loss at the tender age of twelve. Thal's way of showing both hearing and deaf worlds is amazing and how they affect someone going through this tragedy. David Rothman struggles to accept he can no longer pursue his passion--music, and worries how he will fit in when neither deaf nor hearing people totally accept him. His future, his dignity, his sense of purpose hangs by a thread. But David has the help of a family member and friend to push him through the first difficult years, to assimilate into school and the throes of relationships. The reader travels from David's early adolescence all the way to graduation and the beginnings of college, and they get to rejoice in his journey, stumbles and all. Goodbye Tchaikovsky is a quick read with believable characters and snippets of other cultures--Judaism, Japanese families, and the culture of the Deaf world. When reading this book, it really opened my eyes to the feelings and thoughts going on inside the mind of someone who is deaf, fighting to be recognized in a hearing world. Excellent job, Michael Thal!",5.0
"It's not often that a book aimed at ""Young Adults"" makes me want to cry. Michael Thal managed this with his story of David, a violin virtuoso who suddenly went profoundly deaf the day after his twelfth birthday.

Goodbye Tchaikovsky is excellent on many levels.

First, obviously, it is an introduction to what it is like to be deaf in a hearing world, presented so the young reader identifies with Davids experiences on an emotional level.

Second, it is a primer on empathy. ""What if that happened to me?"" Michael's choice of hero is perfect. The underlying message is, ""What if I lost the ability to do the activity that gives me meaning in life, joy and purpose?"" A teenager with a passion for basketball might imagine what it would be like after breaking his neck, another who lives for computer games may think of blindness or a paralyzed hand...

Third, Michael deals with the issue of stigma and discrimination, showing that, whether you are Christian or Jewish, ethically Japanese or Caucasian, deaf or hearing, you deserve respect, compassion, decency, and love.

If you, or someone you care for, are struck by a handicap such as deafness, you can draw instruction and inspiration from this book. However, any teenager will enjoy reading about David's journey, and benefit from the underlying lessons within Goodbye Tchaikovsky.",5.0
"First of all, I want to note this book is probably one of the most powerful stories for tween and teen boys I've ever read.

David Rothman loses his hearing at the age of twelve to a hereditary problem he knew nothing about. There is no warning, no gradual loss. One day, David is rejoicing after a virtuoso solo performance at Symphony Hall in New York. His performance receives rave reviews, and he's excited about a future performance for the Queen of England in London. David returns home to celebrate his twelfth birthday, and the next morning he wakes up deaf.

Michael Thal brings us this story of personal triumph giving way to disaster into the forefront. His character, David, lives and breathes the violin. He is a hardworking prodigy, but now his world is forever silent. The reader experiences David's loss as he does. We walk the sad path where he stumbles, but he picks himself up with assistance from unexpected sources. Sometimes, adults show David the way, but as he slowly accepts his disability and makes his own decisions about his future, he finds himself on a path far different from what he once envisioned.

Adversity is something people face daily. Thal weaves a tale of overcoming an overwhelming and terrifying situation with grace and humor. I recommend this book not only for tween and teen boys, but also for their parents, grandparents, and families. David's courage as he straddles the hearing and deaf worlds shines throughout the story.

On a personal note, I connected with this story from the parallels in my own life. My teenage son had an accident in middle school, where he punctured an ear drum. He plays the saxophone  alto, tenor, and is currently learning the baritone. We held our breath until he healed, but I could see myself in the place of David and his mother easily. Thank you, Michael Thal, for this moving tale of overcoming a major obstacle.",5.0
"I love these flashcards. They have very realistic, colourful pictures on them. There is a word that accompanies each picture both next to the picture and on the backside. The cards covers a wide range of topics such as body parts, places, objects, clothes, animals, and colours.
I started using these cards with her at 3 months old. Even then she was captivated by the pictures and listening to me go though them. At 16 months she is now seeking out her flashcards and can point or show me which body part the card is describing. She has started associating the picture on the flashcard with things in her environment. I can tell the cards have turned into something she really enjoys doing on her own.
My only regret is that I didn't laminate the cards when I first purchased them. I will be purchasing them again and laminating them. I see these cards being something we use for years to come.
Let me also say that I never had a concert every day regime for these cards. They were brought out when I thought about them until my daughter got old enough to get them her self.
Looking forward to using these cards in new and different ways as she gets older.",5.0

"Does this do everything it's advertised to do?  Well, I can't prove to  you if my left and right brains are communicating better, but I can tell you that the ball of whacks gives you an often much needed literal and figurative ""timeout"" so you can contemplate the big picture and the little details.  From a sensory perspective, it's fun to manipulate the pieces and I like to leave myself signals (sharp points or rounded symmetry) of my mood on the table.  Shapes change as do my moods; a good tool for developing EQ.  The use of magnets/magnetism as part of the problem solving or creative exercise comes close to the ""stacrobats""  concept, but instead of soft figures and balls, you have all these wonderful points and pieces that reward the auditory and tactile sense with a satisfying ""snick"".  Enjoy - have a ball!",5.0

It has attracted a lot of attention from colleagues, and several have ordered their own after just a few minutes of playing with mine.

"I received my Ball of Whacks about a week ago and have trouble putting it (ok, them) down.  Interacting and playing with it is extremely addictive and I have hooked my boss and another coworker by giving them each one.

When I was younger I made crystal models out of marbles and geodesic domes out of cardboard and remember the excitement of uncovering different relationships between the shapes.  The Ball of Whacks is bringing back that feeling of exploration and discovery and has quite a few patterns built into those 30 pieces.  I forgot how much fun I had doing those explorations as a kid and can't figure out why I ever stopped.  The Ball of Whacks includes the symmetries of all five platonic solids if you play with it long enough.

I would suggest getting a couple of them - at least one for your desk and one for playing at home.  You may need extras to share with family and colleagues and they are fun to combine into larger constructions as well.

In creative problem solving sessions with coworkers I like to bring in various toys both to stimulate their playfulness and to change their environment a bit.  I am looking forward to trying out the BoWs in my next session although I am a bit worried that I might not get them back readily.

Awesomely fun and gets the brain juices flowing too!!!",5.0
"If you only employ one creativity-enhancing resource for the rest of your life, make that resource the Ball of Whacks!

Breakthroughs in effective creativity-inspiring methods seldom occur.  Most ""new"" methods are simply restatements or reshapings of ideas that flourished among the ancient Greeks (such as Heraclitus, a favorite source for Mr. von Oech) or before.  Those who are familiar with the earlier work usually don't gain much from the newer approaches.  The Ball of Whacks is a happy exception.  Heraclitus would say that you can never interact with the Ball of Whacks twice in the same way.  And he would be right.

The most valuable creativity-enhancing methods I've experienced usually require having a team work together, with one of the tasks involving making little models or prototypes of creative concepts.  I often find myself wishing I could have those experiences more often . . . but seldom having the right people and time to pursue that desire.

Then, I discovered Roger von Oech's Ball of Whacks. Wow!

My frustrations are now behind me.

This is day 8 of working with the Ball of Whacks.  It's been quite an education.  I can hardly wait to find out what I'll learn on day 9!

When you first see the Ball of Whacks, you won't quite know what to make of it.  Open the box, take out the ball, the magnetic stand and the workbook.

Then, let yourself go.  Discover what the ball is.  To the geometrically inclined, you'll notice that it's a rhombic triacontahedron (try saying that 5 times fast!), a ball-like shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red.  The ball feels somewhat alive, however.  It gives when you squeeze it and resumes it shape when you stop squeezing it.  As soon as you take out a piece, you'll discover that the ball is composed of 30 design blocks that use magnetism to adhere to one another.

As you take the pieces apart, the ball disappears and many regular and irregular shapes occur. Usually, that's the end for me.  I can never recover the original shape (my Rubik's cube is still a mess!), but the ball is easy to reform (if I can do it, you can too).

I like abstract shapes and I was pleased to find that the magnets act both to attract and repel the pieces. Unlike Lego pieces, connections can be made in all kinds of odd ways.  I also noticed that the pieces often reshape themselves, almost organically, as they choose a different connection than the one that I initiated. The casual results are often better than my planned ones.

Based on a suggestion in the workbook, I began mixing in other objects that could be held by the design blocks.  The results were infinitely more interesting and rewarding than anything I'd ever created before.  I felt a great sense of peace from the experience.  Many people had told me I would like sculpting, but I lacked the confidence to try.  With the Ball of Whacks, I felt like a super sculptor . . . but without any lessons.

After several days of working on abstract shapes, I decided to try geometric shapes.  These were paradoxically harder to do in many cases.  The magnetism sometimes fought me.  I had to design clever solutions to create the regularity I wanted to see.

I also left the Ball of Whacks out to see what others would say.  Everyone noticed that I kept changing it.  Without thinking, rewarding new designs would emerge in a few seconds.  I gained confidence in my creativity involving forms.

At the same time, I was working on a number of non-physical problems.  Soon, I began seeing metaphors in the blocks and my designs for those problems.  New and better solutions began to flood my mind.

Feeling like I should read more of the workbook, I now found myself intrigued by the directions for how to use the Ball of Whacks to expand my creative repertoire.  I began to see huge gaps between the methods I prefer to use, gaps that I could easily explore and understand with my new appreciation of my creativity habits.

Best of all, the lessons are deeply ingrained.  The human nervous system is mostly made up of connections between the hands and eyes to and from the brain.  By both holding and seeing what I was working on, the exercise connects more parts of my brain and experience.  I find totally different memories being stimulated, especially those from the sandbox and while playing with modular toys.

Today, I went back and totally redid a book proposal I'm working on.  I was astonished to see that my mind was connecting those little blocks from The Ball of Whacks into new ways of assembling the pieces of the proposal.  I would never have expected that.

What does the name mean?  I don't think there's just one meaning.  It obviously sounds like ""ball of wax"" which is something that warms and becomes malleable in our hands.  I'm reminded of the red wax that you peel off of Edam cheese to form shapes.  At another level, a ""whack"" in von Oech's vocabulary is a way of getting you to let go of artificial assumptions.  In that sense, this is a tool to give you lots of whacks.  And it does.

I haven't done all of the exercises yet, but I plan to.  Each of the ones I've done has been quite an eye-opener.

Here's a tip.  Turn off the TIVO while you're watching television and use the commercial breaks to play with the Ball.  The baseball playoffs are excellent for this purpose because you get all kinds of short delays.

Be smart.  Give a Ball of Whacks to each of your children rather than purchasing another toy.  You'll inspire genius that will constantly fascinate you.",5.0

""This is a ball shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red.""  Wiki

My grandson has always had an ability to see shapes and develop them into something original.
He has always liked Legos and moved on to more difficult shapes and products to satisfy his artistic and scientific self. For his birthday, he asked for this Ball of Whacks. Well, this has turned into one of his more interesting projects. I think he needs another two or three. He has created such diverse objects as dinosaurs, animals, turtles, sun, stars, fruits, and more artistic objects he has his own names for.

To say he likes this Ball of Whacks is a misnomer. He brings it with him, the car, park, friends, wherever. Everyone who sees him with it wants one of their own. He really should get a percentage from the owner.  He tells me he is fascinated with the shapes, to see what he can build. He has the kind of mind that can explore any possibility.

The Ball of Whacks Is made up of 30 magnetic design blocks that can be taken apart and rearranged. There does not seem to be any end to the shapes you can make. Accompanying the Ball Of Whacks is a 96 page booklet. This gives you Ideas of what kind of shapes you can make, and how to open your mind. For creative people this is a windfall, and for us, regular folks, it can open our minds from the most concrete manner of thinking to go and explore the possibilities.

I couldn't imagine why they thought it was so fascinating because I don't do well with these kinds of things, but the others did. In fact, the larger, more expensive Christmas gifts were ignored quite a bit of the time because they couldn't stop playing with this.",5.0
This was a gift for my grandson just turning 12.  He had so much fun with it making different shapes.  Us grandparents enjoyed it too but had a hard time getting a turn!,5.0
Bought this for my 11 year old who loves puzzles and Rubik's cubes. Would be great gift for someone's office. Terrific magnets. Well made and worth the price.,5.0
"The first thing anyone who sees this for the first time is going to say is ""WHAT IS IT ?"" You'll quickly come to the conclusion that's a question much easier to ask than to answer. I guess the answer really is,""It's what ever you want it to be.""
  I went to my Synonym Finder and here are just a few of the names I came up with. They are all names we have used,most aren't even in the dictionary,and any one of them could be used to describe this ""thing"". Doohickie,dojigger,gizmo,whachamacallit,thingumajig,flumadiddle,widget,
thingumabob,are all pretty good names;but the inventor chooses to call it a ""Ball Of Whacks"";so I guess that's what it is.
 The pictures and descriptions describe it as well as anything But what to do with it is the question. It comes with a small book of 96 pages that describes how and why Roger von Oech invented it and what you can do with it. He describes the very interesting mathematics that is the basis of the shapes of the pieces or ""whacks"".To mathematicians,the Golden Ratio,the 30 sided rhombic triacontahedron ,and such have always fascinated scientists and are found many places in art and nature,and in this ball.
 The inventor also explains what great creative qualities can be found with the ball. The book shows the inventor with a young Buddist monk creating a sun sculpture.
This ball will fascinate anyone who picks it up,be they young,old, inquisitive or simply someone who likes to hold,handle and play with things. As soon as one realizes that reassembling it is not nearly as difficult as one might imagine;then the creative juices start to flow and they try to see what they can form. The book gives a lot of sculptures or forms to make;but in no time ,one wants to try their own ideas.
 My ball has all the same colored ""Whacks"",(red) ;but it comes in several colors and even in multi colors,where the various colors would add a whole other dimension to the creativeness of ""Ball Of Whacks"".This product is excellently made,will provide endless hours of enjoyment,relaxation and creativeness for anyone who picks it up.",5.0
"I bought this because a colleague of mine had the ""Google version"" of the Ball of Whacks (exactly the same, but with ""Google"" printed in each piece), but since they don't make those anymore, I settled with the original one.

I was immediately drawn to it when I first saw it, and as soon as I got mine, I realized it was pretty ingenious and fun. I knew I was going to like it, what took me by surprise was my wife's reaction. She loved it so much, she constantly makes these awesome figures and puts them on our coffee table to leave there as decoration! Of course, I am reluctant to mess up her art, and you can't imagine the face she made when I told her I wanted to take the ball to my office (she's even planning on getting a metal tray and some other magnetic accessories to make into an interactive art station for our living room!). Thus, I just had to come back for a second one and this time I'm keeping it at the office, where it was originally meant to be.",5.0
"This thing is fun when you first get it.
Although you get bored after a while.
But definitely offers respite when you are having a mental block
and need a quick diversion to clear your head.",5.0
"The Ball of Whacks is an excellent ""fiddling"" toy. As I kid I loved playing with magnets and I've always enjoyed geometric art, so the BoW is perfect for me. $30 is pretty steep for a time-waster, but it was worth it.",5.0
This is a great toy to release stress on and use your creative side to imagine different shapes.  Just fun to do.,5.0
"I'm a high school math teacher who can't keep my Ball of Whacks on my desk at school for long.  I bought it last year, and my students went crazy over it!  This year's students love it, too.  Two comments:

a) The kids make any pattern they choose; in other words, they all ignore the booklet that comes with it.  However, they drop pieces (accidentally) often; one piece was lost last year under an immovable object . . .  Having 29 instead of 30 pieces has made no difference in the popularity of the Ball of Whacks, however.

b) The dang thing is so popular that pieces of it have begun to disappear this year.  I honestly think, unfortunately, that people are stealing 2 or 3 pieces at a time, to fiddle with in their pocket or whatever.  I did not have that problem last year at all, but so far this year (and it isn't Thanksgiving yet!), my 29 pieces have shrunk down to just 20 pieces.  I've considered buying a new Ball of Whacks because the kids like it so incredibly much, but I hate to encourage stealing . . .  Now that Amazon has it on sale, however, I may break down and buy another.

Also: I just received an e-mail from a parent of one of my students, asking for the name of Ball of Whacks.  Apparently he has talked about it so much at home that she wants to get him one for Christmas!",5.0
I put this in my husband's Christmas stocking. He loved it and found it quite addictive. He keeps it on his desk at work and his co-workers find it and play with it when they come into his office. It was a big hit!,5.0
"The Ball of Whacks can be a valuable tool for distraction and refocusing the mind during pain due to illness and disease.  My teenage son has suffered a condition that causes him intermittent pain, anxiety and distress.  I am continually looking for something to occupy his attention during such painful times.

I have noticed that in mild to moderate pain, playing with the Ball of Whacks beautifully distracts him.  His face relaxes, and he is engaged in creativity more than reactivity to pain, which seemingly allows his body to regroup as the pain often dissapates.

I suggest that the Ball of Whacks be more broadly considered a tool in 'pain management' for certain people and conditions.  I could also imagine its usefulness in a hospital or clinic setting, like for individuals waiting to undergo chemotherapy.  We are very grateful for this addition to wholistic care for our son!",5.0
"I'm a tacto-phile, as well as a magno-phile, and this 'toy' is an excellent blend of creativity, simplicity and fun! The look and feel of the individual pyramids is very pleasant, and the fun of being able to take it apart and see what you can create is a blast! I wish I had two (or three!)

One word of warning to parents: Kids will want to play with this. I make it a point to never let my kids play with mine unless I am watching them closely, because the pieces would fit in a mouth, and are pointy enough that they could cause pain if applied incorrectly.",5.0
"Magnets are just plain cool.  We have our Ball of Whacks sitting on the coffee table and all of my son's friends pick it up and start messing with it.  The challenge is to come up with a new design - it's not easy!  There's a flying squirrel in the book, but we've not even got that far!",5.0
My kids love this toy.  There are so many ways to play with it -- the magnets add an extra dimension to the creativity.,5.0

This is one of the best toys I have found in a long time. I bought 5 for x-mass presents and found my two boys 3 and 5 yrs old had opened 2 of them and were so engagued with playing with them how could I get upset. The patterns are  great and there is no wrong construction. Young kids need a little supervision so pieces don't end up all over. Highly reccomend this toy/puzzle",5.0
"This is just a fun, creative toy.  It starts as a ball and comes apart into mini ""pyramid-like"" pieces.  From here, you can use your imagination and create new objects (animals, stars, etc.).  It also has a strangely soothing feel when you are putting it back together.

The only drawback is that the magnets could be a little stronger.  Sometimes it is hard to get your new creations to stay together because they slip.  However, overall this is a really cool toy.  Good for kids and adults.",5.0
"This game is a winner! I ordered this game months ago just from the description, having never heard of it. We've given it as a gift to numerous people, and now friends and family members also find it a favorite and are buying it for others. Have a dictionary on hand....there's always someone who comes up with a word you've never heard of...and someone else raising his or her eyebrows. Fans range in age from 10 to 70. It's very hard to find in stores, so buy it here.",5.0
"Monopoly is fun, but it takes FOREVER to play, those trivia games are too hard for the kids, Dad can't even draw a stick figure, let alone play Pictionary, and you don't want to spend an hour just setting up an elaborate game and reading the instructions.
So what's the solution?  Play QUIDDLER!!  Our family loves this game - you can complete a whole game in an hour or less (or you could stop half-way through and finish the game the next evening).  In Quiddler, you create words, but unlike Scrabble, it's not always the one with the best vocabulary who gets the most points.  You try to make words out of all your letters - there might be a long word which gets lots of points, but it might be little brother over there who is able to make several short words who gets the ""most words"" bonus and jumps ahead of everyone else!
We played this game last night and were surprised how fast things change - someone who is way ahead after the 3rd round can be behind after the 4th.  Just one round can dramatically change things!
Pick a dictionary and let that be your judge on whether or not something is a word.  Be sure to find the dictionary BEFORE you start playing because you'll need it!
We've played this game with 4, 5, and 6 people.  Anywhere from 1 to 8 people can play -  now that's a versatile game!
This is one game where a child isn't necessarily at a disadvantage when playing with adults.
The cards are beautiful - be sure to take time during your fun family evening to notice them!
After loving this game, I bought Set for Christmas and we're going to play this one tonight! ... .",5.0
"We've been playing this game for about 18 months now, and it's still as popular as ever with us.  We're a family of 5, with the youngest playing since he was six years old - and winning more often than I thought he could!  And of course, we've all had our vocabularies expanded without trying, but we haven't let on that this is an educational game. Folks who aren't confident in their vocabulary, don't despair!  Two- and three-letter words can win the game as well as much larger words. If you like Perquacky, Scrabble, and that sort, you'll love this much-more-portable word game.",5.0
"Scrabble is one of my wife's favorite games, but since I purchased this a few weeks ago, she now begs me to play Quiddler.  We're both former English  majors and enjoy trying to outwit each other.  I enjoy Quiddler because it  seems you always have a chance to win, even if you start out with a  negative score.  We also took this game to the beach with us a few weeks  ago and our friends loved it.  I highly recommend it.",5.0
Good source of words for quiddler,5.0
best game ever. Never gets old!!,5.0
"This game is a lot of fun. My wife and I play with our 11 year old and despite my superior intellect (kidding), everyone has won a couple games. Beyond that, however, these cards can be used for literacy-building and team-building games in the classroom! You get 118 cards with individual letters or common two-letter combinations (QU, IN, ER, TH & CL)
with a point value reflecting its use in English words. Ive come up with three other ways to use this deck and I hope to have more to share with my AVID teachers!",5.0
"I find this to be useful tool in adult therapy at the hospital. I use this as a more artsy, fun, and less intimidating (than scrabble) word-finding, working memory-scaffolding, language building, social activity for post-brain injury patients. There is math too, which can be utterly ignored...or not. People from their 20s to their 90s seem to enjoy this game. It can be simplified to meet a variety of abilities, and tasks can be added on to increase the therapy-to-fun blend.",5.0

This word game is a little addictive!  It's fun for adults down to children that are just learning to spell as you can play using 2 and 3 letter words.  Also just as fun with two players.  It moves pretty quickly though a round of hands so isn't a big time commitment to play.  Easy to learn as well.,5.0

"I love this game! it is engaging for all but perhaps the youngest grades of readers. The artwork on the cards is absolutely beautiful. This game is sometimes compared to Scrabble. I'm personally pretty poor at Scrabble, which I find opaque, limited, and unforgiving. I find Quiddler is much friendlier, certainly as challenging as Scrabble, but with increasing opportunities to make words and phrases.",5.0

"OMG, don't hesitate to buy, we play so much that we have to replace at least once a year, have purchased several as gifts, travels well, for the Scrabble lover but a quicker and more convenient game, beware, it's highly addictive, we've been playing for a least 10 years, travels all over the world with us.",5.0
We love this game. It's different from Scrabble type word games and doesn't take as long to play one round. But it requires thought and strategy. Even our friends who don't play games like this one.,5.0
"I still love a good old-fashioned game of Scrabble, but for once I've found a small game that I think might beat it.  While not in a tin or sturdy box (why oh why don't all card games come in more rugged, re-use friendly containers?) the Quiddler cards are high quality and the two stacks fit nicely back into the cheap cardboard box because they provide a small plastic card holder. The game works in rounds where you try to score as many points as possible by building words, and each round adds additional cards to the mix. It's a snap to learn, fun to play, and an absolute must for fans of Scrabble.",5.0
A must have for game.  But be careful as a lot of people think the time to refer to the book is when it is their turn!!,5.0

This game is a lot of fun and the price was amazing.  I've seen the same game in stores with a little fancier packaging for three times the price.  Great deal,5.0
"This is a fun word game for young and old alike. In each round, the person who makes the MOST words gets a 10-point bonus score, as does the person who makes the LONGEST word. Each card (either a single letter or a letter combination, such as QU or CH, etc.) has a numerical value, so the total of those add to one's score. Also, whatever cards one has left in their hand after a last turn when someone else plays all their cards and discards to ""go out,"" count against one's score for that hand. The family can decide in advance how many rounds to play.",5.0
"Good quality cards. Very fun game. Great for all ages over about 8. We play without scoring with kids, and it's pretty cut throat for the adult scrabble and boggle fanatics.
Really love this game and we play it as a family about 2-3 times each week - probably 10 times as much as all our other games.
Highly recommend of you like words, spelling, and the strategy of points.",5.0

A very nice...and useful book...for making Quiddler an even more educational card game than it already was...,5.0
"If you like word games and haven't played Quiddler, you need to get a set and enjoy it. It is simpler and takes less time to play than Scrabble and is easier to transport than any board game. This is our second set of Quiddler cards and when we wear this set out we will be ordering our third set.",5.0
"We LOVE this game! The cards are beautiful and the game is so easy and fun. I managed to win a round pretty quick when I was dealt a hand with the word ""ectopic"" plus one extra letter. It's basically Scrabble without the board and is a much shorter game that can be played once in less than a half hour or over and over again. Great if you're a language geek, really fun even if you're not.",5.0

"If you enjoy word games, I'm guessing that you'll love Quiddler. It's essentially a cross between Scrabble and Rummy, but I would say there's more strategy in Quidder than in either of those games. The game is very easy to learn, but very difficult to master. After playing the game many times, I would offer the following tips: 1) As others have suggested, don't use a dictionary during ""main"" play. Just use one to resolve challenges, or to check spellings of words after a round has been completed. It makes the game much more challenging; 2) When playing with two players (which is the scenario where only one of the bonuses is used), use the bonus for longest word instead of the bonus for most words; 3) Don't allow slang words, as they make it too easy to use high point cards; 4) If some players take too long, feel free to employ some sort of time limit for turns. The game is much more enjoyable when it moves briskly.

All in all, the game is fantastic. I've given copies to about 4-5 friends as gifts. It's the most enjoyable word game I've ever played, and I was a Scrabble geek as a child!",5.0

Drag the rounds out, hoping for high counters, or go out immediately and catch your opponents with a potential bad hand. Every round from three cards to the final round of ten brings a new dynamic to the game.

"I'm not very good at spelling. My wife loves word games. So usually that's not a good mix. However, this game is so fun! It's easy enough that I can win quite a few times when we play. It's a super fun game, we have brought it to parties and everyone loves it. Great out of 10",5.0

"My youngest is dyslexic, it took him a long time to be able to read because he can't learn by phonics. He's in fourth grade now, and his comprehension is at a sixth grade level, but he's heavily reliant on ""sight words."" This game is great for memorizing new ones and reviewing ones he may have forgotten.",5.0
I bought this for my sixth grade class. They love it! Is a fun family game for kids around 8 up to adults. Similar to Gin Rummy but with letters instead of suits. Bigger words = more points.,5.0
My friend first taught me this game less than a year ago. It's now my favorite and I play it often!,5.0
Great game for the word buff. Less time consuming than Scrabble.,5.0

"Blast! Kids 11, 9, & 7 stay interested & unplugged. No regrets. High quality materials.",5.0
"Our family absolutely love this game! We play it one on one or as a family, sometimes with extended family as well (aunts, grandparents) and everyone love it!
Your goal is to create words from your letter cards. Each card is worth a different amount of points and you try to create words that worth the most points. You write down the score of each player and add it at the end to see who won by getting the highest amount of points.
It's easy to understand the rules, so you can get in the game quickly even if it's the first time you're playing it. The game can be as short or as long as you want and the kids (and some adults too) learn a lot of new words from it. Very enjoyable and highly recommended from ages 8 and up.",5.0

"This is the most awesome game!! I highly recommend it! I stumbled across it in a cabin we were staying in for the weekend. I immediately came on here and ordered it. It's an easy, fast game that can change at any minute! No having to pay close attention to numbers like in other games we play. Get it! You won't regret it!",5.0
"This has been a really fun family game!  We all enjoy word games.  This is light enough you can keep the TV on in the background, and chat when not playing, but requires thought and planning - and then some luck!  It doesn't take too long either - you can do a quick round and move on to other things if you like.",5.0
This is a super fun card game.,5.0
"This is a family-friendly, fun card game similar to Scrabble, but without a board. You make one or more words out of the cards you're dealt, picking up a new card and discarding and old one each time you go around. It's very uncomplicated and straight forward.

But there's something a little more interesting about this game...

First some background: my siblings and I all love word games. Scrabble, Banangrams, Boggle, Words with Friends, crossword puzzles, you name it. My mom -- the world's greatest crossword puzzle solver -- passed down to us an interesting ability to see words in a pile of letters. So naturally, we're skilled and competitive at word games.

Despite this, for some unknown reason, those of us that tend to be the best at word games consistently finish in last place with this game! Those without the special gift for words tend to win! I still haven't figured out why, but it's become the great equalizer for us.",5.0
"If you like word games this is a great game. We had a wonderful time playing. Easy rules, lots of fun.",5.0
"This is one of our favorite games. You can make your own rules, change the rules or make different variations of the rules. We played it for hours without getting board, each time switching up the rules to make the game more fun, challenging and intensed. It's also small enough to travel with. Small game but lots's of fun!!!",5.0
have played Quiddler for about 20 years - still love it - a great game for kids and adults,5.0
"Bought this as a gift for Christmas.  My family raves about it and says it's better than Scrabble, one of our all time favorites!",5.0
"This is a great game! I love games that people of different ages can play together. It's not a kids game, but I think any child that can read at all can play and enjoy it. As far as the game itself, it's basically a deck of cards and instructions and that's all you need (except a piece of paper to keep score.)",5.0
"This game is easy, challenging and fun. I really enjoy playing with one other person or a group. Good game!",5.0

Fantastic game!,5.0
"I have only had it for a few days, but this dictionary is great! It has tons of short words that I never knew existed and it has definitely stepped up my Quiddler score!  I love that it is organized the way the game is played, it's super-helpful when trying to quickly find a word before it's my turn. I haven't tried it with Scrabble yet (my family likes the Quiddler rule that you can look in a dictionary when it's not your turn so we play Scrabble that way, too), but I think the organization will be helpful to look for words with the number of tiles I have left.

It has already become the go-to reference for playing Quiddler at my game night group. I think I need to order another because everyone was fighting for it while we played!",5.0
"This is an excellent dictionary! It is laid out unlike any other dictionary. The special organization makes it way quicker to find short words, which is super helpful when playing Quiddler. I am so happy they are selling this separately now! I got my first dictionary as a gift in Quiddler Deluxe -  when we play it is the dictionary of choice - everyone wants it. I really wanted/needed another copy and have many friends that wanted it too. I just bought 10 copies - two for me and the rest as gifts. Perfect timing for Christmas!",5.0
"Love this dictionary! Great for finding those short words. I've been using it for Quiddler and other word games, too. It's fun and educational to just flip through. Highly recommend this!",5.0

Quiddler was a surprise game gift that everyone loved to play.,5.0
"I've loved my copy of the Quiddler Short Word Dictionary since I got it as part of the Quiddler Deluxe tin (well worth it for us Quiddler fanatics!), and am so excited to see that it is now available for purchase on its own!!  The organization of entries by length of word is unique and makes so much sense for this game.  I consult my Quiddler dictionary for other word games, too.  This will be s great gift for my fellow word game nerds.",5.0
Love playing this game with grandchildren.  It helps them learn to spell and work on their math skills while having fun.  The game doesn't take long to play so it is good for children with short attention spans or adults who have only a short amount of time to play a game.,5.0
"I love the Set word games!! This dictionary is fabulous!!
Thank you do much for selling it separately!",5.0

"I wasn't sure if this game would be fun or not when I ordered it. But after playing it, it was definitely worth the purchase. Great family friendly game and a great game for adults. Not too long, and not to short of a game. Definitely recommend for family/friend get togethers or game nights.",5.0

happy,5.0
"After playing with family and friends a few weeks ago I caved to buy my own.  Quiddler is a fun game that can be a quick few rounds or go until the last man is standing.  You can keep it clean and play with the kids. Think of it as Scrabble with out the tiles!!!  Or when its just the adults, maybe its more then just the words found in Webster's thats allowed for game play.  Worth the investment for anyone who is a fan of fun games for a group.",5.0
"This is a wonderful game! If you like Scrabble, this is for you! (Okay, I know I sound like the creator here! But it's a thoroughly enjoyable game.) If you know ""Phase 10"" and Scrabble, this is their offspring!  Tthe nice part is that at the onset, you can decide how many rounds you'll play, so you're not stuck playing forever and the game is finished.  BTW, we cheat when we play it, as we want to learn as many words as possible, so we allow the use of smart phones to look up words. (We'd NEVER do that for Scrabble!!) If it's in Dictionary.com, we accept it. We LOVE this game!",5.0

Fun game for the entire family!!,5.0
My husband and myself love this game. I am not a good speller and I can play this game and win. It can be a pain at times because of some of the rules but we bend them from time to time!  You can build any where from 2 letter words to 10 depending on the stage of the game you are on. Some times the smaller words will bring the most points! We have 2 sets now! I keep one at work to play at lunch. Yes you can play solitaire! But I play like it's 4 people playing and I don't cheat to win a hand. Love it love it love it!,5.0
Very good edition for children of the original game for adults.  To earn coins was so much more fun to count up at the end instead of keeping an actual score. (Math!)  Use of any kind of word or name is also helpful for younger players as they still have to know how to spell it to use it.  It was very well received by the grandchildren.....one in second grade.,5.0
"Using Quiddler for teaching second graders how to read.  They love to play the game and I use it as an incentive so that they finish the""boring work"".  I work one on one in United Way program.  They love to try and beat me.",5.0

I bought this game for my parents, and when we played it with my siblings everyone fell in love it....and went out and ordered their own game.  I would highly recommend it for all ages.  I also think it would be fun to play in a foreign language - my daughter is studying Spanish and I think it would enhance that process and make it very fun.  I bought 4 of these games to give as Christmas gifts.  You won't regret your purchase if you like word games.",5.0

"I was introduced to Quiddler by my aunt and uncle a couple of years ago. My family loves word games so this was an instant hit. For me it is a lot more fun than scrabble and makes for a perfect quick game to play whenever (no board to set up or move of the dinner table so you can even pause a game and come back to it later easily). I've only used my deck a few times, but other deck in the family have gotten heavy use for years and hold up well because the cards are made from good quality paper, in my opinion. It's a big deck so kind of hard to shuffle all at once for some people, but that is easy to overcome. One of my favorite games!",5.0

Very fun game. I have given this game to many friends and family when visiting them.,5.0
"Great game.  Easy to play for all ages.  Highly recommended.  Also consider ""Five Crowns"".",5.0
"Whenever a group meets, we pull Quiddler out! Playing Quiddler with friends has sold many more of the game as they have then gone to buy the game to play with their friends. It's a challenging game of both luck and strategy-don't discard those high value cards until it appears the round is closing out! Should you make a longer word or more words?

Play ""cut-throat"" or friendly, depending on your attitude.

Be prepared to set some house rules, such as which dictionary you will use before playing (Is ""la"" as in a music scale, ""thy"" or ""hi"" really acceptable?) The game has a lot of repeatability because every hand is different.

You can make longer or shorter rounds, count 3 - 10 cards and then 10 - 3 cards, or even go higher. You can keep a running tally.

The cards are durable and beautifully drawn. As the box says, ""FUN""",5.0
The cards have great art work. The game is fun to play and challenges your brain.,5.0

My daughter & I play almost every night.  Great way to learn new words.  Have your Dictionary handy to see new words you never knew.,5.0
"Our family loves card and board games, and are always on the lookout for more offbeat games to add to our collection.  I can't remember how we acquired Quiddler, a word game, but given that we enjoy other word games such as Scrabble, Boggle, and UpWords, we figured Quiddler would be right up our alley.  Our first time playing it didn't go so well -- probably because we had a couple of younger kids trying to play -- but a second go-round with just adults turned out to be very fun and enjoyable.

The rules of Quiddler are simple -- everyone's dealt three cards, then someone draws a card, then discards another.  The play continues around the table until someone is able to assemble all three cards in their hand into a word, then goes out.  Everyone else gets one more turn to draw and discard and try to make words from their hands, then points are tallied up (with any remaining cards resulting in deducted points).  The next round is the same but with four cards, then five, all the way up to ten.  High score wins!

The game is similar to other draw-and-discard games, such as Phase 10, but with a dash of Scrabble thrown in for good measure.  We've discovered some interesting new words, and the game certainly challenges you to find unique words to use up what's in your hand... as well as some shocking but hilarious times when some dirty mind comes up with a raunchy but perfectly legitimate word on their turn.  XD

As an added bonus, the letters on the cards are modeled after Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Kells.  This makes the cards a treat to look at as you play.

If you like Phase 10 and/or Scrabble, you'll enjoy this game.  It's a lot of fun, and relatively quick as well.",5.0
Can't wait to play this!  Brand new.  We played it at a friend's house and stretched our minds and laughed a lot.,5.0
"SO MUCH FUN !!!!!  My wife and I have played this nearly every night for over a year now as we relax after dinner.  We like games and have a closet full that we have tired of - this game challenges you differently every hand.  We laugh at each other as we use words we never use in every day language and try to invent a few.  Since it is just a deck of cards it is easy to travel with.  It also make a great little gift or stocking stuffer during Christmas.  Have fun.

UPDATE 10/2017.  My wife and I were given a pack of 2015. We just ordered our third pack because  we play every night.  It is our time to relax, laugh, and sometimes enjoy a little adult beverage. The game changes with every hand and we never tire of it.",5.0

"Again, another game I purchased based off the reviews here at Amazon.com!  This game does not disappoint!  It's like Scrabble meets Rummy!  Love it.  I play this game with all three of my kids (ages 11, 9, 8) and we have fun.  Now, there are times they need help spelling a word here and there so I assist when needed.  (would be better to play with all adults - but this is reinforcing their vocabulary and spelling) I just love this game.",5.0

Super fun game ... loved by all ages. Definitely makes you think and keeps your brain active. :-),5.0
"Quiddler Junior is a fun game for kids! I bought this for as a fun game for homeschool. It builds spelling, reading, and challenges them to create words. There are cute images on each card with names under them which can help them hints on words they could create. This game is great because you can make it easy for beginners or harder for advanced players by how may cards you need to use to make a word.

Included in this box is instructions on how to play, cards, and point tokens.",5.0
Excellent,5.0
"I was introduced to Quiddler a few years ago. It has now become a bit of an obsession with a few of my friends. One of them is a bad speller, but playing Quiddler frequently has improved her spelling significantly. We've played the game in hospital rooms, restaurants, and are always glad to spread the word about a truly great game -- both fun and something that takes some thought. And it's nice that you can play it with just two or with several. There is a solitaire option as well, but it's not the same as playing with friends.",5.0

My daughter likes playing this game. Great way to practice spelling.,5.0
This has become a family tradition. It is the ONLY game that everyone will play. I'm sure if you had two decks you could get quite a few people involved. We usually have at least 5 and only need one deck.,5.0
Very good game - especially if you're looking for a game for two people.  The game is endless in terms of the # of words you can make by combining the cards/letters in your hand.  It is faced-paced and challenges the mind.  If you like Scrabble you'll most likely like this game.,5.0
"Played this for the first time over the holiday.  Liked it very much.  Sort of like Scrabble, sort of like Gin.  Easy to learn and fun for everybody.  Give it a try!",5.0

A wonderful and fun game and could be so helpful with today's generation and their poor spelling skills.  I HIGHLY recommend.  Young and old alike.  As young as a smart 8 year old can participate.  :-),5.0
Terrific card game of short words.  Enjoyable for everyone.,5.0
Fun family game. Gets you thinking. Maybe harder gor younger children. Has instructions on how to play solitare too.,5.0
Fun game for family.,5.0
Great games for kids learning to spell! It is really nice that it comes with the instructions to play it alone. Makes practicing spelling words fun and less of a drudgery. You can also change the instructions to accommodate children that are still learning their letters. Lots of fun ways to play and not a terribly annoying game to play with your kid or kids. Not gimicky or confusing. Would recommend to my friends.,5.0
"Looking for a fun game to play with the family or friends?  This is it!!!! Whether there are 2,3 or 10 of you, this is the game everyone needs to have for word building fun.  I'm definitely buying these as gifts and packing it in my suitcase when I travel,  Love it <3!",5.0

"Fun game!  I bought this game without knowing a thing about it because I was buying another Five Crowns, as my other set was worn out.  I saw that Quiddler was frequently purchased with Five Crowns, so thought I too would give it a try and love it.  If you like word games, give it a try!",5.0
Great game. Me and my family sit down and play it all the time. Challenging but fun,5.0
What a fantastic game!,5.0
"A fun game that will entertain many time over and enhance word skills, just, note to the wise, keep a dictionary handy!",5.0
"This game is a lot of fun. I like it better than Scrabble because you can make any word you have the letters for, whereas Scrabble only allows you to play a word if there is a place on the board to put it. I've learned some new words from playing this game so much. The only annoyance is the need to shuffle the discard pile 3/4 of the way though a game because there are no more cards left in the deck.",5.0
I first played this game on a retreat. It is a great game for a couple of people or a group of people and it is easy for young children to learn. We don't generally keep score although we count our points for each hand and we help each other so that it becomes less of a competition and more learning fun.,5.0
Really fun portable game.  Better than scrabble because it is fast and portable.,5.0
love this game I've worn out three decks.  We play it 2-3 times each night when we are camping,5.0

Wonderful game.  Makes you think on multiple levels.  Sophisticatedly competitive.,5.0
"This is a family favorite--portable, fairly fast, simple to explain, and good for all ages above about 6--whenever kids begin to spell.  Small words can add up more quickly that long ones--our granddaughter beat my husband and I when she was 8, and he's a newspaper editor and I am a high school English teacher!  This was an emergency replacement because I put our original game away sideways and couldn't find it.",5.0

"I purchased this junior version to use as a fun learning tool while homeschooling kindergarten. It is terrific! We play almost every day, often at my son's request. I do help him a lot but the more we play, the more words he is able to construct on his own. The cards are colorful and bright, and they have pictures and word suggestions that we have found to be very helpful. I highly recommend it.",5.0

Our family has been playing word games as long as I can remember and I have to say this is the one that gets played the most.  It is fun and it does not take forever like some word games.  We take it everywhere and even played in the hospital when my mother was ill and it really passed the time and cheered everyone up!  I highly recommend it!,5.0
"Love this game!
Family fun is important. Play with your kids, young and old.",5.0
"This is a fun way to play a less intensive game of Scrabble and it travels well.
We are going to play it with our grandkids as it is good practice for constructing
three letter words.  Of course by the end of the game you have 10 letters to
use so that some words may be longer than 3 letters, but still can be if that is
the measure of your vocabulary.  A great game for kids and adults alike.",5.0
"This is a very fun game that is quite similar to Rummy 500, but with letters instead of numbers. Quiddler is easy to learn, and features quick gameplay, lasting about 40 minutes total. There are definitely options within the game to alter the rules to find your own style of play, but either way this is a wonderful game for budding linguists at the elementary level as well as veteran wordsmiths. I highly recommend!",5.0
This is a great game to play at family functions or even for a game night,5.0
"Great card game, like playing scrabble with cards.",5.0
"Quiddler was introduced to me in my childhood. While I still struggled a bit when playing with adults, I actually had a fair shot of winning, unlike in Scrabble. The complete reset between rounds and the increasing returns from round to round make it relatively quick and somewhat beholden to luck while still exercising the full breadth of one's vocabulary.
This is the second set that I have owned as an adult. I left my other Quiddler set in Korea with a friend who continues to use it in her English as a foreign language classroom. The flexibility to make many small words or great big words allows English learners to flex their lexical muscles to the extent that they feel comfortable. Allowing them to access dictionaries means that they can learn and use more words (I would require them to explain words that are lower frequency/outside of other students' vocabularies).
I use my current set as a party game with friends. While it may make sense that I happen to be an English lecturer from a nearby university, this game works well for various age groups and backgrounds. House rules, such as 10 points at the end for best band name, can add an egalitarian layer. Alternately, the ensuing discussions can springboard into friendly(~ish) debates. Other examples include best complete sentence, weirdest X, most likely to be a line from Spongebob, etc.",5.0

"Its a fun game. If you know how to play Crowns, then this game will be quick to learn. Played just like that.",5.0
Quiddler is a great game for the entire family.  It's not too long and it makes you use your brain.  We also learn new words.  We play it with a dictionary so that the kids (and my husband and I) can look up words to make sure they are real.,5.0

They, in turn have introduced Quiddler to many of their friends, again all of whom now enjoy Quiddling (which would not be an acceptable Quiddler word.)  It always brings out the smiles!",5.0

Good game,5.0
Enjoy this game very much. Good for the mind,5.0

Had never heard of this game but was looking for some games to play while camping.  This game is so much fun and challenging at the same time.  My new favorite game!!,5.0
"This is the best game for young kids (grade 1-?) as it really developed their spelling and math and critical thinking skills. Initially you can play as a family with all cards face up to help your younger children get the hang of the game and some of the strategy as well. then as they learn you can play as intended and have a fantastic time doing it. this is also good for when your child has other kids over to play, everyone gets a spelling and math lesson and no one has to do much work for it.",5.0

On vacation my husband and I played Quiddler with friends. It was so much fun we decided we wanted to have it. I ordered the game on Amazon and after not playing it for a couple of months we opened the game with our neighbors a couple of days ago. We quickly remembered how to play and 2 hours later had played 2 games and laughed a lot. We anticipate our next game.,5.0

"This game was a blast. We had tried Quiddler Jr,, and had a blast with that, so moving up to the next version only made sense. We found that the game was a ton of fun and that you were definitely challenged to think on your feet and come up with words that will bring you to victory.

This is a game that you will bring out over and over again. You will find that it will bring you closer together, encourage a broader vocabulary and spend some true quality time together!

"We love Quiddler.  This is our 4th set of cards as we've worn out the other 3.  Over time we have modified the rules a bit to make the game a bit tougher for us (we start with 8 cards and go to 15 and don't allow any 2 or 3 letter words). Even after playing it for years, we still love the challenge.",5.0
"A friend brought 5 Crowns  over for ""game night""! Super fun strategy game! Enjoyed playing so much that we ordered two sets for our SS Class game night fellowships!!",5.0
My students have a great time with this game and love it. It is good for students needing help with English as well as students who are fluent. This is the first time my students happily look up words in the dictionary. Good for math too since they have to add up points on each card for the word them make. Fun game,5.0
Great game without having to think too hard. Several people can play.,5.0
"Fabulous game that really gets your mind going!  Try to make words in each of your hands, beginning with 3 cards and ending with 10!  Fun for reinforcing vocabulary words, and exercising your mind as you try to look for words with your letter combinations.  Takes less time than a Scrabble game would, so it's perfect if you only want to play for an hour or so.  We allowed use of a Scrabble Players dictionary as we played, so it made things a bit easier at times.  Highly recommend this game for folks who want to work their mental language muscles out!",5.0

"Fun, faster and easier than Scrabble.",5.0
"we were impressed enough with the card game itself, that we bought the deluxe version and the wooden box version for friends. what a let-down those rather expensive versions were.  realistically, this is the only way to purchase the game.  the cards are of the same not impressive quality in all three games. they don't hold up well with the constant shuffling, but the box stores well, there isn't any excess waste and cost, and it's really all about the game and not the storage or the little pencil they send with the deluxe version.  i think that the caliber of individual playing this game will recognize that this is the best version for themselves, their friends, and the planet.",5.0
Great fun and addictive - can play for hours or just a bit.  Enjoyed with two other players as much as with three other players - which made it much more difficult.,5.0
"I am always looking for a great family game, and while I have tried other Set Games in the past, I had heard great things about Quiddler. This is the Junior version of Quiddler and it intrigued me, as I was wondering whether my seven year old would be able to play this by herself or not. In playing this, the cards are wonderfully made with great imagery and graphics and many colors that truly drew my youngest daughter in from the beginning. I came to find that she did need some help at first as only being in first grade had some limitations in regards to the breadth of her vocabulary. As we played though she got better and better and after a few rounds she had the hang of it. By the end of the game she was asking to play it again. This game really challenges you to think and be creative with your words as well as encourages your kids to learn more and more words in the end. This is a great game that I would encourage for all families!

"I love this game. If you are a word game person, this is a wonderful game for a small group. At least six can play together. You make words with your letter cards. First three cards, then 4, 5, 6, 7 with each round of cards dealt. You can earn bonuses for longest word, most words per hand. Tricky letters such as the QU combination have higher point value. It is a fairly fast moving game and lots of fun for word geeks like me.
There is also a way to play it ala solitaire, but I have not tried that.",5.0

"I was unfamiliar with Quiddler, but I really enjoy Scrabble and this is similar -- sort of Scrabble with playing cards.  You can play it alone like a Solitaire game, and that is fun, but it is even better with others.  I played it first with 3 other adults and then just with my 4th grade grandchild, who commented that two new words were learned that day!  You can finish more quickly than with a Scrabble game.  I would agree with the directions that you should agree beforehand on a dictionary that would be the final arbiter!  We used the Merriam-Webster app that I had on my iPhone.  Highly recommended.",5.0

"Super fun game, even better if you know more words than your opponents",5.0
"If you love words and forming letters into combinations of words this is a wonderful game. Not only is it fun in a group, but I have played the solitaire version with the instructions they provide inside. It is just like solving the daily Quiddler word sets they provide in some newspapers. They suggest that you are allowed to use a dictionary if it is not your turn. This is not allowed in Scrabble and I am not sure it should be allowed here. Nevertheless, use a Scrabble dictionary if you decide to play this way. fact that you start out small with only three cards in first round and increase a card each round gives younger children a chance to play as a family game. Cards are colorful and durable . In fact I would recommend you use a card shuffler with this game since the cards are quite stiff and number 108 in number. If you are a fan of jumble words this also gives you an edge in this game. Instructions provided are very concise yet clear.",5.0

"This game is a blast if you enjoy word puzzles and such. Competitive gameplay that's great for just two or for larger groups. The basic goal is to use up all of your cards in each hand to spell words of three or more letters each--the catch being that each round you add another card to your hand, so you have that many more letters both to use and to puzzle over how to use. My wife and I love this for date nights at home.",5.0

"Nice card game variation of Scrabble and Bookworm Adventures.
Family age ranges from 30s to 80s.
Game plays longer than expected with them as the forced draws and math can add time, which is fine.

"Love, love, love this dictionary! Fast shipping too!",5.0
A great game and top quality cards,5.0
Great game though I find it best for no more than 3 people when a dictionary is being used to find words (Which I recommend for expanding one's vocabulary.) Also helps with math skills when tallying up scores. Sort of a cross between Scrabble and Rummy.,5.0
We love this game.  We've ordered several sets and given some as gifts.,5.0
Fun and great that it can be played with as few as 2 players.,5.0

This is a heck of a fun game if you like word games.  It's like Scrabble without having to set up the board and flip all those tiles.  I have an excel spreadsheet that can be used as a scorecard.

"Set Enterprises INC is the genius behind Quiddler Jr, an educational game that is so much fun kids don't realize they are learning. I think my favorite kinds of games to play are word games and I have been looking for word games to play with my son now that he is learning to read. When I found out Set Enterprises INC was making Quiddler Jr I was ecstatic!

Quiddler Jr is a word game for kids or for really young kids an alphabet or phonics game to start with. Diva plays with the game as an alphabet refresher and for learning letter sounds and sometimes just to identify and help say the names of things on the cards. She has a slight speech delay so practicing all sounds helps. My Gentleman is just barely learning to read so we play as a phonics refresher and a sight word refresher but having to find the right letters and sounds that make a sight word. Ill try to explain but first Ill explain how to play with those who can read but even before that I will tell you a little about the box and all that. Because that is important information too.

For more on my review and how I adjust Quiddler Jr visit http://mygeeklings.com/quiddlerjrreview/",5.0

"Received Quiddler Junior as a gift for my 6 yr old. Love it...uses reading and spelling to make the words and math mathematics to add up points all in a fun and exciting game. Shhh, he has no idea he is actually learning! I also have a 3yr old who enjoys handing out the point chips; which are Colored pink, blue and yellow. She is also learning colors. All around a great game in a compact little box which is easy to store.",5.0

"Warning: wordplay appreciation required. I don't think this game is quite as fun if you aren't already into crosswords, Scrabble, Words with Friends, or similar. I can tell you my mother hated it. Smaller groups are better as it is quite a slog with more than 6 people.",5.0
Fun word game. It makes you think. Good for your brain!,5.0
What a wonderful and fun way to practice your vocabulary.  Fun for all ages. Very reasonably priced and good quality.,5.0
"It Was a gift, she loved it and played for hours. I would recommend this to anyone who loves words",5.0

"We played this last week for the first time.  It was really fun!  There are 10 hands in the game.  When you start out, it proves to be a challenge, but as you get more cards, you can make some fun words.  This would make a good gift for someone who likes cards/scrabble.",5.0

We plan to play it with our grandchildren when they arrive for their next visit.

"This is a wonderful word game for two people or more. It's easy to set up, easy to learn to play, and takes less than half an hour to play a whole round. My husband and I usually play three rounds to make it an evening, but I gave it to my sister and she and her husband play one round, almost every night. It's that quick. But it also makes you work your gray matter; kind of like Scrabble but without the time commitment. After 2 1/2 years, we still play it regularly.",5.0
Great,5.0
It is a fun game.  Easy to learn.  To make the game a little harder we use 3 letter words instead of 2 letter words.,5.0
"I didn't expect it to be such a blast. Fun to play even with a small group, like even just two people.",5.0
"This game is easy to learn, and fun to play.  It is a word game, with both luck and skill involved.  We were introduced to it by a friend, and we bought it right away.

Highly recommend it!",5.0
"This is a game for young and old to play together or independently. Can fill the time in many situations. Waiting for flights, hospital recovery or a snowy evening.",5.0
"Whether you play it solitaire, or with a partner, or with dinner guests, this is a delightful, fast-moving game. It is essentially Scrabble without a board.  After each hand points are counted, scores are recorded, and the words discarded. New hand, new words.
This really is a game for all ages, 8 to 80.",5.0
We have not played it yet but I was very surprised at the huge size of the BOX!!!!!  Pretty big to take with us on vacation. It would have been good to give me the exact dimentions of the box before I ordered it!!!,5.0

Thanks!",5.0
"This is fun and a real challenge -- we all love it in our family. It's amazing how many different words you can come up with. This is one of the best overall games, and the best card game (a little more challenging than 5 crowns--which is also wonderful!) we have",5.0
My beau and I love word games and are very competitive with them.  We are always challenged to find a word with more letters or fewer vowels.  The game is never dull!,5.0
Lot's of fun for get togethers with friends. Easy to carry with you on trips and small parties. Helps to keep your mind sharp.,5.0
"I was surprised that the box was just a bit larger than a regular card game box. That's a good thing, because I was thinking a board game size box.",5.0
A friend introduced me to this game and I love it  Am taking it on vacation next week and will introduce it to my family.,5.0

This is a game that is alot of fun for family and friends  - the game is quick and alot of laughs,5.0
"Found this by chance online while looking for a game for my game loving mother in law. Since we have played it, we have purchased a couple more. We have given the game to friends for a gift and we also keep one in our vehicle to have onhand. Its a fairly simple game, making small words with cards, but just enough fun for a nite with friends or just for us as a couple.",5.0
"We love this game so much that I bought one for another family for Christmas. It isn't big and bulky, so it is easy to take with you on a trip or in an RV. You will need to buy a scrabble dictionary though - to resolve any word spelling issues & keep the players happy.",5.0
It's fun to see how many words you can make out of a handful vowels and one or two consonants.,5.0
This is the best game ever...my son and I play every week for years...amazing ..we have a dictonary/card/book with scores...only wish the card were like Kem Card,5.0

"We play this as a couple, with grandchildren and adult family members.
We also play with my 93 year old mother.  She likes the game and often wins; which gives all of us great pleasure (especially playing against my wife who is an English teacher!)
A nice game to increase vocabulary and word knowledge.
It is a nice game to spend a few hours sharing and enjoying time together.",5.0
replaces one with some lost cards. I take it with me everywhere. Good for all ages (have played with 6 through 96)  and even people of different languages as one doesn't need the deep knowledge of english words that scrabble requires.,5.0
"I played Scrabble, literally for decades, until I discovered Quiddler.  This game is so easy to learn, anyone can pick it up iby playing a few practice hands.  It moves so much faster than Scrabble, because you're basically only looking at your own cards; not what's on the board.  It's portable, and great for travel.  You take the two decks of Quiddler cards, paper and pencil for score-keeping, and a dictionary, if you want to ""be that way about it.""  But certainly easier than taking even a ""travel-size scrabble game.""  Works great on an airplane.  Good for all ages - literally we've played with kids from 9-87 yrs. young and all really get hooked on it.  Wish they'd come up with an app so I could download to my other toys and have it with me at all times!",5.0
This is a great yet simple game.  Even if you aren't good a scrabble you will have fun with this because of all the combinations.  Easy to learn and worth the price.,5.0
"All three generations of our family, ages eight/8 through 66, really ENJOY Quiddler!  'A good time is had by all'",5.0
"My 95 year old auntie in North Dakota showed me how to play Quiddler! GREAT way to keep your brain working but not as challenging as Scrabble, which it is sort of like playing only with cards with letters on them. My husband really likes playing this game when we are out camping on our boat. Terrific game for kids and adults to play together but people who know more words would have an advantage.",5.0
"Similar to the board game, but much faster pace. Have purchased and given several as gifts as well and they were well received. We take Quiddler with us on trips and it's easy to play just about anywhere.",5.0
we thought the game was a blast! grab a glass of wine and enjoy. We played boys against girls and guess who won?,5.0
Our family has played the adult version of this game and have enjoyed it for years.  Great way to increase your word knowledge.  This is a great way for kids to learn new words and have fun at the same time.,5.0
"Anyone can play it, anywhere.  It also is educational.  We do NOT use a dictionary unless we want to challenge and sometimes we even penalize and incorrect challenge ... just like in Pro Football. The artwork on the cards is also interesting.  This has been a terrific find.  I have also bought it for family gifts.",5.0
"As i enjoy laying quiddler as a senior citizen, i'm hoping my 10 and 12 year old great grandchildren and their families will enjoy it.  it's a brian challenging game.",5.0
"Play this game anywhere, to the end or just a few rounds over a glass of wine in the evening.  Very simple, easy to learn, and a challenge, too.  I found there was a lot more friendly interaction amongst players, lots of laughs, than with a game that takes a while to finish.  I must admit to never playing it entirely by the rules, but the fun kept interrupting the goal.  A great gift at a small price - your friends will love you for it.",5.0
"Excellent game
Fun to play, even young children can play.
Nice game for families to play and spend time together",5.0
"Arrived in good time, and the quality of packaging was great.
We love playing this game! I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Scrabble!",5.0
"This is a LOT more fun than scrabble. Mainly because quite a few people can play, it's smaller words so even non-writers have fun, and it's very much like Rummy. We found it in a drawer at the beach house we were at for Christmas. The weird part is that you get only 3 cards the first round. Then 4, then 5, all the way to 10. After 10 rounds whoever has the most points wins that game. Then you start over. It was great to play after dinner with a few drinks. We were pretty casual on whether a word was allowed...for us it was a social game, not a contest. We enjoyed it so much the first night, I ordered 3 copies while we were playing. Two for my mom (camper and home) and one for us.",5.0
This is a fun game to play with family or a group of friends.  Doesn't go on forever and is easy to understand. You can also learn some new words. Is similar to Scrabble but quicker to play. I would recommend it!,5.0
If you like word games you will enjoy Quiddler. It is not a fast moving game but is very chalenging,5.0
"Quiddler was given as a stocking stuffer to a couple in their early 60's and they love it!!!
They have even added an ""extra"" hand if after 2 games they end in a tie!",5.0
"The game arrived quickly, was in perfect condition and is fun to play.  We enjoyed games with a mix of kids (youngest was 12 and needed a little help) through to grandparents.",5.0
Awesome game! We got this for Christmas after playing it at a relatives house. We have so much fun with it...even my kids love this game and they have fun trying to figure out ways to use all the x's and z's. Very fun family game for those who can spell:),5.0
"Although I read the rules that came with this game, my son and I made some rules of our own, that I think are most appropriate to his level of current knowledge, and that I think can best help him learn from playing with these cards.  If we only have 20 minutes, that's enough time to have some fun with this.",5.0
This is a fun and easy game to play with teenagers and adults.  Even bright younger children can play if they like making words.  It's a cross between scrabble and Five Crowns.  If you like both of those games you will love Quiddler.,5.0
"Fun for all ages and all intellects, this game stimulates and rewards the ability to spell and think of shorter and shorter words instead of only longer ones, both to score points and to get avoid getting stuck with high-point value cards in your hand. I was born with a talent the marketplace does not value, innate spelling ability; but my wife (who wasn't) now legitimately beats me at this game regularly due to both luck of the draw and her growing vocabulary and spelling skill. Doesn't take too long to play, rules are ridiculously simple and you won't want to stop playing. Plus the cards are gorgeous to look at, with original Celtic style artwork depicting the letters. Few games are really as entertaining for adults as their kids or vice versa; this one qualifies. I enjoy it so much I gave a set to both my brother and sister for Christmas.",5.0
The merchandise arrived in good time and at a good price.  I would recommend to any one who enjoys this type of card game.,5.0
"We've played Quiddler for years.  It's our quick and easy, play anywhere game.  Travels great too.  My teens love it also.  If you like scrabble it's similar but easier and more can play.",5.0
I bought 3 sets of Quiddler.  One for each of my son's and their families and one for me to keep at home to enjoy with adult friends.  I have had the opportunity of playing it with each of my son's and their families and we all agree it is a great game and such a good learning experience for the children.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.,5.0
"I really like to play this word game, it is a fun and not to hard for some younger players",5.0
played with friends and had a great time. Not too overly intense so you can still hang and chat while you play it- great family game !,5.0
This is a very fun game to play with a group of friends. Thank you again for the great service.,5.0
This is much fun and can be recommended for many different ages and sizes of groups.  Recommended go for it!,5.0
"Cards have great art work-good game for young spellers or not so wordy person-so, best if played with same educational level",5.0
My adult cousin told me about this game.  We have played a few times with neighbors.  Everyone seems to catch on quickly and enjoy it.  One neighbor is buying it for her Grandkids for Christmas.,5.0
Great game for all ages.  We played with the family during the holidays.  Our grandchildren love it.  It is kind of a combination of gin rummy and Scrabble.,5.0
"Couldn't find it in my local stores and was grateful Amazon had it for sale. As seniors, we play Quiddler quite often to help keep our brains sharp and have fun doing it!  It's better than Scrabble (which we also love) because it's so compact and can go anywhere with us.",5.0
"I enjoyed this game more than playing Scrabble.  It is fun and challenging.
Played it with family members over the holiday and they seemed to enjoy it also",5.0

I leave.",5.0
"Great game.  A lot of fun, and simple rules.  Very enjoyable if you are a word-y person.  Get this game!",5.0
"We play Quiddler everyday, so were glad to receive the new sets.  We wear out the cards.  This game keeps our minds active.",5.0
"This is a fantastic word game.  We're on our 3rd deck as we wear these out!! If you haven't tried it, you are missing a great challenge.",5.0
It is a great game that can be played by a fairly large group of people. Most of the games we play are kind of hard to handle with more than 4. We often play Quiddler with 8.,5.0
"Great game to encourage spelling, vocabulary and math! I was surprised at how much my daughter enjoyed earning point chips and cashing them in for higher valued chips.  We gave an extra bonus for words on her weekly spelling list - she loved it!  Very fun game!",5.0
"Fun game for all. We play this at Christmas game night, and took it along to a trip to Mt. Rainier, and played it in the lodge. Lots of families there playing games, and it was a really fun time. Easy to learn, and fun to play.",5.0
"This was a game that everyone in the extended family enjoyed, sucking in even the people that didn't was to ""play games"".",5.0
"Fun, family game that also helps the kids (and adults) expand their vocabulary and learn more about spelling rules. Family game night is a lot more fun.",5.0
"Played this game with my family and knew I wanted to buy it. Its easy to setup and take down and you can play as long or as short a game as you'd like, depending on the time you have available. Fun for all ages!",5.0
A fun spelling game for ages 8 to 80.  There is also an option to play a solitare game.  Purchased two so as to share the fun with other family members.,5.0
"and Quiddler! Perfect afternoon or evening.  I've enjoyed this game [a LOT] with just one person and a group.  It is very adaptable, like Bananagrams.
So, as much fun as WORD WITH FRIENDS is a great time, try this in reality!!  It's a challenge, if you let it be!",5.0
I've been playing this now for several years with children to seniors.  Everyone enjoys it and no one feels intimidated.  My retired group plays it quite often.  Others want to know where they can purchase it because they are impressed.,5.0
"While on vacation, we met a couple who invited us to play Quiddler.  The next day, I ordered it on Amazon.  It is a good game for children, too.  Not only will they have fun with the words they create, they will also use math to learn the value of their words.",5.0
We have fun playing with our senior friends as well as other family members. It keeps the old brain ticking. We need to set a time for peoples turns because some take too long to figure out what they are doing.,5.0
"This game is quick and fun, and works with kids and/or adults. Anyone who can make two letter words can play! As the game proceeds, and the players have more cards to work with, the play is more challenging, but not too difficult.",5.0
"I had played Quiddler before w/a friend & fell in love with it.  So took a game for our Son & his family when we went to visit.  They loved it so much that we left it with them & I ordered another one for us.  It's great for all ages & would be a great spelling teaching tool for kids.  So easy to learn & yet so much fun - every hand you never know how it's going to turn out (unless your Husband is a ""human dictionary"" like mine).  Would make a great Chrstmas gift for the whole family!",5.0
This game is great for friends and family. If you like scrabble - you'll love quiddler. It takes the same concept of creating words with letters of varying point values but with the added challenge of trying to play your hand quickly so that opponents are caught with letters (points) that they cannot play making them count against their score.,5.0
"I think it makes my mind work and makes me find and learn new words.
It's also good for the developing minds of children, it makes them think.",5.0
I bought this for my sister's birthday and we played it.  Very easy to learn and a lot of fun.  I will now buy one for our home.,5.0
"Finally!  A word game that's fun for those just learning to put letters together AND those who love words!  Each card has a letter and a fun illustration of a simple word. So adults can have fun playing while kids are learning new words.  Use letters to make words, with an increasing number of cards each round.  Even the youngest kids are able to make words. The point chips make it easy to keep score.  Fun for everyone!",5.0
This is a really fun game that can be played anytime anywhere. We always bring it along on family trips.,5.0
This is a fun word game that can be played at any age level able to read or make words.  It is one of my family favorites and we have played it for years.,5.0
this is a fun game to play makes you think. easy to take to parties a game for every one,5.0
I was surprised to receive it so quickly. It came the next day as promised! We have ordered several of these and they are new as promised. We will order more from you. Thank you.,5.0
"I sent this game to my nephews and nieces in Germany for the rainy days during the summer vacation. They loved it! They didn't mention a language problem, so it must be a good choice even for non English speaking countries.",5.0
"First, kudos for service. I ordered this mid afternoon on 8/20/13; received it 8/22/13! I use Quiddler to break up the monotony of English class.  The kids play in teams of two or individually. The game is easy and students can use a dictionary. It's all about seeing words in the cards you're dealt.  I 'd bought my first deck at Target years ago but the chain stopped carrying it.  I'm so glad I didn't throw out the surviving 60 cards from that first deck and, that I thought of checking Amazon.  Quiddler will  certainly be in my lesson plan for the first week of school!  Thanks again! VRF/Teacher/Mount Holly, NJ",5.0
Play this game with my group of seniors. Great way to gather and socialize while helping each other out to spell the best hands.,5.0
Fun game to play with friends even if they can't spell. :-) Helping each other out is half the fun.,5.0
"I should admit right away that I LOVE Quiddler.  This junior version of the classic spelling game still managed to exceed my expectations, though.  First off, there are totally cute illustrations on each card.  There are unique words & pictures on each card, too, which is both fun and gives young players lots of hints about short words they may want to play.  Secondly, the point chips make it easier for young players to keep track of the points than using a score pad.  Best of all, even though the game looks more attractive for young spellers it still plays so well -knowing lots of short words is as useful as knowing long words- that kids can be competitive with adults.  Great for all ages.",5.0
"I bought this game for a gift for my mother after having played it myself.  It is great fun.  It can be played with only 2 people.  But it is best to play it first with someone who already knows the rules.  Makes it easier to start.  It is a word game, but there are combination letters on some of the cards, which makes spelling things more fun sometimes, and more complicated other times.",5.0
"We took our Quiddler to play it with the grandchildren when we traveled to visit them.  They wanted to play it morning, noon, and night!  We sent them a game of their own, upon our return to our home.  I received a text (via mom's phone) from the 9 yr old which said, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you :)))))))))))""  It is a great game that is so much fun and delightfully educational.  Thanks you SET Enterprises :)",5.0
"I really enjoy this game, It's easy to play but still challenging. If you like word games you'll love this one.",5.0
"We wear out these cards from daily play. Simple rules but advantages to both short and long words. Quicker than scrabble which makes it more social, especially with two players. Every hand changes the number of cards to play with so the challenge changes a bit with each deal. Fun for a range of skills.",5.0
We tutor an eleven year old and 15 year old in English and they wanted to play this game. We bought it and they were delighted. I also played this with an adult student leaning English and she liked another way to learn English.,5.0

This game is a lot of fun.  I haven't played with other English speakers.  I bought this in order to play with my students in Japan.  We played this to practice spelling and to get them to think of how to make words.  It did exactly what I expected it would.,5.0
A refreshing card game with which one can enjoy with family or friends. It makes you think about more than numbers.,5.0
"I'm a big fan of Scrabble, so my friends recently got me to play! I loved it from the first hand! I've introduced to my 13 yr. old neighbor & can't wait to spread it around. I found a Solitaire game on the Instruction sheet too, which I've played that or a version of it almost every day :)",5.0
I have a group of ladies who come to my home almost once a week to play Quiddler.  We're all senior citizens and feel it helps keep us sharper.  It's also good for children (ten and older?) to re-think letter order.  I do like this game very much.,5.0

It can be taken/played anywhere because it is compact with no extra parts, the entire game consists of 2 decks of cards with letters/points on them.

"A friend introduced us to Quiddler, and we've introduced it to other friends.  I like a lot that we can play with kids -- they like it and although their vocabularies may not be as extensive as some adults' vocabularies, the kids are really quick to see possibilities that some adults miss -- and it works for parties of 2 to 8.  Easy to learn and easy to score and it's not endless (like Monopoly).",5.0
"the rule is similar to scrabbles, you have to make words with playing cards, easy to play, for all ages and easy to carry anywhere !  I took the game on a plane or when we go in vacations , wonderful !",5.0

This is such a fun game. It is like Scrabble and Rummy combined. We can't stop playing it. I would recommend this game to any word builder enthusiast!,5.0
"This is a fun word game which is easy to learn.  Its perfect for small to large groups.

Unlike other word games where long words are king, here you can win with lots of short words or a single long word so it opens more possibilities and gives those who struggle with finding longer words (me) a chance!

And since its just a two deck of cards, its ultra portable.",5.0
I purchased this after having a friend tell me about it. So glad I did. It's a cross between Scrabble and Rummy....the adults and kids love it. We even took it on a long car trip with us.,5.0

"Our family loves this game.  We have worn a few out.  It's fun and quick.  Scrabble can tend to get long and boring, especially with several players.  This game goes more quickly, but is still mentally stimulating.  I think it lends itself better to fun interaction.",5.0
First played this game on Christmas at my sister-in-laws. It was a great game. So I decided to get one for us.,5.0
"Quiddler is a favorite among our family and friends. Any get together, be it for a variety of reasons, ALWAYS ends up in a rousing game of Quiddler. With the little ones, it's a fun way to teach them how to spell. With adults, it teaches analytical thinking while challenging words laid down by others. We've bought this game so many times because we either wear it out, or end up giving it to someone who just played with us for the first time! Must buy. Must have! No question.",5.0

Everyone enjoys this game and it stimulates discussion and thought.  Almost like Scrabble but with cards.  Try not to use the dictionary too much though.,5.0
"If you like scrabble, crossword puzzles, hanging out with friends talking about words, this is solid gold.  A classic right up there with scrabble or bridge.  Hint for grown-ups: start at 6 cards, and go to 13.",5.0
I got this because I enjoyed Five Crowns so much. They are somewhat similar and I was not at all disappointed. It is a fun and addictive word game that anyone would like.,5.0
My family played this game at a reunion and it was a blast so we ordered us our own game.  Played it while traveling on the trains through Europe and loved it.  Also played it with friends who loved it so much I gave it to them for Christmas.  This game is a blast and will make you think.  So much better than playing Scrabble...why do it with cards,5.0
"It is a word game, but unlike some word games (such as Scrabble), it is good for anyone, not just word mavens.",5.0

"This is a great game for all ages.  There is a lot of interaction in this game unlike what another reviewer has said.  There are constant challenges as to whether a word actually is a word or not.  It can be very educational & funny to learn the new words or see what players will try to pass off as words.  If you're the kind of person who memorizes the dictionary for fun, this game may not be for you.",5.0

"This is a super game for playing with a group, or by yourself for sharpening mental acumen.  The only thing missing is an online version so that my family and I can continue playing together in between holiday get-togethers.  I highly recommend it.",5.0
I enjoy this game a lot.  But I have to admit that among our friends I'm one of the few.  A lot of people get frustrated with their inability to make words with the cards they end up with.  I enjoy the challenge though.  I also like the change between rounds with the differing number of cards.,5.0
Product was as advertised  this is a waste of time if it wasn't right you would have heard from me.  Thank you,5.0
"Product cam in in perfect condition and in a timely manner.

The game itself is fun if you like scrabble and gin rummy. Its kind of like scrabble but it takes the part where you just make words and enhances it so you aren't trying to make the word ""Qi"" on a triple letter, instead you're really challenging yourself to use all your letters to make long or short words.",5.0
"We love Quiddler.  It is a nice two person game but can be played with more players.  Being a game playing family, it was hard once we became empty nesters to find something to play for just us two.  It is not a long game.  It is not a complicated game.  It is just a simple fun word game.  We have given this game as a gift to all of our adult children, added it to a few wedding gifts  and have brought it to people's houses as a hostess gift. It is a great thing to bring along on trips.",5.0
"We love this game ! We play it at home with the children & at church with the ladies...this is a great, fun game for all ages !!",5.0

"My family LOVES Quiddler - it is our favorite ""snowed-in"" card game and we go nuts borrowing the dictionary to come up with the oddest words to win!  Simple and complex at the same time, no one has an advantage over others.  Score gets higher with each round and the penalties become greater also.  Keeps you guessing on a winner!",5.0
This game will let you know if you have them. Thank God for the Scrabble dictionary. My wife and I love to play.,5.0
Quiddler is fun for two or more.  Educational in that it challanges your vocabulary skills.  This game moves along quickly.  If you like Scrabble you will like Quiddler. I recommend it.,5.0
"great game for those who like word games; a little like Scrabble but
better because it moves more quickly; challenging but do-able; 10-round
game can be completed in about 35 min.",5.0
"I bought Quiddler principally to use in the English as a second language (ESL) classes that I teach.  Although I have so far used the game only once, it was a great success.  The students (intermediate and above) enjoyed playing it and learned many new words in the process.  They all want me to use the game again in a future class.  But clearly the game can be used in many other situations -- with people of all educational levels.  I have played it with friends, family, adults and teenagers.  It can be played in as relaxed or as cutthroat a fashion as the participants desire.",5.0
"See the title and multiply it many times.  It's easy to learn, takes less than a half hour for two to play, exercises the brain and prompts you to greatly expand your vocabulary.",5.0
This is a great game for 2-6 people!!  It makes you think and expands your vocabulary.  It moves along quickly and is never the same game twice.  The cards are beautiful and you can play it anywhere. It's a great games for adults and children. I plan on purchasing two more sets for family members.,5.0
"My husband and I play cards almost every day. ""5 Crowns"" and ""Quiddler"" are getting worn out.  We have bought 3 sets so far.  In order to learn new words we play with a dictionary. We play it with our older grand children and they love it.",5.0
"I love word games, and this is a definite winner. It's not so long that you get tired of it, but it's not so short that it's over before it's begun. I love how they even added details like the interesting medieval-looking letters on each card. This game is a great buy.",5.0
"An enjoyable word game.  It is fast, easy, and requires some strategy against an opponent.  Easy to take along on trips.  Need the Quiddler dict. for fun.",5.0
"We love this card game version of Scrabble! It's fun with a group of six or eight folks, or with just two. Recently we had our second 'Quiddler Party' with eight friends,and had a ball -- again!  Good to play with any age who likes to put words together.",5.0
"This game is like Boggle with cards. Put together long or short words with the cards in your hand, for multiple rounds using your imagination. A great game for all ages, because the young kids can win easily by putting together smaller words that are can be as valuable as a large word in the end. Worth every penny for it's great price...",5.0
"This is a card game that as long as the person can read and spell, he/she will find it fun and interesting.  It's most definitely a family game.",5.0
Quiddler is a card game that can be enjoyed by adults as well as children.  It can be used as a teaching tool to increase vocabulary yet is enjoyable to play.,5.0
"I bought this game to try on an after-Christmas family vacation with relatives who love crosswords and Boggle and such. None of us played anything else once we learned Quiddler!

Even though some of us regularly trounce others in word games, this one kept us all engaged. There is enough chance in the draw of the cards to even out the playing field, and enough skill in forming words to make it a challenge, and enough strategy to keep us all involved.

It was more fun with four or five (ages 23 to 86) than with just three. I haven't tried the solitaire version, and didn't come home with the game because it became an impromptu gift to one of the new fans! I'll replace mine, though, and probably buy several as gifts.",5.0
"I got Quiddler as a gift when I was a little kid, probably over 12 years ago. It's a great game, and I still love to play it! An absolutely fantastic addition to any game collection.",5.0

love the games by this maker",5.0
"We purchased this game based on some family members that raved about it. They were right. It's fun, and can be a bit challenging (and frustrating) at times. It's great for kids, because they can improve their spelling and vocab with it, too. We've played quite a few games of this and it does not get boring! And, it's extremely portable. Love!",5.0
"Quiddler is a challenging game that is easy to learn and fun to play. We ordered this game to help with my husbands recuperation from his 3rd heart attack. It helps with his thinking and eye, hand coordination. This game is also exciting becase you do not know who will win until the last hand is played. For example the other night he was winning by 28 points but in the last hand I ended up with a quick go out hand and he was stuck with a lot of high cards and so I won but only by 3 points. It is a lot of fun, very exciting and is challenging. It is a good game to teach little ones about math skills, matching numbers, and matching colors. It is a good kids game and well as adults. I would highly recommend this game to anyone and I do so every day at work.",5.0
"Great game to play with a friend at a coffee house! It looks like an easy game, but it is similar to scrabble.",5.0
Haha! We love this game! It was introduced to us and we immediately went home and searched Amazon to be able to purchase a set for ourselves. Great condition! Love it!,5.0
"Quiddler is fun for anyone who enjoys word games.  Makes a good inexpensive gift. I usually play it with one other person, but it's great for several players, too.  I enjoy introducing Quiddler to friends and acquaintances, and always have it with me when I travel.  Kids who can spell pretty well would enjoy it, too, so it's a learning tool as well. Note: I've bought a couple of Quiddler games within the past couple of years, and note that the playing cards are thinner than my first purchase.  Economics, I suppose.",5.0
"This game is so much fun, a good game for two or more people, and is easy to stop and start.",5.0
"This is a great game for kids and adults. It's easy enough to play that you can talk while the game goes on, yet challenging enough to be fun.  It's educational for younger children to practice spelling and thinking of/creating words.",5.0
"This game is fun AND can be educational, not to mention a challange as the game progresses. Great as a family game.",5.0
"Even my video-game raised grand-daughter and finance will come play this fast and challenging word game with me. It would be a good game to play with young readers, as well as oldsters. The cards hold letters, and the goal is to be the first person to use every letter in your hand in words. Children have a good chance since short words can win.",5.0
"I bought this game to have something new for an upcoming game night. I have never played it before. As I was reading the rules, I noticed a solitaire version. I have evnjoyed it since the day I received it. I think it can also be used as a ""learn to spell"" game for young kids.
In my opnion the game is worth every penny.",5.0
Great for two people.  Even more fun for more.  Good for spelling and math. At the end of the game everyone helps each other to find words.,5.0
"We bought this game based on the great reviews and were not disappointed.  It can be played solitaire, with a large group, or anything in between.  My kids (ages 10,8,6) ask to play it again and again.  The great thing is that they are learning and don't even realize it.  They actually voluntarily look words up in the dictionary and then practice their math skills at the end of each round by adding their scores.  Since it is just cards, it travels well and went with us on vacation.  We've played with other families and they almost always go and buy one of their own afterward. Great fun for both kids and adults!",5.0
"This is an awesome game for all ages; great for grandparents to play with grandchildren even.  Similar to Scrabble but it goes much faster.  I am a senior citizen and my friends and I  play it if we want to use up 30 minutes time or 2 hours.  I live in a small town and Amazon is the only place I can find it and have ordered it many times for friends, usually with free shipping.",5.0
"I had played this game before and decided to get my own.  The game is very easy to learn and is quick-playing.  No chance to get bored!  Have not played it with younger children yet, but if they have basic reading skills it would be simple for even them.  I'm a pretty competitive game player and Quiddler definitely provides plenty of opportunity for that.  Would recommend this if you're into word games.",5.0
"This game is much more portable than Scrabble.  Easier to learn, rules are simpler but there is still room for strategy, and it moves faster.  I learned it from another traveler on a trip recently and ordered two more, one for myself, and another for a gift.  This game can be a little hard to find, but was readily available on Amazon.",5.0
"I don't like games in general, but I love this game!  I play it with adult friends, relatives and my grandchildren - who are 7, 9 and 11 years old..  It is fun, educational, you don't have to worry about letting your partner down with a dumb move, it goes quickly, and it's light-hearted playing (which I remember in my youth).  I would recommend it highly for anyone considering purchasing any type of game!  It is so fun!",5.0
"This is one of my favorite games if you have a little time and are playing with people you've beaten too many times at Scrabble ;) It's easy to learn and plays pretty quickly. It's also appropriate for teaching kids how to play word games, since once a child can spell simple words they can play. Great for hanging out in airports. Also has a pretty fun solitaire variation.",5.0
"This word game is not only educational for children but challenging for adults as well as fun. Each time it is played it is a different game depending on the letters you get. It is challening in that you must take a card, discard a card and cannot put down your word(s) until you can play all your cards. It's great.",5.0
This card game is a very educational game for our grandchildren. We enjoy it very much. Have lots of fun playing the game with our schol age grandchildren.,5.0
I love pulling this out when I have a bunch of friends over!  It's great since you can have 1-8 players.  It's hilarious when people try to justify a made-up word they want to play!  Great for family gatherings too since it's fun for adults or kids!,5.0
"I'm 82 years old, so Quiddler certainly is not classified as a toy in my case.  I played this game with a 90 year old neighbor every friday night for a long time.  It is a great game to preserve and strengthen your mental capabilities.  Amazon made it possible.  I always go to Amazon first.  Great!!!",5.0
This is a great game and can be played with a wide range of ages and spelling abilities.  I highly recommend it!,5.0
"Everybody's game!
  Everybody I know loves Quiddler, young and old alike.  It makes one think a  bit, and is great fun.  Your family will enjoy it a lot!",5.0
"This game is addictive! Deal is 3, then 4 then 5 cards and so on. Make words with all your cards and lay them down. Cards have values and so you want higher scoring words. Cards you can't use score against you. Get bonuses for longest word, most words. This is really fun and we are stretching our vocabularies too! Highly recommended.",5.0
"I was told about this game and how fun it was, so I decided to try it on my own.  I got it for my Granddaughters so they would put down the phones and computers and enjoy family.  It worked because now everytime they come to our home, they want to play Quiddler.  It is a challenging game and just the right amount of competiveness.  We help each other with words and it is more fun that way.  My Granddaughters are 16 and 11 and they have a great time beating Grandma and Grandpa.  It also was a very reasonable price.",5.0
Great game. Lots of fun and shorter than a game of Scrabble. I really like the concept. All my family really enjoyed it.,5.0
"I bought this for the kids for Christmas, but my husband and I play more than anyone. We usually play, just the two of us, after the kids go to bed. It's good fun. The kids enjoy the game, too, but aren't as avid as we are. Then we bought Four Crowns and Set. We play them all, but Quiddler is our favorite.",5.0
My husband and I love Quiddler!  We have enjoyed sharing the game with friends.  We play a few times a week.,5.0
My family loves word games and this is perfect. Easy to play right off the bat. Fun also as solitaire. would highly recommend.,5.0
"I bought SET for all of my adult children for Christmas, and purchased all three (SET, Quiddler and Five Crowns) for myself.  My whole family enjoyed Quiddler more than SET and even my husband, who will never play cards, loves it!  We went on a cruise and he insisted we take Quiddler with us.  We played by ourselves and with some other folks we met there.  It was a huge success (for those few down times we all need from time to time).

You will NOT be sorry you bought this.  We varied the rules a bit - no dictionary lookup before your turn, only on a challenge.  This makes it move along more quickly.  You cannot predict which person will do well - it is not predictable!!",5.0
My family and friends are having a wonderful time playing this word game.  Anyone who loves Scrabble! will also love this game.  It is helping all of us to learn new words while we are having fun.,5.0
"When I first saw this card game my thought was, ""Like Scrabble, but with cards"", and I've never been a big fan of Scrabble.  But Quiddler is a whole lot more fun than Scrabble.  Players are dealt cards, 3 in the first hand, 4 in the next, up to 10 in the last hand.  The idea is to use all the cards in your hand to make a word, or words, which together use all your cards.  Players draw and discard until someone can do so, then the remaining players get one last chance to draw and use as many cards as they can.  Scoring is based on the point value of each card used, with more uncommon letters worth more points.

Reading my description may not be exciting, but the game is just plain fun.  Builds your vocabulary too!",5.0
My husband and I play this nightly because we enjoy it so much.  We do a best 2/3 series.  We also play with friends.  Our vocabularies are increasing with each time we play.,5.0
"Quiddler is the game played most often with our grandchildren and their parents!!  It has increased vocabulary and math skills of the grandchildren (and their grandparents) and in the case of one has taught him to shuffle.  The game is not time consuming and multiple people can play.  We have ""worn"" out several decks of Quiddler since we were given it as a gift in 2000.",5.0
"Quiddler is very similar to Scrabble and played with the Quiddler deck of cards.

out and buys the game.  People have carried it back home to England, Canada etc.
It is a fun game to play with your peers, friends, children and grandchildren.  Teachers will find it a great way to engage children in developing spelling,grammar,dictionary and creative skills.
I strongly suggest you order the 3 Decks special from Amazon as you will want to
give it out as gifts.  If you were given 7 cards, each one having one of the  following letters on it, f h v n a u e, what two words could you make. HAVE FUN! figuring it out.",5.0
"This game is very fun.  Takes some thinking and that makes things interesting.  I feel it's a little overpriced, even on sale, because it's basically just 2 decks of cards.",5.0
I've played this game with young and old.  I've played it in groups of three to eight.  It's always fun and it makes you feel smart!,5.0
"My family can't get enough of this game.  Makes you think and learn, all while having a great time.  We've gone through deck after deck, like all cards they wear out, but always have a deck ready to use.  Was a huge hit at last year's family reunion, I should get a commission on games sold!",5.0
"I was introduced to Quiddler by a friend whose enthusiasm for this ""after dinner"" game was infectious.  I now play it several times a month, learning the definitions of words I've never known and finding the strategy of increasing your word score a delight.  I gave it as a Christmas present to my sister's family. They played it with a larger number of players and had a fabulous time. The game's description as being a faster version of Scrabble is accurate. So if you enjoy Scrabble, you'll love this game.",5.0
"As I noted in my title, I think that's the best way to describe this game.  Letters that are more difficult to use have higher point values, though there are some ""Qu"" cards vs. just a ""Q"" card, but that also makes a difference in points.  It's quick to play, easy to catch on to and very portable.  Scrabble is one of my favorite games, but takes seemingly forever to play - this provides a very enjoyable word game experience.",5.0
If you have ever played Five Crowns this one is for you. Same concept as Five Crowns only spelling words instead of using numbers. It makes you think a little more than Five Crowns but was a lot of fun,5.0
Our family had a chance to play this game last year at a relatives  house.  When I spotted it for sale this year while looking for Christmas presents I was so excited!  It's a little hard for my younger kids to come up with words but they always seem to do it.  Overall a fun and educational game!,5.0
"We love Quidler and have given it to over 20 people.
It's better than Scrabble as you have 7 different rounds to play.  The cards are beautifully decorated with Celtic designs.
We play most evenings before bed.
Always bring it on a trip.
So easy to bring.",5.0
"This game is great for kids and adults!  We take it on every family vacation, and all 3 generations have a great time playing!  Not to mention that it helps expands kids vocabulary and spelling ability.  Highly recommend it!",5.0
"Loved this card game.  It is not only for kids, but for adults as well.  Lots of fun.",5.0
"Bring your Scrabble dictionary to the table, and challenge your friends to a Jumble competition.",5.0
"I bought this game on a whim about 10 years ago.  All 3 of us at home liked it instantly and it quickly became a favorite.  It helped our daughter with spelling and has always been a neat challenge for us grownups.  After losing the game during a series of moves, I finally had to buy it again to play with my mother-in-law.  I can see I'll have to buy it for her for Christmas or something because it was the only game she wanted to play during a recent beach weekend.

The best way to describe this game is: rummy with letters on the cards.  You never know what letters you'll be dealt and your hand can easily change with just one drawn card so it's always a fun (and sometimes aggravating) challenge.  When playing with pre-teen kids, it can sometimes be a challenge to not always go out first and/or not always win.  The way I figured out to work around that is to not lay my hand down for a turn or two, to give the younger folks a chance to work something out.  Hey, it works!  It's a fantastic educational game without it being too obviously educational to kids.

I had forgotten that there's a solitaire version and am going to get the deck out to try that as soon as I send in this review...",5.0
I love this game. My kids also join in and it's been a fun way to help them with their spelling skills. They are in elementary school.,5.0
"We love playing this game with our friends and/or our kids.  As long as they are fairly good readers/spellers, this is a great game for kids - my 9 and 12 year-old kids both love it.  And there is even a way to play it as a solitaire game.  Watch out though - VERY addicting!",5.0
There isn't much to say.. this game is sweet.. kind of like scrabble with cards. It moves a bit quicker though. Very entertaining. Great game if you love words. The end.,5.0
"If you like Scrabble but don't want to carry it around, this is a great game. It's not easy but it's not painfully difficult, and it's fun. Great for vacation since it's easy to pack (and goes well with a glass of wine)!",5.0
"Love this game.  First played it on an Elderhostel Trip, and I have now given several away to friends.  Great for groups of mixed abilities, as there is enough luck involved to help those who are less Scrabble Savvy.",5.0
"After playing Quiddler at my Aunts house (in another state - while on vacation), I ordered one for my Mom for Mother's Day. Then, because it is such an addictive game, I ordered one for my husband and myself. Now that my friends have played it, they also want a Quiddler game. We really enjoy playing this game and I love seeing all the words my smart 8 year old can come up with. I highly encourage people (especially with children) to purchase this game. You will want to play it over and over.....never wanting the fun to end!",5.0
Quiddler is a favorite of our family.  We love card games and this one is both fun and educational as you learn new words to play.  Crossword and scrabble players probably have an edge but it's fun for anyone.,5.0
We were introduced to this game by friends we were visiting while we were on vacation.  It was such a delightful game and we decided we wanted to purchase it for ourselves and for other family members and friends.  We were able to find it on Amazon.com and ordered several sets.  We would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves word games!,5.0
We have LOVED this game!  Our family plays a lot of games and I'm always looking for something that both the youngest (age 6) and the oldest (age 11) will enjoy.  Quiddler is challenging to every level of reader - even adults.  This is has quickly become one of our favorite family games to play!,5.0
"I bought this for my friend's little sister. Turns out, all of us adults had too much fun with it too. Not only was the child having fun learning, we were having fun seeing who could come up with the most creative word. I had to buy one for myself.",5.0
"This game is really a blast! Imagine a cross between gin rummy and Scrabble, and this is somewhere in there. Each player gets five cards, and you try to make words by discarding and drawing new letter cards. The next round, you have six, then seven, etc. Our family played this with a 10-yr-old being the youngest player who needed no help from anyone else. Trying to make words out of the letter combinations can lead to silliness, which is part of what made it so fun for us. The cards themselves are beautifully decorated with gothic-style lettering. It can be educational, too, if adults playing with kids take time to explain the meanings of words they made. This is also a game that is small enough to take on trips, and could be played in the car. We're really happy that we bought this game!",5.0
"I've always loved Scrabble, but friends and family members wouldn't play it with me (due to my highly competitive nature!).
Quiddler is WONDERFUL!!!  It gives a much more level playing field than Scrabble:  no bonus spaces, no advantage in following an inexperienced player (who is more likely to open up bonus spaces), no security in having a point lead at the end of a round.  Plus, it's easy to learn, and, because there are situations where using multiple short words rather than one long word can win you more points, younger players without an extensive vocabulary can actually compete against older players without being handicapped.  It plays quickly, even though there are eight rounds in a game.  (And it's very inexpensive!)
I strongly recommend this game for fun, and for the increase in vocabulary skills for those playing it.",5.0
"Me and my daughter played this game incorrectly, but think our way should be added to the rule. When playing with a few people try not going out until a person can use all but 1 card to spell one one.

The rules can be improved. The paly section only tell how to rotate and turn a end a round, not what happens during a round. I learned from the box cover that a person can end a round by makingmore than ne small word and then trwoing out a discard.

The game is great for children wo need practice with their spelling or just what to challenge themselve, adults toooo.",5.0
"This has quickly become a new family favorite and is great for most ages with some ability to spell. Sometimes my 8 year old needs help arranging his cards into words to get the most points. Some of us like Scrabble, and some of us don't, but ALL of us like Quiddler! You don't have to be a lover of words and dictionaries to enjoy this game--though it just might get your kids looking up words in the dictionary to get more points in the next game.",5.0
"This is the BEST game ever!  Its fun, quick, easy to play and for the entire family.  We play this game quite frequently!  Since its only a large deck of cards, its very versatile and can be played or taken anywhere!!!",5.0
"Great for long rides, short attention spans, or not enough time for a full Scrabble game; and you don't need a lot of space, big boards with pieces that get lost OR BATTERIES!  It's easy to learn, challenging even for adults, and a great way to get your kids to expand their spelling skills without making it boring.  We have worn out three sets, and given four sets to family and friends who loved it.  We will use two games at once when we have a lot of people playing. Since it is hard to find in stock in stores,  I am thrilled we found them on Amazon. Try it. If you like Scrabble, you'll love this.",5.0
"Seriously, this game is wicked fun and addicting and since there are like nine billion 5-star reviews for it already, no one is even going to read mine so it doesn't really matter what I write.  Buy this game though.  If you even sort of like word games or card games you will love this game.  Totally addicting.",5.0
It is a reasonable long word game and it is fun. the letters are written in a very cute way.,5.0
"Everyone in our family plays Quiddler. My 80 year old mother, my 13 year old niece, my 24 year old son.... Fun for everyone!",5.0
This is a fun card game for from 2-8 players and is very quick.  We play it several times a week.,5.0
I have found Quiddler a very interesting fun game and is great for teaching children and adults new words. It moves much faster than scrabble.,5.0
I purchased Quiddler to save on shipping. My daughter-in-law has it at her home now and plays with my son and anyone who comes over day and night! WE absoultely enjoy Quiddler and have played the other game (my main purchase at the time) only once.,5.0
"We have 8 children so we look to buy games that many people can play and different age groups.  This game covers it.  It is educational and fun.  It has a competive edge.  You spell words with the cards that you are given.  The first round you get 3 cards, 2nd round you get 4 cards, and so on until you have 10 cards.  The younger children have just as much of a chance to win because you can spell small or big words.  We have almost wore this set of cards out.  It is small and compact and can be played just about anywhere.",5.0
"This game is a hit with our kids! It is really helping them to become faster & more versatile when it comes to spelling. I enjoy watching my kids learn from it. Even our youngest can play along and he's just a beginning speller. Unfortunately, it's boring for adults but we have found that you can adjust the rules to make things more fun (like by adding more rounds with more cards or by making all of the words have to fit to a specific topic). Overall I think this game was well worth the money & my kids are definitely benefitting from it!",5.0
"I had no idea what this was when i found it in my Christmas stocking, so imagine my surprise when I started playing it with my Fiance & it was a blast!!!  :D  I absolutely love this game!!!!!  :D  I play it at least a couple days a week with friends, and sometimes I play the solitaire version if there's nobody else around.  :D  I love it!!!  :D",5.0
"If you don't like word games, this is not for you.  Almost anyone can play, so long as they have a decent vocabulary and can spell.  You need to have a good score person also.  We play it at family gatherings and it gets quite competitive.  Have fun!",5.0
"My husband and I like card games where you don't have to move the pieces or need a board to play. Quiddler is a card ""scrabble"" type of game, fun for two and easy to learn and play. The scoring is easy and the game is limited by the number of deals you play. It plays similar to rummy. The entire game is only a special deck of cards!  The cards have letters and point value. You make words then ""go out"". Fun, fun game!",5.0
"I bought this game for my 12 yr. old grandaugher.  So far we have not used it, so I can't say how much she likes it.  It looks like it will be fun though and educational.",5.0
"After 30 seconds of watching, anyone can understand how to play this game. The rules are cleverly setup so that master wordsmiths can compete with 6th graders on an even playing field. Fast, addicting, thoughtful, and awesome are all great words to describe this game - and also words you can use while playing it!",5.0
"Easy to play and understand, this word game is great for the ""spellers"" in your family. My 7 & 8 year olds found it a little frustrating once we got up beyond 6 letter words. However, my 10 year old loves this game. I am sure you could make many variations using this card deck.",5.0
"I bought this game because I enjoy playing Five Crowns, and Quiddler is in the same ""family"" of games. I was pleased to find that there are many similarities between these two games.

This is a fun game to play with both a small group and a large group! There is an option of playing the game in a solitaire form, but I haven't played it that way yet.

Quiddler is fast paced, so while there are 10 rounds in one game, it does not seem like a long, tiring game.  It is a fun way to challenge yourself and your family and friends!",5.0
"We got this for Christmas and really enjoyed playing it a few times so far.  It might be too simple for adults, as some other reviewers stated, but it is great to play for different ages just for the interaction and competition.  It is not too hard to learn, and is fun to get intergenerational laughs going.  I would recommend this for a gift for a family.  Also could be used at teen parties and gatherings.  Two thumbs up!",5.0
"Where else can the kids have a blast and try to build the longest and most ""point valued"" word? Nowhere. Our girls, ages 7 and 8 love this game!!! It is competitive, engaging and educational. It also gets them using the dictionary to make sure that words are ""real"" words when an adult is not around. They learn the concept of spelling, point value, competition and have a great time all together. A really fabulous game. You will never get the same cards two times in a game with 118 cards to go around. Teaches them the concept of math also when it comes to the idea of adding the  point value of each letter and then comparing the values with the other kids. You can also play up to eight kids. Fabulous game for the money.
""",5.0
"My wife and I absolutely love this game. We like Scrabble, but never know if it will be a fun game or one where it is just 2 hours of frustration because the board is tight. Quiddler still has the same anagramming type game play, but no frustration. It works great for 2-6 people, including kids. Since you can use multiple short words or a single long word to use up your cards, there is no reason a child with limited vocabulary couldn't play this game with some success. Just buy it, it is a cheap game and will get tons of use if you like word games.",5.0
"My Mother-In-Law, Father-In-Law husband and I (and sometimes my daughter - 8) have played this game nearly once a week for the last two years.  It's easy enough that you can carry on a conversation while playing but challenging enough (we learned two letter words that started with Q, X and Z!) to stay fun.  You will love it!",5.0
Wonderful educational game for all ages except preschool. Challenging enough for adult to enjoy. Order was received very quickly and in perfect condition.,5.0
"easy and quick to learn.
can be played over and over again with different groups of people.  fun if you have only 1 other person or 6 others :) good game.  this is almost the same as Five Crowns",5.0
"I love word games, and this game is a lot of fun to play.  It moves quickly so can be played faster than, say, a game of scrabble. The cards themselves are beautiful and, being a card game, it is easily packable/portable.",5.0
Quiddler is a word game using cards. Much like a rummy games - players build words in a ten hand game.  Good spelling workout!,5.0
"Played this at my son and daughter-in-laws, liked it so well had to find it and buy it.",5.0
"This game has every advantage. You can play with 2 or more players. The ease of creating any size word, which is great for a wide range of ages, It is not all ""luck of the draw"" but requires thinking ahead to play your best hand. If you like games, words, strategic thinking or just having fun, learning how to play this is easy and amusing!",5.0
"A most enjoyable stimulating game for family or with friends!
A must for a respite from video games.",5.0
"I played this game on vacation with some friends, it has become a family favorite and we love to share it with all our friends.  They are all hooked too!",5.0
We have a family of game players and crossword puzzlw addits. We loved the game.,5.0
love this game. its fun and teaches your to explore new words. highly recommended for a family night game.,5.0
"An excellent game that enhances vocabulary, exercises use of the dictionary, and gives an appreciation of the abilities of the English language.",5.0
Bought this game for a trip and threw it in my carry on bag.  Very compact.  Played it with 3 other friends for the first time and we all loved it.  The possibilities to make up words are endless and you learn to use the dictionary all over again. It can be played by children also as it starts out with 3 letter words.  Would highly recommend this product.,5.0
"This is a great, fun and educational card game for the whole family.  My sister played this with my kids (aged 17 and 15) and they came home raving about it.  I ordered mine and love it.  My kids have learned so many new words and their math skills are improving at the same time.  But the best thing about this game is....it's fun.  Enjoy.",5.0
We have played this game for hours.  It is easy to learn and easy to take places.,5.0
Quiddler is a great game.  It's fun and  any one from about 7 and up can play.  It is a game that would be fun for the whole family.  It moves quickly.,5.0
"This game has been a big hit with both younger and older members of my family.  Simple rules, fast play, I recommend it!",5.0
Quiddler is a great game! It is a word card game - we refer to it as card scrabble. Lots of fun for all,5.0
Great family game.  It makes us think while we are having a good time.,5.0
"General Commentary:
- I normally play with 20-30 somethings from 10 minutes to 2 hours each sitting.

Good:
- Can be played with people of all levels .
- Great for helping people with spelling and vocabulary.
- Allows for varied time play (a round of possibly 5 minutes to hours of fun.)
- Can be played collaboratively, help other players arrange cards to maximize points.
- Leads to interesting conversations about word definitions and word combination.
- Great for play at any location: the park, the beach, the car (be aware of potential carsickness), Tea Station.

Bad:
- Sometimes does require a dictionary.

Overall:
- I love this game.
- It's my personal favorite among all the SET card games.",5.0
"On A recent trip to visit a friend in San Diego, my 16 year old grand daughter and i were introduced to Quiddler. we played this game several times each night and could not wait to get home to order some.  I ordered 5 games, one for my friend, my sister, myself, my daughter and her family and one to spare.  This gane appeals to every age group form my 7 year old grand son to my 77 year old mother.  This is a great family game. Did you know that QUA is a word.",5.0
"I had read the reviews prior to the purchase. Considering this  is an award winning game, I was sure it would be a good buy. It is a good gift for kids who love words and a first fun game with words before graduating to the Scrabble. Personally, I think it is more fun than the Scrabble for 7 year olds. The 7-8 year olds I bought this game loved it. I got two of them from Amazon. Fabulous gift!",5.0
"Enjoyed playing Quiddler with adults who are Scrabble hounds.  The game would also be fun for kids, especially the three letter word portion for the younger set.  The game keeps your attention and doesn't take forever to finish.  It is more interesting because of the progressive challenges.",5.0
"Whether with a group or just my wife and I, playing Quiddler is great fun.",5.0
"We play Quiddler several times per week.  We play it after a hard work day.  We play it whenever we are tired.  We play it anytime that we aren't interested in or can't agree on television. (You'll actually be able to downgrade your cable connection, just because ""Quiddler"" is more fun, relaxing, and entertaining.)  A good raucous game of ""Quiddler"" is pretty quiet. You'll be too busy checking spellings in your dictionary, switching cards around to stimulate new words into your brain, be anticipating the next possible letter that you might draw, making decisions, and plotting your strategy.  But best of all, this is a game that a person of 12, 30, 50, 80, 90, or a 100 years old can all play together.  Everybody can win.  Everybody has fun.  And everybody will have more energy when it is over than when they started.  You might want to maintain your health, so that you can be your best at ""Quiddler"". It will show in your score. One Tip, the game changes in speed and enjoyment according to the number of players that you have.  I like 3 players, but two is pretty fine also.  4 is ok, but I want to break out a second card set and play two games at once if  there are 6 of us.  Have fun.",5.0
"We often host game night for our multi-generational friends and family. Quiddler has been the game of choice since we first purchased it. Our very competitive group keeps a dictionary close by to challenge one another. My brother-in-law is often the winner, and claims it's due to all the ""vocabules"" he uses. Sorry, pal, that's NOT in the dictionary! I've also given Quiddler several times as a gift. It's age appropriate for any gamer 9 to 90. Enjoy!",5.0
Love playing this game as it is scrabble in card form.  I played it on vacation and couldn't wait to get my own game and ordered total of 4 to give to other people.  It takes up minimum space so is easy to take on vacation or cruise or just play at home with family.  Great thinking game for all ages.,5.0
"Here's a fast-playing game for all. Form words in your hand with 1 and 2-letter cards drawn throughout the game.  Fun, fun, fun.  Each game only takes 10 minutes.  There's even a solitare game of Quiddler if you're alone.  Ages 6 to 90.",5.0
I love Quiddler!  Recently my family played it non-stop on a weeklong RV trip.  All ages were there from 10 to 77 years.  We had so much fun and laughs with it.  Even the youngest competed well.,5.0
"This is a great game!! Our family and extended family really enjoy playing this game. Our children's vocabulary has grown as they have tried to make new words and used the dictionary. Our extended family plays on holidays, college Enlgish majors make the game really interesting. Intellectuals love it and make the game even more challenging. The smarter you are the more interesting the game. To begin with we did play with our cards in view for the kids to really get a handle on it. It does take kids, even smart ones some time to learn to think flexibily in rearranging letters to create words, but once they catch on it's amazing!!!",5.0
"Quiddler is easy yet challenging. There are no moving parts - or loose parts to lose - just cards with letters to make words - but it is great fun! There is some strategy involved, but it is not brain-=draining - just brain stimulating as you arrange the cards to spell the best words you can. I love it!!",5.0
It is similar to Scrabble but with playing cards. Strategy becomes more apparent the further you progress in the game. The best part is that anyone can play. With bonuses for the most words as well as the longest word it caters to players of all skill sets and ages.,5.0
"Had never heard of this game but after reading other reviews decided to buy it and give it a try.  Lot's of fun to play, game is fairly short so you're not stuck playing it forever either.",5.0
"This game is great!  Both my 5 year old and my 15 year old play this (together).  The educational value, along with the fun, make this a must have game!",5.0
"What a great way to keep my son learning both in school and out. He introduced our family to this game after playing at school during indoor recess. We like the way it helps build vocabulary for the younger ones and stretches our strategy skills for the older ones. You try to find long words or multiple words using the cards you have with each letter being worth points. The longer you play, the more cards you get in each round. Board games take up so much space, so it's nice to have a small deck of cards to pull out of a drawer with the same impact on fun (if not more).",5.0
"My 6 year old granddaughter and my 81 year old mother both have fun playing Quiddler!  It truly spans the generations, and the kids like the way they often win when playing with adults.

Suggestion: have the person who introduces this game to the family familiarize themselves with the directions before trying to teach the game to children.  It's really not that hard, just a little complicated at first.",5.0
"Fun, stimulating, educational.  What more can you say for a game at this price.  Good for children learning to spell, great for adults and a good brain challenge to come up with longer and more complex words. Used with or without a dictionary, its a fun game and brings family and friends together.",5.0

It is a great family game and the kids don't realize they are learning.  I have bought this game to give for a birthday present also.  You can give Quiddler along with a nice dictionary for a great gift.",5.0
My family loves to play Quiddler.  All ages can enjoy this game.  My son is in First grade and begs to play this game every night.  This is a great way for him to figure out words from the cards in his hand.  Hours of fun are guaranteed with this game for the entire family to enjoy!,5.0
"What a great idea!  I love Scrabble, but even in the magnetic portable versions, it's not quite as portable as I'd like.  Cards are much easier to carry and there's less likelihood of losing a card from a deck than a letter from Scrabble.

Both the multi-player and the Solitaire options of this game are a lot of fun.  Plus, there's excellent educational value in both learning to spell and strategize.

I'm hoping the company brings out a version of this game for my iPhone. It's a lot of fun and I enjoy the different challenge.

"We have a lot of company in our home and we ordered several sets of ""Quiddler"". The ages are from 40 to 90 and it is game to have an enjoyable time. The people love it.",5.0
"If you like word games, this is a great way to have fun with up to 8 people. The game goes fast and everyone has a fine time.",5.0
Quiddler is a wonderful game and each time I play it with different people they ask me where they can buy it.  It is an uncomplicated fun game for up to eight people who can spell words.  Sort of like a Scrabble game played with cards.,5.0
What a great way to practice spelling! Faster than Scrabble and makes you think in small and big words. Good family fun!,5.0
"We enjoyed, very much, playing this game.  It works well for two or for a larger group.  It also works for people of various ages and skills.  It stretches the verbal skills of all players.",5.0
A friend who is a teacher recommended this game to me. Nice thing is you can play it anywhere since it is just a deck of cards. I played it with my 13 year old niece and she liked it too. It is a bit like scrabble where you make words for points. Try it!!!,5.0
"Games with our family and even games with friends have become very competitive.  Through 8 rounds each player must utilize as many of the cards in his hand as he can by making words out of them.  This is basically like scrabble in your hand, but you have to try to use all of your letters at once instead of in individual turns and you do not play off words made by other players.  You are on your own to turn your cards into words.

It's a fun game that can be played for hours.  I will admit that when we play we keep a dictionary nearby for help.  Cheating?  Maybe.  But it makes the game more fun.  And it is always funny when you get to use a word you learned playing Quiddler and you get to laugh when you remember how you learned it.

When my family gets together Quiddler comes out of the box.  We don't have anyone younger than 23 at this point.  I am not sure this game would be fun to play across generations when younger people were involved.  The gaps in vocabulary may be to wide.  But we have a good time when we play.  Our vocabularies are all equally small!  (Except Mom's; she always wins.)",5.0
Quiddler is a fun word game.  It can be played individually or with 2 or more players.  The game play is much more fun when you have 4 players or more.  If you enjoy scrabble but want a quicker game and less complicated one then Quiddler is for you.  It develops word skills and spelling skills but remains fairly easy.  It's a great game to play with kids.  They probably need to be 8 or up.  Great family fun game.,5.0
"I bought this card game mostly because of the great reviews it received from other customers.  I was not disappointed.  My 10 year old son and I have tons of fun playing this game, along with Five Crowns, which we bought previously.  If you like word games like Boggle, I would highly recommend this card game.",5.0
"This was the most fun, I've seen people having at a card table in a long time. I am a blind person and I brailled the cards. The sighted and the visually impaired all had a great time and we were able to play on a equal ground.",5.0
"I bought this game for family game nights over the holidays.  It was an absolute hit.  I was a little leery about purchasing a card game based on internet recommendations alone, but rest assured this game is well worth it.  If you like word games, Quiddler is sure to be a winner.  The game is very simple to learn and doesn't require a long time to play.",5.0
I bought this as a gift for my 9 year old daughter and we love it. We've played it together a few times and it's a lot of fun and it's great for learning. Playing the game with me is helping her learn bigger words and reinforcing words she already knows and can spell. I would recommend it to any one that wants a fun and educational toy for their child. It's also a great way to spend quality time with your child as they learn and have fun.,5.0
"We have been playing Quiddler for years and are always introducing friends and family to this fun game.  I purchased 4 to give out for Christmas gifts.  Even sent one to Italy this year.  It's a nice balance of luck and skill.  If you like scrabble, you'll like Quiddler.  It's a shorter, less intense game and helps everyone work on word skills.",5.0
"this is a good way to help kids with spelling. it's fun for adults as well. at thanksgiving last year, about 10 of us sat around and played for about 2 hours.",5.0
"This is a fun family game. It makes you think and then when you think you have it, something happens and you have to change your whole thinking. Its a lot more fun with more than 2 people, but even with 2 it gets interesting after the first few rounds. The first couple rounds are easy, but when you get more cards, thats when the fun really starts.",5.0
Quiddler is like scrabble with cards. educationally fun for the whole family as long as you can spell 3-5 letter words.,5.0
"Quiddler can be played with few or many players.  It is compact, so it's easy to take along on trips.  Fun for kids or adults who enjoy word games.",5.0
We play with players from 10 years to 80 years young.  We cooperate to help everyone get the most points out of each hand. The game and the dictionary stay on a kitchen chair for spontaneous rounds of solitare and group play.  We take it with us when we travel and we end up leaving it as a hostess gift more often than not.,5.0
This game is good for spelling and math learning.  Another good family/friends gathering game.,5.0
I play this game with some of the students that I tutor and they love it!,5.0
"I learned this great card game while on a cruise of the fjords of Norway and was instantly hooked!  If you enjoy playing Scrabble and love to play cards, this game is for you.  The night I returned from the trip, I ordered 8 sets.  Everyone on my list will get this for Christmas.  Just be prepared to stay up late for ""just one more game"".",5.0
Quiddler is fun and as a bonus it is also educational  We play it with our young grandchildren and play alone. We have replaced Scrabble with  Quiddler The cards are easy to carry with us on trips!,5.0
"I ordered Quiddler because it is a fun game and good for the children.
It's a good word game.",5.0
I use this game with my middle school students.  It is a Friday treat and it makes them think.  This game fosters belonging and is educational.  The kids will help each other find words so that they can go out and not lose points!  To see them working together like that and learning is great.,5.0
"I received this at my last birthday party and we had 7 adults willing to try it out.  Took a while to play, well over an hour, but it was a lot of fun for everyone I think.  Not sure about all the rules... we collectively thought the ""can only use dictionary when it is not your turn"" made it too easy for folks to hog the help.  It feels like a cross between Scrabble and cribbage.",5.0
Love the game!! Our employees play this card game with the residents at our retirement home and it is a lot of fun.  Players can make the game challenging or not; it is entirely up to the creativity of the participants.  Make sure you have a dictionary available as it makes the game more interesting.,5.0
I bought my first Quiddler game at a mall during Christmas season 3-4 years ago.  I enjoyed it so much I returned and bought 2 more for my daughters.  The game is a lot of fun.,5.0
"Quiddler is a very challenging game for adults and teenagers. It helps to develop vocabulary, is easy to learn, and doesn't take hours to play. Younger children can also play, but adults will have a decided advantage.",5.0
Get this game--agree on the house rules regarding use of dictionary--and HAVE FUN! Currently our favorite game.,5.0
"For such a simple concept, this game is a lot of fun. We can play in any of the languages used in our home (English, French, or Spanish). I enjoy this game more than I do the traditional game of Scrabble, mainly because it is a quicker game and you can keep a running score of how well (or how poorly) you are doing. Other great features are the portable nature of the game; the single/two-person/multiple-player modes of play; and the sturdy, laminated cards. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys crosswords and other word puzzles.",5.0
"Lots of fun to play!  We are all adult ladies, senior citizens, and we love this game.  It is challenging and keeps your mind active.",5.0
"My friend introduced me to this game while on a women's retreat.  We had so much fun that as soon as I got home, I went to Amazon to find it.  My husband and son enjoy playing it with me. Even our 6 year old daughter plays (with a little help from her mom).  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Scrabble or other word games. It's a good way to build your child's vocabulary. Even better, there are no little pieces to lose--it's just cards!",5.0
"For those who enjoy stretching their verbal abilities a little bit and doing puzzles, Quiddler is a great addition to the games closet.  It is a quick learn, easy to play, and more accessible and portable than most other word games.  Easy enough for children, clever enough for adults.",5.0
"I was introduced to this game by my daughter and son-in-law.  After playing at their home, I had to purchase it for my own use.  It is a fun, fast paced word game that helps to build vocabulary and spelling skills.",5.0
i saw people playing this card game  Quiddler and was excited to learn about it  since it is so portable /convenient to pack for travel yet similar to Scrabble - which i love  But then i could not find this game in local stores  so i was pleased to find it on Amazon  It arrived in a timely fashion and brand new and reasonably priced,5.0
"We absolutely LOVE Quiddler! We play this card game with all ages including my 9 and 12 year old as well as my friends and parents. As someone who was raised doing ""jumble"" word scramble, Quiddler allows you to use your creative side to rearrange the cards until you have them all used up. We adapted the rules to make it more fun and do not award extra points to whoever goes out first. We play simple rules and at times help each other out. After all, we love the challenge and educational factor of the game. I bought several decks to put in my ""gift closet"" for giving out to friends for birthdays and such. I also gave a deck to my son's 3rd grade teacher for the kids to play on inside recess days. It helps with spelling, addition, and vocabulary! Huge Quiddler fan!",5.0
"I recently purchased Quiddler after looking for some new games here at Amazon.  The entire family plays it and we love it.  My 10-year-old grandson, who is not a big fan of spelling or school work in general, asks to play this game and holds his own among the adults, with some occasional minor help.  I also have played the solitaire version of the game.  Much more fun than regular Solitaire.  Glad I got it.  Recommend it highly.",5.0
This game is wonderful.  My kids love it.  And the older kids - with more vocabulary - do not necessarily have an advantage over the younger ones.  My youngest - the eight year old - has won the last three rounds.  Highly recommended.,5.0
"I am writing to advise you that I will buy no more products from you until you rework your website to make it user friendly. AS it is now a shopper cannot view all items in the cart until checkout only to find errors then try to delete items or quantities -- it's a nightmare resulting in recieving the wrong items and amounts. i thought i ordered  2 authors games and 1 women authors game only to open my package to find 3 authors games and no womens authors.

"I bought this game as a gift for my husband.  We love it!  The rules aren't too complicated.  It is lots of fun, even with just two playing.  There are 8 rounds in a game, and they can be played in under an hour-so you can play even when there isn't loads of time.  Great for slightly older kids, too.  High quality cards and interesting calligraphy.",5.0
"Awesome game anyone who can spell (over age 7?) can play.  We use the dictionary to check our words when we play.  My parents play it at least three times a week, and we play on holidays.  It is quick and easy to understand.",5.0
"I love to play scrabble, but have a hard time finding people to play.  Then I found Quiddler!  It helps fulfill that Scrabble fix with people who may not want to committ to the time of a full Scrabble game.  And you can play this game on the go.  I played it with a friend on a stadium bench.  There are also rules for a solitare version; I have yet to try this mode.  Anyway, I highly suggest this game for anyone that loves Scrabble or wordsmithing games.",5.0
"Our neighbours introduced us to Quiddler lending us the game for a road trip.  The 5 of us on the trip played the game again and again and just loved it.  I've bought copies of the game for friends / family birthdays because it's educational, fun, easy to play and addictive.  Generally I'm not a huge games player and used to detest Scrabble but absolutely love playing this game, all ages can play (once they can read / write).  Great fun.",5.0
"My girlfriend and I went on a game shopping spree recently, looking for some good adult games that let you use your brain.  We came away with about six games, including Quiddler.  The most expensive of the six was in the $30 range.  The least expensive (under $10) was Quiddler.  So far, I think we've had a lot more fun playing Quiddler than all the other games combined.  We both like Scrabble quite a bit (I've been playing for... well... more years than I really want to admit), and Quiddler gives you a lot of the features of Scrabble, but without the cumbersome board, bag of tiles, letter trays, etc.  We started out playing it at the table, but have since moved to the living room floor.  When all you need is the deck of cards and a pencil and paper (and occasionally a dictionary) you can play it almost anywhere.  It'd be great to take along on a trip to make the miles pass more quickly.  It's a cleverly designed game that delivers a great deal of fun for those who enjoy thinking, without a bunch of playing pieces and complicated rules.  Highly recommended!",5.0
"I bought this game for my granddaughters birthday and she loved it. She played it with her friends, both boys & girls,and they had a lot of fun seeing who could make the best words. It is a game the whole family can play. This game isn't just fun it is educational also. If you like scrabble you should like quiddler",5.0
"Quiddler is like Scrabble played with cards.  It makes you think. The more I play the more creative I am with words. During the eight rounds of play, the score changes back and forth so you never know who will eventually win.  It would be great family game but my husband and I are alone so we play and have a lot of fun.  Can't wait for the grandchildren to visit.  It is a game we will play with them.",5.0
"Quiddler is a great game---the original version works for a group of mixed ages (where being the oldest and wisest is not always a secret to success!)

Winning this game depends on the luck of the draw and the ability to see strategic plays (e.g., waiting to go out so you can compare the benefit of laying down ""be"" ""at"" and ""gin"" to get a bonus for most words or laying down ""beating"" to get a bonus for the longest word).

My family made up a variation that is more like rummy...and that's a lot of fun too.  Once you have the cards, you can find many ways to use them.

The only downside--we play so much that the cards have to be replaced now and again.  : )",5.0
"I bought this card game for my daughters, ages 10 and 11.  Our whole family has had a blast playing it, and the age of the player is not necessarily an advantage/disadvantage.  My husband and I frequently play when the kids are doing something else.  We play a lot of Phase 10, which moves too slow for me.  This game moves faster.",5.0
"Quiddler is SO much fun! It's easy to learn, moves quickly, and can be enjoyed by anyone - even if you're not a ""word"" person. Even people who hate Scrabble enjoy Quiddler, mainly because it's easy to score points, and you don't have to know lots of big words! It's a must have in anyone's game closet!",5.0
"I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  We broke this out at our holiday party.  A half a dozen people who had never played Quiddler before sat down, learned the rules in about two minutes and really enjoyed the game.  Then, when those people got up to socialize, a half dozen more people who had never played Quiddler before sat down in their places.  They learned the rules in two minutes and really enjoyed the game.  That says it all.",5.0
My daughter and I have played this game over and over since we got it. You never know what will come up. You may be ahead and wham! It's fast or take your time. You can teach the young children to think about things before they act and us older...really older..ha causes you to have to take another look and think before you act as well. I usually do not play games but this is just different. Without giving it all away this game brings you out dormat and works your brain yet doesn't tax you and not want to play anymore. It will without a doubt help you with your young ones to process and think on many age levels and still have fun with it. If you could have only seen the hands I was dealt...I would think...Oh good grief...no use! But sure enough it begins to build right before your eyes and wow...I've got something! Cool!,5.0
"Item was a Christmas gift for my aunt, who had played it in October while on a trip with friends and she loved it.",5.0
"I was first introduced to Quiddler several years ago, and it was love at first play.  This is a fun word game that my kids describe as Scrabble with cards.  Now everyone in our extended family plays, teenagers and their friends, our married kids have passed it on to their families, and I've passed it on to other friends and their families as well.  There is enough friendly competition to keep it interesting as you work through levels, forming words with from 3 to 10 cards.  You can play with as few as 2 and as many as ???.  A few months ago we had a tournament with 8 people playing in 2 sets of 4.  Our cards have almost worn out from all of the use they get.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys word games and a little friendly rivalry.",5.0
it is a great game to play in the evening with the entire family it is one night away from the tv,5.0
"While I have always enjoyed board games, word games specifically have remained challenging for me.  I refuse to play Scrabble with my husband, as his skills are superior to mine and it is intimidating to play with him.  Hooray, Quiddler has given me an edge into what I term as word games.  I only have to be concerned about the cards in my hand, while playing attention to the discard/ draw deck-easy verses the interconnectivity of letters on a board which only multiply.

Each player starts with 3 cards during the first round and the number of cards dealt increases by one in subsequent rounds.  The game seems to become more challenging in later rounds when you have more cards in your hands and are trying to create words and ""go out"".  Enjoyable with two or more players!",5.0
"My bibliofile family just LOVES this game! We've played it with kids from 8 to 80. It reminds me of Scrabble, but with cards, so it's more portable. This is really a fun game for friends and family to play!",5.0
"If you love words and word games, then Quiddler is for you.  The game moves fairly quickly, so you can play round after round in an evening.  It's absolutely addictive!  Having a good dictionary handy is recommended.  Quiddler is easy to learn so there's none of that tedious wading through mounds of instructions before you can get going.  You can be playing five minutes after you open the box!",5.0
"I ordered Quiddler for my classroom (high school). I love playing it with my students. It's a great tool for improving spelling. My students like to play the game, and often ask to use it. A wonderful product.  Kay",5.0
"We bought Quiddler for two reasons:
Our other set was wearing out
Our other set is at one place when we are someplace else.
We like this game so much that we felt we needed to be sure we had it close at hand.
It is fun: the outcome remains uncertain until the last hand is played.
It is great for traveling since it doesn't take up much playing space.
Teaching it to someone else takes about 4 minutes.
It is great to play with kids--teaches them spelling and vocabulary skills.

It's just FUN.",5.0
This is a very easy to learn and fun game for all ages (including grandmothers)  enjoyed playing this very much and did not require a lot of time for each game.  If you like word games you will love this one.,5.0
"I found this game on line and read the description and decided for the price it would be great game for my daughter's 8th birthday.  Her dad, myself and her play it all the time.  It is fast so it can be played in the evenings after homework.  My daughter is increasing her vocabulary because being competitive she wants to be the one with the longest or most words so she constantly looking in the dictionary to find words to use up her letters.  It is very simple to play and figure out and it is quick to play.  Keeps the kids interest!  I have since then recommended to every parent I know to buy it for Christmas.",5.0
"This is such a fun game and much easier on the kids than scrabble. It was cheaper online than at ToysRus.  If you like scrabble you will love this game only here you play with cards so no tiles to lose.  My kids are 16, 13, 11 and 8 and all of them enjoy this game.  It may be too hard for children under 8 though.",5.0
"Our 10-year-old son enjoys this game and that is a true testament to this games value. It leads to interesting discussions about words, their meaning, history, derivations, slang, etc. that can be both informative and fun. We tend to help him out a bit when hands are played if we see an obvious word that he is missing that we think he probably knows. The playing field does turn out to be fairly even so all have fun and feel equal.",5.0
I picked up Quiddler as a time-filler and found it to be a great card game for children and adults. I am retired. Four of my retired friends and I play  frequently--good for the mind :) Since then I have ordered 8 games for my friends to give to their grandchildren. The kids love it and the game is a great vocabulary builder.,5.0
"Quiddler is a great game for the whole family.  Matching letters and numbers, it combines the skills of both rummy and scrabble.  Younger players will learn to match numbers and create words while older players will improve their skills in both.  While having a great time, players improve both math and language skills.  Our family has played the game with all ages and everyone - regardless of their skill at word games - enjoys it and is successful.  I have had the game for several years, recommended it to others and given it as a gift.  You can't go wrong with an all-purpose game like this one.",5.0
"My cousin introduced me to Quiddler two months ago, and I've been hooked ever since.  We play 4 or 5 times a week, and still really enjoy the game.  I even bought a copy for my sixth grade classroom, and my students enjoy it too.  If you enjoy scrabble or boggle you will also really enjoy Quiddler.",5.0
"My friends and family have a riot playing this game.  We are big scrabble fans so this is great to play too.  It's even easy for younger players, since you mostly spell short words.",5.0
"Quiddler was introduced to me by my 88 year od mother.  We played it on a recent visit.  I immediately purchased my own game and it has become an almost daily ritual!  Fun, fast moving, great for 2 people , even more fun for a small group.  Basically, it's similar to scrabble using cards.  Also much like word-jumbles.  Unscramble your letters and make words.  Letters have value.  Highest score wins!!! Easy to play!  Made for kids but adults will really enjoy!!",5.0
"Quiddler is like Gin but with letters.  My four years old loves it and my 80 year old aunt loves it.
It's the most fun I've had with a word game in a long time!  If you like Scrabble, Boggle, Upwords, and the Word Jumble in the newspaper, you will love this game.",5.0
"Many word-phobia types may avoid this game. But, they shouldn't! Most of the words to be formed are short words familiar to everyone. We played with a wide range of ages and abilities. We ended up helping each other get the best scores from whatever was dealt. A good game.",5.0
"This card game is a combination of Scrabble and Rummy!  It is alot of fun and can be enjoyed by a wide span of ages...  5 y/o to 100 y/o.  Great way for younger children to learn their spelling....  Adults be aware, the children are probably going to beat you!!!!",5.0
"This is like a Scrabble game, but with cards.  It's great fun for all ages, because the first hand is dealt with 3 cards and you have to make a 3 card word.  Then with each successive hand you made a 4 card word, 5 card word, etc.  Because there are several 2 letter cards, these words can actually be 1, 2 or 3 letters more than the card count.  It becomes more challenging when you get to the 8 and 9 card words, but that just makes the game more fun.  Quick paced.",5.0
"This product was recommended by a therapist at an adult day care center. My [...]son has a brain injury and we do everything we can to help him with his memory loss and retrain his brain. The game Quiddler has been one of those tools that is remarkable in helping him with his recall. It has also helped by 90 year old mother with her memory of spelling. This game is challenging for everyone, as a family we all love playing it. It is a cross between Scrabble and Rummy and most enjoyable, I would recommend this product to kids of all ages.",5.0
"We play this game allowing 'helping' from other players after the first person goes out.  We are competitive AND cooperative. A dictionary is a must.

It's fun, educational. a great gift, plays in one hour...unlike other interminable games that few busy families have the time for.",5.0
"The way Quiddler works is you play  8 rounds with each round getting one more card than the last one.  The first round starts with 3 cards.  To win that round you would have to pick up a 4th card, make a 3 letter word, and discard a card.  Even if you win that round, someone else could have made a word with more points.  We bought the Quiddler card game to have something fun to do in regard to spelling with our 8 year old son.  He's very competitive so we made a rule that if we don't help him, he can double whatever points he comes up with on his own.  My mother in law love this game, and that's saying something because she hates card games.  I personally never liked Scrabble but with Quiddler I can actually win once in a while.  My husband loves it, too.  A wonderful feature is there are enough cards in the deck to have two people playing solitare side by side.  Whenever the cards come out of the box, everyone swarms to the table!",5.0
This is a great game!  Our family loves it!  Helps with spelling and playing scrabble.,5.0

I started playing Quiddler several years ago when my daughter brought a deck with her on a weekend get-away for her and my other daughter - we had a blast.

What a blast we have had with the QUIDDLER word game.  It is great fun for adults and a learning tool for kids too.  I have played the game in both adult only or adult/kid settings and the game is suspenseful and creative for all involved.  Buy a dictionary and ENJOY!!,5.0
Making up words and being challenged is part of the fun of this game.  And not having to go back more than zero points in a hand is very hopeful in playing catchup after a lousy hand. Young and old(er) will enjoy this game.,5.0

"I really enjoy playing Quiddler--especially the solitaire version, as we don't get much opportunity to get together with others for a game night.  We did, however, play it with siblings at New Years, and all who played thought they needed to get the game for themselves. As a 60+ year old, it doesn't hurt to exercise the brain on a regular basis, either!!!",5.0

"This is a fantactic game. We have owned it for several years and it is still one of our favorites. Great for travel, compact and hours of fun.  The great thing about quiddler is that small words can lead to big scores, so when my kids were as young as first grade they could play with minimal help.

Quiddler, Set, and Five Crowns go with us on every trip.  A great product.",5.0

I've played it with people from age 9 up to age 65; I've played it by myself, with 1 other person, and with 7 others at a time.  No matter what, I've enjoyed it.  It's a great way to get your brain moving, and it can provide some pretty humurous word combinations.  I am also a teacher, and my students LOVE to play.  It isn't necessarily the best game for teaching spelling, but it definitely challenges the mind and helps one see things in different ways.  I suggest this game to anyone!",5.0
"This game is SO easy to learn... even a young 1st grader can play. There is great room for stradegy in this game, but a large measure of chance falls into it also. I learned this game in a few minutes and have been sadly addicted to it ever since.  Every person I have taught it to have also become addicted.  Only problem, it's a bit hard to find... haven't found it in the stores yet... online is the best place to buy it.

I only wish someone would create a game site where we can play online with other players.  EGADS... then I'd never leave my computer for sure!!",5.0
"This is an educational game that is enjoyed by multiple age groups and a lot of people can enjoy.  If more than the recommended number want to play, we just reduce the number of hands we play.  Really is fun and everyone helps everyone else, so there's a lot of interaction.  Good choice.",5.0
"This has become a ritual at our house. Every schoolday morning since my son was 7 (he's now 10) we've made it part of our routine to play a game while we're eating breakfast and waiting for the bus. QUIDDLER has become the game of choice, replacing chess. (He's gotten bored with that since I can't beat him anymore!)

The beauty of this game is that we can get in one or two hands on some mornings, and seven or eight on others. Either way, we canb easily pick up where we left off the next morning. Also, becasue it awards bonuses for longest word and most words, the size of your vocabulary isn't always an asset. My son has won many games with his vocabulary; he steals the ""most word bonus"" with 3-4 letter words while I'm trying to get the right letter(s) to spell ""combustion"" or some other long word!

Buy it today; you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"This is the best game I've ever played. We love it & have two decks in the house, one in the camper & one in a suitcase.  I've given it to all my children & grandchildren.

This has been a great purchase.  Kids and adults can play.  We have had lots of fun with it.,5.0
"A good friend of mine introduced me to this game this past winter. I think she may be sorry she did because it created an addiction! I would describe this simple yet thoroughly enjoyable game as similar to Scrabble but with cards. Each card has a letter and a corresponding point value. The object of the game is to score as many points with the words you create in each successive hand. I won't go into explaining the rules and how to play the game, but I will tell you that it is an extremely fun game the entire family can play. It truly is one of the best games I have seen in along while. It is so much fun that even when my friend severely beats me in a game I still enjoy playing!! Well, I have to go... I hear her calling and I gotta play some Quiddler!",5.0
"Picked up the card game this weekend, have been playing the Quiddle daily puzzle (solitaire) online at [...] for several weeks. We played several hands last night. All I need now is a new dictionary!",5.0
I'm a grandparent that loves card or board games.  This game is so much fun and challenging at the same time.  I play mostly with my 11 and 10 year old granddaughters; but know the three smaller ones will enjoy it when they get old enough.  However the fun does not stop there; our oldest son came for a visit (40yrs old) and I brought out Quiddler.  We had a really great time and now I need to buy him the game to enjoy with his friends.  Directions were simple and great to understand within minutes your enjoying the game of trying to out-word your oppnent.  I love the Solitare Version that can be played also.  Can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this game.,5.0
This game is great for absolutely anyone.  If you enjoy card games and scrabble this is the perfect combination for you.  I recommend playing this one with 4 or more people.,5.0
"My daughters are 8 and 10, and ALL of us love playing this game.  Because there are bonus points for the longest word AND for the most short words, both kids and grownups can win big points.  Both of my girls usually pooh-pooh ""educational"" games, but they love this one, and it had definitely improved their spelling.  We've had it for about six months and I've been recommending it to everyone.",5.0
"We love this game!
The cards are beautifully designed with Celtic calligraphy, and the game is clever. You play a total of eight hands in which you progressively get dealt more cards, until you reach ten. The challenge is to make words (short or long, it doesn't matter) out of the letters in your hand. You have to use all of the letters in your hand and discard one card to go out. After that, each player has one more opportunity to make words. Then, points are tallied.
This game is different every time we play it. We are constantly surprised at the great words we make. This game would appeal to card game lovers, word lovers, and strategy lovers. It would also be a good game for youngsters, as they can use their existing vocabulary (and maybe even win!), expand it, and manipulate it to its fullest.
As one of our more simple games, I know this one will be a favorite for years to come!",5.0
"My gang of friends loves card games, as long as they are somewhat off-the-wall -- no rummy for this crew. And we all like Quiddler. It's a good game for times when we want something a little challenging to the intellect but not as much of a time investment as Scrabble. And the change of card numbers from hand to hand makes the game much more interesting. Even the solitaire is more fun than solitaire games with standard playing cards.
The four stars on durability is because they *are* cards. They are no more or less durable than other good-quality playing cards.",5.0
"Quiddler is my favorite game ever.  It is great to travel with and great at parties too.  Quiddler is amazingly easy to learn and play, requiring little explanation of the basic rules.  I've played it with graduate students and ten-year-olds alike, at dinner parties and babysitting.  It's very inexpensive and easy to set up.  Because it is so lightweight and travel-friendly I often bring Quiddler on the train, camping, to the laundrimat, airport, etc.  My sister and I have played Quiddler death matches for hours!  It is so versatile that one can create any number of fun variations on the game - just like a deck of cards can be used in thousands of games - all it takes is a little creativity.  I have had my deck for over 5 years and though it is well-used, it is in great shape.  I also keep a small pocket dictionary with the cards to settle disputes.  I recommend this game to anyone as an investment that returns more than its weight in G-O-L-D!",5.0
"This is the game where Scrabble meets Rummy, with a touch of Hooked on Phonics thrown in for good measure. Quiddler is certain to entertain you for hours. This game will help sharpen your vocabulary skills in a short period of time.
The game progresses from 3 card hands to 10 card hands, and point increase accordingly. You have to constantly be thinking of words and new words as the play continues. Once you start playing you start thinking, a refreshing change in a game.
Quiddler is a true family game game that will certainly challenge even the smartest. You can take this game on the road, camping or even flying and have a great time. For those on a price consciuos budget, this game fits right in.
About the only drawback is the fact that once you discard the card is gone. I think adding a ""rummy"" like rule of taking all the cards might add for more competition and higher scores. overall this game is sure be a party favorite.",5.0
"As a huge game lover, I am always looking for games that everyone can find fun. Each round moves quickly, and as a consequence, it is easy for each player to be in the lead at one point or another. I've had people who grumbled that they hate games request to play this one again once we finished!",5.0
We just keep playing it.  It's a hit with the kids too.,5.0
"I bought this card game for my mom for Christmas.  Everyone in my family loves it, from my 10 year old son, to my 73 year old Dad. My mom and dad play it every night of the week now.  They've never done anything like that before.  Dad always got impatient with scrabble and other word games because they take a long time.  This game is fast paced and lots of fun.  I'm on the web site right now, buying another deck for my brother and one to have at our home too.",5.0
"Our boys, ages 12,9 & 5 received this card game for Christmas!  We as a whole family have had lots of fun playing it.  It's a quick paced game so no one loses interest and the kids are learning things while having fun playing!  I highly recommend this for your family!",5.0
"Quiddler is a deceptively simple word game. You can learn the rules while you play the first deal; after that the challenge is to maximize your score with the letter cards you're dealt or have drawn. Each letter has a point value, and there are extra points for making the longest word or the most words in a round.  A game takes from 20-40 minutes.
Anyone who can read and write can play, but it's more fun with players whose language skills are approximately equal.",5.0
"This game has become an instant favorite in my family... Now mind you, when I say family, I don't mean my children (as I don't have any). I mean my ENTIRE family! Grandparents, Aunts, In-Laws, they all got a kick out of it when we brought it over for Thanksgiving. We must have played 30 games over that weekend... No Kidding!
On a more helpful note, this game is so great because everybody can play, despite limited vocabulary, and playing with such a wide variety of ages ensures that everybody is learning new words! I was teaching my grandmother and she was teaching me!
The only issue with this game is that playing so frequently got the cards a bit dirty. My husband, my mother, and I took a half hour and carefully wiped down each card with a damp cloth (drying it quickly afterwards) and it gave them new life, but I guess for [money] we can afford a new copy each year! :)",5.0
"I bought this game as a gift for my parents- age 82 and 83- and they have played it non stop. My Dad was becoming very discouraged with his ability to remember things.  He now has a new lease on life since he finally beat my mother, the excellent wordsmith. I've enjoyed playing it with them - it's a challenge.",5.0
"This is a game that can be equally intriguing for the 8 year old as well as the 80 year old. All can play on a par level and have an equal chance of winning. I've given and recommended this game to so many others that when I went on the site to order another copy today, I found out that it's out of stock! Much more fun than Scrabble and a much faster game. Teaches and amuses. What more can one ask.",5.0
"Over the holidays we had this game in almost constant play.  Because you don't get more points because of how complicated your words are, the 7 year old can play her 3 and 4 letter words right up against the aunts and uncles and grandparents.  We played games with 2 players up to about 6 or 7 players, singles and teams.  I even snuck in a game of the solataire version one night when everyone else had gone to bed!  All numbers of groups worked well. This was a really wonderful family game that I know we will play again and again.",5.0

"My daughter and I already played this game by making up questions of our own...So I was excited to see the actual card game on Amazon because we like the game and after a while it gets a little difficult to think up new questions.  The game comes with 160 ""would you rather"" questions and two choice chips. There are two game play options. I will share Game Option #1: Each player draws one question card. The youngest player goes first. Read a ""would you rather"" question to the group.  Secretly make your choice by hiding the appropriate Choice Chip inside your closed fist...Blue chip #1 is for the first scenario and Red chip #2 is for the second scenario.  One at a time...each player then guesses what you choose.  After all players have made their prediction, you (the reader) reveal your choice by showing the chip in your hand.  Each player who guesses correctly is awarded a ""Would You Rather"" Question Card from the deck. You win after you successfully collect 5 ""Would You Rather"" Question Cards. Example of a question: Would you rather fall from 30 feet into a briar patch OR climb up a 30 foot wall covered with thorny stems? Great for a kids slumber party, birthday, long car rides, etc... It can be quite hilarious at times!",5.0

I am doing family gifts this year with games, snacks, drinks, and treats in a basket. Also great for camping, family night, game night with friends....

Three of my grandchildren participated (ages 4, 6 and 11).  Of course, we had to simplify the questions a little and choose questions they would understand.  My two adult sons really liked it, one said their family was talking about the game on the way home.  It's a fun game and a little absurd....that's when everyone starts to laugh. Excellent game!",5.0

I play this game with my students at school and with my siblings. Even us adults think it's a very fun game with some of the funniest/hardest/grossest questions.! We never actually play the game with the instructions that came with it because it's sort of boring to try and guess what that person would choose. We use the cards as just some bored questions to ask each other. sort of like truth or dare but we're not dumb enough to actually do any of these things.!,5.0

I really like this little money box set. You can fit bills and coins into easily and take them out. I really like the little passbook it comes with as well I think it would help for kids learning to balance a check book. My son is only 14 months but I feel like the earlier you start the better. This is super lightweight and not too big but I love the tin they used it feels more high quality then the typical plastic you see. I will be buying a few more of these for gifts to my niece and nephew as it is unisex.,5.0

I was surprised that the body of the Moonjar is actually metal and the plastic tops are easy to get on and off. The slots are wide enough for international coinage and even folded dollar bills. What a cool way to teach kids about Spending, Sharing and Saving!",5.0
"I bought three of these for my 7-year-old triplets who have just started using their own money for small purchases. I was getting tired of trying to dig nickels and dimes out of the bottom of a piggy bank, so the fact that these banks are EASY TO OPEN is huge for me! But more than that, I love how much it teaches my kids about money. They now think about the different ways money can be used, and I think that's an important lesson for all of us. I've recommended this bank to all of my friends since purchasing!",5.0
Love this bank.. has helped my daughter in many ways to see the value of saving money and the joy of giving. I had bought a different brand of this earlier and was not impressed. This is a great bank!,5.0
"The perfect 'piggy' bank!  It identifies the key elements of handling money - save, spend, donate (share).

"This has been so great for teaching my kids about money. Before we just had a piggy bank for each of them and my son never wanted to spend his money on anything. This was kind of a good thing, but at the same time, I wanted him to feel free to spend his money some of the time. The Moonjar makes it easy for him to divvy up his allowance and birthday money. We also love the ""How the Moonjar Was Made"" book.",5.0
"I bought this for my 6 year old who is having so much fun using it. We are starting him on a small allowance, $1 a week if he does his daily chores.
He gets to decide where 1 quarter goes and puts one in each slot. Plus any extra money he finds and earns he can put wherever he choses. Its a good way to let kids know that money is not just for spending.",5.0
"I really like the idea of this bank.  My son has had one for a while and is involved in deciding where his share money goes, he loves being involved(he is 4yo).  This one was purchased for my daughter to have one as well(2yo).  The containers are separate but held together by a band.  The tops on each go in securely.  Our family really enjoys this bank.",5.0
"I read Raising Financial Fit Kids and knew I needed something to help my kids learn about money.  This is great!  Every week, they get $3 to equally divide between the three sections.  They also count the money in their Savings and earn 5% interest.  I know eventually they will need to lean about investing but at 5 and 6 this is perfect.  There are no fights about buy me this, buy me that.  I simply say they have their own spending money to spend on whatever they see fit and they can save their money to buy something bigger.

Make sure to buy the Moonjar Classic.  I initially bought the cardboard one because it was cheaper but that got so tore up opening and closing every week.",5.0
EXCELLENT gift; my 6 year old LOVES it!  I highly recommend getting the book with it!,5.0
GREAT gifts.,5.0
"Great tool to teach and I llustrate financial management to kids and adults. I don't use this to actually put money in it. I use it as a tool in teaching financial management. I love how each bank is colored differently (red, blue, green) to be easily distinguished from one another. These do not hold a lot of money, but does hold quite a bit. I relabeled my banks to be 10% Save, 10% Tithe, and 80% Spend (Expenses). I just put a white label on the front of each bank. I love that the banks fit like a puzzle making a hexagon shape which takes up less space and is easy to transport rather than have three separate squares that don't fit so nicely together.",5.0

"Gave as a gift to 5 yr old niece along with multiple bills of varying amounts.  She promptly divided the bills between the sections according to what she thought was appropriate... loved seeing that the largest amount was allotted to people in need.  I wasn't sure if my older nieces required the learning experience, so gave them cash through other means.  They seemed a little disappointed that they didn't get a Moonjar too... they really thought it was great!  Next Christmas or birthday :)",5.0

"My girls, 5 and 8, love this piggy bank.  It's made of tin so if they drop it, it doesn't break. It's a wonderful concept.  Save, Spend, and Share.  They really like writing down how much money they have in the little checkbook that it comes with.  It also helps them learn how to save and share.",5.0
"I was skeptical at first. Could this bank be *too* practical? Nope. It's actually fantastic. We purchased two of them for 6- and 8-year-old kids. The kids loved them, and having the three separate tins helps them visualize how money is used for different purposes. They're well made and easy to get the lids on and off. Even with that being the case, the lids never pop off unexpectedly.

If you're using bills in these, they can fill up rather fast, so you may also want to think of another method if your child likes to save their money.",5.0

"We tried another product which was similar in function, but it didn't hold up too well.  This seems to be perfect.  The kids have a place to put their money and a way to separate it for three different purposes.  Both little and big fingers can easily access the money.  I think three separate containers communicates to children in an effective way that the money is separated and to be used for a different purpose.",5.0

"We bought this for our son when he was 5.  The three separate compartments are great, I like that it's made of metal not plastic and I like that it can be rubber-banded together or separated.  It's very sturdy and has survived being dropped and knocked about. He loves portioning out his money into the different areas and seeing how it grows.  We aren't using the little bank book yet, because he still puts money in randomly sometimes, so we'd have to count it constantly.  It will be nice to use in a couple of years though.",5.0
"This has been awesome for my son. He gets paid $3 a week allowance and puts $1 in each slot. We discuss regularly what each slot means and he has no problems not spending his money on random toys! He's excited to open up his ""giving"" slot at Christmas to help a family in need!",5.0

Great starter for dealing with money for kids.,5.0
"This is a great idea and a pretty sturdy little bank. I gave them to my niece and nephew for christmas this year and we put a little starter money in each of the areas--Save, Spend and Share. Their parents have already instilled this in them at a young age, but it was nice for us to be able to reinforce it.  I suspect there is a familial ""sweet spot"" where you can presume to know what kids should do with their money, without having their parents get annoyed with you for being preachy. I think Godparent, or Auntie/Uncle type relationship is perfect for that.",5.0
"We're doing the ""spend-save-share"" allowance thing with our nine year old daughter, so I was looking for a bank that would make that simpler. I was a little hesitant to purchase this because it seemed on the smallish size and a little pricey, but it's been a GREAT bank. The bank itself is translucent and slides out of the sleeve it arrives in, so you can see the money that is inside and how it builds up. It holds both change and paper money.

The three parts of the bank come apart, so your child can bring the ""save"" part with her to the bank or bring the ""share"" part with her to local orgnizations (we volunteer at a local animal shelter, so she brings the little ""share"" section of the bank with her to the shelter and puts the money into the donation box), etc.

It also comes with a little bank book, so your kids can input the money as it comes and goes.

All in all, I think this is a great introduction to actual banking, as well as a great way to watch money grow over time. Very neat, and great quality.",5.0

"Great for teaching kids about money.  Although does not work great for my kids when they have constant access to them because they rearrange the money.  I like that we can take down one canister at a time to limit the 'distraction' potential.  Kids are ages 7 and 4.

Update after 2 years: I'm ordering one for my now 4 year old.  Seems to be a good age to start using the bank and keeping allowance. The rubber bands do not hold up for two years (what rubber bands do?), but any old rubber band that fits seems to do.  We have plenty laying around from school paintings and grocery produce.  Also, we have had other banks that were 3 attached compartments, and this has worked way better for us - it's hard to just get money out of one compartment without emptying the rest when they are all attached together.  The banks sit compactly on a high shelf in the kitchen and are easy to take down when they get their allowance.  Then they go back up on the shelf.",5.0

"Newest update: My daughter is now 6.5, and I still think this is one of the best things I've bought on Amazon.  We recently saw one of those horrible ASPCA commercials, and she asked if we could send money to the ""dogs in cages.""  She's got the money, so she gets to make those choices.  I love that about this system.  She has donated money to the WWF twice.  If I were to do it all over again, I think I would just commit to $3 per week ($1 per container) - I didn't think that would add up fast enough, but $2 per week has added up way faster than it needs to, and so she doesn't fully understand scarcity.  Even so, she has a much better understanding of money than she would otherwise, and basically has for as long as she can remember because we started this when she was just 4.  Her little sister is 2.5, I'll be buying another one of these when the younger one turns 4.  I don't think there's anything special about the bank itself (by the way, it has held up perfectly - I was afraid the rubber band would lose its elasticity over time, but it still holds the pieces together strongly), but the system is solid, and one of the aspects of parenting that I actually feel like I'm doing right.

---

New update:  It's been a year, my daughter is about to turn 5, and I'm still really excited about this bank.  We took her ""share"" money and looked at charities online.  She chose to give to the Word Wildlife Fund, which has a cool thing where if you donate a certain amount of money, they'll send you a stuffed animal of the animal that you choose to sponsor.  She's definitely still no expert of money, but she's doing really well for her age, and understands when I say things like ""we can't afford this,"" or ""let's save up money for that.""  Great, great purchase.

---
Update:  We've now had this about 5 months.  She has used her ""spending"" money to buy stuffed animals at the zoo (which are super overpriced - but now I don't worry about it, that's for her to figure out!), and we opened up a bank account with her ""save"" money.  I honestly am so glad we are doing this.  She has a much, much better grasp of money, and what it means to spend it or save it.  We are going to do the ""share"" portion close to the holidays, when I will let her choose a charity.  She already is looking forward to that - I don't know how much she understands yet, since we haven't done it, but she will.  But in the past several months, watching the money grow, opening a bank account, using her ""spending"" money - this has been a really, really fantastic item.

---
I have been wanting to start to get my daughter to think about money, and saving it for what she wants.  I didn't know if 4 was too young (she just turned 4), but she understood immediately that she needs to start holding onto money so that she can buy a stuffed animal flamingo at the zoo.  Additionally, she is super motivated now to do things for money.  I debated whether or not I wanted to have this be a part of our routine - money as a reward, learning how to save/spend/etc. so early - but it has been fantastic.  She doesn't quite grasp the ""spending"" and ""sharing"" parts yet, but I can tell that she will soon.  I intend to wait until she has a decent amount saved up, then open a bank account where we can deposit it, and use the ""share"" money on a charity of her choice.  The book suggests putting the majority of the money into ""spend"" and only 5% into the other two, but we do 1/3 1/3 1/3.  Why not?  For now, it's working great.",5.0

He currently is so young that he really just likes playing with them, however, I appreciate that the lids snap on tight enough to where our 19 month old is not able to get them off.

"Perfect for my 4 year old. We are trying to teach her about money. I will agree that this is just three separate banks kept together with a rubber band but I love that it divides it into 3 categories: Spend, Save and Share. It helps me teach her that there is more to money than just getting it and spending it. I will say I have not looked into this program beyond getting the bank so I can't comment on any other aspects...just the bank. I also love that this is a metal bank instead of something breakable like ceramic or glass and also more durable than plastic.",5.0
"Perfect for learning how to save, share, and spend. Teaches early record keeping. As some have said, perhaps you could make your own boxes, but these fit so nicely together and look good that it was worth it to buy it. I'm sure my son will have this for a long time!",5.0

This is a great jar for teaching basics money management skills early in life. They can clearly see three different slots and are learning that not all money is for spending.,5.0
"Very Happy with this purchase, High quality-- everything is sturdy and attractive. I love the idea of the three banks and how they fit together or can be separated to bring along when we're going to use the spending money. Nice quality on closing lids and quality construction has held up to multiple droppings--I just wish they had another color combo (I have twins and it would be confusing to have two of the same jar)",5.0
"I have five children so got one each for my 8 girl, 10 and 11 year old boys. Works real well. Teaches them how to divide there money into three groups so when time for siblings birthday, mothers day, Christmas they don't have to feel there saving is going away but just use the ""account"" money box for sharing. Also the Savings box money can not be used and we put into the bank account when it gets a large amount which teaches them saving for the future. The spending box they then can focus on something they want as if they keep spending they will never have money to buy. We do 50% savings 25% spending 25% sharing. Also there is a record book I help they with to keep track no one is taking there money and they are not using there save money.",5.0
"This was the perfect gift for my grandson to get an early start not only in how to manage his money but to know that he should always be thinking of others too.

"We first purchased this for my son for his seventh birthday. We wanted to start teaching him about how God says we should use our money. When I came across this product I thought it was perfect!! He has been using his for almost two years now, and we are very pleased! He knows just how much he has to spend, and how much he has to donate. When his save slot gets full, we make a trip to the bank to deposit. He has gotten much better at letting his money sit in the Spend container without spending it! My daughter just turned 7, so of course, she got a Moonjar too!!",5.0
"The Moonjar Moneybox concept is on the money.  Save, share & spend is simple enough for even a young child to grasp.  At the same time there are many teachable momemnts.  The passbook and educational information is interesting and not overwhelming, according to my 8 year old son's response.  Finally, the product is sturdy, yet accessible.

"I bought four Moonjar Classic Moneybox Retro Tins.  One for each of my sons, ages 10,8,6, and 3.  Now it is easy to keep track of their money.  One bank is for spending, one is for tithing, and one is for long-term savings.  When we ""get around to it"" we can donate the tithing, and deposit the long-term savings in the bank periodically.  They always know how much they have to spend.  We have thought about writing little notes and keeping them in the spend bank to remind them what toy they are saving up for.  These Moonjar retro tin banks really are made out of tin, with the plastic lid that snaps securely on top.  The rubber band that wraps around the three of them is sturdy and easy to use.  One of the banks got dropped on the tile floor, tin-side-down, and nothing happened to it, it's still as good as new.  I would still be careful, none-the-less.  I wouldn't want to drop the bank plastic-lid-side-down on the tile, even though the lids are very sturdy as well.  Everything breaks on tile.  But these banks should last for years to come with proper care.  I love them.",5.0
"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter for christmas.  She immediately was excited about the different compartments, and decided she wanted to put everything in Save for now until she had enough to buy a chair she wants as well as Kidz Bop 17.

It seems to be slowly sinking in that your money is gone when you spend it all from the ""spend"" section and you need to build up more again. We also place a high priority on sharing our blessings with others and I really appreciate the sharing lesson this bank provides. The banks were well made, easy to use and the passbook is a great tool as well so they (hopefully!) learn to manage their money before another financial meltdown occours, like we adults needed to learn a little restraint!",5.0
It is a great tool to teach kids about saving money and compassion for others.,5.0
"The moonjar is a great way to help teach children about money. I have purchased two of them and have been using them with my children for over a year. I originally started with my 6 year old, but his younger brother (4) wanted to participate as well. We've made a weekly ritual out of dividing they're allowance (about $0.60 per week) across the save, spend, and share jars. They love the whole process: making little towers of out coins in front of the individual money boxes, dropping the coins in the slots of the box as well as talking about how they're going to go about using the money in their boxes for different things. The most valuable aspect of the product is that it provides a tangible way for children to talk about the concepts of saving, sharing and spending. They see the box and the money in it and are able to talk about how it might be used, for example, using money in their share box to donate toys for other children during Christmas. It is a wonderful product. I highly recommend it as well as the book that goes along with it.",5.0
My son loves this! and so do I. An excellent tool for teaching responsibility.,5.0
"First, I'll say that the organs are fantastic. The kids love them because they're disgustingly realistic and squishy, and they're made well. However, the clear plastic body shell is horribly, cheaply made. It is sorely misaligned and will barely snap together without all the bones, muscles and organs inside it...and with them inside it, it will not snap completely closed at all. If you can manage to line up some of the tabs, some of the other ones will pop out of place. We spent an entire evening painstakingly trying to get it to actually go together, with no luck.

We contacted Amazon, and were promptly sent a replacement (love Amazon!). I reserved reviewing it until we tried out the replacement.

The replacement clear plastic body shell is almost as bad as the first one was. It will almost snap completely together, but there is always one particular section that is misaligned. And, it came with one of the tabs broken off (that doesn't help things). I'm not sure we'll bother exchanging it and trying a second replacement. I think we will just be asking for a refund. This is a huge disappointment for my 8 yr old, who had asked for this thing for months (he finally got it for his birthday a couple of weeks ago). Imagine it's your 8th birthday and being so excited to get something you'd been wanting for a while, and it doesn't go together properly and has to be sent back. And then the replacement comes, but it isn't much better and the plastic body shell won't fit together properly to hold in all the parts.

Edited to add: We ended up returning the 2nd one and getting a 3rd one (thanks, Amazon!) because my son really had his heart set on this thing working. I'm happy to say that the THIRD one was the charm! This one was actually packaged differently than the other two were; the box was wider with a slightly different presentation and it seems like it was produced slightly differently. Most importantly, this one's shell actually fits together and stays together once all the part are inside it, so we are finally satisfied and my son is thrilled! I don't think I'll up the rating, though, since it took 3 tries to get a product that wasn't a hot mess, and I want people who are considering this product to be aware that there may be issues with the one they receive.",1.0
"We got this puzzle hoping for fun over the Christmas break. I think most people use like use use the 'edges' technique to start a puzzle. We looked for all the edge pieces and tried to get it going.

First-- the style of pattern that this puzzle uses for the piece shapes makes for pieces that are nearly identical. There were always several options on edge pieces that would fit together. Because the picture edge  is all grey stones, it gave no help to decide which was right.

So it became a nightmare of trial and error to fit the edges. Even after we thought we had it right we found that the inside pieces would not work and the edge must have been out of order. It was beyond frustrating.

The same problem cropped up on the parchment colored inside pieces. With large sections being all the same color, and the shape of the cut pattern being nearly the same, we have several places where the same piece could nearly fit in three of four places.

You might say what's the problem then, just fit the pieces. But it is just enough wrong to cause the nearby pieces to fit 'uncomfortably'. The result is a bumpy, unhappy fit.

I would not buy this puzzle again.",1.0

"Northing like the descripcin. Needs a lot more information  and kid interaction. Once to put it together, you had nothing else to do.  The ""follow your pizza"" was one line in the box. Some of the organs were very hard to fit on the body. A CHILD couldn't have done out.",1.0
"Very poor materials of construction.  The pegs in the feet did not align with the stand, so we could never get it to stand up.  Also, the pegs throughout did not fit very well into the holes on the matching pieces, so the whole thing would fall apart after a few seconds.  Also, the instructions came in Spanish only!  Very disappointed.  Now that I have some time after the busy holidays, I'm going to see if I can return it and get my money back.",1.0
2 pieces broke the first time my 7 year old used it. She was very careful and was playing while being supervised.,1.0
really cheap plastic that breaks at the slightest use.  Was not meant for children to use.  My children are not usually harsh on their toys but this toy didn't last longer than the first day we took it out to play with.  Very disappointed.,1.0
"Very poorly made.  The parts that are supposed to close together do not meet, the pieces do not match up and it's a struggle to try to keep the plastic closed.  Very disappointed.",1.0
"Model is not acceptable.  Pieces do not fit together; squishy organs do not stay put.  The manual is fine, but the model is terrible. My 8 year old son is very disappointed with it as am I.",1.0
"I am extremely surprised at so many positive reviews.  I first saw this item in the gift shop at the Connecticut Science Center, where it immediately sparked my interest.  I homeschool my children using Classical Conversations, and this year we are in Cycle 2, during the first half of which the entire science curriculum consists of anatomy and physiology.  My oldest daughter was very interested in the subject so I figured this would be a great Christmas present as well as a helpful learning aid for years to come.  The concept is a great one, but the execution is terrible.  The ""squishy"" organs do not stick together or fit together in such a way that keeps them in place; and because there is no piece of plastic to cover the opening of the torso, when the model is placed upright the organs slide out of position and eventually fall out completely. The hard plastic skeleton and muscles do not fit inside the clear plastic body properly and are constantly coming out of position as well.  All in all a completely disappointment.  It's going back.",1.0
"I ordered this for my son for Christmas, however her was thrilled at first, after putting it all together the plastic ""skin"" cover wouldn't close properly and looks like a cheap thing at dollar store. Also some of the parts like the arm didn't even fit in the hole to keep it in place, and the intestines keep falling out of the body once assembled and on display. If you don't mind taping some parts together then get it- but I'm sorry I even bothered getting it!",1.0
"Body parts don't last a year they turn to mush... not cool
They need to re think this",1.0
The cheep pieces of this are too hard for children to manipulate. All the pieces kept falling out. Even hard for an adult! Don't buy this!,1.0
Not that great. Hard to keep together. Keeps falling appart.,1.0
"This has the potential to be a cool game/learning activity.  The problem is that all the organs etc. were not included.  Meaning, it was missing half the parts.",1.0
This thing is poorly manufactured and almost none of it stays together. The price is not low enough to expect this quality. I crazy glued most of it together so it would last at least 1 week!,1.0
"The bone and muscle pieces will not stay in place, and the clear plastic ""skin"" will not snap together. This makes the stand useless since everything falls apart when the body is upright.

Avoid this frustrating, poorly made, piece of junk.",1.0
"I seriously do not understand the positive reviews of this product.  My wife bought this (on Amazon) for our 5 year old son as a Christmas gift.  I couldn't get this thing together.  The pegs holding the pieces to the bottom of the model enclosure either were too big so that the piece didn't fit into the enclosure or the peg was too small so that the piece would fall out after moving on to the next step.  The top part of the model enclosure would not snap into place at all locations, so as soon as my son picked it up it fell apart.  Frustrating indeed.  Poorly manufactured.  On the plus side, it seems like it's got decent learning materials to supplement the model.  Now I've got to figure out if I'm going to glue the crap out of this thing to get it to stay assembled or soothe my frustration with alcohol.",1.0
"The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place, problem is it doesn't stay. its such a tight fit, one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out. With these distractions the teaching focus is lost and quickly becomes more a puzzle project than a teaching opportunity; net-net, not a good teaching tool. Its also much smaller than I thought it would be.  We returned it.",1.0
"Even with an adult's help, this was impossible to put together. The body itself could never quite close and so the innards wouldn't stay in place. If I knew how poorly made this was, I never would have purchased it.",1.0
"I purchased this for my 3rd grade daughter for Christmas after reading a number of good reviews on Amazon's website.  After receiving it and opening it, virtually all of the organs and other spare parts were missing.  Where was the quality control on this one?  Obviously a returned item or just poorly assembled.  It looked pretty hands-on and educational, but we were not able to get a return.  WE DID GET A FULL REFUND HOWEVER.",1.0
"The organs felt gross as promised, but the workmanship (or work-machine-ship) was so shoddy that we immediately whisked it away from the 4-year-old and sent it back.  Luckily, he's forgotten all about it.",1.0
The squishy organs are enticing but nearly impossible to put back together.  My 8 year old daughter stopped trying after 2 or 3 tries.  Very disappointing. Wish I got the hard version.,1.0
This book is OK. It just has you going all over the pages just to give you dots. Then the pictures aren't very good.,1.0
Paint started comming off after playing the game for second time,1.0
"So bad.  It wasn't what I thought it would be.  I ordered it for my mother who has Alzheimer's to keep her busy, but after I saw it I knew I couldn't give it to her.  Even for myself, you would have to have a magnifying glass to see the tiny numbers.",1.0
"The paint is already chipping off. The colors are difficult to distinguish between each other (i.e. Red vs orange).  The game, though, is really fun.",1.0
Too young for grandkids so they donated it to school.  My err in purchasing.  My friend recommended it and they loved it.,1.0
"I played this game at a friends and loved it.  I ordered for my son for Christmas.  When he opened it, several of the pieces were stuck together and when we got them apart the pain came off of the shapes making it hard to see.  Also we had a duplicate red square and were short a red circle.",1.0
Great fun to play,1.0
"The game is great but I do not recommend ordering it from MindWare because ours arrived smelling strongly of mold/mildew. The box/packaging/instructions had to be thrown out immediately. I hoped that laundering the bag in which the tiles are kept would help the issue--nope, that had to be tossed too. We aired out the tiles and now they only smell faintly or mold/mildew but the smell is definitely still there. Perhaps MindWare has some kind of flooding/humidity issue in their warehouse that they have not properly taken care of? I recommend this game, but strongly suggest you purchase it elsewhere.",1.0
I wish I knew what I was missing my 15-year old daughter and I played this once and we were bored by how easy it was. But there are so many high rated reviews! What are we missing????,1.0
"Returning game. Box was torn, inside box was moldy, game pieces unopened. Disappointed.",1.0
"Love this game, however...some of the squares had large chips out of them and just painted over.",1.0
"I've purchased this game at a toy store and when compared to that one, this appeared to be of terrible quality.  The tiles smelled musty, paint was chipping off of the squares and the storage bag that was supposed to come with the game, was missing.  This is a great game - I just would stay clear of purchasing from this seller.",1.0
"I was very much looking forward to buying Qwirkle and playing the game with my nieces! From all the reviews I've read online, it seems like a great game to play with family.

Unfortunately, the manufacturer I purchased the game from (this one) seems to be counterfeit. The game comes in the same box packaging, but there is a different logo at the bottom right. Additionally, there are numerous spelling mistakes on the back of the box. Inside, they do send you the wooden game pieces, but about a dozen of them come chipped. Lastly, they do not give you a bag in the order, though it is advertised as coming with one.

After more research, this isn't an isolated problem. Many customers have reported that this product does not contain the bag. Do not buy this product! Make sure you get this game from the actual publisher, otherwise you will be very disappointed.",1.0
"i bought this as a Christmas gift for my brothers family, they have 5 children and none of them could understand
how to play this game,  Directions complicated.  Disappointing",1.0
The instructions make no sense. Waste of my money. In order to play it. We made up our own rules.,1.0
Fun game gave as a gift. Was missing some game pieces. sad cause this was gift for the whole family. can anything be done?we just open it. Thank You JimL,1.0
Boring and hard for kids to understand.  I haven't got my children interested in it.....,1.0
I bought this based on good reviews and lightening deal but when we tried to play it was hard to understand the instructions.  Between 3 adults we tried reading the sparse instructions and playing but it wasn't entertaining.,1.0
"LOOK FOR THE OLD VERSION OF THE PRODUCT. THIS ONE IS POOR QUALITY. This is review for Qwirkle Board Game
Mindware, Sold by: Amazon.com LLC.
During the game you are supposed to keep the wooden blocks in a bag (to draw new blocks without looking). The problem is the current bag is so small, it cannot actually fit all the wooden blocks in it. Moreover, the diameter of the bag (it has a bottom made of a circular piece of fabric) is so small and the bag is so tightly packed with blocks that you cannot close the box when storing blocks in the bag. Well, you could just store the blocks in the box, and put the bag on the side - this makes sense, right? Problem is the lid of the box has a hole that they made to show you the blocks, so the wooden blocks can easily fall out.",1.0
A little too much for my grandson.,1.0
"gave to our grandson this year for Christmas, It was a box of tiles and that is it!  No instructions for game rules, no bag for the tiles.  Not real exciting for a 7  year old, what a disappointment!!!  Would appreciate getting the rest of what should have been in the box.",1.0
Confusing to play.  Only tried once.  Will be giving it to SPCA for them to sell and get some money to take care of the animals.,1.0
"This was not a real Qwirkle game. It was in a different box, not the quality of the real game. It was a knock off. I was very disappointed. This was represented as the real game in the picture. The only good thing was it came quickly. It was a gift, so I decided to keep it. I would not buy from this seller again.",1.0
"This board game was a present. Total waste of money. So, you line up the same colors and shapes in rows and get points. Boring after two seconds.  Big disappointment. I had to throw away!!!!!",1.0
"Like many others the box was sealed but had no bag inside, no instructions, the paint was rough and peeling. In addition the wooden tile paint smelled terrible!! I tried airing out the tiles for a week on the porch but everyone who saw the game said the odor of the tiles was horrible and probably toxic paint. I threw the game away and wish I could reorder but too many others say they were disappointed by knockoffs also.",1.0
"The game I received was missing instructions and the carry bag that is supposed to come with the set.  I contacted Mindware directly and was told that the missing items would be sent within 10-15 business days.  A month later, I have still not received the instructions (which are too small to read and formatted poorly when printed off the internet) or the bag.  My emails to Mindware have either been not returned or responded to rudely.  Waiting to see if Amazon will intervene.

My suggestion:  buy the game at a physical store so that you can return it easily.  Too much hassle for a silly game.",1.0
"If I could give this zero stars, I would have.  I write this review in the hopes of warning other potential buyers.  The version I received is a cheap knockoff with uneven wooden blocks, NO instructions, and NO draw string bag!  Please be careful when purchasing this item on Amazon as I am not the only person this has happened to.  I'd recommend getting this at a store and making sure it is the authentic version by MindWare and not the terrible knock off by Smart Elephant that I got.",1.0
"I do not have ""hands on"" experience with the game.  I bought it for my grandkids because it was rated so highly for young people.  My grandkids are 14, 11 and 7 and they cannot figure out how to play the game.  I unfortunately live two states away from them so I cannot ""see"" the amount of adult involvement nor can I assist in the adult supervision.  Regardless, a fourteen year old should be able to take up the baton and run with it if the game was for young folks.  Thank you, Maxine Bradley",1.0
"We only received the Qwirkle tiles.  There was no bag to put the tiles into and no instructions on how to play the game.  The box was only the size of the package of tiles so you cannot use it for storage either.  I was very disappointed with this product and where it came from.
My mother purchased a Qwirkle game from Amazon and it was as stated in a great box to store everything in.  It also came with the bag for the tiles and instructions.  There were also stickers like the picture shows on the front of the box, mine did not have any endorsing stickers.
I don't know who the vendor was for her game but it was the original version.  I feel that I received a knock off version for my order.
I am very disappointed with this Amazon purchase and will think twice before certain purchases again.  They are not always what you see.",1.0
"I was excited to receive this game which I originally saw on Wil Wheaton's show Tabletop. Upon opening it, I realized it is missing the bag for the tiles AND the instructions! Boo to Amazon for shipping defective items. Unfortunately, it is not worth my time to return it.

Also, the display box is very poor quality, including low resolution printing and even typos! It looks like a cheap reproduction rather than a commercially released game. I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift. Thank God I just bought it for myself.

UPDATE: Amazon is shipping a Chinese knock-off version by smartelephant, not the REAL version by MindWare that is pictured. EVERYONE is complaining about this item not including the bag or instructions. (You can find and print the instructions on Wikipedia.)",1.0
I just opened the box; there's no bag or instruction booklet as advertised on the box. Those items aren't missing as there's no room for them. It's very tedious to get the 108 tiles back into the box. I haven't yet played the game with my grandchildren so I can't evaluate it. It doesn't say Mindware on the box. Won't let me give zero stars.,1.0
"This came with only the tiles.  No instructions and we still have not figured out a way to print instructions from Mindware's site.  There is also supposed to be a bag--this was missing, too.",1.0
I should have read the other 1 star reviews.  This game comes with no bag or instructions.  That should be noted in the product description.,1.0
"The game was missing the instructions and the bag to hold the pieces.  The parts are cheaply made as well.  Deeply disappointed in this product.  As others stated, this product appears to be a knock off of the picture shown above.  There were misspelled words on the box.  Unfortunatly, we were unaware of the missing instructions until we opened the package.  If interested in this game, purchase from your local store.",1.0
Love the game but I gave it as a Christmas gift and it was missing the bag and instructions. Good thing we played together and I knew the rules. Disappointing that Amazon would sell something like that without knowing.,1.0
"Great game if it had all the parts. I received a box with a bunch of loose tiles inside. No instructions, no cloth bag. Good thing I had played the game before and knew the rules. Maybe they should ensure the box hasn't been opened before they ship it out.",1.0
"I ordered this game as a Christmas present for my mom. The game that we received was a Chinese knock off version of the original game. It did not include the bag or instructions, and the text on the box included strange typos like ""for 2 to 4 palyers"". Looking at the most recent reviews, it seems that several people are receiving the same knock off version.

Amazon, please stop selling the knock off version and check your supplier for this particular game. It's a wonderful game, but people are going to be soured to it if they can't get the complete, original version.",1.0
"Both the bag and the instruction booklet are missing.
That is inconvenient because now a computer is required to read the instructions and I have to come up with some kind of bag to hold the blocks.",1.0
My game was given as a gift and the instructions and tile bag were missing.  How embarrassing to have to find directions online.,1.0
I am very disappointed.  I got this game without any directions or the bag it is supposed to have.  Also the pieces are cheap wood with the colors already coming off.  If I could have at least gotten the directions I would have been happier.  The game I got is not from mindware but from smartelephant which I presume is a chinese knock off.  If I was qwirkle I would want to come after Amazon for stealing their game and giving it such a bad name.  DO NOT buy this from AMAZON.,1.0
"All the components of the game were not included in the game box.  It states on the back: one instructional book, bag, and 108 tiles.  The only thing found in the box are the tiles.  How do you expected someone to play a game without instructions.  I too agree with others that you should buy it direct from a store, so you know you have all the pieces",1.0
"I am reviewing the Amazon purchase of this item, NOT the game itself.

It came well packaged in your typical Amazon box. We bought two of these, one as a Christmas present for my son and another as a birthday present for a friend of his. Both boys are six years old. It has great reviews, and I couldn't wait to play it. We opened it early when his grandparents stopped by and were in for a shock.

NEITHER game came with instructions. Also, there is supposed to be some kind of draw-string bag for the tiles. No bag either. I've tried to download and print out the pdf from my computer, but it's not working. Needless to say, I'm pretty frustrated.
My advice? Buy the game from an actual store so you get all of the components.",1.0
Purchased this for our 6 year old.  tried to play it once.  the instructions were too difficult to understand and play.  getting rid of it today.,1.0
"I purchased this game after playing it a few times with friends. Their game, only 3 months old, has wooden pieces. The new version has cheap, hollow plastic pieces. You spend the entire game handling these pieces, and the sharp edged plastic pieces are not a substitute. I guess I'll get out the table saw and make new ones. Then I can donate the old ones to a thrift store.",1.0
"'Quiddler' is much preferred, so it isn't chosen very often by my friends.  Maybe youngsters would like it better..Certainly very colorful!",1.0
"I bought some of these as presents because of the many positive reviews and the hundreds of 5 start ratings it has on Amazon.com. I opened one and played it with one other person, and we both found it very boring. Keeping track of score is not fun (though I guess people who like scrabble and other such games will not have a problem with this). It just didn't excite us. I expected much more given the reviews. Maybe its just a matter of taste (we are in the minority on this one, after all).

Now I am strategically giving these away - I want to give them to people that won't give me a bad reputation for giving crappy presents. I'm targeting parents of kids around 4 years old that will have fun playing with the blocks.",1.0
"Reviewers forget to mention:  this game is endless. I bought it for my grandkid, and we played, and played, and played.  The fun disappears after an hour or so, then you pray for an earthquake, or something to get you out of the house.  Candyland can take awhile, but you can cheat your way to an early conclusion, I don't think there is an easy way out of this game, maybe feign a stroke.  Even the kid eventually got bored.  This game is educational--it sure taught me a lesson the first (and last) time I played it.  Do yourself a favor--create your own, more exciting, game.  I recommend ""Watch grandpa sleep.""  or buy a less painful game, like ""Dan the Dentist's home root canal kit.""  You have been warned!",1.0
"Dull and boring. Very obscure refrences to very old movies. The ""Video Clip"" portion is the only funny part of the game because it is so laughably easy.",1.0
"This Scene It is poorly written.  We have the Seinfeld Scene It game and everyone, including people who have never seen the Seinfeld show, can enjoy it because it shows lots of fun video footage (Comedy Movies shows very little) and the questions are not based on arcane trivia that only experts can recall.  Our whole family, even the movie expert, said that Comedy Movies is no fun.  The writers of Comedy Movies can learn a lot about how to put together a good Scene It game by following the example from Seinfeld Scene It.",1.0
"We have many Scene It games and really enjoy the quality of the product. So we were excited to see this game as our whole family loves comedy films. It hard to describe how disappointed we were with this edition. Poor film selection, poor scene selection and a bad user interface. We used a blue ray DVD player and it had a long delay every time we needed the remote, which is often on an interactive game. In our opinion, the company did not pay up for clips of more popular classic comedies. Move on to your next choice...",1.0
"Confusing rules, not easy to set up, bad presentation, and just simply not fun to play. Obviously the South Park clips are hilarious, but not worth it.",1.0
Very disappointing.  I have played other Scene It games that were good.  This one - the My play didn't work.  It never gave the answer.  Bad game.,1.0
"This is not so much a product review as a disappointed shopper's lament, as I'm still waiting for the item to arrive. I ordered this December 7, with estimated arrival date of December 16. It's still not here, but it is now $9.99 instead of $14.99. So now looks like a great time to buy, if you don't need it by Christmas.",1.0
"B-O-R-I-N-G.  That's basically what this comes down to.  I am a huge fan of the books and movies, and no, I'm not a teenager, I'm in my 30's.  I was so excited for this game because I also love the original Scene It games.  However, the questions here were so easy and ridiculous that someone that hasn't even seen the movies, but knows the general idea of what it's about, can get these answers correct.  Don't waste your time or your money.  Sorry to say it, but I wish someone would have told that to me.",1.0
"Do NOT buy this. Game cannot be played without software and the DVD doesn't work.  The phone numbers and websites listed are all defunct.  Paramount bought Screenlife, the company and then shut it down in early 2012.  It looks like it could have been a lot of fun.  Nice concept, but DVD materials should have been available on-line.  Now we just have a gameboard and some pieces and NO GAME.  DO NOT BUY! This toy and all the screenlife games should NOT BE FOR SALE!!!",1.0
"Love the Simpsons, so we thought it would be a great family Christmas present. Wrong!!! The rules are confusing. The answers do not make sense. Not fun at all. My family muddled through and finished just because they felt sorry for me for being excited over the Family Gift.",1.0
"Bought this as a game we could play as a family, including our 9 year-old.  I would not say we're avid fans, but we do watch a lot of the show.  But we could hardly answer any questions.  After several games like that, we shelved this product and it now sits unused.",1.0
"This game is a huge rip-off. After only an hour of playing, you will start to get questions you've seen before. After a few hours, you'll see so many repeats that it starts getting irritating. After a few more hours of playing, you'll see more repeats than original questions, and the game will have lost all entertainment value.

It's a shame, too, because it seemed like fun.

I want my $ back.",1.0
"It's a good thing I bought this when it was on-sale because it is not worth the money. We own six of the SceneIt DVD Games and love them all. This game is not like the others - it is simply Mini-Games that you play over and over again which is extremely boring. There are no trivia cards, My Play or All-Play included at all. Some of the cut scenese were cute...the first time through, but they replay those as well. We played it once and I guarantee we won't ever play it again.",1.0
"The set was missing 1,000 and 100,000 disks. This seemed very odd",1.0
"Okay, so I'm going to preface this by saying the ridiculous s&h price is behind most of this review. Find another seller who will not charge you an arm and a leg for s&h. I'm not impressed with these discs, at all, considering the price I paid for them.",1.0
"The quality of the puzzle materials itself were fine, but it came with 3 pieces missing.  I finished the puzzle in less than half a day, so they were obviously missing at shipment.",1.0
"I bought this puzzle to teach my precocious 7 year old the cities of the US, since he has known the states and capitals for 5 years. When we first put it together, I noticed that at least two cities in Florida were wrong. We live in this county, and know that Palm Bay is NOT north of Melbourne. I wrote to the company three weeks ago informing them of this error and they ignored me. I am sure they have errors in other states, too, and we wouldn't know it. So this puzzle is useless for teaching anything. What a waste of money! And what great (ha ha!) customer service from Maps International.

PS Their wall maps are wrong, too.",1.0
"Got this for my 70 year old mother, we had a blast doing this puzzle until we were finished.  I think it must be coincidental because the piece that was missing is the part of Michigan that I live in.  Go figure.",1.0
"My kids and I were intrigued by the idea of a hunger-games game. We have all read (and enjoyed) the books and we bought the game based upon our belief that the books are  well-written and entertaining.  The game, however, disappoints.

Initially, the game has very little connection to the spirit of the books.  The premise of the game (gathering approval points) was an idea rejected by the main character (as was the act of participating in the hunger games - including training).

Not only does the game miss the mark from an ideological point of view (as noted, if you identify with the main character of the books, you will likely be disappointed with the game's premise), it also fails to entertain.  Gameplay is tedious and mechanical. It is as if the game's creators intentionally set out to make the most tiresome game imaginable. My kids and I gave up after one round of play.

I would not recommend this game.  If you hope to recapture the feeling that the books bring about by playing the game, you will, in my opinion, be disappointed. Notwithstanding this, the game itself lacks entertainment value.",1.0
Purchased this for my wife and I to play.  The 'New Rule' and 'Goal' cards came up way too often to allow any real strategy to develop.  Perhaps the original version of the game had better mechanics.,1.0
"What a rip off, You can fit it in your shirt pocket. maybe if it was 50 cents or you got it out of a gum ball machine it would be ok. I was planning on giving it as a gift. now I need to find something else. Buy a packet of Post-it notes and make the game yourself.",1.0
Not near as fun as I hoped,1.0
There's no strategy to this game.  The conditions of victory are constantly changing so there's no way to know who is close to winning.  Someone just wins out of nowhere.  It's basically the same as rolling dice to see who wins.  It's incredibly boring and I'm perplexed that people rate it so highly.,1.0
Does not have the English word on the back  of cards.  It does not help you if they have a list of all of the Spanish words and their English translations on a separate sheet. If you're trying to learn Spanish you are going to have a very hard time connecting the English word to the Spanish word this is a very dumb concept save your money,1.0
I am annoyed by this product because the listing lies about the product. It states that there are 3924 words that it will help you learn. There are 104 cards with the same word on both sides with photos and no translation. Shame they couldn't sell this honestly.,1.0
"SAME word on back and front. Thought they would have Spanish on one side, English on other side.",1.0
No pronunciation included.,1.0
Comments said that it was English on one side and Spanish on the other. We brought to Guatemala with us to help our sponsored kids with learning English and were surprised to find out they were only in Spanish! Completely useless for them.,1.0
Terrible.  The Spanish word is on BOTH sides which pretty much makes it useless as a flash card to learn Spanish.  Would be better to have English on one side and Spanish on the other.,1.0
I think one side of the card should have the American word.,1.0
the picture and word is on the same side of the card.  these won't work for a 5 year old trying to learn.,1.0
"Dont buy if you don't know spanish! These cards have No English on them. Thought they were spanish translated.  They are only spanish, have pictures on them but you have to hope that its what you think. I should have listened to the other hints when they said not for beginners! Wish I could send back!",1.0
"I wanted something with English translation, and it's just the Spanish word and a picture...and the picture isn't always clear. I also wanted to know how to pronounce the words, and it doesn't have that.",1.0
Too many dots and too small. The image shown was magnify. This is too hard for my son and I wanted to get it for him for vision practice.,1.0
"Dungeon Roll is barely a game. It ALMOST as boring as Candyland, and involves 1 or 2 more decisions.

Here are all the decisions available to players of Dungeon Roll:
Roll the dice (not a decision..well, I guess you did decide to play)
See what happens (also not a decision)
Roll again? (ooh! First decision!)
Stop rolling? (ooh! I can choose this more boring option instead of rolling again!)
Quit the game forever (Definitely the right decision.)

Don't buy this game.",1.0
"I don't think we are non-intelligent people (other reviewers didn't seem to have a problem), but we couldn't even get this game started because the instructions were so complicated. We passed everything out, read through it all multiple times, tried to do a mock first round (which consists of 4 phases that have sub-categories), and still couldn't figure it out. It looks cool and I'm sure if you google it you can figure it out but prrrretty confusing.",1.0
"I didn't buy this from Amazon- I saw it on a shelf in a store alongside two of my favorite games and thought I'd give it a shot. Its surprisingly a very simple game despite instructions that do no help in understanding how it's played- I had to watch a 20 minute video from the manufacturer on how to play and I still have nuance questions.

There is absolutely no strategy to it at all-  you literally just roll two sets of dice and line them up.  The only decision making in the game is, do or don't, and push your luck or keep what you've got, but not in a fun way.  Some of the concepts seem interesting enough, but seem poorly developed to sell as a game.

Would not buy again. Please everyone, save your money.",1.0
"Just played this game. Well, suffered through it. Ended up quitting. This game was boring. I only got to play once in seven hands because of all the residential cards. And the people with me who actually got to play on their turns were also bored and ready to quit.",1.0
Feeling totally ripped off. I ordered what was in the title. The title says it is a board game. It is not. It is an expansion to a board game. Very annoyed at the lack of clarity in the posting,1.0
"The game was in awesome condition except for one thing, we did not receive the black market card! I don't want to waste money shipping it back and having another shipped to me, so if we could work out a way to have that card mailed to me, I would update this review. There is a picture of the card in the rules book, but that's the four person version, and we would only ever play with three people so I have no idea what the rules for three people is.",1.0
Bought this for a friend for Christmas who loves SOA. We still have not played the game. She tried reading the directions and said it's very complicated. A lot of directions and pieces to the game. I just thought it would be fun to play with a group of friends. Guess the gift didn't go over very good,1.0
Looks great and all the pieces are awesome but SOOO Confusing and hard to follow. There are so many rules which makes it hard to keep up with. My friends and I finally gave up after 45 minutes are reading directions....,1.0
Boring and slow paced. The board also coming in two pieces and don't line up well. They also are very hard to keep connected and the have a slight bend in them that makes it hard to,1.0

FMS is a free downloadable simulator. It can help a beginner learn the art of flying an RC plane. I can only give positive comments about a sim that is available for free. As for this controller. It's resolution is low. Sticks are sluggish. There's no functional trim switches. They are only fake molded switches. I recommend spending a little more for a better controller.,1.0
To difficult to install in PC ended up throwing it away.  Don 't waste your time.,1.0
Wasted money. Do not buy. go and find something else more expensive. This very cheap and you got what you paid for. Wasted my $20,1.0
"Works, but only sort of. Really cheaply made and not worth the money. If you're looking for an R/C sim that will help you learn to fly, spend the money on a real one and don't waste your time with this one. You'll really have to work to get it to do anything and it will be a source of constant frustration.",1.0

"I needed a controller for my Clearview Flight simulator because my Esky controller was no longer functional. The Esky ran on Windows XP for years without a hitch using the Clearview software .  Despite the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance on this product.  It arrived well-packaged and in good shape; however, those are the only positive things I can say about it.  Only one of the four control positions worked on my computer.  The product is very poorly made even when compared to the low-end Esky controllers.  I sent it back to Amazon in 24 hours.  You may be the lucky person who purchases one that works.  If you like to gamble then GO FOR IT, otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this. Amazon should pull it from its inventory based on the number of 1 star reviews.",1.0
"DO NOT BUY. They are cheap in every way. There is a large dead zone in the controls. It is in the middle of each joystick's throw, which renders these unusable. There is also a large amount of control jitter, which makes the plane/copter wander all over the place. I would even recommend it to my worst enemy.",1.0
this is the worst r.c. training program in the hole world. i think its 1985 tech. had to install drivers by hand on windows 7 COMPLETE DISASTER  F- it's this kind of stuff that makes me think about what the hell amazon is thinking. IF i COULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS IT WOULD BE -5,1.0
Not good don't buy it,1.0
"It must have been factory reject. The controller has to have been made upside down. The throttle was opposite of what it should have been. To start you have to bring control stick down. To stop/slowdown, you move the stick up. Totally backward. You cannot alter the controls in the simulator. The aircraft in the simulation always wanted to turn left, regardless of, or where, your adjustments were placed. It was a POS from beginning. Guess I got what I pad for..

"Not recommended.  It's hard to practice flying smooth with this Tx controller because the rudder (left stick left and right) movement is very stiff.  Makes it hard to bank turns smoothly with a helicopter, because rudder input is always jerky. It's hard to give rudder just a little bit of input with this problem. Just order a cable for your real transmitter, much better.",1.0

"I've been using R/C flight simulators for over a decade and have had the opportunity to test a variety of different USB-powered transmitter peripherals such as this one.

The Volantex is about 1/2 the size of a normal R/C transmitter and extremely cheaply made. The trim switches are just for show and non-functional (and will break loose and rattle inside the case if you accidentally press them), and the rate switches (the silver switches on top) are tiny and cheap.

But worst of all, when plugged into Windows joystick calibration, I discovered the right stick failed to register full stick movement. It would only register from center stick and down, but not up at all. Making this device completely useless for its intended purpose. So this defective hunk of junk is headed back to Amazon.

There are similarly-priced alternatives from a certain large Asian hobby distributor based in Hong Kong that work great right out of box. I was hoping this might be a Prime -eligible analogue but unfortunately it's just crap. It's a pity that precious natural resources were used to create this garbage.",1.0

The thing weighs about 2 oz.  Trim buttons are cosmetic only, even then one was popped out and falling into the controller - right out of the box, which was not damaged in shipping.  Right joystick only functions intermittently, making it worthless.

Software is worthless.  I knew that going in too, but perhaps it should have been a warning about the level of care that goes into this product.

yes it is deffinitly true you get what you pay for simple instruction --- with no trouble shoot help -- or  compatable issues or patches update fixes -- i use windows 7 pro and managed to get it work afet a day and if your willing to reinstall this software every time you reboot -- go for it -- i am new to this hobby and thought why go all out at first -mistake-- you will certainly waist $30 -- you may as well save  what you will spend on this E-SKY and go for the phoenix or the real flight  instead --,1.0

There is no hard copy information in the packaging for installing the software, but there is a video included on the disc to ""show"" you how.  The resolution on the video however is so poor that you can't read any of the writing in the examples to allow you to recognize the screens when you see them.

This is just plain awful product.",1.0
"The FMS software that comes with it is a waste of time. It is noisy buggy and just waste your precious time. I would suggest you buy a real flight simulator.
The only way you can use it is by downloading another software named Clearview that will cost you $30 after the trial expires.
Flaws:
In Win7 you need to disable the texture to avoid the flickering.
You need to recalibrate the controller all the time, and this operation is very difficult.
If you are somewhat serious regerding RC flying, consider Realflight or Phoenix.
I do not understand why amazon sells such a crappy product.",1.0
"A piece of junk not worth buying. I've been fooling around with it for the past 5 hours and am no closer to a solution than I was when I started.

"I have purchased two of these drones and this particular model has one major design flaw.  The drone comes with extra rotors, however I have had a major problem with both of the drones I purchased sheering off the screws that hold the rotors in place.  The screws that hold the rotors in place are so tiny that they cannot be easily replaced by visiting a hardware store or Home Depot/Lowes.  There is no question these should be cotter pins, not tiny screws.  If Hero RC insists on using the screws then they should send an extra screw with each extra rotor (4).  The first time it occurred I didn't think much of it, but when it happened multiple times on both my drones I knew it was a serious design flaw.  If it were not for this issue this drone would be fantastic, however if you sheer one of these screws you are grounded.  This should be a simple fix for Hero RC and it's disappointing that they haven't discovered and corrected this issue.",1.0
"First flight was great. One battery failed and would not charge for the second flight and after that neither battery would charge. Instructions are very bad. Customer service doesn't exist.

I emailed customer service a couple of time a week ago and still haven't heard anything back",1.0
I received the Hero RC and was very excited. Upon charging the batteries and flying for the first time I didn't notice any apparent problems. On my third flight I was about 100 feet up when on of my propellers went shooting off straight up into the air. The drone crashed not to far away suffering only minor cracks in its Styrofoam protective body. The propellers are only connected by a VERY SMALL screw. I suggest taking all 4 propellers off and placing a screw of the same width but twice as long.  I only swapped out 2 of the screws. on my fourth flight another propeller shot off and this time my Hero RC caught a wind drift and floated about 500 feet away never to be found again. Its to light and not enough power. I called customer service and they admitted people complain all the time about the small screws securing the propellers. They told me I can not receive a refund and they wouldn't even give me a discount on a new Drone. So screw this drone and the company horse it rode in on.,1.0
Ordered this drone for my husbands birthday and when it was opened the propellers would not work and it did not come with the camera that was advertised. I took it to a hobby show and the clerk said the drone was not synchronizing with the remote. The picture of the drone box is what I received but not what I ordered or paid for,1.0

"Bad, money waste, piece of trash...never works fine,after 2 flies it just die...and never will fly again, don`t waste your money, it seems to lose power after few flies , and you don`t know what`s wrong with the bird, could be the main motors , or the lipo battery , or the receiver.... i don`t know why they sale that piece of plastic garbage named helicopter... amazon never answer my refund request or mail to me...nothing ...carefull with syma products...

Bad , don`t buy it...money waste...nobody will be responsible for damage helis on amazon`s web page.",1.0
"1st one I bought, out of box failure.  Never got to fly it.  Tryed a 2nd one.  It failed shortly after a couple of flights.  Really poor quality and/or poor QC. The little time it did fly, it was stable, easy to fly, looks awesome and was fun.",1.0
"The Syma S009G AH-64 RC Apache helicopter is a terrible product. After 3 flights the model will not lift more than a few inches off the ground. After looking on the internet, this seems to be a common problem. Syma however; will not address the problem and after several weeks of trying to contact Syma's customer service (Both US and China) they refuse to contact me about the problem.

Simple, do not by this product",1.0

"This was a christmas present and the first time it was put on the charge it burnt up and ruined it, so we returned it and bought again thinking it was just a faulty one. We purchased again hoping to have better luck, we didn't. The second time it charged fine but it wouldn't fly properly and it went downhill very quickly. I suggest you look at another helicopter since we got two faulty ones.",1.0

"They must really be cranking these babies out as this one was missing one of the 4 main rotors!!!  I used a rotor from one of my older scrapped choppers and it will fly but this bird does not fly well at all. I have probably owned 20+ of these Syma type choppers and as they get older they typically do two things.
1. The battery life gets shorter and shorter.
2. They become harder to control in that they start doing sort of an oscillating motion if you aren't in hard forward flight.

This particular unit is doing the oscillating from the get go. Am sending this puppy back!",1.0
the helicopter worked for about a month (or less) and now the battery won't hold a charge. It was a Christmas gift and I am VERY disappointed with it and would never buy again nor recommend it to anyone. Have noticed other people have had similar issues and can't get a response from customer service at Syma for possible solutions to this problem.,1.0
Won't fly straight and wants to go backwards on take off I have had a few of these this one is really the only one that has not worked so good,1.0

After reading all the positive reviews and knowing many of these kind of helicopters get terrible reviews I felt this one was the one to buy.  My son opened it on his birthday and then charged it being so excited. Never got off the ground!!!  So upset for him.  Mailed it back that same day. I am still looking for a good one to replace it.,1.0
"The delivered device uses AA batteries, not a rechargeable lithium ion as described on the website AND on the box itself.

"Got this for my son's birthday and, believe it or not, I can't get the controller's battery compartment open. The screw seems to be jacked in too far and got stripped in the factory.  Even after trying to push it up with another tool while trying to unscrew it doesn't work. So we didn't get to try it out at all.  Fortunately I can still return it.

It sounds great so I'm still ordering the same model again and hoping that it's a good one next time.  Unfortunately my son has to wait a few days for the new one.",1.0
"After charging the helicopter for hours, days, it still would not flyoff the ground! Would not recommend this this helicopter.",1.0
"While the helicopter seemed to be made well with metal parts, it broke in less than a week and my 17 son had used it very little.

"As an experienced RC hobbyist, I bought this brushed  truck to bash around the yard since I own a small fleet of brushless Vaterra, Axial, Carisma, etc. cars. I have never gotten it to work. Out of the box there were problems with the axle and ESC. It actually doesn't even run. This Exceed rig has not even left my garage . Yes, it powers up and I can turn the front axles (steering) using the transmitter---that works. However, the motor and ESC do absolutely nothing when the throttle is squeezed except rapidly flash. There is a electrcal hum and that's about it. This was a bad buy. What's worse is the seller has a non-replacement/return policy which means either you take it to a hobby shop and pay for a repair or eat the cost. Others may say this is a great rig, but in my opinion it's a dud. Save your money and buy something of a higher quality.",1.0
I returned this product before I ever gave it to my grandson. None of the information explained how it should not ever be used inside and the battery should be charged in a fireproof box. In addition there was a disclaimer on the box about the cancer causing substances involved.  These things should be mentioned upfront.  I had to pay over $35 to return this item and I am not happy with that outcome at all.,1.0
"It only ran twice. This is the second RC car off of Amazon - the previous one only ran three times. Like the other one, this one was never driven on anything but asphalt, did not crash it, did not take it over jumps. Worked one day, then didn't work the next. Was running fine when I shut it off. The other one was a Losi, so I changed brands hoping for a better experience. Not the case.",1.0

"Beware, reviews are likely faked!

I have bought 2 of these quads, one for my self and one for my studio, each both broke within the first 2-3 flights.

I am a seasoned quad flyer and own 3 ProtoX, which fly perfectly after hundreds of hard crashes, I own a Blade Nano QX, which also flies perfect after many many many crashes, and I have built my own quad from scratch, so I know quads at this point.

My cousin also bought a Hero Sky Matrix and his was faulty directly out of the box.  The thing spins in place!  Not one of them worked correctly.  I have to think that these things are simply faulty, 3 strikes your out in my book.",1.0
This thing was a waste of my time and money. I ordered this as my first quad copter and it was a complete let down. I charged the batteries fully. Installed fresh batteries into the transmitter and it would turn on but the blades would not spin. No matter how many times I followed the instructions and did everything to the T.  Terrible product.,1.0
"I bought it for my kid and two motors never worked, and NOT possible to repair",1.0
"Ok, this is the 2nd one of these I bought.  Sent the first one back because one prop would never stop spinning.  This one the headlights stopped working in the first 3 minutes of flight. And no, it was not because of a crash. But speaking of crashing, this unit is nowhere near as stable as the Hubsan X4.  Now, you put THAT one in a protective cage like this and you would really have something.  Here, all you have is a cage that protects the flying unit, but the flying unit is not very good to begin with.",1.0
I purchased the Sky Matrix for my godson as a Christmas present. Shortly after Christmas we opened the product and followed the directions.  I tried charging the device several times and it would not fly or crawl walls.  I watched all the Youtube videos that gave directions and still we could not get the Sky Walker H1306 to work properly.  So I decided to send it back and exchange for a new one.  And still no LUCK!!!! Works great on the ground like any other remote control car but it will not fly or crawl walls.  Its a complete waste of time and very frustrating.,1.0

"Read the other negative reviews and believe them (I wish I had).  My cousin bought one, and it shipped without a battery charger.  Even still, it looked compelling enough that I bought one too.  Mine ran for about 45 seconds before one of the props stuck in the 'on' position 100% of the time (I'm not the first to report this behavior).  So I gave my battery charger to my cousin, and his ran for the better part of a day and a half before it too broke.... buyer beware.",1.0

I just got done with my first run with the mad torque and the design on the truck is great but the assembly of mine was very poor I had bolts the were not torqued and have lost the on the ride the hub bolt/pin backed out and is lost along with an axle nut so I went through the truck when I got home and apparently there were a lot more bolts loose so I advise before the first run to go through the truck closely and see if there are any loose bolts and if anyone knows where I can get a bolt and but set at I would appreciate it greatly thanks,1.0

"I give it 1 star only because it came ahead f schedule, other than that, how anybody else who knows anything about the rc world can give this thing more than maybe 2 stars is beyond me. Were do I start, lets see, got it May 29, ran it around for a bit and I was surprised low level crawler was doing really good. Took to crawl some rocks and dirt the next day, not even 24 hours out of the box and for some reason it started out good but after 10 minutes its not climbing anything very well, must be the battery, its dead. Charge it up, lets go again, oh wait, same thing, hmmmm, what could it be, oh wow look at that, the rear axle is pushing but front axle is just spinning. Ok so lets pick it up and test something, with the rear wheels on the ground it wants to push like its crawling, put the front down and pick up the back with the front tires on the ground and the driveshaft just spins and tires don't even feel like they want to move. Well to make this story shorter, rear axle started doing the same thing few hours later, so lets see if we can figure what happened, let me notify the seller also and see if maybe something is wrong with mine sine this has a 4 1/2 start review. Well I figured it out and the locker inside the front and rear axles is garbage, its not even a good locker, its cheap plastic, so I start looking for parts. Mind you I sent the seller a email about my problem so, now back to the parts thing, there are some but not much, most of the main stuff like the main gear they don't have, its out of stock like everywhere and don't worry the upgraded one is out of stock also. So now I don't know what to do, I have a crawler that doesnt crawl and also its beyond slow, maybe three to four mph. Next day, finally seller emails me back and informs me of a website, Nitrorcx.com and they have every part for this truck. Well since I was already at that site I knew that was wrong, I emailed them back and the basically told me I can return it and get my money back or get a new one but thats it, no more returns. So basically they are telling  me if I return it for a new one Iam screwed if something is wrong with that one also. I don't know what to do cause this was for my son who saved and worked is butt off for 2 months. This truck need modifications to be a decent truck, not good, decent. I don't think the regular person who doesnt know rc should get this truck cause as we all know you get what you pay for, as far as the seller, rude and unknowledgeable, if your going to sell something at least know the product before you ship me off to someone else. If I could take away a 1/2 star I would.",1.0
"The product is horribly engineered. I bought this for my son and had nothing but issues. This is advertised as a crawler that can conquer more difficult terrain. The 4 wheel drive option is useless as the grub screws will come loose disengaging the the front or rear drive shafts. In my case both. Once contacting customer support and describing the issue, their response is ""the grub screws are metal and shouldn't come loose"" that response is true when engineered properly. Contrarly they aren't and did indeed come loose. They finally send me another car, after a few uses the arm controller steering (which is plastic) breaks rendering another car useless. They refuse to refund. I would not recommend this.

The use was on grass and a dirt track.",1.0

"Not what I expected in typical plushes. There is too much stuffing for it to bend without probably ripping at the seams. It cannot stand on its own either, which makes this plush rather difficult to enjoy. The Lapras was tightly packed into the package, which caused its head to bend at an awkward angle. Mine also had a green mark above one of its eyes, which ruined the appearance. Within 2 minutes of opening the package, I quickly sealed it away again for return. I then ordered Banpresto's Lapras plush, which looks more realistic and may be free-standing. I have not received it yet, so I may provide an update when I do.

Update: The Banpresto Lapras plush arrived, and it looks amazing! It came in a large package so it was not crumpled. It also is free-standing. The details are just amazing! Plus, it came with the tag, so I'm sure it's real. Banpresto's Lapras plush is a must-have!",1.0

"I would advise that you do not buy these figurines.  Although I have never purchased this product myself, the proof that they are fake lies in other reviews, the images, and pricing.  The first image you see of the product when you make a search is legitimate, showing the actual figures and colors.  However, the next two photos are far less detailed in the painting of the figures and there are many problems with the colors themselves.  Also, a tip for collectors and other Vocaloid fans: When buying figurines like these, they will cost, at the very least, 10 dollars *each*.  The ones that can go 100 dollars and beyond look the same as these, but they come in bigger packaging, and you may swap out faces, hair, etc.  The ones displayed in this first picture are most likely small, single figures that come with stands, and are usually sold separately.  Therefore, a 10 piece set for less than 20 dollars is an obvious bootleg.  Unless you would like to buy these bootlegs intentionally, please do not purchase these if you are concerned about the quality of the product.",1.0

I swear I should have payed more attention to the photo. I thought they would look like they would in the picture but I was wrong. I got them today and I was excited but then I saw them and they were horrible. The paint job on them was done horribly. I don't suggest you buy this.,1.0

"I received this gift as a present, but I had looked them up online before asking for it.  Like everybody else, we thought these were genuine.
The painting is horrible, they are VERY fragile, and were just a very serious let-down.  As I said before, the painting was absolutely horrid; whoever painted these did not use the right shades (Luku's hair is almost white, Rin and Len's hair is just an ugly shade of yellow, and my Meiko had BLONDE HAIR!), and painting over details (Rin's barrettes, Miku's tie clips, keychains, etc.).  When they painted their clothes, they painted over the skin too, which looks really bad.

Their stands were extremely fragile, and I almost broke them trying to put them together!  The bottom of the stands were bent, so the figurines wobble around all the time.

Even though these figurines are obviously cheap imitations, they still get the point across that you're a Vocaloid fan, and that's good enough for me.",1.0
These petite nendoroids were let's just say... horrifiying. I'm a 14 year old otaku collector and this is really disappointing. First of all the paint job is sloppy. I cannot see any effort put into these. Just as a previous review said Lukas hair was LAVENDER. Also the second Meiko had blonde hair instead of brown. They even painted over Rins hair clips! Completely effortlessly made nendoroid petites! Please do not make a mistake like I did and buy these.,1.0
"I got these in the mail and only recieved one of the boxes, which was slightly torn. I opened it up, and found that I had only gotten Miku, Rin, Len Kaito and Meiko.

"Okay, first of all this was my first ever buy. It was also probably the worst. So my set came with the two Hatsune Mikus, MEIKO, MEIKO Sakine, Luka Megurine, Len Kagamine, KAITO, Rin Kagamine, Haku Yowane, and Neru Akita.

Miku Hatsune (The one holding the flower)- She has dark blue hair instead of the turquoise the real Miku's hair should be, her whole figure is completely rough though. The flower has no detail, her hands are sloppily panted, the underside of her head isn't even painted. Her skirt is horribly painted, and for her socks/shoes the paint isn't even in the lines. Her eye's also do not have the white around them that they should.

Miku (The one holding the leeks)- This was probably one of the best ones of the whole one. The leeks we're painted fairly nice, her hair was still a darker color then it should've been, and her eyes definitely are better then the first Miku. The blue triangles around her collar aren't colored, they are gray, the blue that's supposed too outline her socks/shoes, arm sleeves, and shirt aren't there either. The black clips on her tie are painted over as if they weren't there, her headphones are purple (seriously?) as well. The tan from her hands is also on the arm sleeves, not good.

MEIKO- WOW, okay just WOW. So MEIKO's hair is yellow, what even is this? I can say this makes me very upset. The black rim surrounding her eyes isn't there, and on her right eye the black line (for her wink) isn't there. Her face also is damaged. Her belt's silver does outside the lines, it's on her skin and on her red skirt. The red from her shirt also does on the silver and on her skirt- but that's fine since the skirt and shirt are the same color. The brown on her shoes is just awful as well.

MEIKO Sakine (The one from Project Diva, the one with more detail)- Next to the second Miku I feel this is one of the better ones. Her headphone detail isn't there, it's just all black! Even worse that her brown hair color is also mixed with the black on the headphones. Didn't we learn too color inside the lines in kindergarten? Her gloves don't go onto her hands, they stop about near her wrist. No detail on the gloves. Her right eyebrow is covered in pink paint, her eye also has flecks of pink paint on it as well. Her shirt and skirt are lacking the proper detail. Her belt also is not colored inside the lines. The buckle/lace/i cant even tell with the paint job is colored the same as her boot.

Luka Megurine- As mentioned in one of the earlier reviews her hair is more of a lavender then the pink it should be. The paint from her hair also covers the headphones, and the gold on her headphones are on her hair also. The gold paint was sloppily applied, and the X's on her headphones (the headband portion) are painted over in the gold. Her eye color is wrong as well. Her microphone is painted over in lavender as well, you can barely tell it is a microphone. Her arms are painted in black instead of having the detail of the sleeves, only her hand on her left arm is painted tan and her right arm as far as it's visible is decent. Instead of painting the inside of her skirt black it's painted gold also. The boots are horrible, the skirt is horrible, the detail is horrible, the colors are horrible.

Len Kagamine- It hurts too see what horrible detail my favorite Vocaloid has. His hair isn't detailed like the real model, it's all painted the same yellow, not even a nice shade of yellow either. The microphone is colored as if it's attatched too his hair, along with the headphones. On the headphone detail instead of having yellow marks they are black. The under portion of his sailor uniform-in between the black parts-is all painted white and his neck and skin isn't visible, probably painted all white. There is no yellow stripe on the collar. Also on the back part of it he is damaged. His tie is more of an orange, and the belt strap, shoes, and rim of his pants are a slime green. No detail on the belt strap. No detail on the arm sleeves nor leg sleeves. His shoes are also painted black. No detail on the sleeves attached to his shirt, it's all white.

KAITO- The color isn't all that off on this one, but mostly the detail. His scarf is discolored however, and his headphones are painted blue. No scratch that, his microphone and headphones are painted the same blue as his hair, as if not there. There is the yellow on the sleeves of his coat though. But the part of the sleeve near his wrist isn't detailed. Also white paint is on his fingers. Not staying inside the lines, discolored, and parts not even painted on the coat. His shoes are also the same dark brown as his pants. The inside of his coat is also all painted blue.

Rin Kagamine- Oi... my heart just broke further. </3. Rin is just horribly done. Her hair clips are painted the same yellow as her hair, her microphone and headphones have the same problem as Len's and the shirt part in between her collar is all painted yellow up too her head. Her ribbon is damaged and the part where you should be able too take off her head is open, you can see the inside of her. Her body is wobbly as if you could snap it off from the body. Her arm sleeves don't have detail, the ""02"" ""ACT2"" on her arm is not there, her belt and ribbon is orange. Her belt strap is painted over in black. Her shoes and leg sleeves have the same problem as Len's. Her head ribbon is discolored, the ribbon on her chest isn't painted in some parts.

Haku Yowane- Her arm sleeves are painted half tan half black, no detail. Her ribbon and headphones are all a plain black, also no detail. Her eyebrows are not colored. Her belt is colored over in black. No detail on her pants, the only thing visible on her lower half is a little mark of white where her shoes are supposed too be. Her shoes are black on the bottom. The tie is purple, but it's not in the lines so it's on her shirt and stomach.

Neru Akita- Her eyebrows are more of an orange while her hair is the same gross yellow as Rin and Len's. Her tie is half slime green half yellow. The black clips on her tie ARE visible. Her arm sleeves no detail. Yay, on her arm it says ""DEN2"" in clear visible letters, but in black. Her hair tie is completely blue and covered a little bit in yellow. Under her arm's her shirt is painted yellow. In the area where her stomach should be exposed it's painted yellow. No detail on her shirt besides the border on the bottom that's yellow. Her skirt is completely yellow, no detail. The whole underside of her skirt is tan. Her legs are also devoid of detail. Her eye's are discolored and her phone has 0 detail. Her stand was also broken.

Don't buy these items unless you want garbage, it is not a good buy unless you repaint it yourself. This is a horrible bootleg, they also came wrapped in plastic. Woop de doo. Don't buy them, there is a chance yours may differ from mine, but also a chance like mentioned by somebody else you may receive two of the same thing. DON'T BUY DON'T BUY DON'T BUY!",1.0
When I received this order I found that I had two Rins instead of having a Len and then they expect me to pay for shipping to return this item when this was their mistake in the first place!!! Because of their mistake I am now stuck with an incomplete Vocaloid set! Besides from that the box was in terrible condition when I received it and some of the Vocaloid characters are terribly painted to where it looks like they are faded such as Luka's hair which is more of a lavender than a bright pink and Miko's hair was blonde instead of brown. Horrible customer service and horrible item; I will never buy from this company ever again and I recommend everyone to do the same.,1.0

"Horrible car in general, differentials don't last longer than a couple weeks, it does indeed slide until it breaks, I keep good care of mine and it's just not working for me, and I'm not new to this, just gave it a try. Not worth the price, wish I could get a refund.",1.0

"My son saved up for this helicopter, ordered it with his own money, and it was a total dud.  Right out of the package, it just spun in circles on the ground and never lifted off.  Not only that, the missiles fired about 1/4 the distance they were supposed to.  To top it off, we tried to read the instructions to try and problem solve, but they were in such broken English (like ""press VS frequency to mean VS success, otherwise no work how you want to""), that we couldn't even understand what they were saying.  SUPER disappointed - don't buy.",1.0
"I bought this thinking it would be good because I had already bought another R/C helicopter but when it arrived it DID NOT FLY!

"We were told this is a ""beginner"" car but it is not.  You need to buy fuel($30.00) and also the glow plug charger($20.00) and even after all of this the car wouldn't start.

If you read the instructions given you will realize this car is alot more work and upkeep than a normal 13 year old would like to do. Returning it and will just buy an electric one.",1.0
"I have had problems with this car this the day I received it, It would not stay running during the break in period, assumed this was natural, now I can not get it to start for nothing. My boy who received this for his birthday is very upset this thing will not start. He has had now for 3 weeks. Tired of jacking with it.",1.0
We received the car with really poor directions (like they don't even tell you how to start it).  I found out we had to go to the store to buy a glow plug but no idea how to use it when we did buy it.  I contacted the seller and the manufacturer for better directions and received no response from either.  Then after we had everything we needed the starter cord quickly came off.

"This was the first time I opted to purchase a remote control helicopter online. It arrived in time for my son's birthday but was a HUGE disappointment. The helicopter never got off the ground. The propellers moved alright, but only when it wanted to and as soon as I, my son, my husband AND my older adult child began to navigate via the accompanying controller, the motor just stopped! We tried all combinations of frequencies and joystick movements from slight to hard, but got NOTHING. It was frustrating and my 10 year old was VERY disappointed. This was the only gift he asked for and received from me (Mom), and was thrilled beyond belief when he unwrapped it. The whole process broke my heart to see his thrill dwindle in a matter of seconds. He researched it online and even tried suggested online solutions for a whole week afterwards before giving up. Needless to say, I was disgusted and because of this experience, I refuse to buy electronics from Amazon online anymore. I feel more secure seeing the product and testing in person at a store before I buy any electronics because of this.",1.0
"Somehow when I decided to buy the more expensive version of this game, I expected higher quality and a better experience.

This version that cost $70 including shipping, is a piece of junk.  I looked at the $15 version over the weekend at a local store, and it is of much higher quality.  This version is cheaply made and the pieces and pegs do not stay in the holes.  What fun!

Certainly the last time I will buy this type of item on Amazon.",1.0
The quality just isn't there.  The ships are hard to put in and take out while the hit or miss designators fall out all of the time.  A great game frustrated by poor quality!  For what they charge for the game the quality is extremely poor.,1.0
"My son and I enjoy playing Battleship - it's a great game. But I have to give this edition one star, for its fatal flaw: the pegs fall out of the holes very easily. This is mildly inconvenient if you want to suspend your game and resume later, because if you try to fold up the game board, you'll lose your pieces. But the pieces are so loose, they can fall out if someone just bumps into the table. One false move and you lose the whole game. I guess this is true of lots of games, like chess, but Battleship, with those pegs in a vertical surface, is a special case. There's no excuse for making pieces that are the wrong size.",1.0
I order and spent the money for this classic battleship so that my husband would play happily with my son.  We already have the new battleship which is cheaply made and is readily available at Target for $15.  I spent $25 plus $10 shipping to get the classic version pictured.  Well it came today and it was the new cheap version.  I did not order this so I called the number for the company listed above.  Strange that they don't take phone calls only emails.  I will not pay for the Classic Battleship that I didn't receive.  If Amazon can't work it out I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company and already talked to them about it.  Anyway don't order this!!!,1.0
"Before I begin to rant-get one thing straight. I LOVE BOARD GAMES!!! So you can imagine how bad this is, if someone like me, who owns at least 200 board games, despises it.

Amazon sent me a second unit and it was exactly like the first one they shipped me. On the second unit, I even went to the trouble of taking the screw out of the batter compartment cover and checking the battery. The battery was good. However, Amazon only offered a refund on the second one instead of sending me a working unit. This is what my granddaughter wanted for her birthday so Amazon deserves one star as well.",1.0

"We love this game and have played our first one so many times that the popper is really hard to pop. When I went to the local store a few months back to buy another, I saw that they had changed the board so that the players' pegs didn't have plastic 'cups' to hold the pegs around the board anymore. Kiddos wanted the 'old' version so I found it here and ordered it. It arrived on time and the game board is the older version, which is great. What is NOT GREAT is that it is supposed to have 4 games pieces each in 4 different colors: red, yellow, blue and green. However, my game came with only 3 yellow pieces instead of 4. The bag of pieces was sealed.
Don't want the hassle of having to ship it back and wait for another one to come, especially since there is no guarantee the new one won't also have missing game pieces.

This is one of the cheapest games I've seen it my life. First off, there was no shrink wrap; the box was just taped shut on both sides, like I was buying a used game from a garage sale. Secondly, you have to assemble the game board. There's the top, hard plastic part, and there's a cardboard (just thin, weak, flimsy cardboard) you attach to the bottom using 4 rubber feet. There is no protection for the bottom layer of cardboard... the bottom of the game board is literally just a piece of cheap cardboard. I can't stress how unprofessional this looks and feels.",1.0

Needed MIND TRAP II,1.0
"Seriously?  I remember seeing Mindtrap in stores when I was younger, and always wanting to get it because of the cool art.  I bought this game at a garage sale for a few bucks, and thank goodness I did.  The questions on these cards fall into one of three categories: so easy it's silly, so ridiculous that there's no way you could get the single right answer that is printed on the back of the card, or silly math involving oddball fractional answers.  I guess if you were to play this game alone, it might make for a few good logic questions, but otherwise, it's no fun whatsoever.",1.0
"This game is slow, boring, and sloppily made.  The cards are full of mistakes and typos, hardly educational!  There are no tokens or playing boards.  It's ""roll the dice and cross out the squares"" - no bonus rounds, timers, buzzers, chance cards, traps...so it's quite dull.  ""Fun"" is the last word I would ever use to describe it.  The answers, as another reviewer pointed out, are either obvious and easy or just plain ridiculous.  Two thumbs down!",1.0
"This gets one star because my kids really do love to play with it. It's a fun toy. The reason it ONLY gets one star is because the play coins get stuck behind and under the opening cash drawer. And it's impossible to get them out. I've tried shaking it. I've tried holding it upside down. I've even tried hitting it and banging it up against things. (I suppose that means it's really quite durable as well LOL) But, I can't get the coins out of the bottom. I was going to take it apart, but the screws holding the bottom together are so deep down I would need to buy a special, long, skinny, Phillips screwdriver.

Then, once the coins were gone my kids were done playing with it. I'm unwilling to replace the fake money or let them play with real coins because I can't get them back.

Fun toy but major design fail.",1.0

Very cheaply made and the cover for the code was broken when we received it.

"Do not buy this new version. Extremely cheap construction especially compared to the original ""Retro"" version.

"I got this out of nostalgia for my kids, since I used to play it when I was a kid. The quality is just about as cheap as it gets for a plastic toy. The pieces don't even fit into the side container (there are too many to fit -  so I don't know if they are expecting you to lose a bunch of pieces, or what you are supposed to do with the extra pieces until that happens), and the small pegs jam up the hinges, and they spill easily.
I get that it's an inexpensive toy, probably costs them $0.50 to make in China, but I'd rather pay double to get something reasonable quality. Maybe most people wouldn't and that's why they went this route?
If you get this, don't have high expectations.",1.0
"I spent $38 for this game of Trouble.  Although the packaging was fine and it wasn't damaged, I was under the impression that I was receiving a quality product for the amount of money I spent.  Wrong!  The bottom was a piece of cardboard the thickness of a piece of paper and it wasn't even attached to it.  The plastic of the game board was so cheap and flimsy...it was terrible.  I am not sure that I would have spent $5 on it.  It is misleading to cost $38 when the product is not even close to the quality of the game I played when i was a kid.  Unfortunately, it is being returned.  I will try to find it elsewhere.  I do NOT recommend purchasing this item.",1.0
"I bought the 'newer"" Trouble and was disgusted by how flimsy and cheaply it was made -- nothing like the one I had as a kid, which is the one pictured in this product ad.  This one claimed to be the ""classic"" Trouble and was $20 more, so I bought it, thinking it was what it said it was.  However, it is false advertising.  I received the same crappy, flimsy, cheap new Trouble board game, where there is a piece of paper that goes over the plastic board peg holders.  When you push the number bubble, all the pieces come flying off the board because it is THAT FLIMSY.  So you are constantly fixing the pieces and trying to remember where you are in the game.  I am returning it immediately.  It is FALSELY ADVERTISED.  It is NOT WHAT IS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED.",1.0
"The picture shown is not the game that we received.  I ordered the older Trouble game that Milton Bradley made before selling to Hasbro's China branch.  The new game style is very cheap.

There was also another game listed by them for $39.99 I thought they would send it to me for the same price since it was their mistake, but no they won't and It is not worth $40.

"The compartment meant to hold the pieces is too small to close when all the pieces are inside, and there is no way to keep the two different size pegs separate, so it takes forever to sift through the parts to get ready to play.

Get the version ALSO SOLD BY AMAZON with 5spots and separate compartments for the pieces.",1.0
"Why am I giving a 1-star rating to one of my favorite games? Because this edition sucks, that's why.

This edition is objectively poorly designed. Did nobody play test this? Did an intern design this for their summer project? Who knows?

So, to run down the complaints:

1. Poor choice of colors. For some reason, the designers felt that the board and the peg covers needed to be bold, primary colors--meaning they couldn't use two of the most easily identifiable colors in the code pegs. This means you get pegs in pink and teal/green? And that the hint pegs are now changed from black and white to RED and white. What was wrong with a black/gray/brown game board? Nothing. Someone thought--incorrectly--that trendy/different colors would be refreshing and somehow hold the attention of attention-deficient players. It's just harder to use.

2. Poor build quality. I'm not the only reviewer here who's mentioned this. It's seriously the most poorly designed edition of any game I've bought. And that's really saying something, since the original was nothing stellar, but nothing to complain about, either. It's cheap plastic, and everything's rounded, making it hard to hold while traveling, suitable only for tabletop use. The hidden code cover is poorly made, the hinges not secured enough to keep the cover attached to the game. I'm not talking abuse, either--just regular moving the cover up and down, and it'll come off. This isn't a fluke, this is how it was designed. The peg storage cover stays put, but the storage compartments a) aren't completely separated, so the pegs will mix, and b) the code peg compartment isn't nearly big enough to hold all the code pegs! To store all the code pegs with the game, you have to put some of them in the hint pegs compartment, mixing the two types and eliminating the advantage of having two compartments in the first place. The hint pegs do sometimes slide too far down into the hole, reflecting inconsistent build quality, but I did experience that in the original, as well. The code pegs or their holes have been changed enough to make them very difficult to handle and hold in place. A domed top was never the best design (hard to grasp), but in the original they were easier to grasp, for some reason.

Do yourself a favor and buy an original/used one on eBay. This is just an embarrassment.",1.0
"Paid a premium for the original game, the one that kids can actually play without breaking instantly. I received the new model from pop o matic... the same one I can get from walmart for 5$, it is a piece of loose leaf paper that goes over thin cardboard that has the pop thing in it.. just horrible build quality....and will not last more then a couple games once my nephew gets his hands on it.

. I see a lot of people saying the same thing... The seller in this case was School Specialty, they need to have there items removed from this listing. I paid more for the item in the picture, because IMO its a better product. I was then shipped alternative version.... Plain and simple bait and switch.",1.0

"The version pictured is the ""old version"".  The one that was sent to us was the ""new version"" that's available everywhere for 1/2 of what was charged - around $10 at Wal-Mart.  We wanted the old one.  This one's going back.",1.0
"The version received can be found in Walmart right now for about $7.77. Even without a discounted price, the game is only about $10.00. I paid the almost $17.00 in hopes of receiving the actual one and got this off-brand version instead. At least that's what I call it. If this version is supposed to be an upgrade from the original, I must not know what upgrade really means. This ones is cheaply made and not nearly as nice or as decorative as the original. I am very disappointed, especially since they had the audacity to keep the original picture of the board game up. Also for an extra note, when I purchased this I do not recall the other pictures that I see now visible when I first found this seller. Makes me wonder, because this version of Trouble is not worth $17 or so. It doesn't even sell for that much at Toys R Us without a discount. Highly disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone that has played the original version of Trouble. You will not be pleased.",1.0
"I live outside of the US and recently returned for a few days.  Prior to my arrival I ordered a few things, one of which was this game.  I thought I could share some of my past fun memories with my girlfriend.  When I recieved this game I was very disappointed.  It is the cheapest thing I have ever seen.  A complete waste of money.  I have nothing against the game itself, it is just that the quality SUCKS!!!",1.0

Was missing pieces:(,1.0
"I have been playing as a child similar games and I knew they would be useful and educational for my kids.
However, even if I have read other reviews that were complaining about the poor quality of this product, I didn't believe it could be that bad. Well, it is BAD. So bad that my opinion is: the product is barely usable.",1.0
"I was shocked to see the colored backing falls off as there is not a back/bottom plastic piece to this game to hold it in place.  Now I will need to tape it which is ridiculous.

My popper does work and doesn't seem to need to be pushed too hard like other reviewers have stated, but this overall board game is POOR POOR quality.  Mine didn't even arrive in shrink wrap so how do I know this is new??

I have never written a review on Amazon before but I was so disgusted by the quality I wanted to let others know..AVOID.",1.0
Love this game but ours DID NOT ship with the indicator pins. It was over the Christmas break and we wanted to play so instead we used colored toothpicks we had on hand. Had a blast but that was in spite of the missing pegs. So come on.... really... Their QC is pretty bad to not have them. How could that be missed?,1.0
"My daughter had played Trouble at a friends house and begged for it for Christmas.  I remember playing this game when I was a kid and loved it.  ""Santa"" gave it to her and my husband and I were both very let down at the quality of the game.  The bottom is merely cardboard that falls out constantly.  We kept looking around for a hard plastic bottom surface to click into place and then realized that there was none.  When buying online it's not always easy to tell the quality of an item, and this is one problem with ordering from Amazon.  With items less than $15-or $20 it's not worth returning because of shipping costs.  We are simply out of luck with this purchase and it's wasted money.  Unless Hasbro would be willing to send a better version of the game as a replacement....",1.0

"It wasas broken,  My grandson was very upset and so were we... not going to purchase from this buyer again",1.0
Very cheap construction difficult to understand the instructions and just not worth the money,1.0

"HASBRO  sucks,.... there is no plastic back the bottom is only a thin cardboard with four white rubber pegs to hold it in place.....  CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP  board games are NOT made with quality anymore!",1.0
"This game is similar to Sorry, but without many of the neat dimensions. Almost no strategy is involved, very little thinking. Basically ""turn the crank"" (roll the single die) and move forward. Except for the youngest of game players, this game has little value. Skip this and move straight to to Sorry, which requires more thinking. Also, the fit and finish of trouble is disappointing...a cheap plastic game....",1.0
the design for peg storage isn't good. markers and pegs easily mix together.,1.0
"We received this as a gift and I'm appalled at the price for a rattle. My son is 6 months old and hardly ever plays with it. He may when he gets older. It's a great idea, very durable and all. But I just don't think it's worth $10. Perhaps $3 or 4. I'm glad we didn't buy it!",1.0
Didn't come with the right colored pegs. Only two yellow pegs! So now we now have a game that only has 5 colors to make a code. Disappointing!,1.0
great game just a bit cheap plastic not too comfortable to store the little pins which can get lost very fast,1.0
"It just a big machine and just few things inside, the coins and dollars are not enough to play.",1.0
"A great game for children and adults alike. Unfortunately the pieces and board are so cheaply made that play is difficult with poorly fitting pieces you need to jam into irregular holes. I played a ""Danish"" Mastermind my friend brought home from Denmark last summer and was pleased to see that some countries still get good quality versions of Mastermind.",1.0
"They sure don't make this like they used to. I played this game as a kid and remember it being much more sturdy , with a hard plastic bottom, and the popper not as flimsy.  My son recieved this game as a christmas present, and most of the time the popper won't even pop the dice, and the game board it self is very flimsy. It doesn't even come in a hard sided box, just a thinly constructed jacket. Needless to say I'm very dissappointed in the quality.",1.0
"The box was smashed, the popper hardly pops and is totally cheap--in order to get it to pop you practically have to use a sledge-hammer. Certainly my very strong four year old son cannot push the popper down--when one can actually get it to pop, the tactile experience is extrememely unsatisfying and the noise is not pleasant either--more like a 'bang' than a pop. Thoroughly unsatisfying. I would rather pay a few more dollars and get a game that is decently made and comes in a real box that could actually store the toy.",1.0
"As others have indicated; Great classic game, but the game board is total junk.

Great game. Kid's love it as well as adults. This version (made by Pressman Toys) is extremely poorly designed and cheaply made. Several design flaws:  Peg storage flap is not large enough for all the pegs, the divider between the small and large pegs is COMPLETELY ineffective in keeping the pegs from mixing, and the code hiding flap falls down VERY easily and makes inserting pegs difficult. There are also not enough scoring pegs to score a full run game. Do not buy this version! Look for another option.",1.0
"After I put this colorful toy on his Gymini gym, I found that he had managed to get his arm caught in the toy at the elbow and could not get loose due to the shape of the toy.  I would not recommend this toy for any child due to safety reasons.",1.0
Ruined by awful board!!  Bins do not keep the pins separate.  Full grown adult fingers are too big to use it easily.  And the colors are horrid.  what was so wrong with black plastic pins?  By the classic version!!,1.0
"This deserves 0 stars.  The box states it's contents as follows : game console with built in storage tray and code peg shield (got it),  108 code pegs in 6 colors ( I got  20),  30 key pegs in two colors (I got 0), complete instructions (I got none) see attached picture,  that is all I got in my box.",1.0
"The board size is needlessly too large.  Despite the large size, the build in storage for the pegs is too small and poorly designed.  It lacks a storage box or bag making it messy.  Does not stack among our other games.  The packaging is quite large suggesting there may have been a storage container hidden inside, but no such luck.  Regret this purchase.",1.0
"The game itself is as wonderful as ever.  The design of this particular edition, however, is terrible.  The container for the pieces is completely useless.  It does not hold all of them.  You cannot close the door on it it even if you under-fill it, because pieces get jammed inside it.  The tiny pegs get mixed up with the large ones (and there aren't enough of the tiny pegs for a whole game, anyway!).  The large pegs don't sit firmly in their holes and they are easily dislodged.  The tiny pegs slide down too far into their holes and get stuck.  Simply ridiculous.  We're going to seek out the old version in ebay.",1.0
Total garbage. Cheap plastic. Pegs don't fit. Wanted to share a happy childhood memory with my kid. Great game concept. Garbage construction. Returning and buying 1972 version on eBay.,1.0
very good,1.0
Small pegs completely missing. Small flat bag inside but no pegs! Also the hide panel is loose and the large pegs fall out easy. 1 star is only because the game concept is still awesome! Goes to show that you cannot sacrifice quality for quantity... Bad bad design.,1.0
"Great game.  Cheap, moronic board.  Though that's probably too gentle.

If you're over five feet tall, you'll have trouble getting the pegs into the code maker's code area-- it's something about the position and the way the hinged cover lays.  The storage box is designed so that one set of pegs easily migrates into the key peg area.  Further, the pegs can slip in the gap of the door and prevent it from closing... if it could close...which it can't because it wasn't designed to be big enough to hold all the pegs.  Last, there aren't enough key pegs-- the game is especially skimpy on white key pegs.",1.0
Cheap and not worth it. I actually returned it.,1.0
"The game itself is great but Pressman Toys succeeded turning it into a piece of ugly-looking cheap plastic. The compartment that holds the pins is too small. You have a hard time getting all the pins into the compartment and then closing the lid. The lid itself does not click and shut, no if you turn the thing around all the pins fall out rendering it unfit for travel. So you can use it at home only, but who wants to put such an ugly piece of plastic on the table? There are various kinds of plastic and his is one of the cheapest. The shape of the whole thing is odd too. So, good work, Pressman Toys, you failed in all respects. Selling this piece of junk for 10 bucks is almost outrageous.",1.0
The code cover keeps falling down enabling the code breaker to see the code. This defeats the purpose of the game. The storage area door is flimsy and the compartments do not keep the pegs separated.  We were very disappointed in the quality of this product.  So much so that we decided to return the game.,1.0
I purchased because my nephew was in town and was taking a train ride home.  He was so disinterested in this game that he lft it behind. I've never been so embarrassed.,1.0
"This was a Christmas gift for my niece and when she tried playing it there were 2 cars missing.
This makes the third Christmas gift purchased through Amazon that was either damaged, was missing pieces or already opened.",1.0
I recieved a version for toddlers. Misleading.,1.0
"This is an awesome board game. I loved it as a kid, and my 6yo loves it now. I thought it'd be too sophisticated for him, and his enthusiasm surprised me.

I would not recommend that you purchase this version of it. The original edition from the 70's is much better designed, and more fun to play. You can get it on EBay for about the same price. The new version has fatal flaws that interfere with enjoyment of the game:

- The peg compartment it too small to contain all the pegs. This means that you have to keep the original cardboard box around to hold the extra pegs.
- After the game, you'll often have trouble closing the peg compartment, because pegs have slipped between the lid and board. You have to empty out all the pegs to get the stray peg out.
- Color pegs fit loosely. A small bump to the board will dislodge the pegs.
- The colors are off. I find it much harder to think about Pink, Teal, and Orange, than the original game colors. And red and white pegs for scoring do not have the mental clarity of original black & white.
- Everything about the game feels cheap, they probably shaved their production costs from $3 to $2.25 by using only the cheapest materials available.

Do yourself a favor, and get the original version off Ebay, or a garage sale.

Many toys are built much flimsier than they used to be. I've love playing my vintage editions of Risk & Monopoly. There is just something about holding a nicely designed piece in your hand.",1.0
"Just purchased this manufactured version of the classic game and found it to be terrible!
The pegs the code makers has to enter to give clues to the code breaker are entered on a square pattern of holes!... which bears not resemblance/mapping to the linear arrangement of pegs for the code breaker!  With the absence of this one-to-one mapping of the peg positions, it becomes very difficult for my 6-8 y old! (I suspect this un-natural arrangement of peg holes is to circumvent the original patent! -- Can't see any other reason why!?!).
The colors are off colors (not like the original).
The construction is very light platics (not $13 worth!).
The design of the mask for the code maker is cumbersome, even for small children fingers (I miss the simplicity of a removable mask like the original).

All these negative features negate so much of the pleasure of this game that I'm returning it and will try to find the original!",1.0
bought this as a gift for my 9 yr old granddaughter she used it twice and it hasn't worked since.  Very upset she was so excited to play store and it's been on the back porch in it's box for months now.  not happy.,1.0
"I had Mastermind as a child and loved it.  For our wedding, we registered for this - the new version.

The box is CHEAP - it will fall apart very easily.  It is also way too big for what is included inside.

The plastic board is also cheap, and the wall between the two types of pegs does not keep the pegs from mixing, so you end up picking the different pegs out of the other slot - time consuming!  Plus, the trays are so poorly constructed that it is almost impossible to close the lid without getting pegs stuck so that it can't close.

They should have just used the same construction as the old sets, and they'd have been much better off.",1.0
"I've been playing the Mastermind game as a kid and I liked it a lot. I was excited to offer the same to my children. However, this particular edition turned out to be very poorly made. The plastic is ugly and cheap - doesn't even have consistent color throughout the board. Some of the small pegs are too thick to put them into the holes, some other are loose, most are too hard to pull out for my kids. Colors of the big pegs are dull and are hard to distinguish from one another in ambient light.

Returned to store.",1.0
"Although this game appears fun to the naked eye, that is just a gimmic. This game has no educational value whatsoever! It is a waste of money and useful plastic.",1.0
I purchased the battery operated calculator about 7 years ago and it worked fabulously.  Then I purchased this new solar powered model and it was defective.  It worked poorly from the start; it was hard to use without a direct light and I live in sunny Hawaii.  After a few months the equal sign would not work so you could no longer use it as a calculator.  This company does have an excellent return policy as does Amazon.  I would not purchase this again.,1.0
It's just a big calculator nothing else. I thought it would say the numbers when you punched a number or the scanner tool would beep to pretend to scan and it makes no sound,1.0
"Stratego was introduced in the United States in the early 1960s. Offering strategic elements of chess on a familiar board game motif, it became a very popular game in American households during the 1960s and 70s. By 2000, no doubt caving to constant reports of how stupid American children were becoming, Hasbro changed the numbering system on the pieces, completely inverting the familiar 1-9 scale. Historically, the most powerful piece (Marshall) was marked ""1"" while the least powerful piece (Scout) was marked ""9."" More recent editions contain pieces marked in the opposite manner, with higher ranked (i.e., stronger) pieces displaying higher numbers. This decision was not met with universal applause, and in response (or perhaps it was planned all along to generate multiple streams of revenue?), Hasbro released a ""Vintage"" edition. So if you wish to own the same Stratego game you grew up playing, you are forced to find an older game or else purchase the more expensive Vintage edition. Another pitfall for would-be buyers is that Hasbro recently capitalized on the popular fantasy theme, releasing a version of Stratego which replaces the classic Napoleonic army with medieval themed pieces (i.e., dragon, dwarf, slayer). Confusingly, this version is NOT named Stratego--the D&D Battle or Stratego--the Fire and Ice Edition or any other moniker that might be helpful in distinguishing among them. Note also that this version also reduced the number of pieces from forty to thirty.

To recap, there are three current Hasbro (Milton Bradley) offerings. They are all offered on Amazon (at varying price levels) and I will cross reference the manufacturer's part numbers and also provide the relevant links to the games on Hasbro's Web site, although you cannot purchase directly there.

Hasbro Item #40836
(See Comments section below for link.)

The Vintage edition (confusingly titled ""Nostalgia"" by Amazon) offers the proper (in my opinion!) numbering system, and comes in a keepsake wooden box.

Hasbro Item #04714
(See Comments section below for link.)

The basic Stratego (post-2000) edition offers the proper number of pieces (40) but the inverted ranking system. This last and most important point is not obvious until you scrutinize the Product Details. (""This new, updated version of Stratego is slightly different than the original, though the gameplay is the same."") Plus you need to apply the stickers yourself! Ouch, Hasbro cheaped out.

Hasbro Item #45068
(See Comments section below for link.)

The fantasy-themed version with 30 pieces. Again, Amazon has failed to adequately label the game, simply titling it ""Stratego."" However the Product Features make it clear. (""Choose to lead warriors from an ancient arctic realm or a fierce army from a land of fiery molten lava."")
====================================================

Your best bet? If you simply want the same game you grew up playing, just look for a cardboard boxed set from the 70s or 80s. For example, this version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stratego-The-Classic-Game-of-Battlefield-Strategy-1986-Edition/dp/B0028LEM26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stratego - The Classic Game of Battlefield Strategy 1986 Edition</a>) is the same one I have. I have owned it for many years with no complaints. Finding one for yourself, however, might be trickier than you think. Unless you buy it here from a Amazon Marketplace vendor--which is not recommended, given the ridiculous prices--you are left to your own devices to find it in a used game store or at a garage sale. Alternatively, you can buy one of the currently offered versions. But as I have demonstrated, they are not all the same as one another, and indeed very few are identical to what you may have grown up playing.

P.S. After much further research, I believe either of these two sets (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stratego-Vintage-Wood-Book-Edition/dp/B00285LPMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stratego Vintage Wood Book Edition</a>) or (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Library-Stratego-Game-Set/dp/B000AFDIDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Library Stratego Game Set</a>) are equivalent to the Vintage edition described above, and at least one may be available inexpensively at Target.",1.0

"I purchased this game for my son this Xmas, and was very disappointed that Hasbro has re-numbered,/re-ranked the pieces (the highest ranking player is now a 10 vs. the classic version where the Field Marshall was #1). Hasbro has also cheapened the game by making you put decals on all the pieces.  Very disappointing that they unecessarily have mucked up a great game.",1.0
Really hoping the manufacture can address what's happened. I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and two days later it is broken. She is not hard on her toys and was opening and closing it like instructed. The open button is totally pushed in on one side and it will not open. This was a toy I expected her to have for a long time and basically I'm going to have to throw it away. Very sad about this!,1.0

"As a preschool teacher, I have had one of these in my classroom and have seen one in almost every classroom I have visited.  This year I purchased one for my daughter for Christmas.  I don't know what is different, but this one just seems very cheaply made.  The calculator barely worked right out of the box and I thought that maybe that was due to lack of light on the little solar panel.  For a few months, it limped along, numbers would appear on the screen, but the beeps from the buttons sounded like the thing way dying.  Now, it seems to have completely died, as I cannot get the calculator to work at all.  I'm very disappointed.",1.0
I got used one. Scratches all over. Returning it,1.0

"Basically, the solar powered register never charged for more than a few seconds of use, even when we left it on the windowsill.  As others mention, the drawer does open ridiculously violently (and got stuck at one point) but the reason that I'm returning ours is that it just doesn't work as a cash register because it can't hold a charge.  We are going to order the more expensive battery powered register and hope for the best.",1.0

He was very upset when it stopped working. and to top it off, we couldn't find a place to replace any batteries because it works on solar power like the older calculators do. Disappointed! Would NOT recommend. Especially for the price!",1.0

"When this item arrived it looked like it had been used.  I was skeptical but didn't want to hassle with a return.  I liked the idea that the cash register worked as a calculator, giving my preschoolers an opportunity to interact with numbers and math in a real way during their play.  The digital display is so faint that sometimes you can't even see the numbers on the screen.  The credit card slide beeps when you run the card into it, but it is barely audible.  I was immensely disappointed in these things, but kept the cash register so the students could still open and close the door, pretend, and handle the play money.  Now after just a few months the ""open"" button is no longer working.  This item had awesome reviews and I haven't found any of the key features to be worthwhile.  This wasn't worth the money and I even got it on sale.  I shoul dhave sent it back!",1.0

I contacted Learning Resources directly and let them know the problem we had. I was given a discount and free shipping so I ordered another cash register directly from them.

"So many great reviews.  I wonder if any of the favorable reviews were written by friends or family members of the game's developers?

This card game is muddled and messy during real world application.  Some specific thoughts:

1.  The pile that develops in the center of the table sometimes gets rather big and messy.  Hard to see the previous two cards.  And you need to see what the previous two cards are in order to yell and slap the pile in case there is a thief, a slamwich, or a double decker.

2.  Kids sometimes naturally want to see their card when they are - per the directions - ""tossing"" into the pile.  The ""tossing"" is messy and creates an awkwardness to the game.  The card pile becomes disheveled.  And the pile requires constant caretaking.

3.  The cards have wonderful graphics and appealing design.

4.  The directions DO NOT tell you how many cards to deal out to each player. But the assumption is to deal ALL the cards equally to the players.  And place extra cards in center of the table.  Just lacked clarity.

5.  The directions suggest removing the ""Muncher cards"" to create a faster, easier and more pleasurable game for younger kids.  So why even have the muncher cards?

6.  How did this card game get so many wonderful reviews?

Card games and other games that I DO like:  Connect 4,  Don't break the Ice,  Rush Hour,  UNO,  Yahtzee,  Chess,  Blink, Guess Who, among other games.

Pass on this game.",1.0
"I bought this game because the box looked cute and it had won two awards.  What a waste of money it was!  It is essentially a game of war - you scream and slam your hand on top of the pile if the cards happen to be flipped over in a certain combination (two of the same next to each other (""a double decker"") or two of the same cards on either side of a different card (""a slamwich"").  There is absolutely no educational value to this game, it's just a game that will have your kids yelling and arguing about who won a particular slam.",1.0
"Cards are not colored, making it difficult to pair when playing.",1.0
"I was really excited to get this cash register for my kids for Christmas (ages 3 and 4), especially with all the great reviews.  But I am really disappointed in the product I received.  Because it is only solar-powered, it barely works.  The only way we can get the solar-powered part to work is by shining a flashlight directly on the panel.  Without that, the calculator will not work at all.  We tried putting it directly under our lights, and I've turned an extra lamp on directly over the cash register, but we can still barely see the numbers.  My 4-year-old has been so diappointed that she can't get the buttons to work.  She was also upset that the credit card doesn't beep when it swipes, and even when we shine a light on the solar-powered panel to get the numbers to show, the buttons make no sound.  Aren't they supposed to make a sound?  As much as I don't want to deal with having to send something back to Amazon, I'm afraid I'll have to return this toy.  I've been trying to find the good in it, but all-in-all, it has been nothing but a disappointment.",1.0
My three year old received this for Christmas. Finally put the batteries in and voila...NOTHING. IT SAYS CB and I looked in the manual. The cash box is closed and its not registering so now he cant even interact with the toy. Im really pissed off that I received a defective item. Just my freakin luck,1.0
We received our version of chutes and ladders today. It was shrink wrapped without a lid. This is all we got. (See picture.) What the heck?,1.0
"I would give it less if it was possible. Bought this for my son for Christmas and the ""solar power"" is a joke! It doesn't work! If you hold it in the window sill tipped to the sun it will work but otherwise it's useless! My son likes the drawer and pretending to be a grocery store so he won't let me return it but I'm really unhappy the adding function doesn't work. Basically it's just a place to put the pretend money. Thank goodness the drawer at least opens and closes or it would be in the trash. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",1.0
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY

This toy broke within 5 minutes of coming out of the box. The sounds no longer work (first thing that stopped working) then the visual stopped working too (about 15 minutes later)

Tried swapping out the battery, no kuck...

Typical cheap Chinese junk that gets peddled to Americans. I sure am tired of garbage like this being sold on amazon...",1.0

Game is just too difficult.,1.0
"The  game was  in  worse  condition  than  described  by  seller,  the game  pieces  were  falling  apart  as well as  the  box.  The  game  itself  was  easy  enough  for  my  5  year to  understand  but  its  hard  to  figure  out  where  the chutes  and ladders  begin  and  end.",1.0
"We purchased this toy twice. The first one never worked, right out of the box. The second one worked for a short time and then stopped- even with brand new batteries. I don't know if there is a better option out there, but I'd keep looking. Junk.",1.0

the new characters look creepy,1.0
"Cheaply Made!!
I could not believe how cheaply made this game is.  I had it as a child and it is so different.  Even the graphics on the board are difficult to read.  The spinner and the players are cheap card board.  Not worth the money.",1.0
"The board is so flimsy that if (or I should say ""when"") it gets bumped, the pieces move around and it's difficult to remember where they were.  The pieces are too large for the squares they sit on, and the graphics are confusing.  I did not enjoy playing with the kids at all.  Maybe the ""classic"" game offered here on Amazon is better.",1.0
"I loved this games as a kid, but the current version is horrible.

There are 100 squares on the board and you have to go back and forth across and up it. Since it is laid out like a checker board and the pieces are the same width as the squares it's very easy to get off or move the wrong direction (especially when kids are playing).  The board is so crowded that it is difficult to tell exactly where things begin or end.

To top it off, the spinner has started coming apart, and we have only tried to play 3 times.

Don't waste your money. It's more activating than fun.",1.0
Chutes and Ladders is an awesome game. A childhood classic that our toddler's grandparents even played. My issue with this version is nothing more than the quality of the board. The game is meant for 3 year olds. The board ripped after the first use while folding it to put back in the box. I would rather pay more and have a quality board. We ended up playing my in-laws 30 year old version instead.,1.0
"Horrendously cramped board, don't buy this version. Simply put the board is too compacted together and not the simple chutes and ladders you remember as a kid. Avoid.",1.0
"The pieces are bigger than the spaces. Don't waist your money on this newer version, spend a few extra dollars and buy the original!",1.0

"This game seemed like it was gonna satisfy my gaming need but it left me high and dry and back on the Xbox for another round of Zombies. The kids don't like it, my wife hates it and I really think you'd be better off with a deck of cards.",1.0
Remember the old Candy Land from your childhood? Well this isn't it! It has no cards and the board is completely different. Did not have fun was not what I expected.,1.0
The register stopped working after my grandson used it only 2 times. I need to call the company and let them know about this.  It was nice when it worked,1.0
It was a winner with the kids but it created such chaos that the adults were not able to play with them,1.0
"Terrible ""new"" design.  Just stinks. My version has alternating green hues forbthe square colors. Kids can barely tell the difference from each swuare. The pieces are too big and the squares too small. Add in a low quality spinner and you are in for a bit of aggravation. Not sure why this thing is nothing like the one made 30 yrs ago.",1.0
"This is a terrible remake of a classic game.  The board is much smaller and the chutes and ladders graphics are so oversized that they cover the individual squares. The pieces are so big compared to the smaller squares that they are easily accidentally moved to another square, and you easily lose your place.

The graphics are so awful that this game was actually WORK to play.  This was one of my favorite games as a kid, and the new one is so poorly designed as to be unusable.  Fans of this game, don't waste your money!",1.0
Cheap quality,1.0
"They destroyed this sweet (ha, see what I did there) game -- why do the princess and the fairy now look sexy?  Where are the nice, non-sexualized images from the old board?  Please bring it back.  I'm returning mine and hunting for a classic on ebay.",1.0
This is not the Older version I used to play as a child. The picture that was used to advertise was the older edition. I received the new edition!,1.0
"Not at all impressed with this cash register.  No sound effects.  No bells and whistles at all.  It's a glorified calculator.  Amazon carries another one which is also made by Learning Resources but which is soooo much more fun!!!  It has all the bells and whistles I expected from a toy cash register.  It's called the Teaching Cash Register, and it talks!",1.0
I should have tried harder to find the original. This game looks nothing like the one I grew up playing. They should have stuck with the original. 2 thumbs down!,1.0
"Calculator (solar powered) only worked outside, and only if the sun was directly on it.  However, Amazon gave me a full credit for the item.",1.0
I paid extra to get the Pit game that included the bell.  The bell did not work and I had to go out and buy a bell to go with the game.  I was extremely disappointed but didn't want to go to the trouble of returning the game.,1.0
"As other reviews have stated, the board is extremely cluttered and hard to follow. My son has trouble seeing the squares because the colors are so similar. There are arrows telling you which way to go but they (like the squares) are so similar in color to the background that it's hard to see them. The numbers change position on every square making it hard to read from square to square.

I'm 30 years old, and I had trouble figuring out which direction to go when it was my turn. Chutes and Ladders shouldn't be like that. Just saying.",1.0
"I was expecting the game pictured, the original game came in a box like that. I was misled by the picture of the original box for the older version of Candy Land.  The product I received was the newer version of Candy Land. Please change the product picture to reflect the version you have.",1.0
I bought this game because I wanted the original candy land with cards. The picture shows that this game has cards and is the original. I looked at several other sellers and thought this was the thing I was looking for. Little did I know it was the one I could have bought for half the price at walmart. Highly dislike and disgruntled.,1.0
Not what i ordered! In Picture it shows the classic Candy Land. What i got was a modern smaller version. Instead of the cards i got a spinner smaller bored and not the classic plastic ginger bread men pieces. the bored was different than the original. all of the pictures of this item show the one i want but what was send to me was nothing like it was supposed to be. Very disappointed now i have to send it back and since i don't have a printer am inconvenienced to go to library and print out a return label! Was looking forward to playing this with my daughter tonight since she has been counting down the days until her package came.,1.0
I don't remember buying this product so it's very hard to rate something you don't remember.  I don't know what else to say.,1.0
I got the wrong game. It is a candy land but not the version that it said and had pictured. I am very unhappy as I paid to get the specific version that I wanted and got another one.,1.0
"The photo of ""Candyland"" game depicted the original version, complete with cards to match-perfect for a preschooler. The version that arrived was a new version, cheaply made, shrunken size and not fit for the toddler/preschoolers for which it was originally designed.",1.0
"My children are always confused when playing this game.  They don't know in which direction they are going, and where things begin and end.  I think it is because the board is waaaaaaay too busy.  They have gone terribly overboard with the pictures on the game board.  Let's bring back good of' snakes and ladders!",1.0
"I haven't given it to my great granddaughter yet, it's for her summer birthday, but I'm sure she will love it.",1.0
This is not the one pictured. I specifically wanted the one pictures and I got another one with different characters. This mattered for me because it needed to match a school set :-(,1.0
"I received this game, and it has a spinner, not cards. Very disappointed, as this was the reason I ordered this game.",1.0
"was looking for the original chutes and ladders for my 4 year old, and this is not it.  feel a bit duped by the seller, as i was led to believe by the post that this was actually the original one.",1.0
"This is a thoughtless, ill conceived, redesign of a classic children's game. The newest 'improvement' reduces the players to three, seriously? Hasbro must have done that to make room for the HUGE nonsense graphics. Good luck getting the correct 4 player version it too, it costs extra, it will be wrong and its not worth it. This game has been ruined. Your best bet is to find the old classic game at a garage sale.",1.0
"The game itself is a classic and I thought my son would love it, however, the colors and design make it nearly impossible for a child to differentiate between squares. My son seems always lost on the board and I can't blame him. Save your money...",1.0
i purchased this game at the highest price point of several which were available.  it was very poorly constructed and definitely not worth the additional amount.,1.0
This toy is not kid tough it was broken when I took it out of the box and went down from there! Nothing lined up and the register part wouldn't even open!!!,1.0
Paint chips off way too easily.,1.0
"I got this cash register for my 6 year old to help him with is counting and and basic adding and subtracting and didn't even have it 2 days before it broke. When I opened it the buttons on the calculator stuck so they were hard to push, and the drawer opens but doesnt close. This was a complete rip off and I would have never bought it if I had known the way it was made. Do not waste your money on this item.",1.0
my five year old grandson really enjoyes playing with this i really believe more than any of his other toys great product,1.0
I bought this for my grand daughter. When we opened the game there were only 3 game pieces in the sealed bag instead of the required 4 that was suppose to be included in the game!! Very disappointing to say the least. Grrrr.,1.0
"That half-gallon of orange juice has been shaved down to 59 ounces.  Your 8-oz. container of yogurt is now 6 oz.  What used to be a half-gallon of ice cream is now 1.5 quarts.  It used to be that T-shirts you purchased held up for at least a year.  These days, they're paper-thin and fall apart after a single washing.  And now...

I discover that even board games are not immune to shrinkage.  With the cost of rising raw materials, manufacturers attempt to increase their profits without hiking their prices.  A common tactic is to decrease the amount of materials used to make the product, which is what Hasbro has done.

Their strategy fails miserably with Chutes and Ladders.  Did Hasbro even product-test the new version?  First, I want to say, I think C&L is a great game. It's educational because it tries to teach beginner math skills and instill some morals through the pictorial depictions on the game board.  I have fond memories of playing it as a preschooler during the early 1980's (yikes), but this current version, which my daughter has, fills me with annoyance every time she drags it out.

The size of the board is now 20""x15"".  I seem to remember it being closer to at least 24""x20"" (don't quote me on that by the way, I just know that it used to be a lot bigger!)  If that's true, then the playing area has been reduced by a good 40%.  The base of the player pieces are now circular instead of rectangular.  If two players land on the same spot, they can't both fit.  I don't remember bumping into each other being an issue in the old version.

For what it's worth, Candy Land (also by Hasbro) has shrunk to 20""x15"", too and now includes smaller gingerbread men playing pieces and color block cards.  I'm not thrilled about that, either, but the new Candy Land is still playable.  Some games can tolerate more shrinkage than others.",1.0
"This is not the game you remember from your childhood. This newer version of Chutes and Ladders has a board about 3/4th of the size of the the one I had 30 years ago. The board is tiny and the squares are so small that each piece can barely fit. Because of the size, the board is way too busy- chutes and ladders run all over the board and cover the squares.

Chutes and Ladders is supposed to tell the story of choices and consequences. The illustrations in this version are so bad, and everything is so crammed, that all meaning of the game is lost. I don't even bother to point out anything to my son, I just help him keep his place.

Lastly, the spinner is horrible. You'd think a spinner would be a pretty simple design for Milton Bradley, but the arrow on the spinner covers the number. So you spin and then have no idea what number you have. I don't know how that got passed the designers, but it's pretty obvious they were counting on nostagia to sell this game.

Don't waste your money.",1.0
"Not sure about the product actually, but it should be made clear that they are manufactured in China since the blocks are painted. Never would have purchased this were made clear. Do not trust their quality standards when it comes to paint.",1.0
"I played this game when I was a kid. However, I think I suppressed my memories of how bad it is. I recently played this game with my 4 year old niece and nephew. My niece chose the game and we picked our characters and started playing. After just a few spins my niece started saying that she wanted to play a different game. I thought it would be the reasonable thing to insist that she finish what she started. However, after awhile she was in tears and I don't blame her. This game is mind-numbing. You spin, move your piece, over and over and over again. I have an attention span much longer than that of a toddler and still found myself just rushing though the game wishing for someone to win and put us all out of our misery. The board art is uninteresting, and there are no redeeming interactions, you just mindlessly spin and move over and over again until someone wins by luck. The value that this game has for building motor skills, teaching turn taking and counting should be sought with a game that is more interesting and a little less soul crushing. A kid may cry when they lose, but a board game shouldn't make them cry just for playing.",1.0
"Unlike the other one star reviews, I don't care that the game is boring, you are playing with preschoolers, after all.  The revamped board is hard to follow and most 3 year olds can't count past 30 ish, so some directional arrows would be nice.  Also, there are way too many chutes, most preschool kids want to play a quick game, not one they almost win, only to be thwarted by chute after chute.  If a classic version exists, maybe, but this one is awful.  I loved this game as a kid and was disappointed by this version.",1.0
"The board for this game is TERRIBLE.  The numbers are unclear, the spaces are too small and there's too much clutter.  My daughter is age 5 and loves board games but she cannot follow this board.  The players are way too big for this space.  I definitely recommend the classic board rather than this one.  Otherwise be prepared for constant frustration as the kids move in the wrong direction, skip spaces and get mad because they don't know which way to go.

Such a disappointment because the original is such a fun game, but this redesign is AWFUL.  Don't waste your money.",1.0
This is the same chutes and ladders as the cheaper one. Not the same one as pictured above. I wanted the same one as the picture since my son liked those kids' faces!,1.0
"Don't be fooled by the cover of this game.  This is the most boring game for adults to play with your kids.  I have four children and Chutes and Ladder is a long game and often give up to do something else.  It's infuriating when you hope to finish soon only to slide back down quite frequently.  By far, I prefer to play Candyland.",1.0
"THERE ARENT ALOT OF PICTURES T
BUT ALOT OF THE SAME ONES WHICH SUCKS. I EXPECTED DIFFERENT STUFF ON THEM.. NOT 4 ELEPHANTS ETC...",1.0
Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and the calculator was broken straight out of the box. The kids still like to play with it but we were looking forward to using it as a fun way to learn math. I had one as a kid and loved it so I knew my kids would too. But don't expect it too hold up to well,1.0
My daughter loves it so much that she plays with it all day everyday!!!!!!!!!:)and it even gives them more learning skills!,1.0
"There are three items* SOMEONE should warn parents about before they buy them. This is one of them. I only wish someone had told ME years ago...

Yes, this game is cute and easy to play. Yes, it's famous. And yes, it's probably educational.

But be warned - it is THE most boring game in the universe. After ten minutes you will find yourself in a stupor. You'll look at the board and begin trying to calculate how much time it will take for the game to END. Soon you'll feel the urge to throw your chair through the window...not the loving-family-ambience you were expecting.

AND EVERY TIME YOU THINK THE GAME IS JUST ABOUT OVER, YOUR KID FALLS DOWN A CHUTE AND HAS TO START OVER ALMOST AT THE BEGINNING. You will find yourself lying to your children, telling them a ""2"" means ""Move 4"", and secretly scribbling over the chutes at midnight with a fat-tipped indelible black marker while spouting gibberish and drooling.

Let your kids play this at pre-school. Give it to the grandparents. JUST DO NOT ALLOW THIS GAME IN YOUR HOUSE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY.

"Terrible!! I remember playing this game as a kid and really enjoyed it and so we bought it for our almost-4-year-old daughter. She loves Candyland, UNO, matching games, Old Maid, Go Fish, Sorry, etc...but really does not like this game. We gave it to Goodwill after playing one time. The board is very hard to decipher (nothing like I remember as a kid) and it's simply too boring for her. Do NOT bother with this game.",1.0
"Growing up in Germany with a LOT of siblings we played a lot of boardgames. But I never knew Candyland. When my daughter was 2 and we could play other games with her besides memory I googled for some nice games for beginners (the games I remembered from my childhood aren't sold here). Everybody recommends this game, so we bought it. I have to say, that Candyland is by far the most boring game ever!!! Now I know, why people here don't seem to enjoy boardgames as much as I am used to. My daughter is 4 now and we play at least 2 different games each night before bedtime. And we play Candyland about twice a year (and only because my daughter likes the gingerbreadmen). We bought it new for 5 $ and it is not worth the money. If you buy it because of  your own fond memories then make sure it won't be the only boardgame in the house. And if you grew up with ""Sagaland"", ""Mensch rgere dich

The grapes look like cherries...have you ever seen candy apple red grapes? The apples look like red pumpkins. Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters...confusing to a child trying to learn. Additionally, the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some. They have a strong odor (kind of like clay).

"It doesn't look nearly as good as the picture depicts.  The colors are rather dull, not vivid.  It has very little functionalitty.  The display is very dark, can't be good for the eyes.  I've returned it already.  Very disappointed.",1.0
The game wasn't complete.,1.0
"My son loved this toy, but we returned it as the digital display never functioned properly and displayed only gibberish rather than numbers. Sure, I got my money back, but did not appreciate the hassle. Also, the drawer opens so forcefully that money flies out every time... my son needs no help making messes. Looking at other brands as I'm very hesitant to buy this product again.",1.0
My operation game came without the pencil so I am one prop short and its not fair and important to the game.,1.0
"Not at all what is advertised. I ordered this item for my daughter's candyland party and wanted the older design as pictured. When I received my order, it was the newer design which has a totally different name and board.",1.0
It took my 11 year old and my 8 year old over an hour to set the game up(with alot of help from me)Every time you bump the board the whole thing falls apart so you have to spend about 15 minutes trying to put it back together.  As for gameplay- what gameplay- you're so busy trying to keep the thing together you don't get to play the game.  Also if you lose just one of those little pieces the whole game is shot. This quickly went into the trash- don't waste your money!,1.0
"The calculator did not work from day 1.  It stayed on ""0"" no matter what button was pushed.  Whenever the drawer opened several coins went flying out.

We received this as a christmas gift.  Luckily we were just under the 30 day return policy.  We can get a credit but what a hassle.  We don't get a refund until well after the broken one is received back and AMAZON won't do an exchange.  It would have been nice for them to apply the credit for the exchange and maybe take our credit card info on a hold until they got the broken one back.

Now we have to do a new order and there is a $10 price (increase) difference.

It's hard to ask a kid to wait 14 days after you return their gift for a replacement.  So I would need to just pay for a new one and keep the credit for a later date.  This is a lesson - don't try and make it easy for relatives by giving them an amazon list of items to buy.  You really need to be sure its purchased within the 30 day return policy and that you have a few days to be sure it is not going to break.

And I feel bad for the relative who is excited to hear how the kiddo likes their one gift...and it turns out broken.  Shame on Learning Resources - what a piece of junk!",1.0
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. We have changed the battieres and have yet to pay the game because it won't work.,1.0
"Not the game pictured, it's a new version that is not the one I had ordered.
When I went to return it, I was unable to do so online even after filling in the option (and explaining in the required comment section) that it was not as pictured.

I want what I paid for.",1.0

"To describe this toy in brief I'd have to say all it is is a large calculator that makes a ""ding"" noise when it opens. I purchased it for my 6 year old so she can practice math through productive play but for what I spent ($33) I was better off purchasing her fake money from the 99cent store and a large calculator, I would've save a good amount of bucks and it wouldve been the same effect. The dollar bills and coins do not look realistic as advertised and it is not solar powered it uses a cell battery. So much for reading reviews! If it didn't cost dam near as much as I paid for it to send it back I wouldve sent it back as soon as I opened it and tried it out. It didn't captivate her amusement but for 30min. There are better options out there. DON'T BUY THIS TOY FOR MORE THAN $10 As for durability it is sturdy. The plastic is very thick.",1.0

"I wish I'd checked the reviews before ordering!  I refuse to buy this newer version of Candyland with ""princess"" type girls scantily clad with lollipop bustiers, and I have searched high and low for the more ""old school"" version.  What seems to be mass produced today is this ""glittery"" version that is sold at most retailers for around $4.99.  I'm happy to pay more for the version I prefer, which is why I came to Amazon and paid over $23 (including shipping).  I am so disappointed that what showed up to my home is the exact version that I have refused to buy in the store.  What a huge disappointment five days before Christmas!",1.0
"Not only is this not what they advertise but I got charged $19.50 instead of the advertised $15 for what I had ordered.  I got the  Kingdom of sweets version which I specifically did not want.  I had researched extensively and was so happy when I found this seller  offering a more toned down, less spastic version of this classic game.  The one they sent is easily available at many stores for a 1/4 of what they charged me.  CONCLUSION: DON'T BUY FROM THEM UNLESS YOU WANT A FREE STICKER THAT SAYS SUCKER TO PUT ON YOUR FOREHEAD. Oh and they did not send any type of receipt in the box  to return it.  I will make it my mission to do so :)",1.0
"I was under the assumption that Candy Land was an actual place. So I purchased the so called ""game"" thinking it was a map and quite frankly I still do! I drove around the Greater Chicago area for about 4-5 hours trying to find the Candy Land exit. I finaly got off at Dolton and got a burger. The burgers in Dolton were fantastic! I am not sure if they are known for their burgers but it was really good. You didn't even need fries, but how can you have a burger without fries? It's like getting candy for being bad!!!! Anyway, overall good product.",1.0

"I purchased this because it was favorite game growing up and my kids are into the board game scene right now. I was more excited than them to set it up! This game is so cheap and terribly made that you can't play it properly. Everything falls apart when you spin the wheel to send the marble on it's way. The marble stops mid way and has to be picked up and placed back on track. The stairs don't stick into the actualy board, so there is no support. My kids keep complaining to play this game, but it's impossible to play since the plastic parts don't function properly. This cheaply made game is such a disappointment. Save your money. Or go ahead and buy it to see for yourself.",1.0
"THIS GAME IS NOT THE SAME AS THE PICTURE. YOU WILL GET CANDY LAND THE KINGDOM OF SWEETS GAME, NOT THE ORIGINAL AS PICTURED HERE. So disappointed! This game would be fine for my 5 and 7 year old who already have the original Candy Land board game, as pictured, as it would add a fun twist to an old game that they love. However, I was ordering this for my 3 year old niece. I wanted the original Candy Land game!!!! So disappointed as I know my sister would have wanted her to have the original as well. So I'm giving this a 1 star due to FALSE ADVERTISING!!!",1.0
"If you notice most 5 star reviews are dated pre 2006. It seems the board has been changed since then. I bought this for my son and was expecting the classic candy land game...I was very surprised to see the changes that have been made. This version is very busy...which causes it to lose a lot of it's charm (and give me a headache). This game is meant for toddlers...the board shouldn't be a chaotic mess.  Not a good update in my opinion.  If something isn't broke, don't try to ""fix"" it.",1.0
"This was the worst game I have ever experienced. In all my vast years, I have never come across something so wretched and horrible. It was a plethora of wasting my time. I spent THREE MINUTES of my life on this piece of garbage!!! I hope all the kids who buy this see past the lies and trickery and buy something else like Monopoly. This game ruined my life.
[ Please note: the above was written by my 13 1/2 year-old son, who refused to walk down memory lane when I purchased Candyland as a humorous interlude in his frenzied world of Xbox and IPad.]  PLEASE! Don't take the above very seriously!!! (He was just mad that I WON in three minutes!!!!!!!!!)",1.0
"Be aware the version you are buying is not the classic one shown in the pictures!!  This game has been redesigned completely - and not for the better!!!

The redesigned candy land is so disappointing; it is nothing like the classic game I remember playing. Every inch of this board is filled with tastelessly designed cartoon characters, and the female characters are overly sexualized. The ice princess has a giant slit up her dress and she is posing like Angelina Jolie. It is disappointing that a classic family game has been ruined.

That said, my 3 year old daughter unfortunately loves this game. We have Candy Land marathons in our house. She likes the game so much she wanted to get the game as a birthday gift for her friend. However, the version I bought for her friend I noticed no longer even has the CARDS, it has a spinner! So now instead of being able to land on the candy spots at the beginning of the board only once, you can be sent back to the beginning over and over. What a way to make a long game even longer. This was clearly not designed by anyone who has actually played this game with a preschooler. I felt bad for her friends parents buying this for them, I would not want to submit another parent to this redisgned version of this game.",1.0
"I purposely ordered this game from this seller because I wanted the older ""Kingdom of Sweets"" version of the game, NOT the newer, oversexed 2013 version.  Well, the joke is on me because I received the new, bastardized version of the game.  It's going back.  I reviewed that version on its page.  I ended up buying a vintage 1978 game on eBay.",1.0
"Ok So I should have listened t the other reviewers. This is not the advertised game. This is the ugly new version of the game. I am going to submit a complaint to amazon about the vendor and I suggest you all do the same. The game is not whats listed, yes its candyland but it isn't the cleaner looking version, its the overly saturated with ugly pictures version of the game.",1.0
"I bought this game new for my son for Christmas and when he opened it, you can completely tell it had been used. Theres pieces missing and the pieces that are there are in someones ziplock baggie. Super disappointed.",1.0
"Ridiculous!  Game doesn't work properly.  A parent has to trigger each successive step - push marble across the alligator trail, push down on giraffe's head to make the ball drop, compress hippo to trigger drop of trap and finally align the trap so it catches a mouse.  Utter rubbish.",1.0
"Honestly I am shocked that so many people like this game. This is a really boring game for my 4 year old. She just wants to give up after a while...it is too long of a game for a 4 year old that just never ends. All it really has is really cool graphics on the board without much purpose to it. Mainly there are one or two color blocks and you have to move your pawn forward to the matching color space on the block. Very rarely there is a picture card that moves the game along but there aren't that many of those. So you just have to bare your way through the pretty graphics block after block on the trail. It is a very very boring, long and painful experience!!! If you want to bore yourself to pieces, this is the game for you!!!",1.0
I ordered this game fully expecting the original game with cards not the new cheesy version.  I believe when I ordered this there was actually a video of a young boy playing the old version which is why I ordered this one.  IT IS NOT AND I AM RETURNING IT!!,1.0

"The picture that Amazon has up for Candy Land is WRONG. I guess Candy Land has a new version. I don't like it. The Game is too busy looking.  I hate how they keep changing the classics ...My Little Pony, Strawberry Shortcake, and even board games. I get it. They want to appeal to a new generation. That's fine. Just know--that you are not getting the game in the picture. You can find the old ones on EBAY.",1.0
"I purchased this toy for my daughter's for Christmas a few months ago.  They opened it Christmas morning, just yesterday, and played with it for only 5 minutes before the keys stopped working.  Nothing my husband or I did could fix this problem.  The screen stays on zero which makes the functioning value of the solar powered toy completely useless.  We are so very disappointed! My 5-year-old was very exited to add up her ""sales"" and follow along learning how to add and subtract with the register.  She's very disappointed it doesn't work.  I've recently noticed several reviewers with the same issue.  I was really exited for this gift for our kids.  This only qualifies for a partial refund and we would have to pay for the return shipping, unfortunately, we're stuck with this register.",1.0
"I rarely give low ratings, but this game deserves it. I bought this for my children with some old memories of playing when I was a child .. was disappointed right from opening the box that everything was plastic, and clearly of the cheaper mass-produced type. As we struggled through the first game, our enthusiasm kept going down .. from looking unsuccessfully for the rubber band that was supposed to be in the box, to scrambling to find another piece that we finally discovered in the garbage as it looked exactly like the throwaway plastic pieces that held the other cheap plastic parts.

When we finally got to the point in the game when the mouse trap was built and someone finally hand to turn the crank ... nothing. The plastic parts had shifted on the board. So, reassembly and then I held the board down on the floor as my daughter turned the crank .. to watch the metal ball careen down the too-short track and in 2 seconds trip the trap.

We put the game away, and went back to Monopoly.",1.0
"I couldn't wait to buy Candy Land for my daughter.  I loved Candy Land when I was younger & I remember being jealous of the newer, cooler versions that came out after ""my time"".

I couldn't wait to open this box...but I was very disappointed when I opened the box.  The game board is TOO busy!  It's jam-packed with colors, characters, candy, scenery, etc.  It's hard to even see what's going on!  It's overwhelming.  & honestly, it's ugly!

we are considering buying a used version of this game that is not so ugly.  this board game is over-designed & poorly designed.

it's sad what has happened to this game...they should have left it well enough alone a few versions ago...",1.0
"We were really excited about this toy for our kids and the first one we received arrived broken - the keys did not work.  We returned it (very easy to do via Amazon) and received the new one in a short time.  This one worked for about 3-4 days and then the same thing happened, the keys stopped functioning.  I agree with the other reviewers that the drawer does open with a bit too much force and even that mechanism was not working 100% well.  The drawer open key would stick. So we were not willing to buy a third and just got a refund.  Very disappointing.",1.0

"I ordered this game for a Candyland themed birthday party I am throwing simply because the picture showed it would be the 1997 version. But that is not what I received!!! I looked all over for the 1997 version because that's the version I grew up with and that is the game board I was basing my entire party off of. I received the newest released version and I HATE it.
I am so mad at the false advertisement that I have considered returning the game and just not having the game at the party, but our guests have requested we have the game so I am keeping it.
Definitely going in a garage sale after the party.",1.0
This is the new Hasbro version with false advertisement using the Milton Bradley version,1.0
There's a piece missing even though it said all the pieces were included so the product doesn't even work :( you have to minipylate the trap by hand which kind of defeats the purpose. I added a pic of the piece that is missing,1.0
"I purchased the Classic Version because it came with game cards and money and was exactly what I remember playing growing up.  Unfortunately, the game pieces that were inside the unopened box were for the Minion version of Operation.  When I contacted Hasbro, they were quick to send out the correct game pieces.  When the replacement pieces were received....they were for the New version of Operation.  The New version contains a cell phone, smiley face and other pieces that do not work with the game I purchased.  I contacted Hasbro again and this time was told that the Classic version is no longer in production and those game pieces are no longer available.  So if you buy the Classic Version your box may contain the correct game pieces, but if not, you are out of luck.",1.0
"I rarely post reviews on Amazon, however, I felt I had to do it on this item.  I'm an engineer and found it appalling at the lack of precision that these cheap plastic parts were made.  This is nothing like the old classic Mouse Trap game you played as a child where things actually worked and pieces were made of thick sturdy plastic!  This whole game is built around things fitting together crisply to make the game work.  One bent or poorly molded plastic piece and the game is essentially junk.  My recommendation is to look for an older used version on eBay.  This was junk and returned the same day I received it...where the part labeled ""thing a ma jig"" snapped onto a post that was angled instead of straight, making the second marble not fall properly.  Junk, junk. junk.",1.0

"Best Age: 3

Pros:
In theory, the game would teach a toddler to wait his/her turn, how to match colors to move along the path, and then the important life lesson about winning/losing and still having fun.

Cons:
The entire re-design. Totally ridiculous. Don't waste your money. Go to eBay and get the real thing.

As everyone else has probably explained, the original characters from the 80's are gone. This alone wouldn't invoke such an awful rating. The problem is they were replaced with extremely intense pictures which are so detailed and huge, that the path has been narrowed and now winds through some new places (so it is longer and thinner). To be honest, I even missed the secret path when I landed on it because the game board is so busy, you can't really see where it starts. The enlarged gingerbread men (and I thought the Katy Perry video totally mocked them, uh yeah - they are fairly accurate in terms of these new creepy ones) don't even fit on the micro-spaces that comprise the path. Because the path winds around itself so many times, it is hard to follow, knock your guy an inch and suddenly you are in the next loop of the path and have jumped ahead dramatically. It now takes about double the time to play a game, in part because the path is much longer - but also because the board is harder to follow. It seems it was designed with a deranged teenage girl in mind, not three year olds. You would think they would test these products and do a side-by-side with kids comparing the new one to the old one - hands down, the original would have won.

Unfortunately, this is pretty much the only board game for 3 year olds and now it is rendered useless. By the time your child has the dexterity to move his/her piece along this narrow, windy path without being distracted by all the crazy graphics - he or she will realize how babyish this game is and will have moved along to something more challenging.

I did actually write to Hasboro directly regarding the above issues, though I doubt they will ever respond.",1.0

We'll donate it, as it seems a waste to return. I just hope others read reviews instead of just looking at overall rating like I did.",1.0

I especially don't like how sexy the snowflake princess looks, she looks like one of those horrid Bratz dolls, and the prince looks awfully cheesy. Thoroughly disappointed, very misleading",1.0
i ordered the older candyland not the new one in the stores now paid 2 time what i would have in the store and ended up getting the same one i can get in the store for 8$ that is not the one i wanted if it was i would have got it in the store not happy with this i needed that one i ordered for a party for my child it a theme she wanted and now i have to do something with this one and try to find the one i wanted the box was messed up to no happy with this order and i order alot may not be as much now!!,1.0

"My husband and I remember Candy Land and were excited to play it with our 3-year-old.  What a disappointment.  They have ruined the game.

- There is no longer any white space on the playing board.  The path used to be made of large squares that wandered through a white/pastel candyland.  Now, every inch of the board is covered in super-saturated graphics that make it hard to see the path, for us adults.  It's like Where's Waldo but instead you are trying to find the path.

- They have also made the squares smaller and put more of them on the board.  Why, oh why, would they make this game LONGER?  It's supposed to be a kid's first game.  None of us could hang in there for the ETERNITY it took to get to the end.

I am hiding this and going to look at yard sales for an older version.",1.0

"My husband and I have raised five boys.  We are a huge game playing family. We have heard all the wonderful reviews of Candyland.  However, our experience was quite the opposite. Not one of our children enjoyed playing this game. Getting toward the end of the game and sliding back down to the bottom was overwhelming for our little ones.  They became so frustrated that when they played Candyland someone always ended up in tears or they ended up fighting.  Perhaps it is better if the children are older,  but ours just never enjoyed Candyland.",1.0
"This game was something I was anxious for my little cousin to experience since I had such fond memories of playing it as a child. When it was purchased however I was extremely shocked and disappointed by the changes. The gingerbread men had wider bottoms that overlap the board pieces, and the graphics were horrible. My favorite characters like Jolly and Grandma Nut were completely unrecognizable, and Plumpy was nowhere to be found. Plus there was a beaver, where'd he come from? My cousin enjoyed the game but I felt bummed. The nostalgia is just not there with this version. Why are they ruining all the great games with their ugly changes? Maybe it's just me and I focus too much on the looks of things, but the new version just didn't cut it for me.

I suggest buying the retro version from Wal-Mart or an old game board online. My cousin enjoys the older version so much that we rarely use the newer designed board.",1.0
"I remember the game when I was a kid. The game is still the same, however, Made In China means cheap construction. The pieces do not fit well on the board. The board is way too small.

The kids just construct the pieces and turn the crank to see the action ... they don't like to play the game because of the issues with the pieces issue.",1.0

I am disappointed because it does not have clear directions on how to play the game. but more disappointed because when we reached the helping had and adding the thingy ma-jig, it app[ears we are either rmissing part of our thingy ma-jig or it was broke. So we were unable to finish building the trap and I had a very broken hearted 4 year old. Unfortunately, because I opened several months after we ordered, returning the product isn't an option.

This is one of the best board games for kids and adults. Unfortunately it is made so poorly that it doesn't work properly. It is overpriced and needs to be made sturdier so kids can enjoy playing it without always haveing to put pieces back together.  I never had this game as a child but those who have say it was made so much better and actually worked. I would be happy to pay a higher price for a sturdier version of the game because it is so much fun to play.  I am returning it simply because it doesn't work.,1.0

Worse thing I have ever bought.  It was extremely used and damaged. Pieces were broke off in the holes to secure the game.

Packaging is impossible... took scissors and a knife and lots of muscle to get everything out of the box.  Then it didn't really work.  Taking it back today.,1.0
I can't believe I spent money on this POS... the crank doesn't work and the boot has to be swung manually to make it kick the bucket (I had to bend the pole it's on to even get it to be close enough to kick it). It constantly fell apart each time we tried to add more pieces. I put this away after 1 day of frustration and my son hasn't asked to play with it since.,1.0
Did not have all of the parts was supposed to have. Very disappointing as it was not a cheap game.,1.0
Missing game pieces.,1.0
The pieces of plastic are so cheap it doesn't work. Do not buy.,1.0
"I got Mouse Trap thinking it would be a game, about creating.  No.....  There is one set way to build the trap.  So boring.",1.0
Very poorly made. Pieces broke apart badly when trying to set it up. Never got to play it because the pieces didn't fit together n it didn't work because of it.,1.0
This is the worst game ever. It was my first true disappointment as a child. People who like this game are serial killers who love pain.,1.0
"Although cool in concept, it is too easily broken. The first one arrived broken. The second one broke on the first use by a five year old. We super glued it, but still did not stand up to a five year old's use.",1.0
"I bought this game as a gift, so I didn't open it and test it beforehand :(  Wish I had because it didn't work.  It's used and the battery area is corroded!  Unfortunately it's past the 30 day window, and I can't return it.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!  Lesson learned.",1.0
Game was received missing a key part. Too much of a hassle to return it.,1.0
"Description prior to buying said a few pieces of game were missing. When I opened the package the box was in bad condition, there was no money to the game, no game cards, and the ONLY piece that came with the game was the rubber band",1.0
"I wish I had bothered to read the reviews before ordering this game. Paid $ 40 to get the ""original"" version of this game and instead got the so called updated version which has large holes and rubbish items to take out and that's it.
Applied to return it but couldn't without talking to customer service. After explaining the problem she said she would issue a return slip and send the game I had ordered, which by then had gone up an incredible $ 20  to $ 60. She did agree though I should have it at the original price I ordered it for and was going to issue a $ 20 credit to my account.
I presumed the matter was sorted until two days after when I received the exact same game from Amazon. I again could not return the game without talking to customer service but was unable to explain anything more than I wanted to return the game. The fact I still wanted to order the original game did not sink in with the cs agent. The agent merely commiserated with me when I said I still wanted the game and could I get it through Amazon or not as so far it didn't seem likely. The ""I understand how you feel"" comment I got made me decide to give up, particularly when, as I was chatting with the cs agent I noted that in the last two days the price again had risen by another $ 10.

I've now bought it through Ebay, at least I hope I have. It's a shame as I never had an unpleasant experience with Amazon before.",1.0
Very disappointed with this new version ( which I ordered by accident). The box says ages 4+ and that it  has larger openings and easy grab pieces. There are no cards to tell you what to remove. The pieces come right out so there is no challenge! Will be looking for the original version.,1.0
Well someone just upped the price on this item considerably. This item was on my wish list at a considerably lower price and my partner bought it for me as a gift.....they shipped the UGLYnewer version which is really dumb looking - wish I could return it but instead I'll just donate it.,1.0
I too received the newer version (for the older version price).  Newer version has a toilet and cell phone among other dumb things in the toy.  If I wanted the newer version I would have bought it for less money.  Trying to contact the vendor now but of course I can't seem to get them to call me back.,1.0
"Very disappointed with the rules for playing the game. Set-up the same, but the process of the game is not the original and confusing and non-interesting. Quality of the game is poor. Parts of the game do not work.",1.0
"I've never posted a one star review on Amazon before, but this is totally unacceptable.  I ordered this version of Operation for $24.99 because it shows the classic version in the pictures.  The version they shipped is the new one, which Amazon retails for $14.77.

This is a complete rip-off.  They're probably counting on people being unwilling to go to the trouble of sending a board game back.",1.0
"amazon had listed the ""original"" operation for $29.99, which is what i ordered.  i was sent the ""new"" version, the one made for small kids, that sold at mass merchants for $7.99.  when i complained, hasbro ""generously"" offered to let me have this version (which i didn't want) for $15.  crazy.  fortunately, i was able to return this & get a full credit.  what a bother though, and an extreme disappointment...",1.0
"I still have the original game, and I revisited it after so many years of collecting dust in the closet. I thought time would be kind to it but unfortunately not.

The light worked, but the sound was thankfully gone. It had to be the most annoying sound of any game (it may have been deliberately fixed to prevent it from happening). I honestly thought that all parts of the body except for one were easy to get out. But, the writer's cramp...man. Forget it. That's when the game ended the life of Operation. And then, back to the closet, still collecting more dust. Sometimes, I see doubles. Sometimes, I know the tweezers just flat out suck. And a lot of times, I am just pissed off about the last time I set off the light.

All in all, Operation is a very, very annoying game to play with.",1.0
"I want a refund! What a rip-off. This is not the original game (as advertised in the picture). None of the pieces are the same. 'New & improved' piece of garbage. Shame on Amazon for false advertising. TAKE DOWN THE PICTURE!!!

I WANT MY $30 BACK.",1.0
"I purchased ""Operation"" for my nephew, who loves challenging games,
but the parts to be removed are light plastic & so cheap along with close to impossible
to maneuver. I remember the game from years ago and while the
manufacturers may have cut costs, it also made it
unenjoyable for a child.",1.0
"I should've listened to the other reviews that stated this isn't the original.  I guess some people got the original and some didn't.  I didn't, and I don't want the new version.  They charged the price of the original, though.  I wish I could find a seller who will actually send me the correct product.

Update: the seller has offered a 50% refund and for me to keep the new version.
I've told them I want to return it for full refund.

Final update: the seller gave me a link for a return label but I would've had to pay shipping. I requested a postage paid label, so they said I could just keep the game and gave a full refund. They said the error is because amazon has not updated the information on this game. I still would want to pay and get the original instead of the new version for free. This game is so obnoxious!",1.0

I ordered this classic version of the Operation game and received the new version.  This is not the classic game!",1.0
"Disapointed!  I purchased this product because the picture and description reports it to be the original version.  That is what I ordered for a christmas gift. What I received is the silly version that I could buy today at Target for $16.00 rather than the $30+ I paid to get the original version.  Have sent the seller, stl pro, two emails but have recieved no response.  Will be returning this and missed out on a great christmas gift.",1.0
"Heads up! I ordered the more expensive ORIGINAL version of this game with real bones and body parts. I did not order the new version with cell phones and boogers. I did not receive the original version that was double the price. I received the new and cheaply revised version but was charged the more expensive price. I should have listened to one of the reviewers that it happened too but I gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt that they would represent stand up companies.....apparently not!!If anybody knows of a place to order the original operation that will actually ship it, please let me know. Thank you. Shame on you, Amazon.",1.0
"This seller is not to be trusted. I purchased the ""old fashioned"" game of Operation, for which I paid a higher price than I would have had I ordered the new version of the game.
What I received was the terrible, new, plastic version of the game. This game is cheap and poorly constructed not to mention that it is vulgar. Whatever happened to the sweet game of yesteryear in which one could angle to remove the funnybone? Now, children are greeted with burps, farts and other bodily rumblings, along with alarmingly cheap plastic bits to remove from the patient.
I am not satisfied at all and will NEVER purchase anything from this seller again.
BEWARE! You will not get the item or the quality for which you paid!",1.0
"If you view the photo associated with the purchase above, you think you will receive the original version of Hasbro's Operation game.  This was not the case for me!  I received the newer, revised version of the game with strange sounds and awful parts!  I paid more for this product because I thought I would get the orignal.  You could easily pay $10 or $15 for the version that I received.  I am very frustrated and I will be returning this game.",1.0

"Item was said to have all parts and pieces and in good condition. ..received item the game box was torn and beat up (no biggie) once the game was opened to check for parts I found there are parts missing, parts broken, half of the directions are missing (the important part) and the game is unable to be put together correctly let alone played..very unhappy as it was a Christmas present for my 6 year old who wanted the ""real"" mouse trap not the baby one.",1.0
Box broken with tape around it and board ripped and just not even worth it. To me anyways.,1.0
"Garbage. Giraffe does not move when ball lands on it. Misshapen pieces. Game does not work without moving the ball along with your finger. I suppose the Chinese have gotten the order to make these, but quality control and tolerances are a second thought. Thanks Crapbro.",1.0
"Excited that my daughter was finally old enough to play my favorite childhood game, we purchased it and rushed home to play.  This is NOT the Operation I remember!!  The game is cheaply constructed, and it is nearly impossible to use the tweezers.  They have NO grip, so time and time again, they slip off of the part you are trying to pick up. I was successful a time or two, but my daughter was only able to retrieve the rubber band.  Needless to say, she became frustrated quickly.  This game is JUNK -- save your money.",1.0
"We purchased this game for our  granddaughter because our kids had it as children and spent hours of giggly fun operating on Sam. We were so very disappointed with the quality of the game. It sure isn't what it used to be. The plastic ""organs"" and ""bones"" slip right off the tweezers when you try to remove them during the ""surgery"". They could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them. Also, the tweezers actually throw sparks when they touch the sides of the ""operative sites"". Coupled with the loud buzz, our granddaughter perceived the was going to be shocked or hurt. Even though we explained that she wouldn't be. She said, ""I don't like this game."" The game board itself is also very cheaply constructed. It's really a shame that they've ruined a game that was loads of fun in cutting costs by cheap manufacturing. Sadly, this is another product manufactured outside the USA and it's become junk!",1.0
"I bought this game for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and what a huge dissappointment!!!  My husband and I could hardly play.  First of all, the ""funotomy parts"" are so small. The cavities are so much bigger that the parts slide all the way to the side and it's virtually impossible to remove the part.  The tweezers are cheap and the nose of the tweezer is too big.  With some of the parts, you cannot even grab the parts no matter how you try.  What a piece of junk. It's going in the trash!!!  Don't waiste your money.",1.0
"Terrible game.  no one can play it, not even my husband, and he IS a surgeon.  Can't get all pieces out without losing.  Annoying sound too!!",1.0
"I played this game as a kid and loved it. But now this thing is made so cheap, the top paper isn't even glued down and we've had some parts get stuck under it, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to pick up these pieces, even if you are steady and all that, you can't get the pieces out because they are real slippery and so are the tweezers. There is nothing to grip the pieces, they are both totally smooth. This game sucks!!!!",1.0
Worst game ever invented for a parent.  Setting it up and getting it to actually work is a nightmare.  My son and his friends do not care about playing the actual game.  Just setting off the trap.  The game always ends in arguments and as a result needs a parent referee.,1.0
"I have a hard enough time shielding my children from all of the violence and gore on television, the last thing my family needs is a game promoting it.

""Operation"" is a game that features a man with his internal organs exposed.  The children that play this game are encouraged to remove said organs ""with a steady hand"", or risk being electrocuted.

Pavlov is rolling in his grave.
Granted, the shock the child receives is minor -- it's actually more of a sustained vibration (comparable to a personal massager), but this is not the type of reinforcement my children need.

I prefer to encourage my children -- not terrify them with buzzers and shocks when they do something wrong.

And for a game that's been around as long as ""Operation"", don't you think it's about time that Sam the Patient found a new doctor to fix what ails him?

If you're looking for a game that promotes wholesome goodness and a steady hand, chatchi's family recommends ""Don't Break the Ice"" or ""Cootie"".",1.0
I bought this game for my 6 year old son for Christmas.  It was hard for him to get the tweezers in the slots without making the buzzer go off and then when the buzzer did go off.....which was a lot.....it would vibrate all the other pieces to where you couldn't see them so we had to shake the toy to get them back into sight.  We were disappointed in this toy.,1.0
"This game looks really cute and could actually be a fun game, BUT....the pieces are way too small and slide around under the game board so they are virtually impossible to get out.  It makes no sense to make such large holes under the board for the tiny pieces!  The game itself is cheaply made and not durable.  My kids were completely disinterested and discouraged after the first loud buzzer went off.  Your money is better spent elsewhere.  [The] Uno card game is more fun and teaches numbers and colors at the same time!",1.0
"Perhaps it was the nostalgia, perhaps the clever packaging. Whatever compelled me to buy this game, I hope you do not fall prey to the same misguided intention.
My kids hate the game. They hate the buzzer, and they hate the tiny parts that get lost in the carpet. They hate the premise. There is no educational value in this game other than learning to count money or learning that specialists get paid exorbitant amounts of money, even more than ""regular"" doctors.
Within minutes after we installed the batteries, the red light bulb that serves as a nose no longer worked.
I recommend you spend your money and time elsewhere.",1.0
"The outside shipping box was in excellent condition. The inside game box, (which would be used to store the game) had a rumpled rip about 3 by 3 inches. It was obvious that it had been loaded in the box that way. Whoever packaged it didn't care.
I called to return it as we ordered for our grandson's birthday and it was too late to replace it and not available in our local stores. I frequently shop at Amazon as I am handicapped and don't drive. The person I spoke to was very nice about a free return, but I would have to drive it to the Post Office to send it.
That made me angry as it was delivered to my door and it was damaged at Amazon, not because I changed my mind or wanted a different color. After explaining more assertively how it was wrong for them to cause me difficulty, she put me on hold a few minutes and came back and told me that now they understood my condition they could have it picked up at my door. The item was picked up and returned but I don't understand, IF IT WAS CLEARLY AMAZONS MISTAKE, WHY SHOULD ANYONE HAVE TO RETURN IT TO P.O.?",1.0
"You know what? Alot of parents are out there just like I was filled with nostalgia, rolling the mouse into action. I am here to say don't bother. This cannot be the same game we had when I was a child. The toys are way, way smaller and so difficult to get out. We lost them the same day the game was opened. They were little plastic things with no character or charm and there seems no way to replace them.  The educational quality in this toy is a lesson for parents, we can't go back, and for kids, some things aren't worth the trouble. Buyer Beware.",1.0
"While my children loved this game when they were youngsters, we were sorely disappointed when we built the mouse trap and found that one piece was not formed correctly, therefore, we the game could not operate properly.  This problem took away all the fun.  We probably should contact the manufacturer and get a replacement. As you know, this is a toy where the enjoyment depends on all the pieces fitting properly and performing their function.",1.0
"by the time you get this together, kids no longer want to play.  This said, pieces broke off as we were putting it together.  very cheap.  i am tempted to contact the company to get a replacement",1.0

"I purchased this game for my daughter as a gift, because they have one at her school with which she enjoys playing.  The game simply does not work.  The mousetrap cannot be sprung.  It fails every single time.  Now, we had this game when I was a kid.  So, I went to my parents' house to see if they still have the retro version of the game and guess what... they sure did.  While we were setting it up, I noticed that some of the pieces were different from the new game I had purchased.  After it was all set up we sprung the mousetrap, and low and behold, it works perfectly... 25 years later. I don't know why Hasbro chose to change the design, but they should really consider going back to the old version.  Stay away from Mousetrap 2.0 and see if you can track down the old version in a thrift store or a flea market.",1.0
"If your kids are older and are really good at following the directions, maybe this could work. Otherwise you will be struggling to put this together while your kids are freaking out impatient to get started. It ruined our Christmas morning hassling with this game. Very annoying.",1.0

"The pieces are flimsy and not durable! My daughter received this game for her birthday and it lasted about a year.  The parts did not fit well and the action was clunker at best! As a kid I had the exact same one back in the 1970's but the one back then was better built then this modern day version.  We outgrew ours and my mom sold it at a garage sale.  Funny thing...it still worked well when she sold it and looking back I wish I still had it!
Bottom line, don't buy this modern version of Mousetrap. It's flimsy junk!",1.0
Integral pieces of this game were missing (not even manufactured by the look of it) The mouse trap does not fit together at all (even the bits that do not rely on the missing parts) so the game cannot be used and was a huge disappointment and a complete waste of time and money (I think the freight over to Australia was more than the toy),1.0
Proud of my eight year old son for trying over and over to get this game to work (it was put together properly by dad).  Have the manufacturers themselves ever tried to play it themselves?!  They should be forced to play the game with their own children as punishment.,1.0
Do not buy this version of the game.  The boot does not hit the stop sign which renders the game useless.,1.0
"My son really wanted to have this game and it looked really fun on the commercials...  However, the pieces don't fit together correctly and the green boot doesn't come close to hitting the yellow bucket no matter how it's manipulated.  So, then I manually tip the bucket and the ball doesn't hit the hand thingy hard enough to tip the second ball...  Oh, I almost forgot to mention that a few pieces were missing when purchased and we had to order replacement parts (pay for them).  If you've played this game, you'd understand.  It's a complete waste of time and money.",1.0
"I remembered playing this game when I was a kid (over 20 years ago).  My kids are 6 and 8 and we received a copy of Mouse Trap this year for Christmas.  When we opened it, one piece was BROKEN.  Not ""broken in shipping"" - just plain broken - the rest of the pieces were whole and the box was not crushed.  The game is not playable if any pieces are broken!

A friend had another copy & lent us their piece to stand in for the broken one.  Even then, the other pieces did not fit.  The boot is supposed to swing and kick the bucket, but as assembled, it does not come close enough to hit the bucket!  We have to slightly bend the lamppost to make the boot come close enough to hit the bucket.  Sometimes the marble just falls off the shoddy pieces.  For instance, the stairs piece, when locked into position on the board, causes the marble to fall off onto the board instead of into the rain gutter.  When completely assembled, and then adjusting all the pieces to make them match up (resulting in a LOT of adjusting and time-wasting), we got the whole thing working only 25% to 50% of the time.

We didn't bother with the board game part of it, everyone knows the fun is is in making the contraption work.  But the pieces are now so poorly made and they fit together so badly that it is such a waste of money and time.

Plus I was so frustrated trying to get this thing to work that I said it was ""crappy"" and now my daughter knows a bad word.  Yes, we immediately discussed appropriate language when frustrated.  But Milton Bradley is now selling games of crappy quality, no two ways about it!",1.0
"Milton Bradley has decided that quality doesn't matter in children's toys. 2 eight year olds and 2 adults playing this game can't make these poorly made pieces fit together. How frustrating for everyone! I apologized to my Grandchildren, but Milton Bradley should be apologizing to me for taking my money.",1.0

Look at the box online and go buy something else.
What a disappointment! My grandchildren deserve better.",1.0
"I fondly recalled playing with this game as a kid, and so was excited to buy it for my children. And they were very excited to build the mousetrap. But alas, the modern version of this game is a piece of junk. The pieces don't go together well, and the end result simply can't catch the mouse. The kids were very disappointed and I was annoyed to have wasted my money. I couldn't even recycle the plastic! Find the old version of the game on ebay or buy something else!",1.0
"Dear Hasbro,

  I have long depended on your products; they have only improved my life. I was afraid that after my sister, Fran, died that I would no longer be able to talk to her but thanks to your Ouija Board I get the opportunity to talk to her almost every day. As a single mother I have also used your products to help teach my children. Once every year I gather around my five kids and we all sit down and play a game of Monopoly to demonstrate why capitalism is a flawed system. We play through the game in one sitting - even if it lasts ten or twelve hours. That monotonous stretch at the end of the game where one or two players slug it out in a slow battle really underscores how the economic system makes us suffer.

  The fact that I've depended on your products so much in the past is the reason why I find it so hard to write such a negative review for you but I feel that I must. Recently a family of mice moved into our house; a gross affair, indeed. I searched your product listing and found one named ""Mouse Trap."" A smile came over me as I realized that this could also be a learning exercise for my kids as it can demonstrate how cruel nature is and how one wrong move can mean your death.  I've tried to teach this before by hanging swords over the dinner table in classic `sword of Damocles' fashion but I don't think they quite got the message.

  So when your board game arrived in the mail I was eager to put it together. While the way that Mouse Trap itself works is inefficient, to say the least, it properly gives the message that a chain of random events can end the life of any living soul; it also encourages creative thinking! I put a piece of real cheese - made with milk from the cow we keep in the garage - underneath the mouse trap. I also put the little plastic mice in a line as if they were moving towards the cheese. I thought that if mice saw other mice going for the cheese they would find the cheese even more desirable.

  We sat all night waiting for a mouse to come by. When the first mouse came he demonstrated barbarism to my children by attempting to eat one of the plastic mice. When he was finally in place underneath the trap I turned the crank to set the trap into motion - but it didn't work. The little green diver figure did not catapult into the place it was supposed to go. The mouse was content to continue nibbling on the cheese while I made eight consecutive attempts to get the trap to work. They all failed because of that WRETCHED green diver figure. On the tenth try the trap did indeed work, and the cage fell down onto the mouse. The mouse was startled; then he lifted the cage and stepped out, running away with his food.

  I fear that my youngest child, Aristotle, is now confused at his place in the food pyramid. I am deeply disappointed in Hasbro as a company that could release such a faulty and amoral project onto the so called `free market.' I will be hesitant to pick up Hasbro products in the future and if the next product fails on me I may have to abandon your company for good. Let us swear to Odin that this never transpires.

Cheap quality, unstable, and impossible to ever get to the actual game since you are reassembling the board CONSTANTLY.

"Forty-five years ago this toy was made with high quality parts, and worked every time.  Now, it cannot work because it no longer includes a necessary spring, and the shoddiness of the parts makes the contraption too loose to function.",1.0
"My 6-year-old daughter was delighted to receive this game for Christmas. I have to admit, it looked like it would be fun to watch the whole contraption work.

Apparently, the poor design and flimsy construction are somewhat intentional - i.e., the mousetrap isn't SUPPOSED to work all the time. See, Mr. or Ms. Consumer, that's part of the fun!!! Yeah... But it was excruciating to try and get any one part of it to work at all. First, a little hand crank is supposed to propel a boot into the bucket holding Steel Ball #1. As my daughter turned the plastic hand crank in earnest, the gear teeth slipped and the whole mechanism bent under her crushing 6-year-old grip. The boot remained motionless, but in her attempt to rotate the crank, my daughter inadvertently moved the game board - and the slight motion sent Steel Ball #1 through its zany maze. Fortunately, because the mechanism that sets off Steel Ball #2 is so poorly designed, Steel Ball #2 just sat motionless on its perch. Family fun a-plenty.

On our next attempt, with my wife holding the hand crank mechanism and game board firmly in position, my daughter was able to turn the crank without breaking anything. The boot kicked the bucket (yeah!!), Steel Ball #1 dropped out (all right!!!) and went through its maze (woo hoo!!!). But again, it failed to trip Steel Ball #2, so that was the end of that. We finally gave up and operated the second half of the game manually so my daughter could see it work, at least.

When the moon is just right, the stars align and you wiggle the game board at the right moment - but not too much, 'cause then you will set off the mousetrap or break off some flimsy piece - it almost works like it is supposed to. Otherwise, keep your blood pressure medication on hand.

Maybe the educational value is in seeing how poor design and construction can lead to product failure...?",1.0

What is worse is that the slightest move of the table sends the marble going.  An elbow on the board means the pieces start coming out of their holes.
Little kids like it but it is not made for them.  You need to be older to know what to do and what not to do...but then you are too old for the silly concept.
The idea of all the little parts and setting it up is a dumb one.  Half the time I would just set the hole thing up for them and use silly putty to keep the pieces in place.  Even the end plot of the game is wierd.
My kids are 8 and just about 5. We are a big game family.  This game is so bad that I kept it hidden on the top shelf in my laundry room hoping it would be out-of-sight-out-of mind. I then put it up for sale in my Garage sale for 1.00.  Other games were going just fine.  Then some lady came and bought 7 of the 8 remaining games.  Leaving Mousetrap behind.  I told her she could just have it and she said ""no thanks"".  I said ""oh do you already have it?"" and she said ""not any more -- it was pure torture"".
There are way better toys out there than this thing.  I think I would have given it a 0 if I could have.",1.0
"this game comes in many little pieces and has to be put together before the kids can play, then taken apart, put together, and so on. The pieces don't fit well, they get lost, and your kids will need you to put it together for them , but after the first time you'll suggest they play something else! I finally threw it all away. What a relief.",1.0
"Children think this game would be fun, if only they could figure it out.  Mom & Dad have to deal with it, & we can't figure out how to put it together either!  The pieces are small & complicated.  It is pure frustration.  Don't buy it!  Games are supposed to be fun!",1.0
"The thing takes an hour to put together and does not function
at all when assembled. What a piece of junk!",1.0
"I bought this for the family thinking it would be a refreshing change from Balderdash.

It could have been. Except the expressions were fake. They didn't capture the culture nor have any meaning. This is true of the English and Scottish expressions as well as the ones from cultures and languages that I don't know. I am quite sure they were made up by the game's authors.

I quickly realized it wasn't fun when the 'real answer' was meaningless; I could bluff better than the authors' fake answers. We never had a round where everyone correctly identified the right answer. We had many rounds where no one did.",1.0
Heats unevenly,1.0
My mom hate it.,1.0
"My sister got this toy for her birthday and she really doesn't like it. I think the same way. All this thing does, is open and close. The design is nice but we didn't feel like looking at it all day. We tried to play catch with it but the thing just broke apart. We put it back together and tried to do different things with it, but it just kept coming apart. Now it is sitting in our closet and hasn't been touched since. If you want this toy just for it to sit there, then I guess you could buy it. If you expect to play with it at all, DON'T BUY IT. IT WILL JUST BE A WASTE OF MONEY!!!",1.0

Absolute junk. Broken within minutes of opening.,1.0
Not as pictured; not a Hoberman,1.0
I wish I could give this 0 stars.  Not what I ordered.  The description said I would be getting an original hoberman model1335 which is what was pictured.  What I got was a cheap knock off.

Do not order this,1.0
"Clearly I got a cheaper knock off direct from China. Although I ordered the sphere with classic colors (red, lime, yellow, purple), the color of the one that arrived is more neon.

I had one similar to this as a kid and thought this would be a fantastic calming tool for my son with disabilities.. sadly it came broken. Does not seem to be of good quality. My son never even touched it.

Waste of money :(  I should of spent extra bucks on a better version of this i suppose...,1.0

"Incredibly cheap version of this toy. The plastic is very thin and weak and where the plastic makes connections with the ""nodes"" or hinges the pieces are extremely weak and feel as if they won't withstand even the most basic play. I do not recommend.",1.0
"Came apart the first time within one minute out of the box - I tossed it up in the air a few times and caught it (I'm 5'5"" and my ceiling is 9 feet -  it didn't touch the ceiling) and it broke on the 3rd or 4th toss - before my daughter even got to see it.  My daughter wanted one of these at the fair (kids were throwing them and kicking them around and had them on elastic strings flinging them everywhere), and my concern was all the ""Fair Fare"" was the ultra cheapo stuff bought in bulk.  Having experience with the larger version, I *thought* I knew the quality of the Hoberman, and paid a few extra dollars on Amazon to get something I thought would last.  Joke was on me.  I found the pieces and put it back together and gave it to her anyway.  She played with it for a couple hours and another 6 pieces came apart.  Do no waste your money on the Mini - get the regular size and if you want the Mini - see about ordering the super cheapo version direct from AliBaba or getting one from your local Fair.",1.0

"Boo! I wrenched my back. I yelled at my spouse. I stared angerily at my dog. In fact, to see which was more painful, I held my hand over an open flame for a minute, and guess what? It wasn't nearly as painful as trying to put this together. All because the toy manufacturer refuses to put anything but the meagerist of effort into their instructions. I have a degree from Phoenix University and I could not figure out how to put this together. Come on! Charge me a buck more and write HELPFUL INSTRUCTIONS! If my wife hadn't spent more than $50 on this I would have thrown it in the fire.",1.0
This was a really crappy item when i first bought it the displayed words were very visible the product itself seemed really cheap like i went and bout it for $5 downtown off the street i would put a few more dollars and get something better,1.0
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift but given the poor reviews about quality I tested it before I gave it away. I'm so glad I did. The battery cover would not properly fit in the opening & the screw provided would not stay in place (maybe the threads in the hole were stripped already when I got it). There was no way to keep the battery cover from protruding off the back of the unit - it sticks out and scratches you. As others have said, Yes, the screen was kinda hard to see and the buttons felt very cheap to the touch.

The final straw for me was the warbly little sound it makes when you solve a problem - it sounded like a dying robot. A very sad sound & there was clearly something wrong with it. I could not feel good about giving it as a gift knowing it would gurgle out that pathetic sound over & over.
Get a Little Professor instead - working vintage models are available as are newer solar powered models.",1.0

do any problem seeking on his or her own. You can put your own Calculation numbers in but the rest of the math is already inputted for test problems not your own math problems. Would of bought a calculator instead of this for a child to do math problems.,1.0
"This is a piece of garbage, pure and simple.  I ordered one which came defective (the number 8 and 9 keys didn't work - how are you going to do math without 2 numbers?) and returned it for a replacement which then also proved to be garbage.  With the second one, there were whole sections of the LED screen that did not show up.  While I was hopeful that this would be a valuable educational tool for our kids, it is nothing less than useless plastic.  What a waste!",1.0
"I bought the Mathshark for my 7-year-old child to practice her math skills. Opened the package, put in the batteries, and tried to use it. Half of the buttons did not work, no matter how hard I pressed. A few other buttons only worked if you pressed them REALLy hard. I was surprised given that we own several other Education Insights products with which we have had no problems. Too bad, a piece of junk.",1.0
"Half the reviews for this product are 5 star, half are 1 star. I decided to take the chance. I wanted something that would help me relearn my math facts and that would grow with my daughter as she begins to learn them. This sounded like the best one on the market and sadly, I still think that. So what's wrong with it?

The numbers are not very dark so it is difficult to read it in both dim conditions and in bright light. Forget using it in a car.

In addition, the numbers are poorly formed. They are similar to some calculators, where the numbers are made up of straight lines but that's not the problem. The problem is that the lines have fairly large spaces between them which make the numbers oddly formed. When combined with how dim they are, it makes them quite difficult to read.

The buttons barely work. You have to hit them firmly and check the display to make certain that your button hit was seen before moving on to the next number you want to enter. This is annoying for an adult but nearly impossible for a very young child to remember or accept. I also figured it was a matter of days before some of the buttons stopped working entirely.

Another minor problem is the LED's on the front are incredibly bright, actually painful to look at. A quick swipe of a black sharpie on the light itself would fix it but I figured there was no point. After trying it out for over a week, I sent it back. In case you are wondering, I ended up searching for an old DataMan - a similar toy from the 80's.",1.0
Just received it.  A great concept but poor quality.  Straight out of the box the button for #'s 4 and 5 do not work and #'s 7 and 8 are very slow to respond. What a disappointment.  I will be sending it back tomorrow,1.0
"ordered this item hoping my child would enjoy it. Saved it for later and did not check until my kid's BD. While trying it on, discovered that buttons 1,2,3 does not work, calculator mode is broken at all, does not respond. So, since it was a BD present, my kid is very upset and i am not sure we still can return it, just waste of money!!!",1.0
"My son used this for a little bit, nothing exceptional, but it worked as an electronic flashcard.

One day he came home from school and teh battery cover was gone. Looked everywhere;couldn't locate. I contacted Educational Insights, completeley willing to pay for a new battery cover.

They said bluntly, they could not help me. At all.  The HAD no battery covers, they said. Thanks and goodbye.

I would never purchase from any compnay that has such poor product service. Buy a math game for a PC or DS instead.",1.0
This toy is so expensive and yet so cheaply made.  They break easily and don't work well.  For these steep prices ($40) you can so much more for your money than this thing.,1.0
I really wanted to like this. The screen is just so sub par. The kids will pull it out occasionally to use as a calculator but that's only because they don't have another one. However bad you think the screen might be it is probably worse. This quality of screen would have been complained about by reviewers 20 years ago because it does cut things off and make them unreadable. Today it makes no sense to sell a screen like this when people are use to so much better. Also a rubber button promptly fell off and is still floating around the house somewhere.,1.0
"I purchased this game to help my 8 year old increase her recall speed in math (addition, subtraction and multiplication).  Loved the idea that this would grow with her and challenge her at different levels.  When the product arrived we were not able to turn it on, even after trying several sets of batteries.  Set it back for an exchange and the second one turned on, but stopped working after two uses.  Sent it back again, and was told by Amazon that the product is being pulled from their distribution because of poor quality and other similar complaints.  Needless to say I am very disappointed.",1.0
"I had a copy of the original game before it was changed after four years to its present format.  It was simple, got the job done, was fast-paced, and cost less.

I don't know why they die so fast but we have it in our little car games bag and every time my son pulled it out the batteries were dead. at least our L-max works great. We just haven't been able to get much use out of this product, and I think we overpaid for it because of the battery problem.",1.0
"This is an excellent concept. It has every feature that you could think about. My kids liked this very much (5 and 7 year olds). However, the screen is worthless. It is faint and hurts the eye. There is no way you can turn up the brightness (no buttons for that). The numbers on the outside can't be seen at all. The window is the exact size as the screen so that light from any side casts shadow on the screen. Kids even when they are squinting to understand if the number is a one or seven make mistakes. I would have happlily given double this price to get a version with the screen resolution issue resolved. May be this would get resolved in the next version. Till then it is as worthless as a 74 inch plasma hdtv with a dead screen.",1.0
"Well, live and learn.

My husband and I deliberately spent a higher price than most of the others advertised, as we were looking for high quality.  (Nothing more frustrating than a labyrinth that doesn't work properly!)  However, when we received the labyrinth it was immediately clear that the construction was shoddy, and that the frustration the game would cause would make the product neither educational nor fun. In addition - the picture on the web, as well as the one on the box that it came in, showed 60 holes, whereas this one has only 36.

Not a way to enhance Christmas morning.",1.0
My 8 year old daughter requested this ant farm.  It came quickly and the ants (about 25) we ordered came in about 1 1/2 weeks.  We prepared the habitat for ants per the instructions.  The ants weren't a problem at all to put in.  We did put them in the refrigerator for 7 mins to slow them down.  The first day or two the ants did explore the habitat somewhat.  They went down some of the tunnels we started for them and extended some of the tunnels.  In all they added about 2 inches in tunnels before they stopped.  For the most part the ants kept trying to get out of the habitat (they can't get out though) by trying to climb up the plastic wall.  After 10 days of this it was pathetic to watch them continually climb up the wall only to fall down.  I was considering letting them loose outside.  But by the 2 week mark they started dying off.  Every day we looked in there were more dead ants.  By 3 weeks they were all dead.  We gave them fresh water everyday and tried a couple of different foods (once per week per instructions) and kept it clean.  The only food they ate was a little bit of a sunflower seed.  My daughter wanted me to write this review so other kids wouldn't waste their money on this.,1.0

My first set of juggling balls around three years ago were this brand of juggling ball, and they lasted two years. The cover started to fall apart but the mesh bag on the inside held strong. They were excellent balls.

These are not those balls. They're the same size, about 3 inches in diameter, but their build quality is awful. I've tried finding that original set of balls to no avail and have decided to stop purchasing Schylling products.

For juggling balls I don't recommend this product nor this brand.",1.0
poor quality,1.0
"I'm far from what you would consider a professional juggler.  I ordered these in hopes of impressing my 2 year old son of my juggling skills.  After using them 4 times (each time for no more then 5 minutes) the stitching busted open and the insides are coming out.  Also it's very hard to tell from the picture but these are NOT sphere shaped, they are not a BALL.  The are oblong, almost like small footballs.  I wouldn't consider them ""classic juggling balls"" as much as I would call them cheap, oblong sacks.",1.0
"I should have listened to the reviews here, but I wanted to be cheap.

I wouldn't have minded the fact that they are cheap vinyl feel, so long as they had a good weight to them and they were all the same weight.  The three I got were: 35g, 44g, & 56g.  It's not possible to juggle when one is almost double the weight of another.  My hands smell a little bit, too, after handling them.

I also thought, because of the description, that I was buying 2.5"" balls, and the ones I got were 1.75"" in diameter.  The packaging was plain, and did not have the  Schylling packaging shown in the listing. I might try again from another seller. Or I might just bite the bullet and buy nice professional ones.",1.0

"each juggling ball was a different weight with one being 2x heavier than the other, plus they are all 2"" in D instead of 2.5"", and the instructions while helpful look like they are just photocopied from a pamphlet

"1. Each ball has an obnoxious tag that must be removed, do so at your own risk, because most likely, you'll end up tearing the incredibly fragile stitching on the seams.
2. Random seams just start tearing after light use.
3. The beans are at least contained within an inner plastic bag, so when the seams tear, the beads don't spill everywhere

Generally bad quality. Not even worth 5 bucks.",1.0
The product description clearly says these balls are 2.9 inches in diameter.  What we received were balls that were about the size of a hacky-sack -- 2 inches in diameter just a little larger than a golf ball.  This is flat out lying and false advertising.  Do not buy these juggling balls.,1.0
Lighter weight than previous juggling balls I have purchased. A seam on one ball started coming apart after very little use. Very disappointing.,1.0

I ordered the juggling balls a few months ago to teach my new 4 month old puppy how to catch things in her mouth.  At the same time I ordered clickers to teach her clicker training.  Since that time she has been successfully clicker trained.  As for the balls I never received them.  So I can rate the seller as terrible since I paid for something I never got.,1.0

At first I thought they must be defective but the packaging they came in - they arrived in a cardboard envelope (to give you an indication of size) - was only just big enough for them.

Based on some of the other reviews here I get the impression that other folks must have received a different version or batch as they seem to have had very different experiences. Either way, based on what I received some of the reviews do not represent the product that is currently being shipped, be sure to check the date of any review you read.

"The juggling balls that I received were not like the ones in the picture. Maybe, it is just the seller, Novelties Wholesale LLC, who is supplying inferior merchandise, but either way, these are bad for juggling. All different weights and the beads are so loose in them that they shift around and cause your throws to go wonky. Do yourself a favor, go out in your yard, pick up 3 similar sized objects, and save five bucks. I've juggled lots of random stuff that handled better than these.",1.0
"I bought two sets of these to work on my 4-ball juggling. I couldn't be more dissapointed. As stated, they all weigh differently, and they are about the size of hackey sacks These ARE NOT good juggling balls. They are kids toys....",1.0
"I was so dissappointed when opening up the tube with these. The container tube they came in was cracked beyond use. The juggling balls are not even round - they are football shaped. The vinyl is so stiff it would take months of juggling before they were soft and pliable. The material inside is much lighter than I would have expected. Wish I had bought a higher quality ball, as I bought two sets so I could practice with someone else.",1.0
"The balls are all of different consistency, some are filled more than others.  This affect their feel and weight. One is rock hard, the other is a little mushy and the third is very mushy.  Because they are different weight it make throwing them a challenge.  I recommend green fuzzy tennis balls.  They are all the same weight, size, and consistency, and they are course so they are easy to catch.",1.0
Im very disappointed that the cards came in a worn out box. I expected them to be brand new and not old and dented,1.0
This is NOT the original Uno! It's the newer version and the cards are smaller. So disappointed I can't return it!,1.0
"These Rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition.  However, the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see. After we opened the cards (two sets were purchased), we found that the Rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside-down.  The cards are also not particularly sturdy. These cards appear to be irregulars.",1.0
Did not receive original game. A newer version was delivered.,1.0
I ordered the original uno as pictured and described. I received the new version with the customizable wild cards. Which is exactly what I didn't want. Please contact me about returning or exchanging,1.0
"The deck I got was nothing like the one that is currently displayed on the product page. Granted it's still usable, maybe a little to glossy for regular uno cards, but if I wanted this set, then I'd have bought it somewhere else on Anazon for much less.",1.0
"Unfortunately I also purchased this expecting to get what's shown in the pictures, but I got the Wild Card deck with the box slightly damaged too. Next time I'll read the reviews for sure. Don't order this!!!",1.0

"Uno Card Box came with duplicates of the red and yellow cards, no blues and greens :(",1.0

"These cards tore up after one night of playing. Cheap. I can't believe they are named ""Deluxe"" and ""Player's Edition."" We've had our old Parker's Brother's set for years, and they have just now worn out.",1.0
These cards are so stiff that you cannot shuffle them without a great deal of difficulty.  They are also very slippery and slide all over the table.,1.0
"Note: I LOVE Rook... it's one of my favorite games... If you have never played, I recommend trying it, but DO NOT BUY THE WINNING MOVE DELUXE Cards.  I bought these cards because I thought they would last longer... but they did NOT.  After playing 12-15 games, the cards were bent and edges were coming apart.  THESE ARE CHEAP CARDS, made of paper and they will not last long.  Also, the ""score sheet"" included in the pack is worthless... just use a black piece of paper!",1.0
Terrible quality.  Corners start coming apart after 5 games.  The numbers are so big it makes holding them in your hand awkward.  Can't anyone make a decent set of Rook cards like the 70s.,1.0

I CAN HOOK UP TO TWO RINGS AND THAT'S IT.  THE DOLPHINS ALSO DON'T ""SING"".  I WILL GET AN OCCASIONAL TOOT FROM THEM BUT NOT CONSISTENT.  IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR IT TO MAKE A NOISE MUCH LESS MUSIC.  FORGET THAT!  THE ONLY GOOD THING THAT SHE LOVES ABOUT IT IS THAT SHE CAN PUT 3 RINGS ON HER FEET.  IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME TO THROW AWAY!  I WOULDN'T GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE EITHER.

"In general, the Gears line is a great STEM toy, but this is a poor set. There are very few pieces in this set by comparison to others. The springs are fun, but hard for little hands to remove or move. My son always asks for help with them. The propeller was the one great piece in this set except it was broken on arrival. Customer service was poor. They promised to find a replacement propeller but never never called back. Hubby fixed it with a fiberglass kit.

Would like to recommend the set as it has some fun unique pieces like springs, a variety of gear sizes and bases, a crank, and the propeller, plus the colorful stickers are fun. I do NOT recommend it as a first set as there are better sets for the price, easy of use, and durability.

Update: The stickers have peeled off, so I'm dropping another star. Definitely find a different gears kit.

+1 Multiple Gears sizes
-1 Broken propeller
-1 Poor Customer service

"The dolphins cannot make music when water gets in them, which is constantly.  The rings do not stay linked together.  The dolphins are cute & my 1-year-old enjoys dunking a dolphin & watching bubbles come out the top of the toy, but that's about it.  Very poorly designed.",1.0
"Was not going to buy this because of the really poor reviews.  But my daughter actually put it on her list for Santa, so I did not want to disappoint...the product really is junk.  The dolphins don't stay together, some don't work, and the quality is just really bad.  Stay away.....",1.0
"The pieces don't stay together, the dolphins barely make any noise. My 3 year old is not at all interested in these, if anything, they just frustrate her.",1.0
"I bought this toy for my 4 and a half year old niece. We were all so excited to play, and then soon incredibly frustrated. The pieces barely fit together; 3 intelligent and dexterous adults were unable to put more than 5 pieces together after an hour of trying. Incredibly frustrating and disappointing because the concept seems like so much fun!",1.0
"I ordered these for my 2 year old daughter thinking they would be fun during the bathtime.  They are not what I expected.  They work on the same principle as the musical wine glasses.  They are hollow on the inside and make a sound based on how far up the water comes in the hollow inside.  The idea is a good one and is nice that there are few parts and no batteries needed.  However, the dolphins don't work half the time and don't work if water is in the wrong areas.  They fall over easily and don't make enough noise to actually play any musical tune.  My daughter has more fun putting them in the floaties and blowing out the blow holes to clear to the water to try to get them to sing. I would not have bought them if I had seen and tried them out before hand.",1.0
These dolphins are a terrible bath toy for kids. You have to hit the dolphin very hard on the top of the head to get the sound to work. My children couldn't do it and the dolphins did not link together as I thought they did. I donated this toy right after purchasing it...too bad..what a waste of money.,1.0
"I think this product misrepresents itself. The dolphins do make noise, but I would hardly call it singing. If you tap them, if you're lucky you hear a slight ""bing"", but some of them are completely silent. The rings do not stay together at all and there is no symphony going on in this tub. It's cute, but takes up room, and not with the money. A plastic duck for $.99 is as much fun.",1.0
"There is a reason most of these reviews are one star this toy doesn't even deserve 1 star all I can say is loved the ideal, didn't love the toy please save your money and PASS",1.0
"It these are really made by Mattel, than I am SHOCKED by the poor standards they have. These cards are very small (half the size of the box) and so flimsy it is almost impossible to shuffle them.  I was so disappointed by this purchase. I surely thought they were poorly made knock-offs. I would not buy these.",1.0
"THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL UNO GAME. THIS IS A SCAM PRODUCT. cards are smaller than the original, its VERY CHEAP material, and I wish I had read the review that said the same thing.  DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!",1.0
"As mentioned in other reviews, the biggest problems with this toy are that the dolphins do not actually play any notes and it is very tough to link the animals together.  In order to get the dolphins to make the slightest squeak of a noise, you have tio slap them pretty hard and then, you can't really hear the squeak over the sound of your hand slapping the toy.  I would not recommend wasting your money on this toy.",1.0
We were looking forward to this but it just does not deliver.  The dolphins don't make sound reliably and the darn rings will not stay hooked together.  It is going into the Christmas return pile if I can find the box among the recyclables.,1.0
"This is the first review I've ever written because I feel so strongly about how useless this toy is.  I am a very careful shopper and typically do not buy things I haven't reviewed.  But this was a gift and I'm glad to hear that I am in the majority who feel this toy is poorly constructed.  I thought I must be doing something wrong.  My two year old has very little interest in this toy because it barely squeaks out a note and when it fills with water, it won't make any sound at all.  My kids love music so I thought they'd enjoy this but trust me, it is a total waste of money!",1.0
"Horrible toy.  Difficult even for a grown-up to get it to ""make music"", let alone a kid.  Don't waste your money.",1.0
I actually found these at home goods for [...]...well I am glad I did not pay more than [...]... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up..they didn't match their tubes...When I mean they didn't match...they put in whacky colors like red/orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube (no yellow dolphin) then we got two of the same colored dolphins.  Okay..so the colors weren't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins wouldn't whistle...that's totally useless...and as someone else mentioned the links don't stay linked. HUGE disappointment!,1.0
"If your just looking for something to float in the tub, then these dolphins will do it.  But if you're actually thinking that you can get some musical value out of them, forget it.",1.0
Gave cards to my uncle in KY for Christmas; the quality was very poor. They were like paper cards. Tore up the first time they were used. Other sets w/plastic coating last much longer...don't waste your money on this set of Rook cards.,1.0
"These are NOT what I ordered for my OCD father, who wanted the big picture of the rock on the back.  We already have two of these and it takes him a r",1.0
I was very disappointed to get these cards.  They are smaller than regular playing cards.  My family plays a game that requires five decks of Rook cards.  These are too small -- you can't shuffle them lwith the other Rook cards.  Ruins the game.  Where can one find the regular size?  And still stay with the old design.  The new design is terrible.,1.0
"I purchased this deck of cards for a fairly high price of $17 and received the item in a fair amount of time. However things went downhill form there. Firstly the image that is shown does not represent the product and the actual box and cards sport a much more child oriented theme.

The main issue was when we started playing. After 3 days of playing we noticed one of the cards was beginning to peel away from itself. We became concerned and made sure we wouldn't damage it any further. This was until we found 6 more cards like this. It was infuriating! For $17 we got a deck of cards that were not even laminated. This would be fine if they lasted longer than a few days! My anger is beyond words because we now live in a world where most products are ""buy me cheap, watch me break and buy me again and again"". Oh and I'm totally ignoring the fact that I've seen better craftsmanship in a $3 deck.

In short, don't waste your time with this product and purchase a Hasbro deck (cannot confirm it's not as atrocious as this one) or make your own. Just never ever get this product.",1.0
Fun game but this set is terrible quality! Cards are thin and some of ours were not printed on so we don't know which cards they are suppose to be and what we are missing. The directions have a ton of spelling errors too.,1.0
Very poor quality,1.0
"I wish I had read the reviews... This is definitely a knock off -- I received a set of cards with only two colors and a torn box. The directions had multiple typos and were half missing. My husband also noticed immediately how bad the cards smell. I would not buy from this seller again, even for such a cheap item.",1.0
"My daughters are 6 and 9.  They only played with it a day, before they grew so frustrated at the obnoxious Barbie voice, that they no longer play with it.  The toy is very demanding (ie. you have to push the right button at the right time or else it shuts off)  They quickly tired of the inflexibility this toy offers.  I really wish I had bought them a simple cash register that alows them to lead the way.  Instead, this cash register seems to be constantly barking orders at the kids.  They do not play with it at all.",1.0
"I thought this toy would be a great, reliable toy for the 20-25 dollars it sells for, but the reviews are all correct, doesn't play notes reliably, won't play them when there's water in the dolphins and they don't stay linked together.  It's very frustrating for the kids :(",1.0
"This toy takes up a ton of space and DOESN'T WORK!!! Rings DO NOT link together, they fall apart if the kids move at all which kids tend to do in tubs and they DO NOT make music. I managed to get a few of the dolphins to make tiny squeaks that you could barely hear with the kids moving around. I'm going to try and return it.",1.0
"These are just terrible.  They don't work well at all.  We finally started blowing through them--clears out the water and you actually hear some sounds.  I haven't tossed this yet only because it is holding up really well, but I should.  They aren't fun, take up too much space, and don't work right at all.  They do seem durable.",1.0
"I have never written a review about anything, but I am so shocked over how pathetic this toy performed I had to see if it was just me. Then I saw all these other reviews. My son got it as a gift and I was very excited to  try it with him tonight in his bath. 2 or 3 dolphins made a pathetic whistle about 90% of the time. The others I couldn't even get to make a  peep- and you knock them underwater just trying. I couldn't even get the rings to stay together in a circle OUT of the tub! Everything the other reviewers said is true. I'm going to dry it out and try to return it anywhere they sell it for some other bath toy.
What a sin, because it really looked like a great idea and I thought it was a GREAT gift. SHAME on Tomy for selling this. You can't tell me they tested this and thought it was suitable for sale? There is just no way. I was hoping I was a big spaz and I was missing something on how it worked... but we can't all be that ""special""!!! There weren't even any instructions , so what could I have missed?

Honestly I am so shocked, I have never seen such a DUD toy.",1.0
"I bought these for my grandparents who have been playing Rook for years and this particular set bent easily the first use and were pealing by the end of the second use. The previous set my grandparents had for 10+ years and the new set they bought elsewhere are not having this issue.  I was extremely disappointed.

The backs of the cards also had a different design than shown in the picture.",1.0
"I bought this product as part of a larger order I placed for some games for family game night.  My wife and I had always enjoyed Rook, but never owned our own good, new deck.  This set sounded nice with it's ""Deluxe"" packaging and inclusion of a ""score sheet"".  There's nothing deluxe about it.  The score sheet makes no sense for the way we and most others we know have always played and scored and the cards are absolute crap.  First game and they are already coming apart at the edges.  My first shipment of this game didn't even include the cards in the package!  I had to be sent a second game just to get the cards.  Save yourself the headache and money and go to Walmart and pick up a cheap and probably better made deck and keep score on a piece of scrap paper.  Two thumbs way down on this product!!",1.0
"My children received this for Christmas and, while it is very cute and colorful, it does not work.  We first tried in their bubble bath and thought that maybe the suds were causing a disruption with the sounds.  We gave it another try in a second bath with no suds and, while it worked a bit better, it was not a significant improvement.  I would not recommend this at all.  Even if it did work well, storing it would be a nightmare for us because we have little room in our bathroom as it is and this has many pieces to store.",1.0
"I cannot imagine how this toy even got on the market let alone become featured in so many catalogs and toy stores.  It just doesn't work.  I can barely get a faint whistle out of the dolphins and even though I have been able to link up all the floats, so what... it's not even remotely interesting to a baby let alone a toddler.  My son has had no interest in it and neither did I.. and it takes up a lot of space in the tub toy department... a cup and funnel are more fun!",1.0
"Significantly flawed design -- dolphins take on water easily &
no long make the whistling sound.  Save your money and just buy a standard inexpensive floating toy.",1.0
"This is a toy we gave our 16 month grand daughter who LOVES her bath time. What a total waste of money ... The product review by TOMY indicated something that would be stimulating and lend a happy experience to bath time. NO musical sounds were produced by the dolphins, the little tubes did not stay hooked together, and once she removed the dolphins they all sunk. There was no educational merit to this toy at all. SAVE YOUR MONEY",1.0
"These dolphins are fun to blow through with your mouth, but they work POORLY in the water.  They work better when the water has been drained out of them before placing them in their innertubes in the water.  But seeing as they are water toys, it doesn't make much sense to do! My boys were 2 and 5 when we got them as a gift.  They are now 4 and 7 and still don't like them. I just gave them to Goodwill.",1.0
"This toy was poorly made, didn't hold together well in the tub and it was almost impossible to may the musical notes. The seller was not very helpful about return/refund. I won't buy from Amazon ""partner"" sellers in the future - more like a flea market than a retailer.",1.0
"My [..] daughter received this as a gift. I was excited to hear the fun musical tones it was supposed to produce. But we are lucky to get even the faintest whistle out of them. I have no idea why they called it a symphony. I feel this is very misleading. Also, the rings don't stay together which is frustrating for me and my child. I have no idea how they took that promo photograph with all of the rings staying together. That poor child in the tub must have been sitting there for hours! Brrr.. I also have a hard time teaching colors with this toy because the dolphins are ""Kind-of orange"" ""Kind-of purple"". So overall I wouldn't recommend this toy.",1.0
"I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. The box had been opened at the store, but all pieces were inside except directions if there are any to begin with. I thought it was broken. I was expecting some kind if electronic tone to come from the dolphins. I put it in water...still nothing until I came to read some reviews which said that the ""musical"" elkement of this toy is a slight whistle as the dolphins heads are tapped down into the water. Barely audible, too complicated for a 2 year old to understand the perfect amount of water and head tapping pressure needed to produce the slight whistle sound. Buy it for the colors and imaginative play...not the musical aspect as there isn't one.",1.0
"Ordered these thinking they were the genuine article, but they were clearly fakes.  Multiple spelling errors in the directions.  Cards were very poor quality (faded colors, random dots on the back, etc).  Contacted Amazon since I purchased them using Amazon Prime and was promptly issued a refund.  I used that money and went to Walmart and bought the real thing for $1.50 less than I spent on these crappy cards.",1.0
Bad toy.  Rings do not stay together.  Ducks are always getting water inside and will not make sounds.  Don't recommend.  My 3 yr. old gets very frustrated.,1.0
"Great idea - horrible design.  The rings break apart at the slightest disturbance of the water.  The sound that comes out (if any) is barely audible.  Extremely disappointing and frustrating.  Overall, a total piece of junk.",1.0
"It's hard to imagine how a toy like this remains on the market.  I won't go into detail here because I'd just be echoing the many complaints that have already been written.  I'm just stunned that such a completely dreadful, useless waste of money continues to sell.",1.0
"I am totally unhappy with this toy, the rings do not stay together, there is no music at all it was a complete waste of money and I would NOT recommend it to ANYONE.",1.0
"Its a great toy in theory but it doesn't work. The chains do not stay link at all. I tried until I became frustrated. My son had no patience for it. They also tip over and the sounds are hard to hear. He got the most use out of it by sucking on the dolphins. I would not recommend this toy, it just doesn't work the way the manufacturer says.",1.0
Toy doesn't make sound very easy.  It is hard to hear.,1.0
"My daughter has just started to play in the tub.  This was purchased for her first birthday.  She gets very frustrated with it because they do not stay together as shown in the picture when you play with them, the sounds are all very similar and the colors of the dolphin and their tubes do not match.  She likes to have them in the correct color tubes and the red dolphin and its tube colors are way off, the red tube matches the orange dolphin, the orange dolphin matches the yellow tube and the green and turquoise dolphin tubes do not match as well.  This is very frustrating for a young toddler who is trying to match and learn colors.",1.0
"This toy plays music by forcing air through the dolphin when it is tapped.  I thought this was battery opererated and that the music was going to be strong and clear, but it is not.  The sound that is released, if at all, is almost inaudible.  This is still a fun tub toy.  My girls aged 2 and 4 years still like to match the colors and make them swim.  It is not however, very musical or educational.  I would have returned it if I had paid more than $11.99 for it.",1.0
"If you want a bunch of useless plastic junk to float in the tub then this is the toy for you.

The dolphins are supposed to play a note when you tap them on the head.  They really don't.  The sounds, when actually there, are barely audible whistley whispers...certainly not distinct enough to tell apart from one another.  Once the toys are filled with water they make no noise at all.

Another annoyance is the lack of matching colors.  The dolphins and the rings are not the same...so even if you get the numbered rings in order, you can't easily put the dolphins where they're supposed to be in the ""scale.""

Over all, a complete waste of money.",1.0
"We found that only a child 5 or older can gently and swiftly rap on the dolphin's head to make a note.  Younger children always push the dolphin down too far, too slowly to get any sound.  After one dip in the water the dolphin is no longer musical, unless mom or dad shakes the water out!

The connecting rings are frustrating - overall I grew tired of picking up so many pieces of a toy that was nothing more than a few shapes to play with in the water.",1.0
"I do not think this toy was tested before they decided to produce it. It does not work as described and my child found it very frustrating. The rings do not stay together in the water. A slight jiggle and they come apart. The sounds are soft and I would not describe them as musical. It's as if someone invented this toy with no knowledge or even observation of how children in this age range play. The description sounds fabulous, but does not ring true for even one minute of play time.",1.0
"Item is clearly not authentic. First thing that gets your attention is the instruction card is in chinese and english. The chinese portion was facing out when the cards were removed from the box. The UPC on the box is not registered to Mattel nor does the box indicate any form of copyright for Mattel. There are glaring typos in the instructions as well.
  There is an authentic game being sold, this is not it. The items under this listing, containing this UPC, are not authentic.",1.0
"I agree with the other review. However, I would not call the description tricky, I would call it outright deceitful. How does a person read the description as anything but that you are getting 8 decks of UNO, when they actually list the price per deck in addition to the total price.",1.0
"My son recieved this toy as a birthday present. Looking at the box, it seemed like a really cute toy that played music in the bathtub. However, when we tried it out, it was not what we expected. You have to push on the dolphin's body rather hard to get it to play a ""note,"" and the rings detach from each other quite easily. My son was more interested in the other toys in the tub, and basically ignored this toy all together.",1.0
"This toy is nothing but clutter !  It is so difficult to store - there are at least 20 pieces - the toy does not stay together in the tub - the ring breaks apart easily and the worst part is that the whistles never work !!  Also water/soap can stay inside the dolphins if not washed out and dryed right away !

My little girl (18 Months) picked this toy out herself and boy what a bummer once we put it in the tub !!! Don't waste your money !",1.0
I was very disappointed with this toy.  When it was put in the tub the dolphins do not make sounds like they are suppose to.  The floats do not stay together and this makes my 20 mos. old very upset.  They look good and are cute but not worth the money.  Would not recommend.,1.0
"I bought this toy for my kids thinking that the music would be great but this toy does not make music at all.  One would really have to strech the definition of ""music"".  I was disappointed because the box makes it looks like it would be a great toy.  My son got very irritated at the rings not staying connected.  I returned the toy.",1.0
This is obviously a fake.  The cards are not made of card material and it is impossible to shuffle them.  The edges of the cards are brittle and breaking right out of the package!  Awful!!!  Do not purchase.,1.0
"finally opened these 6 months later to play with grandchildren...cards are flimsy, defective, smeared ink, some ripped feels like a ""knock off"" to me! very disappointed second item recently received that was seemingly NOT genuine article.",1.0
"A register is a great idea, but this one is too regimented. Playing should be fun and allow a child to use their imagination.  My five year old likes the microphone and playing with the money, but it won't let you play with it like a calculator. It took me a long time with the instructions to figure out how to use it, I hope they don't get lost. Perhaps when she is older, much older, she'll enjoy it. Another bad feature is that it  sometimes does not turn off and drains the batteries. Keep it simple! This was a waste!",1.0
"I got this as a gift for my 1 year old. The rings don't stay together when you tap the dolphins on the head....but more importantly, to get the dolphins to make a half way audible sound you have to put far more water in the tub than is safe for a toddler. It is far too dangerous to fill the tub to that level just to get a  couple of high pitched whistles out of a few  plastic dolphins. SOOOO not worth it~",1.0
"It's hard to get sounds out of this toy -- you have to hit them pretty hard to get a very short whistle (as the water is forced in and forces air out), so it's frustrating and not much fun for my daughter (12 months old). They take up a lot of room in the tub, and are always coming apart -- the rings don't stay linked, and the dolphins fall out of their rings. Buy something else.",1.0
"I was also happy when receiving this as a gift.  However, it takes up too much room and they don't stay connected.  If you have to use your tub for other than your child for bathtime, then it's fine.  If others need it to shower, it's lots of bulky pieces to find places for when not in use.  Get a BIG bucket or something. It's just more trouble than worth.",1.0
"The worst!!!  The dolphins make either NO sounds at all, or a BARELY audible whistle when you tap them as instructed.  Plus, tapping or touching them at all makes the innertubes come unhooked from each other.  If you just want colorful dolphins resting on innertubes, this toy is fine.  But then it should be called that, and not ""Water Symphony.""  A huge disappointment!!",1.0
Do not buy this product. It is a foreign knock off!  Wish I could give it to zero.,1.0
This is the most disappointing deck of uno! First let me just say it's not as the picture shows but it gets better! The deck of uno I received had 2 deck all of the same 2 colors blue and green with a couple of plain wild cards?!!!! Upset!!! Who plays with only green and blue cards!!! Not a pleased customer!,1.0
What a disappointment this toy is!  It doesn't really scan you have to slide the card thru.  It seems durable but it is not used that much.  The main thing my kids use on this toy is the microphone which does amplify your voice.  My advice talk your kids into something else (wish I did).,1.0
The dolphins do not really make a very good sound.  When they get too wet they don't play at all.  I would not recommend this toy at all.  It's cheap and doesn't perform.  Sorry....,1.0
"I was so excited when I first saw this toy for my 15 month old who loves music.  When we first used it, I was disappointed to find out it doesn't make music or stay together.  The good thing about it, my daughter loves the little dolphins and since the rings don't stay together I can put just a few in the tub and not have too much bath clutter.  It is not worth it though.  There are other options that would be a lot more fun.  Don't waste your money!",1.0
"This toy was given to our 18-month-old son by a music teacher with great intentions. However, the noises produced by the dolphins are squeaks at best and only audible when hit hard (which my little one isn't quite up to doing). Also, the ""ring"" of dolphins doesn't stay hooked even without whacking dolphins, so pretty soon there are 16 pieces of colored plastic cluttering up the tub. Definitely not worth buying.",1.0
"Unfortunately, this toy isn't as fun as it looks!  It's a lot of work to put it all together every single time your baby takes a bath, it takes up a lot of room and falls apart pretty easily.  Additionally, it doesn't make ""music"", rather it just whistles a little...if you're lucky!!  Sorry...thumbs down for me.",1.0
"What a waste of money.  Cute, I'll give them that, but useful?  Only in taking up space in the tub basket.  The first thing my 3 year old daughter said when we first TRIED to use them  was, ""Mama?  How come they don't sing?""  I think I've lost the feeling in my fingertips trying to make the buggers make anything but a plastic thugging sound.  From time to time, when the tide is high and the moon is low, my daughter can get something that may qualify as a musical note out of them.  But all in all?  A huge letdown for the whole family.  I was so excited to have the kids have music during bathtime...guess i'll keep searching.  Or take up singing??  Hope not!",1.0
"I have never been this disappointed in a toy. EVER! If you are considering getting this, don't bother. It's not even worth the seemingly 'good deal' of a premise for $12.00.  As noted by other customers, the rings don't stay together well. One tap and poof, the rings come apart and all float away, making it hard to keep track of the notes. Secondly, 'music' from the dolphins sound like a whistle from an amastha sufferer. A MUFLE!  One can HARDLY make this toy sound like music, let alone a symphony!!!  After the bath, I threw the whole thing right in the TRASH!  TOMY should be ashamed for creating such a disgrace of a toy.  It is incredible the company is allowed to sell this toy and rip off so many others.  Beware! Don't get trapped, too.",1.0
The deck just came in for me and it came as the UNO with Customizable Wild Cards. Very disappointing. The title of the deck says ORIGINAL UNO Cards. The pictures even show the original UNO cards. Refunding my order. If you are looking for the ORIGINAL UNO Cards do not buy it here.,1.0
"With minimal effort, this toy could be useful and fun, but as is, it is neither.  The rings in which the dolphins sit do not hook together easily, nor do they stay together once hooked.  The dolphins definitely don't play music by ""tapping"" on the dolphins.  Neither my 4 YO or 2 YO like the toy - a terrfic waste of money.  This was the last TOMY toy in this house.",1.0
"This is just another plastic toy that can go in the tub. You have to smack the heck out of the dolphins in order to even hear a peep of a whistle, and it's scarcely enough to make a song.  And when you smack them that hard, the rings all come apart!  They're fine for just floating in the water, but this should not be billed a ""water symphony"" whatsoever. Very disappointed.",1.0
"We bought this toy when my son was 12 months old with the high hopes that it would be lots of fun in the tub and add some new interest in our bath routine.  Unfortunately, despite my childs interest in music, his extremely good fine motor skills and his general interest in new things, he could never make the toy work (even now at 20 months old). Each ring is very hard to snap together.  Each dolphin is extremely hard to make whistle.  The only thing this toy is good for is color matching.  Even then, your child would need to be atleast 2 to enjoy that benefit since, the colors are ""shades"" of, and not primaries.
I do not recommend the purchase of this toy.",1.0
"It is nearly impossible to get this toy to work properly. After several frustrating attempts my 5 yr old asked me to just throw it away. I was determined to get it to work, so I discovered that if you blow the water out of each dolphin, you can get it to work ONCE. Then you have to repeat the process again. A waste of money!!!",1.0
"Biggest waste of cash. Looks like such a great toy, but I hate it. I may take someone else's review advice and teach colors with it, but it takes up way too much space. I'll hang onto it in the hopes that maybe as my 14 month old gets older, we can play nicer with it, but this is definitely not a baby toy and I'm suspecting it's a lousy toddler toy too. I am so glad my family didn't waste their money on this, it's bad enough my husband and I did! Should have read the reviews!!! We usually know better! More specifically.... The dolphins are tricky, some make sound some don't, the dolphins do not stay in the rings, the rings do not stay hooked together. My son likes to bang the rings around but could care less about the water-logged drowning dolphins.",1.0
These look really cute and fun in the box but once you get them in the tub they are useless.  They rarely make noise and fade rather quickly.,1.0
"I bought this toy recently and was very disappointed. Not only do the dolphins not stay together so you are constantly trying to hook them up again, but they also don't make any music. They come with songs that the dolphins are supposed to play, but they just don't. I have some music in my background, so it's not me..they just don't do what they are supposed to. My 2-year old never gave them a second look.",1.0
"I can't complain about the durability of this toy.  I can't count how many times a dolphin has been dropped on the floor and not a single one has cracked.  HOWEVER...
This toy seemed like a fun idea, but it just hasn't delivered what I expected.  It is difficult to get the rings to stay together.  This makes playing a song pretty impossible.  However, if the rings did all stay together the circle they create is way too large for an average-sized tub. Also making it impossible to play a song is the fact that once the dolphins fill with water, they no longer play their notes.  This problem can be solved by blowing into the bottom of the dolphin (nice image, huh?) to expel the water--which my son finds is the best and funniest part of the toy.  This excess water issue is a huge design flaw given that this is a BATHTUB toy, which to me means water is involved.
I do have to give a star for this toy's educational value.  It can be used to teach colors.  Although I would not use both the dolphins and the rings together to work on learning colors.  The rings and dolphins are made of different types of plastic, making them different shades of each color.  For example, the purple dolphin's ring is not exactly the same purple as the purple dolphin.  This is the case for every color used in this toy.  This could lead to confusion if trying to match which dolphin goes with which ring.
I am pretty disappointed with this toy.  My son loves music, so this seemed to be the perfect tub toy for him.  We hardly ever use this toy due to a serious lack of toddler interest.",1.0
"I was disappointed with the quality. The exterior was tin, which looked durable, but once you open it, you get plastic balls that don't hold well in the holes. The  balls are too light, so they're constantly being knocked over when you make a move. And, like another reviewer noted, maybe it would help if the holes were bigger so that the ball could sit more securely. I remember when I was young, about 30 years ago, we used marbles. I think the weight of the marbles just sit better.",1.0
My daughter received this gift for her first birthday.  I was very excited because her bathtime entertainment had become pretty dull ... I should have stuck to plastic cups.  The dolphins DO NOT sing ... you can barely get a noise out of them.  Mostly she played with the rings that the dolphins floated in and we had fun practicing our colors.  Too many pieces ... took up all the space in my bath net/basket ... I quickly phased this out and dolphins made their way into the trash.  Avoid this toy.,1.0
"I bought this for my little girls's first birthday. I should have read the other reviews before buying. I only paid ten dollars and thank goodness for that. Like the other reviewers have said, this product falls apart easily and it is difficult, at best, to get it to play music. Good news is i learned an important lesson....Always read reviews first.",1.0
"MY DAUGHTER LOVES BEING IN THE BATH TUB, SO I SET OUT TO BUY HER INTERESTING AND EDUCATIONAL TOYS.  BROUGHT HOME THE SYMPHONY FOR CHRISTMAS, WAS VERY EXCITED.
SET IT ALL UP, PUT HER IN THE TUB.  WELL WE PUSHED IT, NO SOUNDS AND IT KEPT COMING APART.  YOU HAVE TO TOUCH IT GENTLY AND EVEN AT THAT THERE IS VERY LITTLE SOUND.  PLUS HAVING TO CONSTANTLY PUT IT BACK TOGETHER EVERY TIME WE TOUCHED IT MADE BATH TIME LESS EXCITING.
PLEASE DON'T BUY IT, EVEN AT $20 YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH AN EMPTY SHAMPOO BOTTLE TO PLAY WITH OR THE GOOD OLD RUBBER DUCKIE.
MY DAUGHTER WAS 18 MTHS OLD WHEN I PURCHASED IT.
GOOD LUCK",1.0
"I am FURIOUS!!! This toy [is bad]! .... The  floats do not stay together in a ring (the slightest pressure breaks them apart) and the dolphins make hardly any noise - let alone musical ""notes"". At least none discernable to the human ear. In fact, one of them makes no noise at all.  My little girl was so frustrated, she cried through her entire bath tonight. ...",1.0
"As soon as this toy gets any water in it, it does not make music. I spend most of my time blowing water out of the dolphins so my son can get a whistle or two.  It is very difficult to link the rings together.  They do not fit tight and forget making a circle!  As soon as I get one on another comes off!  My son does like the dolphins and plays with them but when it comes to making music, this toy is terrible. Not worth the cost.",1.0
"The Float Ring is so poorly designed it will not stay together when carefully lifted or carried to the tub by an adult.  How does the manufacturer expect children to play with this toy wihout frustration?
I can't comment on durability since I took it back the next day.
There are better toys.  Pass this one by.",1.0
They were a bad photo copy version of the real deal.,1.0
I was completely disappointed with this bath toy.  I waited almost 1 1/2 years for this to go on sale and it finally did.  I was so excited to give it to my daughter to make her bath time that much more fun.  Music?  What music.  Plays tunes?  What tunes.  Lame Lame lame.  Not even worth buying on sale.,1.0
"I really thought this was a cute idea, but as another reviewer noted, you have to hit the dolphins ""just right"" to get the tone, and even then it is not very loud.  They don't stay hooked together well, they are bulky and take up lots of space.  I got these when my son was 18 months old and he quickly got bored with them and has never had much interest in playing with them.  I think it was a total waste of money.",1.0
"This is a BIG waste of money.  The rings do not stay locked together and it is very hard to get the dolphins to ""sing.""  If you are looking for some additional plastic items to throw in the tube go for it, but if you are looking for something for your child to do in the bath - look elsewhere!",1.0
"This is NOT the original UNO.  This is a cheap knock off and not worth the cost or even  free shipping to obtain.  There are numerous grammatical and misspelled words on the box and in the directions.  The cards are of poor quality with washed out colors (spelled colours...lol) and have pictures instead of the words ""Draw Two"", ""Reverse"", ""Skip"", ""Wild Card"", etc.  This is the illiterate version of the game UNO.  Don't waste your money.",1.0
"Don't waste your money.  These cards are made with such poor quality paper, you cannot even separate them in your hand.  We were so looking forward to an Uno game on Christmas, but quit after about five minutes, because it was just too frustrating.",1.0

"This is a piece of junk. If I could give this a ""0 stars"" rating, I would. It is shameful to even waste trash bin space on this one. Seriously. Yes, it really IS that bad.

1) Chinese Checkers: The board size -- at 11-1/2 inches diameter -- is ridiculously small, which renders it frustrating to all parties of all ages who attempt to play. It is next-to-impossible for even the most adroit and nimble-fingered adult to play. And even our children at ages 6 and 7, with their teeny tiny fingers, cannot move one ball one space anywhere on the board without disrupting at least a dozen other balls and sending them scattering to the four corners of the Earth. And believe me, this has nothing to do with motor skills or eye-hand coordination!

2) Chinese Checkers: This set does NOT utilize real glass marbles which look aesthetically pleasing in their soft pearlized hues and feel pleasantly organic to the touch. Oh no. Rather this set comes with cheap, pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" in obnoxious primary colors. The pathetic plasticness of these ""balls"" renders them utterly useless for anything other than annoyingly rolling to the four corners of the Earth -- at every touch, turn, hiccup, and/or breath!

3) Chinese Checkers: The holes are not set deep enough into the board; therefore, the pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" proceed to roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth every time someone even minimally touches the playing table, board, or any marble on the board. In fact, if anyone even closes a door in the house, turns on the radio, or a car backfires in the street, all of the pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" on the board WILL indeed roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth.

4) Checkers: First, the checkers are about the size of Sweet Tarts and trying to play the game on a board this small will nearly drive you mad. Second, the checkers will not stack and stay put when it comes time to ""king"" someone. Third, there is something about the sound of plastic checkers banging down in repeated movements on a tin board that is akin to nails on a chalkboard in the realm of one's auditory sense. And last but certainly not least, similar to the Chinese Checkers side of this maddening duo, if you can move your checkers on this eensy board without disrupting every other checker on the board and sending them sliding toward the four corners of the Earth, well, you have some mad playing skills that no one who has entered our home of any age, gender, race or religion -- be it man, woman or child -- can master!

5) Storage: The pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" and maddeningly unstackable checkers cannot be sandwiched for storage inside of this two-sided tin (even though this is touted as a ""feature"" of the product) when/if kept in the nylon netted bags in which they come. We had to separate ""balls"" and checkers out into several ziploc baggies in order to spread them out in a ""thin enough"" layer to actually get the tin to stay sandwiched closed. So essentially, we had to repackage all the playing pieces immediately in order to simply get the tin to stay closed for storage in between play sessions.

Bottom Line: This set is ill-conceived and poorly executed on so many different levels it's appalling. ""Cheap junk"" is the best thing I can say about it. My mother bought it locally for twice the price it is here on Amazon as a Valentine's gift for our children. Within three days, they were frustrated beyond measure, and my husband and I went online looking for something better.

For a good quality, aesthetically pleasing, useable, properly-sized Chinese Checkers set at a reasonable price, please consider the **15"" JUMBO CHINESE CHECKERS WITH MARBLES BY CHH** here on Amazon. It has a lovely, solid wood board with deeply drilled holes and real glass marbles in gorgeous pearlized colors... feels great to the finger, sounds right to the ear, looks much nicer in person than it does online. It has been worth every penny, complimented highly, and well received by all who have played.

"This version of Chinese Checkers has many flaws: 1) The board is too small, which makes it hard to pick up the pieces; 2) the pieces are plastic! 3) the metal is too thin, so part of mine was puckered downward; 4) because the pieces are plastic, they are LIGHT, and if you happen to bump the board they roll out of their positions (the indentations are quite shallow). Overall, unacceptable.",1.0
The pieces are way too small.  Nearly impossible for adult hands to pick up and move.  Holes in board are too shallow and pieces are too light.  The slightest bump sends everything flying.  The drawstring clamp just broke as well.,1.0

I thought this would be a great present for my little one. What child doesn't like to bang on things--and if it makes sound that's all the better! But I was rather disappointed with how this is constructed. It seems almost too large for little hands. The on/off switch is on the part you hang onto so it get's turned off by accident a lot. The large end that's supposed to be used for wacking things is stuffed but has a hard center and hard plastic at the base where it connects to the handle. Not too good if someone get's wacked in play because it can hurt! I know people aren't the object of what your supposed to be wacking but tell that to the infant.,1.0

"JUNK! We received this as a gift for Christmas and I had the same experience that many other users have had. They have omitted the wing nut from the kit which the instructions show, and consequently you cannot get the stopper tight enough.

The fuel delivery system is poorly designed and we could not get the rubber stopper to tighten (needed to build up pressure in the bottle) thus decreasing launch time to 2 seconds. Not hardly enough time for us to get out of the way. The first launch sprayed baking soda and vinegar all over my son and me as it lifted off. I'm not idiot and do many chemical reaction demos for my science classes, but I could not get this kit to work properly, mainly the most important aspect, the fuel system.

"Absolute utter Chinese crap.

Remember when we were growing up and toys were built to last?  Remember when a scientific toy actually taught scientific principals?

My kids have received numerous gifts under the name of Scientific American over the years, and each one lasted under a day before it broke.
Add the ""Meteor Rocket"" to that list.

This terribly manufactured toy takes an hour to build and 30 seconds to destroy.  If you are considering buying this for your little ones, know that they will need a sharp utility knife (not supplied), scissors (not supplied), tape (not supplied), a ruler (not supplied), baking soda (not supplied), vinegar (not supplied), and plenty of patients.

Also not supplied is a discussion of the chemical reaction taking place that produces the gas.

Once you manage to cut the balsa wood fins and attach them to the rocket, it's time to head out to a field and try this puppy out.

Unfortunately, the pressurization system is as crappy as the materials.  It is a rubber stopper with a screw attachment that is SUPPOSED to keep the stopper in the mouth of the bottle.  The idea is that a tube stuck on the end of the stopper is supposed to keep the vinegar and baking soda from reacting while you tightening the stopper.

The reality is that it's really difficult to keep the rocket on its side while you carefully place the tube inside without spilling a single grain of soda.  If even a bit reacts, you will NOT be able to get the stopper to stay in.  The tightening mechanism does not work.

The only way we got a ""flight"" was to mix the chemicals and push the stopper in as hard as we could, allowing the rocket to launch while holding the stopper.  The result of course of a shirt covered with vinegar and baking soda.

And once the bottle opening becomes wet, it is impossible to create a good seal with the stopper.

A MUCH BETTER and virtually FREE chemical rocket can be found on the Steve Spangler website.  It uses things you have in your house to build the rocket.  The only thing you'll need to buy is a rubber stopper.  Plus, the site actually talks about the reaction that's happening.",1.0

"15 to 20 bucks seems a bit high for a few pieces of tape, balsa and a pop bottle. (But aren't most ""science"" kits expensive for what you really get?)  The only unique part was the molded plastic fin holder - tape it around the bottle and slide the fins into place with perfect spacing and alignment.

The parts were only durable enough for a few demonstration flights and then the rocket needed some first aid (bring duct tape for the balsa wood fins and paper towels to dry the fuel tube before refilling).

I found the launch instructions lacking in safety warnings.  In five launches we had one kid hit in the face by the rocket almost immediately after setting it on the ground and a second hit with the stopper that shot out prematurely as the rocket was being set on the ground.  Maybe we didn't get the stopper tight enough - who knows?  In hindsight this toy makes a better cork gun than a rocket.",1.0
It is impossible to secure the cork to the bottle. After 3 tries it went straight to the trash can.,1.0
"I purchased 2 of these and would love to be able to write a review on the product but can't since i NEVER RECEIVED IT!  It says sold by ""MindWare"" so I'm not sure if they were at fault or amazon, or both but I ordered this product for 2 ten year old boys to receive at my family Christmas a week and a half before the event, making sure to select a shipping method that ensured the delivery in plenty of time.  That Thursday night (with the party following that saturday), I checked, for the 4th day in a row, my Amazon account to see when It was going to arrive.  Up until that day the order had went through normal steps and appeared to be getting prepared for shipment.  Every day before, the 5 items and had my total: shipping, tax and product price that it had charged to my card a week before had been right there totaled up just as it was the day I ordered.  Thursday night when I checked, the 2 rockets were just gone.  It didn't say it had been canceled, it was just like I had never ordered it in the first place.  The other 3 items showed up as shipped, which i actually had received at the beginning of the week, and was totaled for shipping of those 3 items plus tax, with no trace what so ever of the 2 rockets.  I began to contact customer support when it occurred to me to check my email, thinking maybe they had contacted me. Sure enough they did.  There was an email, sent that same day (thursday, a week after ordering and being charged for it) a little after 1pm telling me my order had been canceled because the product was out of stock.  I did get my money refunded to the card but I was left with no gift, and had to run out and get a last minute thing.  I have no idea why the product would have all of a sudden become unavailable when it WAS IN STOCK when I ordered it according to Amazon.  I also have no idea why they would wait a week to tell some one who obviously needed the product by a certain date, otherwise would not have selected a faster shipment method.  On top of that, why would they not contact me and ask if I wanted to wait on them to get some more instead of just canceling my order and sending an email that they had done so.  It is listed as in stock right now.  Does that mean they have already got another shipment in since 5 days ago or are they just trying to ruin some one else's attempt at Christmas shopping?",1.0
"My 7 year old was excited about this gift, but it doesn't work. The stopper does not form a tight seal and as soon as I turn the rocket to mix the baking soda with the vinegar, the stopper flies off from the slight pressure build-up. Pretty dangerous if you happen to be in the way. We tried 3 times with the same results.  Also, the instructions are also printed out of order, but it wasn't too much of a problem to figure out. Very disappointed that we wasted 1 hour and $20 on this product. It has the potential to be really fun.",1.0
"Poorly designed product.  As many reviewers stated, the rubber stopper will not form a tight seal.  This prevents the whole ""rocket"" function for which the toy is intended.  You're left with a soda bottle and a few pieces of balsa wood (that is literally what you're purchasing).",1.0
"I bought this rocket for my son to be a toy to help him move on to bigger better rockets. Plus give him some ideas about science. It did neither. I couldn't even get it to work. It is horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone.
It is awful. the directions are lousy and the outcome of the rocket is even worse. It did nothing but sit there. I will never oreder this item again.",1.0
We bought this at Barnes & Noble assuming that it would be a good educational toy. This was a horrible experience from the moment we opened the box. There were two sets of conflicting instructions...the materials are too filmsy. The worst thing is that this damn thing didn't work ..the seal did not work even after trying multiple times...am not even sure how anyone can get this to work. Imagine buying this as birthday gift for a kid who is into these kind of toys only to find that it does not work. If you go to their website they have a contact number which is not even functioning....you cannot even reach out to someone to figure out if there is a way to make use of this so called toy in any way...net -net this is a total rip off....preying on parents' psyche who wants to buy educational toys for kids. There should be some law against such scams !,1.0
"I know my review title sounds kind of petty for saying that this rocket is lame looking, but it is! Kids want an awesome looking rocket--not one that looks like a soda bottle! Please! In addition to looking like a soda bottle with fins; it was more difficult to build than most rockets. You have to cut out shapes from balsa wood and stick foil on them--which looks SO cheap once you've finished no matter how well you do it. I got into making the rocket but gave up half way through thinking it was not worth the effort, and also that having the actual explosive take off was the best part of launching a rocket--this one uses vinegar and baking soda--uuuuk!",1.0
"Ages 9+ and  the instructions start out with suggesting you use a zacto knife..???

Absolutely poor design and never flew.  The stopper would not tighten and the gas just escaped.

I now have a 9 year old that is very disappointed.

DO NOT BUY THIS.",1.0
"The kit's instructions are poorly designed, hard to follow, and do not cover the science involved with the rocket apart from a few poorly written paragraphs: Under the heading ""Rocket fuel from food"" it says ""The METOR flies for the same reasons (sic).  Mixing baking soda and vinegar causes a chemical reaction that makes carbon dioxide gas.""

The stopper design does not work well.

The kit has about $2 dollars worth of parts in it and little educational value.

This kit is to be avoided.",1.0
"The non profit organization Healthy Stuff has a website that provides chemical information about toys.  They tested this toy and found high levels of lead and bromine in the magnets and in the black board, making this toy a health hazard to children.  This also makes the toy illegal in the USA.

Yes, it is fascinating.  And like other reviewers, I've also had some fun with it myself. But I am disgusted that it broke down so easily--twice.  There must be a reason that Amazon doesn't offer new ones for sale; please think hard about buying a new one elsewhere.  Unless you don't mind looking at the $30 you'll pay as a month or two of entertainment, look to other gear toys that don't depend upon this lousy motor.",1.0

"My Grandson goes to a Gymboree class and loves the bongo drums they have. I went onto Amazon and was excited that they had apparently the exact same set of drums from Remo and ordered them. What I got was different from the picture on Amazon which shows a jungle scene with brightly-colored animals just like the design on the Gymboree drum set. But on these drums the design is more abstract. But the design is not important -- what is, is the sound. The ones at Gymboree do not sound like professional drums but they at least sound like drums. These new ones do not have almost any tympannic sound at all, You might as well hit a piece of plywood. Amazon was very nice about taking them back.",1.0
"Extremely disappointed in this product.  Brought these beanbags to bring to a homeless shelter field day games for kids and the bags were of very poor quality and old looking.  Contacted the seller to return them for a refund, but still have not received a refund when I returned the items weeks ago.",1.0
"Very poor quality in my opinion, based on the stitching came loose the first time my 2  and 3 years olds played with them. I had plastic beads all over!  Threw them away.",1.0
"Please inspect your drum carefully as soon as it arrives. I didn't realize until much later that the black strap that wraps around the top border of the drum had a very sharp edge that hung out. Very dangerous! My baby kept getting scratches on his leg, but I didn't realize it was coming from the drum until I got a very bad cut from it. The sharp corner of the strap put a huge gash in my leg that eventually turned into an ugly scar. Although Amazon eventually took it back, the process of getting a return from them was not very good because I discovered this defect outside the return window. It seemed like a pretty terrible and dangerous defect, which I thought should get a hassle-free return. Unfortunately, the feelings weren't mutual.

I really wanted to love the drum because it's otherwise a well-built instrument. I'm not sure if my drum was the only one with this major defect. But I think it's worth inspecting your drum to make sure there aren't any razor sharp edges, particularly at the edges of the black strap, that can harm your children. My child got cut and I got cut -- completely unacceptable. Something this bad really should get a recall notice.",1.0
I agree with other reviewers. These were very disappointing. Cheap material and very few beans inside. They were basically flat. If I had seen these in a store I would not have purchased them. Not at all what I had in mind. Will be returning these to get something with a little more value for the money.,1.0
I was expecting bean bags. I got bags with a few beans in them. Essentially flat bags. Could use a lot more filler.,1.0
These barely made it out of the package in our house! The chemical smell was so nasty I put them right back and returned them. Yuck!,1.0
"I was hoping someone could help me. My son got the Sea Monkey Explora sun for X-Mas and we started it last week.  I boiled water as instructed and washed the tank in hot water before filling it up. When the water cooled I added the water purifier and not only did I wait 24 hours, I waited about 2 1/2 days before adding the sea monkey eggs and stirred them as directed. All it looks like is pieces of dust and debris, little specks but we did not see any ""hatching"" occur or notice anything whatsoever happening in that tank since we added the eggs. It has been about a week now and we will add food for the first time today as instructed(feed after 1 week) and I hope to see some improvement but I do not understand why every other reviewer is raving about hatching sea monkeys and doing tricks, etc. etc. when all we see is little specks of dirt settled on the bottom of our tank. The kit has a air pump thingamajig that goes in the top of the tank and it syas to give it a a pump or two every two days for oxygen. We have done this also, and that is the only time our ""dirt specks"" seem to move around the tank when we give it a pump(obviously causing the water to rush around) so we try to get excited and wonder if those specks are the sea monkeys swimming around but a minute later, they settle back to the bottom of the tank. The water is a bit cloudy also, I do not know why since it was purified and is only 1 week old. I have them in a climate controlled room as directed, not in sunlight, I did everything as instructed and so far it looks like a piece of junk. I noticed on these reviews many people said to give them a pump of air two times a day, but my instructions said every two days! And also, another important detail-MY TANK DID NOT COME WITH A MICROSCOPE, the box has a list of all of the items/pieces included and we went over it and counted everything and all the pieces listed were there BUT THEN in the instructions it states that we should ""look into THE microscopic lens to get a better view of sea monkeys"".  WHAT MICROSCOPIC LENS? The kit did not come with one, nor did it have it listed as one of the items included in the kit on the box, but then in the instructions it tells me to use it? Also, I noticed some of you mention plasma, I didn't get any plasma either! I noticed several discrepencies in the instruction manuel that came with this kit that did not seem to make sense, even the diagram/illustration showed a tank of an entirely different shape!! This ""explora sub"" is supposedly one of the newer tanks I believe and claims to hatch colored sea monkeys but as of now we have yet to see a darn thing and are very disappointed!!",1.0
I bought two of these for Christmas and the eggs from neither pack hached. I think this is a rip-off. BEWARE!!!,1.0
"We bought these at a local bookstore, and you would think that it's a pretty straightforward toy that would be fun for a child, except that after about 6 months, nearly all the letters have come unstuck from the magnets, so now we just have a bunch of magnet squares and a bunch of wood letter blocks.",1.0

It comes in a surprising small box, about half the size of a regular board game.  The small board does not lay flat.  It comes with super lame, thin cardboard (more like somewhat thick paper) pieces that you are supposed to pop out. The print quality on the box is super low too.

Grandson loves drums but this is the first time I felt ripped off by a Amazon ad.  Also, ad did not give ages for kids.  On the large drum it is for children 5 and older.  For the smaller drum it is designed for ages 3 and older.  My little guy is only 1 but loves the drums.  Just needs to be watched.",1.0
"So disappointing. The box only comes with a net home for the butterflies and a small, flimsy, plastic pipette to feed the butterflies. Its not worth the money paid for this kit. The instructions illustrate a log where you're supposed to place the top of the jar once the pupa attach to it. The box doesnt include that log or the feeding station for the butterflies. For $20 it should include both of those things. You have to get creative and make those two things if you don't want to pay more money to buy them separately. You also have to pay $8 to have your caterpillar shipped. So this kit ends up being a total of $28 and the kit is not even worth $10. If it wasn't because my son is excited about seeing the life cycle of a butterfly, I would return this. Its not worth the money and its deceiving.",1.0
Its not a voucher if you have to pay 7.95.  I regret buying this as a gift.,1.0

The real mystery is how you're supposed to play.  There are a dozen ""time cards"" and once you've turned them up, that's it - you're done.  If you've matched some cards already, fine, you know those aren't the ones that are hidden, but for the ones you haven't had a chance to see yet (because you - by pure chance - turned up time cards first), you're just guessing.

"I've never actually written an Amazon review but I felt compelled to once I saw such glowing reviews for this game. First off, I should say that my 4-year old did like this game and it could be fun for little kids. But we like playing games as a family so I'm looking at it from that perspective. I thought this was a terrible game.

I get the co-op thing and that the point of this game is that everybody wins, but this game goes so far as to have disclaimers about how dark, even though it is the enemy, is not actually scary but is actually a wonderful time, and the obstacle cards are called good grief cards to remove all sense of badness from them. A little squeaky-clean touchy-feely for my taste.

But that's really not the problem -the problem is that the game doesn't make any sense. Anybody can defeat any obstacle at any time as long as everybody else agrees that the card can defeat the obstacle. Or you can just wait and get the right cards to defeat the obstacle, which usually happens if you just keep rolling and mindlessly flipping over cards. Maybe I just don't get why ""everybody wins all the time"" is fun. It just seems pointless and really tedious if you pretty much know what's going to happen every time you play. Again, fun for little kids - maybe. But tedium and confusion for me and my wife.

Anyhoo - just wanted to add a counter-perspective. I have sat smiling through many rounds of Pretty Pretty Princess and enjoyed myself, but I truly hope to never have to play this game again.",1.0

We received it promptly and the next day tried setting it up in the backyard. We didn't even get it set up before the a pole broke. Trying to thread the pole through the loop to stand the tent up was impossible - the pole had no bend, so it snapped.

I would love to be able to buy the battery separately.  I cannot afford to but the charger every time I purchase a battery.  I am very disappointed about this ""handcuffing"" of me the consumer.  They have the monopoly on the flexpack and are using it to force you to buy the charger since the bateries are not sold separately.  I was told that they would be about 9.99 alone.  I would buy about 8 more for extras.  What ever happened to customer service?  Please start selling the batteries seperately.",1.0

"edit: I haven't checked this review in years and it seems that this is the first review listed for this product, so I would like to clarify a few things:

1. Those are true and accurate pictures of the unit I received. The unit came this way out of the box, with no manipulation whatsoever. At no time were any buttons removed and replaced.
2. I believe, based on later reviews of the same product, that my unit was an aberrant defective unit. It seems that other people who purchased the product at a later date did not have the same problem.
3. I commend the efforts of other reviewers going out of their way to disprove my review. Claims should be vetted before they are accepted. But again, I assure you that this was not a malicious review. The unit I purchased contained incorrect mathematical equations out of the box.

Such a great idea, perfect in its simplicity, and yet executed so horribly. This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review on Amazon (I was so worked up I even took pictures and added them to the product description).

1. The tactile feel of the product sucks. The buttons should click or at least depress nicely.
2. Murky, hard to read numbers. Even when I push down all the way some numbers are still barely legible and I wonder if my daughter will be able to depress the buttons all the way.
3. Some of the math is wrong! 1 + 2 = 3? 2 + 2 = 3? This isn't exactly advanced vector calculus and it's THE ONLY THING this product is supposed to do. At least do it right. Even if the company realized the mistake after one million units were produced, they should have the pride to not ship a math product geared exclusively towards kids learning math with bad math on it.

1 star, avoid.",1.0
"I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. You are supposed to press on the button and ""magically"" the correct answer appears.

No magic here! The answers are simply underneath and as you push, the correct answers underneath are supposed to become more transparent or visible (similar to using tracing paper and placing it over something you want to trace. The closer the tracing paper is to the image you want to copy, the more clearly you can see it.) Well, neither my daughter nor I could even make out what the answers were.

They don't give a damn about making an honest living doing hard work. They use slaves to make their products and then resell them at extortion rates. Only lazy, deadbeat sociopaths would sell a battery that cost them pennies for over $55!

Don't waste yout time or energy on this poorly designed toy.

The service tech I spoke with at Tyco knew all about this problem. It appears that they rushed it to market without proper testing.

I certainly agree with the previous review.  I purchased two Tyco RC's as Christmas gifts for my children to the tune of $120.00 !!

Merry Christmas to you Mr. Mattel, I bet your kid had a battery for his Terrain Twister on Christmas morning, tell us was it as much fun as the commercial said?

I am just another one of the many unhappy customers who have purchased a Tyco R/C vehicle that needs a TMH Flexpak battery and charger. Then found out when my son opened it on Christmas Day that they are not included. Then again to discover that no store in the greater Seattle area has one to buy. I have searched many stores the past week only to end up buying one on line. Tyco should change their sales tactic and include the battery and charger with the vehicle.,1.0

After charging as the directions said, the toy worked for less than a minute before it quit working.

It really hurt our xmas when that was supposed to be his nicest gift.

"Our grandson specifically asked for this toy for Christmas, and we ordered it online from Toys 'r Us.  It amazes me that the website description wasn't specific enough to make shoppers aware that the toy wouldn't operate without this VERY EXPENSIVE battery pack.  Giving us the option of making a fully informed decision (bundling the toy with the battery pack, for example, and noting that one won't work without the other)would have been greatly appreciated, because this grandson was the only one of 5 to receive something he really wanted that was completely useless on Christmas day!

We will not purchase any other TYCO toys, because we prefer to deal with ethical companies.  Toys 'r Us might consider being more thorough in their descriptions as well - we're not likely to return something a grandchild had his heart set on, but we will be more careful in the future when we shop online at Toys 'r Us.",1.0
"I ordered online the Tyco RC Terrain Twister.  Never once did it offer to sale me the TMH Flexpak.  My son was dissapointed on Christmas day as well as the other children in the earlier reviews.

I called every toy store in my area, and none of them have this batter pack in store.  So I have to order it and wait for delivery.  Now, after calling the support # on the ""Contents/Features"" booklet, all I got was a recorded message.

Tyco can do much better by their customers.  On a products like these, the batteries should be included or at least offered at the time of purchase.  And I agree with an earlier comment above, that they should sale the batteries seperately and not make you buy a charger each time.  If the batteries run about $10 why do I have to spend an extra $20 on the charger each time.  Tyco is going to stay rich, while continuing to take us to the bank.  They should be exposed.",1.0

I finally purchased two of the terrain twisters after two years of trying to have my kids disappointed because they did not come with batteries.  I am 100 miles from the closest toys are us so it will be a few days before my kids can enjoy their gifts.

"I purchased the Tyco RC Terrain Twister for my 6-year old for Christmas.  He specifically asked for it so I bought it at Toys R Us.  I agree that the packaging is very deceptive.  I saw that it required a 9-volt battery and made sure to have those on hand.  When I opened the package on Christmas morning and my husband went to put the batteries in, he asked me where the charger (flex pack) was.  We looked all over the place thinking that it got set aside while opening the package.  Then I looked closer at the box (and you have to look CLOSE) and saw that it required the 9-volt batteries AND the flex pack.  The wording on the package is VERY deceiving!  When you are out doing Christmas shopping you don't study all the wording on packages!  So, I too had a disappointed child on Christmas day and the RC Terrain Twister is sitting under the tree unable to be used.  If I'd have known that this $60 toy was going to end up being a $95 toy, I would definitely not have purchased it.  I don't know how long it will take to find a Flex Pack as I don't recall seeing any near these Terrain Twisters at Toys R Us and why do I want to pay a shipping charge on an already overpriced item that should have been included with the toy!  I too will not be likely to buy a Tyco product in the future.  I can't even rate this product because we can't use it!",1.0

"I purchased the Terrain Twister weeks before Christmas because last year I could not get one.  The check out person at Toys r us even reccommended that I charge the battery on christmas eve so my son could use it on Christmas morning.  She never mentioned, however that I had not purchased the $35.00 battery pack.  I guess even the store that sells it was not as smart as ""Rick"", who wrote the only possitive review on this product.

He must work for Tyco!

I did inquire about batteries and we both agreed that I needed  one 9 volt.  The real problem here is that Tyco is evil enough to sell a $100.00 product for$65.00 and then sell the rechargeable battery separately.

I have many remote control products and NONE require you to buy the battery pack separately.

This is obviously a marketing scheme created by the evil Tyco empire(Mattel too)to make it seem like the product is less expensive than it really is.

In any event, my son could not use it on Christmas morning.

No more Tyco products for me, and I will tell everyone I know!

"Agree with others, this is nothing more than a scam. There is no reason to require a specialty battery pack, then not include it with the toy other than to decieve customers. Either design the toy to use some of the 100's of standard batteries available or if you must use a specialty pack because of design, include it with the toy. Nothing more than a scam, tyco should be ashamed. I for one, will not buy anything else produced by this company.",1.0
"My son received this toy as a gift.  I made sure I had the 9 voltz battery so he could play with it with his friends.

I went on line to toys r us and read the review below and realized that the BIG present my son is getting this year will not work and I have to order the battery and hope it gets here in time for Christmas.  I spent about $65 on that toy and now I am looking at another $35 for the battery...I held off on the roboraptor because it was too expensive...I wish I would have bought that now instead...I still might send this stupid toy back just on the principal that they do not inform the customer that you are paying $65 dollars for something that you really need to be spending $100 on to make it work!  How many other people out there got tricked by the lame battery info. and have really sad kids on Christmas morning...how hard would it be for the company to put Batteries NOT INCLUDED on the package. I will also never buy another RC Tyco toy!  Next time it is radio shack all the way!  Nice job Tyco!!!!! And frankly, toysrus, you should be embarrassed to carrying this product packaged this way.

First of all, it's possible that we plugged the battery in backwards into the charger, since it will fit both ways. As a degreed technical manager in an electronics field, I'll say ""bad design"". Second, since when has there been a battery charger that you can only leave in for exactly the amount of time and no more? No more Tyco for our household and for our disappointed son.",1.0

"I am very dissapointed. I brought my son the terrain twister for 2004 christmas and i am thinking okay i can get a 9 volt battery. NOT, they fail to mention on the front that it needs a rechargable battery thats 35 dollars. I paid 69 dollars for that car. I am very upset, my son still has not played with his car yet because guess what, toys r us dosent have them.  DONT BUY",1.0
I am happy to know that I am not the only parent who bought their child a Terrain Twister for Christmas and did not realize until Christmas morning that I needed a TMH Plex Pac to run it. No problem- go to Toys R Us and pick one up.  That was three weeks ago and we have been to Toys R Us 8 times.  They don't have the Flex Pac and don't know when and if they will get it.  Shame on Tyco for selling such a product without the proper battery and for not being able to fill the demand.  I might as well have given my son a broken stick for Christmas.  That would probably be more useful than a Terrain Twister which has been sitting in a corner for three weeks.,1.0
"Boy do I feel better that I was not the only Mom to purchase this toy and did not see that it needed a ""special battery"" as my son would say.  Imagine my son asking my why Santa would bring the toy, and the batteries but not the ""special battery"".  Well it is Jan 14th and we still have not found the ""special battery"" in any store, we have spend a great deal of time going from store to store.  I have to rate the toy a 1 due to the fact that we still have not found the battery.  How upset am I that to purchase it on-line not only do I have to pay $35.00 but I have to pay to have it shipped.  Thanks Tyco!",1.0
"I totally agree with a former complaint about needing this battery for the TERRAIN TWISTER ($50 toy).  In tiny writing, it says this flex-pack is not included.

"We purchased Tycos Terrain Twister for my 9 year old son at Christmas. [...] On Christmas morning my son was SO excited to open this and could not wait to try it out.  However, the $19.99 battery pack we purchased along with the Twister was NOT compatable with the Twister and we are stuck with a $20 battery that is useless. On top of the wasted money on the battery pack we scoured the local stores for the FlexPak and NO ONE had them available. It is now Jan. 7th and the Terrain Twister is still sitting in his room - unused. I found the flexpack today and ordered it- but NEVER would have purchased the Twister had I known I'd be paying $35 - PLUS SHIPPING for a BATTERY.  Amazon needs to CLEARLY state what battery needs to be purchased for the Twister and that you have to purchase the battery seperately to even use the car.  I'll never order another Tyco RC product again.",1.0
"Finding this TMH battery pack is a hassel. I bought the Tyco

Terrain Twister for my grandson which was quite a bit more than

package which was a 9.6v plus 6 AA batteries for the remote. It

was very disappointing that the TMH battery pack was not available at purchase. Two weeks after Christmas I am still

searching for this pack and my gradson is upset since it was one

of his major gifts that he asked Santa for. It should have been

more clear that the toy would not run without a TMH. And it should have been clearly displayed with the twister.",1.0
"I was one of the early shoppers who bought the terrain twister by tyco in november.  It was sold out of many stores, so I went online to make the purchase.  When making the purchase, I ordered batteries as well.  What was not indicated was that after I spent $70.00 on the toy, it would not work Christmas morning because it needed a tmh flexpack.  Why wasn't this mentionned when  I placed my order since it is essential to make the toy work?  Isn't it like buying a bicycle and having to pay extra for the wheels?  ""Why didn't Santa know about the flexpack?""  Am I really now spending over $100. on a remote-control car?  This is the last Tyco toy to come to our house.  I have learned my lesson, and I'm telling everyone I know.  I hope Amazon will list essentials to make toys operate in the future, and if they have been duped by Tyco as the rest of us are, I hope they will send Tyco these emails.  You haven't screwed us Tyco, you've screwed yourself.",1.0
"I purchased a Tyco motorcycle toys and a Tyco Rewinder(looks like a space age race car) for my 7 year old son and my nephew.  I understood AA batteries were needed for 1 and a 9volt for the other toys.  I happily purchased the aa and 9v battery packs.  So excited to see their faces on Christmas morning open these gifts they both had been asking for.  That surprise was quickly shot down, when after inserting the battery, it did not work.  Upon reading further and calling the 800# we were extremely disapointed to discover we needed a Flexpak battery and charger.  I returned the toys to the store and purchased other RC items for the boys.  I hope everyone responds in letting TYCO know that the packaging is deceptive and misleading.  I will steer clear of any TYCO item.",1.0
"I had purchased a Tyco RC REWINDER for my 6 year old son for Christmas that, "" I thought only needed a 9v battery""... To my dismay on Christmas Day, we found out that it also needs a FLEXPAK.

However, seeing what others have said on this toppic I feel it is VERY MISLEADING! If companies such as Tyco reads these comments, please understand that it is heart-breaking for children and parents in these circumstances. So now I have to get $40.00 to complete my son's toy. Thanks for the headache.",1.0
"Color us unhappy, and count us among the ex-Tyco toy customers...we don't know how much fun the toy is because it still sits in the box...unused. We were (unhappily) willing to purchase the battery pack after noticing the tiny print that said

battery sold separately, but cannot even find the battery in our local stores. We too had an unhappy child on Christmas Day as he

was waiting for the chance to try out his new Terrain Twister...alas ...no battery.

Never again. See...we did learn from the toy.",1.0
"My 9 year old son recently purchased a TYCO-Roll Cage remote control car for approx $30.00.  He had taken his allowance money, which he has been saving for some time to Target to purchase something.  This is the toy that he chose.  Upon his selection, we reviewed the package to determine battery needs, even asking a sales representative if our understanding was correct.  2 AA batteries were required but not included.  It also indicated that the TMH Flexpack battery was needed, but we were told that as a specialty battery, this should be included.

Imagine the disappointment once we got home.  My son opened the box only to discover that this specialty battery was not included.  The next day we returned to the store to get the battery and we were told that they did not normally carry these.  He referred us to several stores, including Toys R Us, Radio Shack, Walmart, etc that shoudl carry these.  We drove around for 2 hours to all of these stores only to be told that they either do not carry these, or were out of stock.

Finally, I resorted to going online to order one.  I was shocked to find out that it would cost me basically $40.00 to purchase this product.  This is more than the cost of the original car.  Needless to say, I felt obligated to purchase since my son had worked so hard at saving for this toy.

Let me just say that I think this is ridiculous. Had we known this upfront, we never would have made the purchase.  After reading the multiple reviews within this forum, apparently we are not alone.  We will never purchase a TYCO product again in the future.  I'm sure some marketing person within the company figured out that this would increase the bottom line, but in my mind this is a very deceptive process that preys on the vulnerabilities of children.

Now he will have to wait an additonal week to get the batteries, and the toy sits in the box in his room.  I guess this was a good educational experience in that it teaches my sone that coprporations like TYCO, do nto really care about the consumer, it only cares about greed!!!!  He'll definately think twice the next time.",1.0

I would have to echo the review from two disappointed children!  I was also sucked in by the toys r us marketing that suggested the 9.6 volt battery.  We live in the Northeast and had a great snow storm last night and were all set to use the terrain twister for our son while we shoveled today and low and behold the battery isn't the right one.  It wasn't cheap for the 9.6 volt and now we have to purchase (first find) the flex pack battery.  I don't know if it was Tyco or Toys R Us that thought up this marketing scheme but it was a good one! The reason my review is all 1 star is because we haven't been able to try it out!!!!!!!!!!!,1.0

"I ordered two terrain twisters for my parents to give my two boys for Christmas.  When I ordered them, your website suggested that I also buy the 9.6 v batteries and chargers.

My children received their gifts from their grandparents yesterday and we charged the batteries last nights.  When we tried to use the terrain twisters this morning we all discovered that we actually need a flexpak battery.  This is disgraceful.  Why would your website suggest buying an expensive battery for a toy that it does not even fit?  Now we have to locate and buy the correct batteries at an additional expense.  Shame on you.",1.0
"1 week ago I got online to purchase 2 terrain twisters for my children for Christmas.  I noticed that you received the flex charger for free with the purchase of the terrain twister.  I didn't order it at that time because I wanted to make sure they still wanted the product for Christmas.  4 days later I got online to do my ordering and I noticed the toys was out of stock.  I went to other online stores to find the terrain twister and they were out of stock, also.  I called local toy stores to find the darn toy and no luck.  The next day I got online again (toys r us site) and they had the terrain twister in stock!  In my excitement, I grabbed my credit card to oder the toy.  Guess what!  Not only was the charger not free with the toy, the stupid toy went up in price!  What a racket!  Toys R Us sits and waits for us desperate parents to see how far we will go to buy their toys.

"PROFIT! PROFIT! PROFIT!  I would like to see Tyco's listing of the gross margin on products.  The specialized batteries and mating chargers have got to be at the top of their list!  There are numerous name brand chargers for nickle metal hydride batteries for less money, but they don't work on TYCO.  Making the charger and battery separate is a wonderful way of cutting costs for toys but then they WAY OVERCHARGE for it separately.  If it wasn't useable on several toys most customers would be in open revolt over the outrageous price.  It's a brilliant marketing move that makes their toys look like a great deal compared to toys that have to include the battery, and could be a great savings for everyone in the industry (look at standardized RC car batteries) if they would either charge a reasonable price or make it standardized so other manufacturers could use it.  But then they would have to compete based on overall value or not make as much profit on the speciallized chargers.  It's the same method they used to overcharge on their previous ni-cad battery packs (smaller and cheaper to make) rather than using industry standard RC batteries (much more powerful for less money).",1.0

"I will never buy a Tyco product again. I went to the store to buy my 8-yr old a remote control toy. We chose the Tyco Terrain Twister and only realized once we got home that it required a specialized battery pack that was NOT included with the $60.00 toy. The battery pack is $30.00!!! While they disclosed on the front of the box that it required a regular 9 volt battery and the TMH battery pack, it was not prominently displayed and the TMH battery was especially made to look like it was included in the box. Most parents accepted the fact a long time ago that batteries are not included with toys, but have always thought that it was limited to one of the various regular sizes.  I have no doubt Tyco, by their deceitful merchandising techniques, encourages that misunderstanding. I called the manager of the store and she apologized profusely for the misunderstanding and told me that she's received a lot of complaints about this very subject.  She offered to take the car back and encouraged me to buy another brand that was a little more expensive, but included everything. Naturally, since we had already purchased the car, I was not about to tell my child that he couldn't have because the manufacturer was deceptive. Congratulations Tyco! You got me! But I can assure you that I will never buy another Tyco toy again.",1.0
"The rating should read minus 10! As if the world needs more disposable over priced garbage, this rechargeable battery pack is hazardous waste, yet the manufacturer Tyco/Mattel refuses to disclose the type of battery contained in the Flexpak, which means, as a consumer, you are stuck with this thing, it is irresponsible and possibly illegal in your community to dispose of rechargeable batteries in the trash, many are highly toxic.

"I would like to be able to rate this toy but I this brings ""batteries not included"" a new meaning. Grandma bought this for my 6 year old son for X-mas. I seen batteries not included so I thought plural, but I was wrong. I don't know what Tyco was thinking about when they placed that on the box. I spent almost a full week hunting these ""batteries"" with no success, until one place. But to my shock they were out with no idea when they would get any more. So, now my son does nothing but pushing his rewinder around the house. I wish I could rewind time so grandma would not buy this.",1.0
"Our 7 year old son also received the Rewinder for Christmas and was VERY disappointed when we did not have the correct battery.  So much so that he gave us a deadline of January 12th to find the battery or he didn't want it.  I had no idea it needed a very specific battery pack, and frankly, would never have bought the toy once I found out how expensive it was.  At his age, my son loses interest in toys pretty quickly so it's just not worth it.  I guess Tyco has to find ways to compensate for all the financial bungling their top executives have burdened the company with.  It's too bad since, in the past, we always felt the Tyco remote-control cars were well-made and worth the money.",1.0

We have been all over town searching for the battery pack....Walmart, Target, Toys R Us, and even Radio Shack.......Not one of these stores in the Ft. Lauderdale area has it.  Needless to say, by now my son has lost interest, and it is going back.  Tyco toys will not be coming into this household anytime soon.",1.0
"I don't feel so dumb now after reading all the other reviews here.  When we purchased the car(Target had a whole WALL of them on clearance before Christmas--now I know why!)the first thing I did was read the package, scrutinizing it for the battery requirements.  The only thing the package stated was required but not included was a 9 volt battery.  I am a pretty savvy shopper/parent and that didn't sound possible to me that this amazing toy ONLY needed a 9 volt battery.  I read the box again and yes, it did show a picture of the battery pack, but made no mention of buying it separately.  I scanned the shelves to see if there was a display of special RC batteries and found none.  Still suspicious, I tracked down a Target employee and asked him to look at the box and tell me if I am making a mistake or do I really ONLY need a 9 volt battery.  The employee read the entire box in front of me and declared, ""No, you just need the 9 volt battery.""  Then he quickly brought me one and I made my purchase feeling confident that I had covered all the bases.
Christmas morning came and in the chaos of all the wrapping and gifts for two kids I did not notice Vertigo had been unwrapped until my 7 year old son, assisted by his father, had DESTROYED the box and packing material.  A veteran shopper, I cringed and crossed my fingers that the toy would not need to be returned for any reason, but seeing how excited my son was, dismissed the notion quickly.  I went to locate the 9 volt battery I knew I had on hand so that my son could immediately enjoy his FAVORITE gift.  Five minutes later we had determined that ""Yes Virginia, it does need a special battery!""  My knee-jerk reaction was, ""We'll be returning that toy immediately.""  Then I recalled the package problem and told my son, ""We'll just have to wait until after Christmas and pick up a battery.""  Anyway, today is the first chance I've had to look into it, and much to my chagrin, it is painfully obvious that is not going to happen.  So as I sit here now, with the useless pile of plastic and rubber next to my left foot I think I just might cut my losses and walk it out to the trash.  Pickup is tomorrow morning.",1.0

"Santa got my son the Tyco Vertigo for Christmas.  I have searched all over town for the flexpak, but everywhere is sold out.  You can say all you want about how people should read the packages, but the fact is the stores are not even stocking enough batteries to be used with the toys that are sold.  Shouldn't they at least have as many batteries as they do toys that take these batteries.  I think that it is irresponsible for a company to allow companies such as Wal-mart, Toys R Us, Kmart, Target, and Meijers to request a large number of their toys without re-enfoircing the fact that they will need special battery packs for these toys to operate.

I purchased this item for my 1 and 3 year olds. The boys loved it but within a few weeks it became unusable.  One of the velcro tabs used to keep the coils together when storing it fell off so it no longer folded up flat.  I think that led to pressure in part of the fabric so the metal that creates the coil shape tore through the fabric.  Due to this sharp protruding metal we can no longer safely use the tunnel. I would not recommend that people buy this product.,1.0

"It is poorly designed. The answer is not clear to see when the button is pushed. Even you can read the answer, it can be easily hidden by the finger. The question (A x B) are painted on top of the button, and it can be easily worn out. I can't believe a product of such a poor design can be put for sale. It is already 2011! I have to return it.",1.0
"I have bought this product for years and I absolutely love it, it's fairly simple to maintain and incredibly cool to watch butterflies develop from caterpillars. However, this particular product from this seller was damaged and had a pretty big hole ripped in the side of the netted butterfly garden. The box it came in was tattered, damaged, and haphazardly-taped closed with Dollar Tree quality scotch tape; but initially that didn't bother me because I didn't need the outer box to use the product inside. Again, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Insect Lore product, but I will definitely be buying it through another seller in the future.",1.0
"I have had three babies in 2.5 years, so needless to say, we have a ton of baby stuff in our house.  This by far is the worst purchase I have ever made.

First of all, it says it's meant for babies ages 6 months to 2 years.  That is a joke.  My baby is 9 months old, and if he pushes even a little on the sides, the whole tent ROLLS OVER, with him inside, as there are no stakes to anchor it into the ground.  Completely dangerous.

Then, I was under the impression that the opening was a zipper, but it's not.  It's Velcro.  He stood up against it, and the velco all came undone and he came tumbling out.  Luckily I was about a foot away from him so he didn't actually hurt himself.

Overall, this tent is dangerous and useless.  I bought it so I could have a safe place to contain the baby in the yard while I played with my 3 and 2 year olds, but I would be better off to let him just chance it in the grass.  The only baby this tent would help contain is one that doesn't roll, crawl, or move in general (so a newborn, pretty much).  And newborns are content and safely contained in their infant carriers, so this tent actually serves no purpose.

I am so unhappy with this purchase, I am going to try to send it back immediately.",1.0
Bought this for a family trip to Lake Tahoe.  We had it up in the sun for about 2 hours before the rubber part around the poles at the top melted.  It was only about 80 degrees?  Very disappointed and had to throw it away.,1.0
NOTHING like Lincoln logs!!!! Missing some pieces (including log pieces needed to put a roof on) & many of the pieces have splinters!!!! Not safe for a child.,1.0

Bought this for my 6yr old for Christmas but never actually gave it to her cause its really hard to see the answer numbers when you push down on one of the buttons. It would be nice if it lit up or something to make it easier to see. I returned this item and I will be buying the Leap Frog twist and shout multiplication instead.,1.0
Very poor design..The results are difficult to read as the box is semi transparent. The worst thing is the results are superimposed on the print. I forgot to read the comment before buying this. So had to return this back to Amazon for a refund.,1.0

Product would get 1 star. I tried to put it together when it arrived...not only was it hard to bend the poles to get them in place,  but it took FOREVER to do! Not what I want to do in the hot sun at the beach.  I returned it & bought a different one.",1.0
"I had to return this item, as there is no larvae in the set. I am glad I checked the contents, as this was intended as a gift.

The worst thing ever I couod possibly buy. I wish I read the reviews before ordering!",1.0
Don't buy. Bought for children and most pieces were not cut evenly which made building unstable. Cheap materials. Cuts are inconsistent and not centered. Learned my lesson. Stick to the original Lincoln logs.,1.0
Not impressed with this set. Notches are not cut level nor do they fit snugly with each other. Roof pieces slide off the roof with no way to anchor them. One roof piece was warped and won't lay flat. I won't purchase again.,1.0

"Angry rant follows.  I've used these cages (and several others by different manufacturers) for many years.  I've probably purchased a dozen of this exact model, many from Amazon.  These are, as the Amazon description says, ""A family and classroom favorite for almost 50 years.""  They can be bleached, stored, and reused.  From year to year, the dimensions sometimes change a bit or the fabric component has a different pattern, but until now, I have found the quality of this Insect Lore cage to be excellent.

However, the two cages I just bought do NOT have the clear, vinyl lid still pictured, but rather -- for the first time ever -- super-crummy, lightweight, slippery, nasty, horrible, no-good MESH lids!  This has been terrible for my monarchs and a real annoyance for me this season.  Like many larvae, these little guys like to wander about, spreading their silk around the ""roof"" before settling down in earnest to place a serious silk button and screw in their wee cremasters for a good, safe hang before pupating.  With the old vinyl lids, I never had a problem gingerly unzipping the flap to maintain my Late Johnnies who were still eating while their siblings continued to dangle safely and securely.  No worries:  the silk stayed in place.  Insect Lore should know that a critical function of a semi-stiff, clear, zippable plastic lid is that you can DO such maintenance.  It is essential to be able to remove frass or swap out fodder while leaving attached chrysalises secure.  Unfortunately, this lousy mesh does not provide a proper surface for secure adhesion of the silk, nor anything else.  The entire RAFT of silk has come unstuck on each of the new cages.  A couple of chrysalises have fallen as a result.  Now I must hang entire batches by pinning -- a technique I don't happen to prefer, but I guess it will do until the season is over.

The new mesh lids do not allow me to tape up a fallen chrysalis, a method I like a lot when a cremaster cannot easily be tied by thread.  The mesh is so slippery that I can't even slap on the adhesive office notes I use to track dates, numbers, and instars.  They just fall off.  I have to PIN on the bl**dy notes now.  Agh!  More pins!

The original design allowed perfectly sufficient airflow, so I can't see that as an argument for the change.  What on earth was Insect Lore thinking?  Cost?  Just charge me a dollar more, please.  I'm returning these, but can't do it until the season is over because I need the real estate.

I'll close by saying that if you've read this far (gosh, I'm sorry) AND if you only plan to use this cage once to rear a cup of Painted Lady larvae you got with a coupon, then you may be much happier with this new version of the product than I am.  Your larvae, if they are of similar size, are likely to pupate at about the same time, and you're probably using that insta-food in the jar they gave you (it looks like yellow goo).  You might be ignoring the frass (caterpillar poop), because it's so difficult to remove from the jar.  If that's so, you won't be doing any real maintenance.  You won't be hanging fallen chrysalises nor slapping on a dozen Post-It notes for record-keeping, as I do.  So my advice to you would be to buy this silly thing and ignore my rant -- just DON'T mess with the zipper once you see those chrysalises hanging, if you let them do it on the cage lid, outside their jar.",1.0

"I bought this for my grand daughter several years ago, she loved it .  I ordered it for a gift and no caterpillars you get a voucher to to redeem for them.  I tried to redeem the voucher and it says it is not valid.  So in order to use this kit, I have to pay $15.95dollars for the
caterpillars plus $  7.95 Shipping charge.

I have an email saying it was successfully redeemed, now they tell me the order was never place.  Extremely upset with this company, call, go online, chat with someone, now go back and order it again, how can I order it when the voucher is already redeemed.",1.0
Received game quick. But it was nothing like I thought. It is on a roll out mate and is very small. Hard to see if you have a lot of people playing on a big table. Returned item and got the board game at Target.,1.0

If you have worked with them before, I am sure you will find that the product they now provide is not what it was, and definitely is not worth the money.  So very, very disappointing.",1.0
Definitely not esay to put together.  I cannot even imagine trying to set this up at the beach with sand blowing and the sun blazing on you.  I returned the day I received it after spending over 2 hours trying to set this up and the bars cracking.,1.0

"Two year-old couldn't open the blue carton. Now, at three, still can't. I liked how plain it was and thought it was an extra bonus that it was ""educational."" Silly mama. Get this instead, my kid's friend has it, and my kid is obsessed with it: TOMY Little Chirpers Sorting Eggs Learning Toy. It's even a little cheaper.",1.0
I have seen these eggs in the store but a different brand. Compared to those these ones are made of a very cheap plastic. The eggs are  really hard almost impossible for my two year old to pull apart. Also the clasp that closes the container is even tricky for me to get shut! Very disappointed in this product!,1.0
"First thing, is I bought it thinking you would be able to make both items pictured, (because I have 2 Grandsons, and they play army men, so 2 buildings was perfect),  plus it doesn't say on the box that you only build one at a time, very misleading, the instruction booklet doesn't even give you any instructions for the second one.  Second thing and the one thing I am very upset about, is the uneveness of the pieces, I could not even build the log building because the pieces are cut so uneven, it falls over because it is lopsided, I even took it apart and tried different pieces, didn't matter, still sits lopsided. I should've  sent it back, but I procrastinated, now it is too late. So I will have to sand some of the pieces down to make them fit each other, then I am going to glue them together, so they can at least play with them. I would not recommend this product.",1.0
It's so expansive . and my daughter didn't like it.,1.0
Caterpillars came to us dead. Company said they were hibernating. 7 days half passed and caterpillars have not even moved. Really crappy return policy. Too much of a headache for what it's worth.,1.0
Eggs were too hard to open for the adults. Only one or two opened easily so there was no play value for the kids,1.0
Way to complicated to follow the directions to put this together ... i will plan to send it back to try to find a pop up version.,1.0
Definitely not what I expected.  Purchased to keep my infant out of the sun at the beach.  Very difficult to assemble by yourself and doesn't have stakes or sand pockets to weigh it down.  The poles to the tent are very cheap! Returning!!,1.0
"Had the original version with nice foldable playing surface. Deluxe version is identical except you get a piece of rolled up oil cloth for the playing board. Had to mount it to plywood before we could use it. Great game but don't waste your money on the deluxe version and receive an inferior product.

"Read the product Description that I pasted in below! MISLEADING!!!  They CLEARLY say ""Butterfly larvae with food shipped directly to your home"" they DO NOT SAY THAT IT WILL COST YOU $7.95 TO SHIP IT!!!! Not only that, the voucher says that it is a ""small $7.95 fee"" for shipping an handling.  This is cookie cutter false advertising! They know that if they said it would cost $7.95 to ship, nobody would buy this and just order another kit for cheaper in total where the larvea come with the kit.

Product Description
Witness one of nature's most spectacular transformations up close with this reusable, collapsible habitat. Fine, transparent mesh lets you see butterfly metamorphosis up close. Product includes easy-to-use feeder and complete instructions for habitat. Butterfly larvae with food shipped directly to your home. The habitat collapses for storage when not in use. You can adopt and raise a handful of caterpillars, watch them transform into painted lady butterflies, then lift the garden cover to release your beautiful specimens into the wild. This exciting habitat makes a fabulous introduction to the miracles of nature. The larvae and food available round the year",1.0

"this is a flimsy product.  it does not block the sun and I question the UV protection.  I wanted to use it for the beach but when we put it together in the yard it was clear this wouldnt happen.  aside  from practically blowing away, the sun was beating through it and it was  annoying to put together.  I wanted something that just popped up and down and with this you have long bendable rods that get in the way.  I returned it quickly.",1.0

I am very disappointed with this item. I payed more thinking it came with caterpillar because was a kit. And only came with a net. Now I have to pay more for the caterpillars. It's ridiculous!!!!!,1.0

"I ordered this kit since it states it is shipped with live caterpillars. After ordering it, my voucher does not work and they only have e-mail. They say I have to mail the voucher.

Reading one of the other posts about this product containing lead, it's going back for sure.",1.0
"I bought this tent for my 4 1/2 month old because it stated on the description that it offered UV protection.  We were going on a family vacation and I needed something to protect the baby while on the beach.  This product is a waste of money if you need it for the outdoors:

1.  It does not say UV protected anywhere on the packing - this is a lie.  I contacted the company twice about this and they cannot provide me with an answer.  They will not confirm or deny it, which is false advertising.

2.  There is no way to anchor the tent.  The tent was blowing all over the place.  I had to put bags inside to weigh it down.  I didn't even put my baby in there for fear she would blow away.  I brought it to the beach the first day and didn't even bother bringing it back.

If you want the tent for play indoors it should be fine but do not expect to use it outdoors especially if it is windy or sunny.",1.0
Item did not hold up...after a few uses the mesh split apart. very disappointed in the quality,1.0
"This tent is really cheap, and I dare to say it's dangerous for kids, it arrived with brown stains (like it was used) and one of the poles set was broken, it went directly to trash because I don't want to return it and make them able to send it again to another kid. Awful, awful, awful!!!",1.0
This was slightly disappointing! I opened the box to get the Boucher so I could send off for the caterpillars and hopefully receive before Easter and there wasn't one!,1.0
Very disappointed. I bought this kit as a gift for someone and on top of that they have to pay an additional $8 to get the caterpillars??? I was so embarrassed to basically give my niece half a gift (basically the netting) and have her parents basically pay more to get the actual caterpillars. This should be charged all at once and the voucher for the caterpillars should not have another $8 attached to it. I was really looking forward to getting this for a lot of kids in my life but I will absolutely not be purchasing this anymore. So embarrassing!!,1.0

"The so called ""free"" caterpillars cost $7.95 to ship. If it was just a couple of dollars I wouldn't mind, but tacking on nearly 8 more dollars to this already not so cheap activity is ridiculous. You hardly get anything in the box. It's literally just a mesh pop up hamper with a zipper over the top. Total rip off as far as I'm concerned. Making a butterfly habitat is cheap and there are so many ideas online. It was only worth the money to me because you also got caterpillars. I'm returning this item and I will buy caterpillars from another company that doesn't make me feel ripped off. For this price they should include a nice workbook or something, not a flimsy pamphlet the size of an index card. There are other places to buy caterpillars if you search for them. I'm off to search now.",1.0

I wasn't going to wait for strike 3 before deciding to return it.  Typically things like this come wrapped in plastic bags, parts maybe sealed individually prior to being put in the box.  Maybe this company is ecologically conscious, and skipped the plastic.  But this was just stuffed into the cardboard with no such wrapping, further leading me to think this was returned/used/whatever.  Strike 3.",1.0
We have done this 4 times with great results . But the last set of butterflies was faulty. One never came out of its crystalid and shortly there after the remaining  4 all died and 2 never could fly . Very sad . They were a sickly bunch. I wrote/called insect lore no response .,1.0

He loves catching bugs and I was hoping he could keep using it for that after we release the butterflies, but it's so flimsy it's not going to withstand much use.",1.0

"My 4 yr old received this as a birthday present and it was the first thing he wanted to open.
What a total piece of JUNK.
- The directions are the WORST I have ever seen. Incomplete, wrong and unclear.
- The track DOES NOT stay together. It falls apart even while you are putting it together. And in places where the track passes other track it is too tight.
- There are NOT 3 trains in this set-up. There is one wheel/battery base that the 3 tops can REST ON. And watch your train go around the track and top continually FALL OFF.
- There is a section of the track that you rest the 2 unused tops on and the base comes by and switches tops automatically. It never worked. The wheel base either got hung up or the top kept falling off. And it is not very clear in the instructions as to how this works.
- Now here was the fun part. Trying to get the train on the track. You have to be a magician. You have to rest a top on the trains wheel base, pull down little metal, slippery, swinging bars on the BOTTOM of the base and stick them into the track goove AND turn the train on at the same time. You CANNOT turn the train on once it is resting in the grooved track, you fingers will not fit. Kids and adults were ready to throw this thing out the window.
- There are little white buttons placed around the track. They are supposed to change the direction of the oncoming train. We didn't have to push the buttons the train continually got stuck going back and forth on it's own.
- Finally, there is no way to get the million pieces back into the box for storage. And you can figure on loosing all of the 12 little balls (how generous of TOMY) on the first day.
I do not know what the happy customer received but it couldn't have been the same thing we did.
We are throwing it in the trash. I considered sending it to a consignment store but I thought that would be too mean to knowingly do this another child.

"My 4 year old son received this for his birthday. It was the first thing he wanted open. What a total piece of junk!
The track DOES NOT stay together. AND it is a very tight fit  where the track passes other track. The directions are the WORST
I have ever seen. All they show is how the track goes together (and it is VERY incomplete) and it does not show how anything else is suppose to work.
You get a set of wheels with a battery inside of them and three interchangable train bodies. You set these bodies (THEY DO NOT SNAP ON THEY JUST REST ON THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT - AND  ***FALL OFF **** ALL THE TIME!!!!!)
You set the extra bodies on a specially made part of the track
and the battery compartment switches bodies automatically to do different jobs.
IT NEVER WORKED. And the directions never explained this part, we deduced this. So good luck there...
READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISSAPOINT YOUR CHILD. You have to be a magician to turn the train on and get it on the train at the same time. The bodies do not snap on the wheel section they just rest there - in order to facilitate the switch mentioned above. (And they fall off very easily) then once the body is resting on the wheels, you have to pull open little metal bars, on the BOTTOM of the wheel base (that rest in the track grooves) AND THEN turn it on
These little bars swing very freely and are slippery. The kids got VERY frustrated.
No one could do it. If you are use to Thomas quality you will NOT find it here.
Also there are little buttons on the track they (we think, are for changing direction - we are not sure. They never worked. Also, We were too busy trying to get the bodies to stay on the train).
I do not know what the happy people got in these reviews but it surely cannot be what we got. We, like another reviewer, are sending this huge dissapointment to the consignment store (although I will think this over, I do not want to dissapoint another kid).

There is virtually no opportunity for hands-on play, so my son just sat with a dazed look on his face as the trains continued on a circuit by itself.  The only time any interaction occured was when the train skipped the track or became stuck, and it's un-userfriendly enough that he usually couldn't fix the problems on his own.  I will be returning this toy this afternoon.",1.0

The tops keep falling off the chassis, and we have to push Thomas up the ramp every single time; whatever is supposed to aid the train against gravity isn't working.  I can sit there with the kids and repeatedly fix, push, pull, aid, and assist the trains, but the point was kind of for them to have something to do WITHOUT me.  I'm going back to the wooden Thomas sets.",1.0
"After months of asking, I finally caved in and bought this set for my son's fourth birthday.  It was tedious to put together and the pieces are poorly made.  After finally getting the track assembled, my son was anxious to enjoy his new toy.  I will say that it was somewhat entertaining to watch the train travel around the track a few times while changing to the different characters.  The problem for me is that everytime my son accidentally touched or shifted slightly against the track there would be a malfunction where the train would go off the track or the top pieces of the train would fall off.  The pieces are flimsy and my son became increasingly frustrated. My husband at one point had to tell my son to stay away from the toy and that he couldn't touch it, but to just simply watch it go around the track.  If you want a ""toy"" that you can't engage in and do not get frustrated easily during the assembly process than this is the toy for you.  MY son likes to actively engage in his play, so this didn't fit our needs. We finally put the pieces back in the box, and I told him we would return it for something else tomorrow.",1.0
"My son received this toy as a gift for his birthday.  We set it up with no problem, except that the tracks come loose very easily.  Every time my son pushes it with his foot while sitting watching it or just touches something, it comes loose.  Also, kids like to play with the trains not just watch one at a time go round.  Neat how it works, but my son gets upset that he can't play with Percy, Thomas and the crane at the same time.  It only has one battery powered base and it drives around and drops off percy then picks up thomas.  In my opinion, it's not worth the money.  I agree with what the other reviewed said about the wood set.  The wood set now comes with a electric/battery powered engines.  Much better and great for the imagination.  Endless possibilities instead of one scenerio.",1.0
"My 2-year-old received this for his second birthday.  It's not a toy for kids to play with at all.  An adult must set this up in exactly one way and everything must be done perfectly for the toy to work.  All a child can do is watch the toy go.  This toy requires and allows for no creativity at all.  Sure, the one time we set it up it was kind of fun to watch go, but as soon as it gets off track or taken down, it requires adult help to reset.  All my 2-year-old could do (and this goes for older kids too) is wreak havoc with the toy.  My advise: buy one of the wooden Thomas set that a child could actually play with.",1.0
"We got this train for our daughters 4th Birthday and when we took it out of the box the main train that pulls the rest was broken. We tried to figure out how it goes together and never did so she has not got a chance to play with it! The box was in great condition so I really do not know how it was in so many pieces when we got it! I am not happy about that, but as far as fun...can't say due to it never working!! I hope others that purchase this toy have better luck that we have had.",1.0

"I remember this toy from the 1980s, one of my friends had one. I found one at a fleamarket (the original 1977 version, called Big Loader), and excitedly set it up. What an utter waste of time! I can't believe that as a kid, I though this was a neat toy, and almost as good as my Big Trak. It's a sorry state of affairs when pointless rubbish like this is still being produced, but quality educational toys like MB's Big Ttrak are forgotten - when the technology to make the latter would be inexpensive and vastly improved over the original.
Tomy - and all toy makers - by all means, raid the past for good ideas. But everyone else has said it, and I'll say it too - this toy is pointless, has no staying power, and is a shamful attempt to cash in on a classic British story character.",1.0

"It was pretty easy to assemble, but we tried to use it for the beach with our 4 month old and it wasn't a success.  It kept blowing away, wasn't 100% sun protection and it was hot inside. When it blew away we got sand all over the little guy - which was a BUMMER! It would be nice if it had little pockets on the side so you could shovel sand into it. For an infant and beach use, not the best purchse for us.  Probably good for parks and when it is a bit cooler.",1.0
"For our first child we had the quick cabana we loved it!! It however only survived two years with an active toddler, two dogs and a cat. This time we opted for a cheaper version intended for the beach. It is awkward to put up especially on a windy beach. You have to watch the direction of the sun because sun gets through all sides. The vecro closure is a pain. To weigh the tent down we had to put our beach bag in it not leaving much room for our nine month old.  If you are looking for a tent for little ones to play inside and intend to keep it up this is the tent for you. If you want a tent for the beach or just to be outside.  Go for the quick cabana. We loved that tent and wish we would have spent the extra money. This tent for us has become a playroom tent.  You get what you pay for. Wish we would have gone with the quick cabana",1.0

"Insect Lore DOES NOT stand by their guarantee.  My daughter received this as a birthday gift last fall and very patiently waited for it to be warm enough to ""raise butterflies"".  She literally anticipated this for months.  The caterpillars arrived and there were only 2 of them.  At the time, I had no idea there were supposed to be 5 of them.  Both caterpillars formed cocoons after 4-5 days.  We watched You Tube videos and read lots of instructions anticipating their transformation.  My daughter was like a mother hen watching them.  The first emerged last Friday and seemed to be doing well.  The second emerged Saturday morning and appeared to pass away shortly after.  By the time we arrived home that evening, both butterflies were dead.  My 7 year old was completely devastated.  She requested that we bury them. A bit crazy, but hey, I'd do anything for my kids.  I promised her that I""d order more and was surprised to find a ""guarantee"" on the Insect Lore website. They apparently are supposed to send 5 caterpillars and guarantee that 3 will become ""healthy adult butterflies"".  I immediately contacted them (Saturday evening) and late Monday evening, I received a response requesting a photo of the butterflies. What kind of morbid person takes photos of an occasion such as this when their child is so upset?  I sent the one photo I had taken of the first butterfly shortly after it emerged. I received a response today that without a photo of the dead butterflies, their guarantee isn't much of a guarantee at all.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!",1.0

"WARNING: Our credit card number was used to purchase round-trip plane tickets from the state where the live caterpillars are shipped from, the day after paying for the caterpillars. Our card company notified us immediately and said that this issue has happened many times before with this company - in fact, it is flagged in their system.
This is how the rest of our experience with the Insect Lore kit went: We bought 2 kits, 1 for us and 1 for our neighbors kids - the kits are so cheap that we thought it would be fun to do them together. Then they arrived - despite being described as ""including live caterpillars"" on the boxes we ordered, we had to order them online. So much for it being a great gift. We pulled our neighbors caterpillar ""coupon"" out so we could order it for them (bringing the total cost for 2 kits to close to $40!). FYI, the website will not allow you to order multiple cups of caterpillars to the same address or use the same credit card for multiple orders. Despite the fact that the shipping boxes are designed to hold 4 cups of caterpillars. That being said, it's for the best that the caterpillars are shipped to you separately, or they may sit on the shelves for too long and die. Both sets of caterpillars were set to arrive on a Wednesday. Our neighbor's did arrive, but our didn't. They arrived to my husband's office on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, while we were out of town. Luckily, we were able to pick them up Sunday night and they were still alive.
After 1 week of chowing down on the green goop in the cup and wallowing in their own excrement, they have formed chrysalises. Unfortunately, some of our caterpillars were not satisfied with eating the green goop and they also ate half of the paper liner at the top of the cup, making it nearly impossible to transfer them into the mesh enclosure. We're on day 3 of our butterfly watch.
Our daughter is fairly interested in the project, although she'll probably be the most excited when the butterflies hatch. If this review was just about everything that happened once our caterpillars were safe in our home, this would be a 5 star review. However, having our credit card stolen by the livestock company loses this product 4 stars (more if I could).

"We were very disappointed with this kit.  We followed the instructions exactly.  We used purified water, temp control, lighting, aerating the water, feeding etc.  When the sea monkeys ""hatched"", we could barely see them.  But after a few days they got bigger and we were getting excited.  We had about 30 of them.  Then by day seven, all but two of them died! If you are going to buy this, get the air pump ahead of time. Maybe that will help. The light also burns out quickly because it is battery operated. They make these creatures out to be like little people.  The fact is, they are very small, fragile and much more care taking is involved than expected. I would gladly do it if the little creatures would live long enough to get some enjoyment. The guarantee is also only for replacement, which requires you to send them a shipping fee! I don't want to bother with it.",1.0

I contacted Insect Lore but did not hear back from them.  Fast forward to Wednesday and all five were dead, lying in the bottom on the cup, some sunken down into the brown stuff that comes in the cup (nutrients for them).  Needless to say, my daughter is very disappointed and if we want to have a 'round two' and give it another try I now have to pay full price for the caterpillars.",1.0

They then responded by saying that their guarantee is only that you end up with three butterflies, not that you receive the five caterpillars they advertise they are selling you, and that I should write them back if I don't end up with three butterflies. They additionally stated that if I wanted more than three butterflies, I should have purchased the larger kit.

"I wish they would make a Trivial Pursuit for teenagers, and one for adults.  I really like the format and the idea behind the game. As a teenager, I really enjoyed the questions, but with this edition I find that  the questions are way too easy.

Some of  the questions even contained lame hints to the answer! I tried to salvage  my ... investment by buying the Know-It-All cards, but I was disappointed  with those, too.

"My wife bought this for our 4 1/2 year old son for Christmas.  We set it up and it didn't last one day (not 24 hours).  Of course he managed to break one of the poles.  They are FLIMSY!!!  OMG, really, really FLIMSY!  They can bend for the curve they need but not much more. Okay, I called the company.  Yes, they could ship me a pole but they were doing inventory (they were on the fence about this; not really certain of what was going on or when items would ship).  Maybe they could ship one by the 7th or so of January.  I could place the order but it would be held until it could ship (no kidding?).  I waited a few weeks, no big deal, my son has tons of toys to play with.  Now their site indicates that the replacement poles are out of stock.  Really!?

And it is worse than this.  Their site indicates 4 different poles are available for this model (20200): 20200-P-114, 20200-P-118, 20200-P, and 20200-P-115.  Seriously?  It's not like the part was marked with a part number (that I could find).  What's the difference?  After calling customer service the answer is: the last number is the length of the pole you have, in inches.  So, the -114 is for 114 inch poles, the -118 is for 118 inch poles, and the 115 is for 115 inch poles.  Wait what's the -P one for?  Your guess is as good as mine.  So, unless you call them, you are SOL on figuring out which pole your child's set needs.  Also, what this means is that this outfit is producing products from a variety of Chinese (yes it was made in China) manufacturers and/or getting these poles from wherever is cheap, regardless of lengths (you should hear my story about Horrible Freight Polyester rope which was braid over...wait for it...a scrunched-down run of DIAPER material which had been printed in reverse (meaning the words read backwards (I kid you not one bit))).  Those folks over there waste NOTHING!  So, I wonder about the Chinese sourcing these rods.

So, at the end, I've got a broken toy which shouldn't have broken in the first place but the materials were flimsy and weak, and now no way to replace the needed part because the company went from ""we're counting stuff, we can't ship stuff"" to ""we're out of stuff"".  <sigh>  Really?!

Everything about this company that I've encountered screams, ""We're a little group who buys stuff in bulk from China and sell it with no real design or plan other than to make money and no power over the suppliers to appease our customers' demands for parts.""

Not happy.

"I am so shocked by just how cheaply games are manufactured these days. This one is no exception. The two mallets are constructed of very thin plastic. The one appeared slightly warped when removed new from the packaging. The frame is made in two halves you have to connect together before playing. It was easy enough to assemble, but getting it back apart for storage was very difficult. I thought I broke it. The polar bear that sits atop the iceberg is not made to actually attach like you would expect. He has one plastic tab protruding from the bottom of each foot. The tabs are of exactly the same size. The directions don't offer any indication as to why each foot has a tab, and either one would appear to fit in the slots on the iceberg, but neither actually do. If you use the one, it makes him lay parallel to the ice. Maybe he is ""falling""? The other would make him stand in an upright position. Neither one of them fit securely enough though to do either. He just kind of hangs there, sideways on the verge of toppling out of the slots all together. I even tried to secure him to the iceberg before placing it in the frame during set up, and it doesn't happen. Lastly, I assume the frame has been manufactured in two pieces instead of one, as was the original version so that the packaging can be smaller. Shelf space in a store is of a premium as is shipping and must be a concern for manufactures. Getting the disassembled frame, all the ice blocks, and the two mallets back into this new packaging is not. It is ridiculous. To top it off, the box is flimsy so don't plan on using it to store the game. I am just so completely disappointed in the quality of this game. Hasbro has ruined a game I really loved and had such fond childhood memories of that I had hoped to make with my grandson.
I don't know that I have ever made a return to Amazon and I am pretty certain this is maybe only the third product review I have ever written, but literally, this game arrived in the mail less than two hours ago and now it is packed, labeled, sitting next to the front door to head to the post office for return.
FYI The game Ker Plunk by Mattel is also in the box for return. Essentially the same reason. Both games are made of such poor quality, they are obviously meant to be disposable- and that being sooner than later. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money. I plan to look elsewhere for an original version of both games.",1.0
"The game build quality is poor.  You have to spend 30 minutes punching out the cards and holders, inserting the cards into the holders, then putting the holders into the boards.  Then the card holders will constantly come out of the boards, and the cards comes out of the holders.

The game is also not that challenging for all but the youngest players since the character traits are not that varied.",1.0
piece of junk,1.0
"This is a great game. I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French. Lots of fun, easy to play, not determined by chance, teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful.

Unfortunately, the new edition is very shoddily designed. The cards are flimsy, and they fall right out of their holders when they're flipped (or sometimes when they're *not* flipped).

Ultimately, the game is almost totally unplayable!

This is very disappointing to all of us. I'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game, and I'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster, I'll probably get brushed off.",1.0

"After wasting a ten dollar Amazon credit, I chose to send it back, it required you to make an additional payment to get the butterfly larvae. The little boys I got it for were very disappointed. It should have been stated before purchase.

"Pegs are too wide and far apart. The frame is made out of cheap material. The stick shuttles were not sanded down properly and were unfinished, making them snag onto any yarn used. Not worth more than $10. A very disappointing purchase.",1.0

"This is pretty much my least favorite game that my children have ever owned. First of all, it is a serious pain to set up, because you really have to work at getting the ""ice"" to fit in there. Little kids cannot do it.

Then, they bang on the friggin thing making the worst, most annoying sound other than nails on a chalkboard and incessant whining). This sound literally goes through my bones and I have a high tolerance for kid toy sounds.

Not surprisingly, this game has mysteriously disappeared. FOREVER.",1.0
My daughter was excited for this product.  Just ordered the caterpillars and they arrived already in centralised and broken off.  So no caterpillar experience here.,1.0
"The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However, it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up. Without forcing too much, the tent tore.",1.0
"I got this as a gift for my granddaughter for xmas. She was so exited to try it out, and when she oppened the kit, all the accessories were missing.  Very disspointing. I was hoping to be able to contact amazon to see they can just send me the missing parts or a replacement. I am ultimately mailing back and empty box.

I know that Amazon is very great about their returns but not very easy to get in touch with for this unique situation.  I have decided to just return it all together and NOT try for another.

Very dissapointed.",1.0

"this is very popular with teachers, however unless you live in california, where these larva are shipped from, as soon as you release the butterflies they will die. these butterflies are not from the northern or eastern parts of america and they will not survive. yes the children get to see the life cycle of a butterfly but you raise these butterflies to just to kill them.",1.0

"I am upset to find that I was sold something that was not needed for the Terrain Twister. The web-page on Amazon.com advertise these products to be bought together to save me money.

(GREAT) I have one dissappointed little boy on my hands right now, plus I have to go through the hassle of returning in the mail because the closest toys r us store is 2 hours away. I think that who ever sent up the sight and put the battery pack and charger on the same page should be fired, obviously there are alot of unhappy people out there and I think toys r us should be compinsating them for this screw-up that was there fault.

My son opened his terrain twister, we set it up to charge the battery, and soon found out it would not work.  Why would ToysRUs advertise this battery along with the Terrain Twister?  They gave me a refund at my local store, but now I can't find the FlexPak anywhere and am out my shipping charges.  Thanks a lot ToysRUs, I'll think twice before ordering again.",1.0
"Although this battery pack is listed on the page for the Tyco Terrain Twister as one of the things people buy with the toy, it is NOT the pack you need to power the Terrain Twister -- or a number of other NEW Tyco products -- which use ONLY the TMH pack.

I got this game cause I remembered playing it when I was younger and just loved it.  So I got it for my kids.

"I am not very impressed with this product. First off it doesn't include the caterpillars. To top that off the code they gave me to

"I have always had wonderful service from Insect Lore and now regret my most recent order.  The product itself is fine. However, unlike other kits, live caterpillars were sent rather than the ""order when its appropriate"" certificates I have always received in the past for butterflies, ants. The larvae should not have been sent, as it was sent to Phoenix in June! They arrived broiled and dead. You cannot call customer service, you may only email and get automated, rude responses to issues. My request for replacement certificates were met with a replacement shipment of MORE dead, broiled alive caterpillars, even after receiving confirmation that certificates would be sent.  Another email got no response. In reading reviews on YELP and elsewhere, I see this is a new trend for this company, horrible customer service and delays in shipping, dissatisfied customers. I don't know what happened... perhaps they were purchased by another company.  I will never, ever order from Insect Lore again.  Teachers, be warned!",1.0
We bought this toy to replace a tent that was falling apart (that our kids loved and used in the house). This one was way too small. Good for one kid only.,1.0

"Expensive and a little bit of a scam, with the mail in voucher for the caterpillars, PLUS $5 additional shipping charge.  Do not recommend.",1.0
"Received this as a gift.  It comes with a coupon to redeem for larvae.  Okay so far...until you try to redeem your coupon.  For some reason they require money to redeem the coupon for ""processing and handling"".  Kinda sucks to give something as a gift that then requires the person receiving it to spend money just to use it.  But the fun may not stop there: for us, the coupon code didn't even work.  Messages to ""customer service"" are completely ignored.  So we didn't even get to experience receiving dead caterpillars in the mail yet, so I feel cheated of the full experience.

Never in a million years would I give this as a gift to anyone I personally liked because it's a terrible experience.  A satisfaction guarantee is only as good as the company behind it.  Maybe if they let the caterpillars run the company things might improve - it could hardly be any worse.",1.0
"My kids absolutely love this toy, however, I have noticed a lot of fine bright blue powder-like particles when I am sweeping our wood floors.  Being a nurse, I am very concerned that if I'm finding this 'dust' two and three rooms over from where the tent is set up, that my kids are actually inhaling it into their lungs in addition to tracking it all over the house via their socks.  Thusfar no one has mentioned any strange blue streaks in their Kleenexes when they sneeze etc but since 2 of my kids have had problems with bronchospasms and wheezing in the past I am taking this tent down until I hear from the manufacturer as to what is going on.  Has anyone else noticed this problem?",1.0

"We received this item as a gift.  Of course my kids were thrilled about it! It comes with a certificate for a cup of caterpillars, but you have to pay an extra $5.00 for shipping.  When I placed my order the company never shipped the caterpillars.  After a month of corresponding with them, they finally shipped them.  4 out of 5 of the caterpillars were dead on arrival and the 5th died shortly thereafter.  Insect Lore is not responding to my requests for a refund on my shipping costs and a return of my gift certificate to use at a later date.  This is a great idea, but I don't think sending the caterpillars in the mail works very well and the company does not have very good customer service.  I'd recommend staying away from this product and company.  I hate seeing my kids so disappointed!",1.0

"When I ordered this product a week ago it was called ""Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden Shipped with Live Caterpillars.""  I ordered this kit because it was supposed to contain live caterpillars.  I paid more for it and in addition I paid for shipping (the kit that didn't have the live caterpillars was cheaper).  When it arrived there weren't any caterpillars.  I contacted the company and they told me that they didn't understand my confusion but that they would update their description to make it more clear.  In addition- they changed the name of the item so that it no longer says ""live caterpillars.""  I feel like I was deceived by the company and would not trust them again.  They shouldn't be able change the name of the item when someone complains that they did not get what they paid for.  I would definitely never trust this company again.  Thankfully, when I contacted Amazon they made it right for me.",1.0

"I'm really surprised this game has almost a five star rating.  I got this for my two girls a couple years ago when they were six and four years old.  They love hitting the ice and seeing who does it the fastest, but that's the only plus for this game.  You constantly have to set it back up after each game which takes a couple minutes once you find all the pieces that have fallen on the floor or rolled across the room.  The set up alone is a pain, putting it away is a pain, and it's a noisy game.  You get what you pay for... junk.  Needless to say, I got rid of it.",1.0

"I have a 3 year old and it can be difficult to find games that aren't too difficult for her but still fun for the rest of us. My kids, ages 6 and 3, were totally excited to play this game as was I until we discovered that you spend more time putting the cubes into the frame than you do actually playing. It's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids. Then, all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls. My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell. They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that's really only fun once or twice. I think we played it about four times in the past year. I hate to be down on any kind of game that brings the family together or gets kids involved in something away from the tv/computer, but this game is just annoying to set up and dull to play.",1.0

He has no glasses but he does have a mustache. He has sprouted legs with tieless shoes instead of old-fashioned blue brogans. His arms are short and stubby with no elbows. He's not the spud he used to be ... or the spud that is pictured.",1.0

Very disappointed.  I ordered the classic version which was pictured and received the mustached Potato Head.  I did not want that one!  UGH!!!!!!!!!  My star rating has nothing to do with the toy itself.  I'm sure the mustached Potato Head is fine but I really needed the other one for educational purposes in my classroom.  The one star is for the deceptive picture.,1.0
While we did get a potato head it wasn't the classic potato head I was looking for. From previous reviews it looks like they just send out whatever which is frustrating because then you have to go through shipping it back & refunds & reordering things when all I want is a simple potato head. Just provide what you advertise & we'd be all good!,1.0
"My excitement was soon deminished when I got my butterfly farm in the mail. I was expecting to start my farm right away...but no...you have to order the caterpillars, pay an extra $5 for shipping, then wait another week for them to come in. When they did finally arrive (which they were 3 days late) all the caterpillars were dead. The only way to contact customer service is through email. Which is extremely frustrating. I emailed them letting them know I hadn't received my caterpillars yet. They responded ""should be there shortly"". Then emailed them again about all the caterpillars being dead....no response. It's been two days & I've sent 3 emails & still nothing. I'm extremely disappointed in this company. I'm returning all 4 of my farms & will be contacting Amazon & the BBB.",1.0

Even my very patient and persistent 4 year old couldn't get these ants to jump right. I myself have tried to figure out the 'trick' to it so I could teach them but have had little luck.

They haven't wanted to play it again and when I suggest it they refuse. Today we tried it a different way, we put the pants in the middle of a hula hoop and have the kids stand around the outside and try to toss the ants in. They enjoyed this much more as it was something they were able to do.",1.0
"DO NOT BUY THIS WAGON. I expected so much more from a brand like Radio Flyer, but my child ended up injured due to shoddy materials and craftsmanship. First, the handle disconnected from the wagon due to too short of a screw. I went to the hardware store and got a new one, and that fixed it. But a month later, out for a walk, the entire back panel disconnected from the wagon (nails ripped out clean) and my 2 year old daughter fell onto the street and her head was lacerated and bleeding badly. There's no excuse for this poor quality, especially for products designed for children.",1.0

"Received as a mess
- Misaligned Frame
- Had to pre-drill some of the holes our self
- Should have been sold as an openboxed item
- Damaged Product
- Missing Assembly Hardware (several)
- Not all components were still on factory bags, etc.

Experience:
1. Opened outer box. Pulled inner box out (with wagon inside). As we lifted the inner box, parts just started falling out into the outer packaging. It was then we realized the box had been previously opened and terribly re-taped as only partially closed!
* See Photo

2. As we layed out the parts per the instructions, we discovered many parts were NOT in bags (previously opened). 2 Bolts and 4 Nuts and 1 Red hub cap were MISSING.
* See photo of hex bolt (example), we dug up a few from our tool shed.

3. As we assembled using our own parts, we noticed the frame was shaped like a leaning rectangle. Had to hammer it with a large rubber mallet to partially re-align.
* See photo. This was as close as we could get it. It was twice as far out.

4. The frame had a chip of wood missing from the corner. This was ""as received"", not from hammering. Maybe previous owner whacked it before returning? IDK.
* See photo.

All in all, our little boy was super excited to receive a nice red wagon. At the end of the day, he was happy but what it took to get it to a usable and somewhat aligned should NOT be the consumer experience and NEVER cost this much.

If you are going to sell open box, not inventoried or an un-inspected mess -- then advertise it like that and maybe charge 80% LESS than we paid for this junk.

Not worth trying to return nor trying to explain to a young child why they have to give it back. We will keep it as our best option. Strongly recommend you search for a better product or at least a better QA department. Terrible experience.",1.0
"I placed an order for both butterfly and ladybug larvae more than a month ago (March 30). It is now May 7 and still no larvae and no contact initiated by this company. I am currently on hold (28 min wait time) for my 4th call with them.

My first two follow up calls were met with a response stating the orders were processing. No apologies for the delay. My third call, yesterday, resulted in an internal inquiry  and the opening of a ticket for my two orders. This morning, I did get a response to ONE of them, stating there was a glitch in the computer system and the larvae would ship - didn't say which ones. No response still regarding the second one. Yet another call today, connected me to a rep who ""unfortunately"" could not do anything other than open another ticket.

At this point, this is bordering on ridiculous! I am now on hold with them right now - apparently 15th in line with a wait time of approx. 28 minutes. Hopefully, they will either ship BOTH my orders before the summer is out or cancel them.",1.0

We ordered caterpillars over 1 month ago. I have contacted them by email and via their company's website ""contact us"" page 6 times and have not received one response. I decided to take time out of my day to call them and was on hold 30 minutes before someone answered. She asked me when I would like my caterpillars, which I thought was really odd. I stated I wanted them as soon as possible since it has been a month over a month and my kids are anxiously awaiting them. She said they are on back order (their website says ""in stock""). She couldn't guarantee me a day when they would arrive, but it would be next week. Well, it's next week and still no caterpillars. My children are so frustrated. I'm more than frustrated! I've spent way too much time on this whole project. I will never purchase anything that has to do with this company again.

So I send an email to customer service, and get only an automated response. I wait two more days, send another email, and still no response. I call again - this time, hold time is only 35 minutes!

"You recieve the kit and inside is a voucher, you then have to buy the caterpillers for 5 more (usual price is  11.99). The poor little guys arrive via Royal mail in a tiny box with a cup inside.

Now we lost 4 catterpillars i wasn't sure if they had died or if it was normal behaviour, so i left in the cup for a day or two whilst i messaged insectlore to ask.....no reply. so i used google and did the best i could. i removed the dead catterpilars. We had one which turned into a butterfly but he has crippled wings. Now he sits at the bottom of the mesh bag looking sad unable to fly. I really cant bare to kill him so I just help him as best i can with his fruit, sugar water and flowers I put in his enclosure.

"Wow.  This has been a disappointment.

The wagon thing stunk when it arrived.  Not quite a gasoline smell, but close.  And yes, it is the wagon, not something from the UPS truck.  It was inside the box.

Assembly is tedious, requires materials (oil) not included, and the suggested tools for assembly would extend assembly time to at least 2 hours.  Thankfully, I have some tools, so rather than use the suggested adjustable wrench, regular flat head screwdriver, pliers, and a hammer,  I used a ratchet/socket combination, needle nose pliers, flat head and cross-head (ratcheting type) screwdrivers, and a hammer.

The cross-head, ratcheting type screwdriver is essential for putting together the side supports.  Using a flat head screwdriver would take forever to drive the 20 screws for the side supports.

The needle nose pliers are essential for insertion and bending of the cotter pin.  Regular pliers would not easily reach the confined area.

The ratchet and socket were essential for tightening down all the locking nuts.  Doing that same job with an adjustable wrench would be tedious.

One wheel is bent or the axle shaft is off, so I will need to call and get that wheel replaced.

So far, this is a disappointment.  Hopefully the wheel comes in a few days or the whole thing is going back to Amazon.",1.0

Both those games by BlueOrange teach balance awareness and practice dexterity as well as being fun for both kids and adults.  I know the point of Spill the Beans is teaching the same concepts but its just not fun.  Don't spill the Beans is both flimsy plastic and boring.  The pot doesn't stay straight even with no beans on it so it don't take much to spill the beans.  I even tried putting coins in the pot, but that didn't help.

We got one and the wooden frome was cracked on the end on one side. Not sure if it was cheap wood (made in China) or if it was dropped during shipping. The box it came in had no protection on the side if it was dropped.

"The only thing ""Deluxe"" about this addition is the glossy foil cover of the box, which is designed to make you think you are getting something special by paying more money.  Nothing could be further from the truth. This edition screams ""CHEAP"" from the second the lid comes off.

The board is a quad-fold affair, redesigned presumably to allow a smaller, less expensive box. It has much less rigidity than the single-fold board of the ""classic"" version. When it is left out for an extended period of time, especially overnite, the ends of the board curl up and refuses to lay flat.

The houses and hotels are completely featureless, just small blocks of wood. They looked to be dipped in some type of vegetable dye rather than painted. This is probably an attempt to eek out a few extra cents of corporate profit.  The ""bankers tray"" and ""property wheel"" are flimsy plastic jokes. Neither would last under play by children much more than a few games.

This edition is a sad legacy to a classic game, and the cheapness of the set detracts from the joy of play. For the additional cost, all you are really getting is the fancy foil cover and one extra play token, plus a board that curls up at the edges: Whoopee!

My advice: Save the extra money and buy the ""classic"" version.",1.0

Horrible experience!!!! The cards  are dirty and the chips arrived in bags that look like they were taken out of the trash,1.0
This is a horrible company!!  This product does not cost $14.88. All you get for this price is a large fabric bag.

"My first impression was how heavy the carton was that the wagon came in. It certainly wasn't from metal content. There is a good deal involved in turning what you recieve into a completed wagon though the job is simple enough.
It HAS to be mentioned that the floor of the wagon is not metal. It is of some sort of particle board by appearance and if left outside a single time in the rain I doubt if the wagons floor would maintain any integrity whatsoever.
Rather than going through the hassle of sending the thing back I instead went to a NAPA store and bought some 3-M spray on undercoating, the rubberized type. I then masked off all areas surrounding the exposed ""wooden"" portions of the wagons flooring and top rails (not the red stake parts, just the wood of the wagon body itself). I then applied 3 spaced 36 hour apart coats of the spray on ""tough"" rubber undercoating, making sure to get into every nook and cranny and now hopefully have a wagon that very well might survive a night left outside with rain or even dew. The undercoating is also some pretty tough stuff that tends to stand up to rocks thrown up by tires into vehicle wheel wells. In short I did what I could with what I was provided. But long gone are the days of the Radio Flyer having a metal floor. At the price I feel ripped off severely by the product as delivered. Time will tell how well my undercoating will work. If you do the same thing I did, remember that the undercoating requires some heat to set up properly. I put mine out on the front deck during the day as the days were sunny and of course the black undercoating got quite warm. At night I brought the wagon in and set it in front of the pellet stove to maintain warmth to help with the curing process.
As mentioned the undercoating is black but if you mask off the parts you don't want covered you end up with a product that actually looks rather nice.
Of course all this would have been completely unneccessary if it had been made clear that the major portion of the wagon was made of some inferior wood byproduct. I have no idea why the company went away from metal. The wagon will be used primarily by my wife in hauling some of her plants about the property but I'm sure the Grandkids will get to play with it some too. I can only hope that the undercoating allows the inferior bottom material of the wagon to maintain some degree of integrity.
I DO NOT AT ALL recommend this product to anyone. It is simply cheaply made and for what you get, vastly overpriced. I got ripped in other words.......and in afterthought I should have returned the item and looked for an old ""real"" Radio Flyer at an auction or garage sale. Where I live almost precludes that as I live in a VERY rural area.
Just please view the data supplied in this review and really give some thought to whether you want to spend north of $100 for a product worth a quarter of that amount.",1.0

"As a preschool teacher, I thought this product would be tons of fun for the kids. They would be witnessing the stages of life unfold right before their eyes. Wrong!

It made me sick to think that I played a role in their demise..the thought never crossed my mind that shipping could kill them! Therefore, I feel the need to warn anyone else that may be considering this purchase. Check out the other one star comments-there are many that say the same thing. I can't imagine who would dislike these comments as well..hmm..maybe the people who would not be gaining profit?!

That's bad enough. What's really, really awful about this game is that the dictionary contains a number of what it calls ""improper spellings"" of words, such as ""et"" for the past tense of ""to eat."" It contains a limited number of foreign words, chosen on a purely arbitrary basis, such as ""oblast"" (Russian for district). It permits obscure slang such as ""za"" for ""pizza,"" and strange words never heard in conversation or seen in books, such as ""showerer"" (one who showers). I could go on, but that would put me at the same level  as the annoying blockheads responsible for this travesty of the English language. OK, it's pretty cute to see my child trouncing his family by digging up words like ""rebuy.""  My advice: Buy your kid ""Bananagrams,"" which uses the Miriam-Webster dictionary.",1.0
It's been 6 weeks since I placed my order for the larvae and still nothing...  Horrible customer service.  My 5 year old is really disappointed that he cannot use his birthday present he was totally excited about initially.,1.0
"Be careful if you order this and expect to receive the butterflies any time soon! Particularly from Amazon.  Tried to order with the coupon, but was not able to as they cannot ship to Texas now due to the heat.  Called customer service and was advised that Amazon was not informing customers of this when they order.  She said there were 3 other states they could not ship to until September 17.  Since this was for a 5 yr old, was very glad I had decided to order BEFORE giving this to her as it would have been a big disappointment to her.  I think Amazon should either not sell this or provide full information.  Of course the products customer service was aware that this is happening with Amazon.  Just be careful if you are ordering where you live.",1.0
"The butterfly net was fine. But, it would of been better if we actually could get the butterflies! The Insect Lore company is TERRIBLE with customer service... absolutely horrible. I tried 5 times--no joke!--to get the free caterpillars per the coupon that came in the butterly net package. And 5 times was told to leave a message for customer service--no one ever called me back. And, 5 times was disappointed and left frustrated and angry that I couldn't get anyone to filful my order. I originally ordered the caterpillars online but for some reason my order didn't go through right. So, I got a letter in the mail saying to call or mail in payment again. I wanted to call thinking it would be easiest that way and 5 times got nothing. My daughter was sad over this because she so badly wanted it. Oh, and at the final attempt, I asked the person on the phone who couldn't help me AGAIN and advised that I leave ANOTHER message for customer service that Insect Lore did a big promotional campaign and because of that couldn't handle all the calls coming in for ordering--three words for Insert Lore: Not My Problem. If you say you sell something then sell it and treat your customers right because now, they lost me as a customer forever. So, buyer beware... if you want those free caterpillars get ready for headaches. I finally gave up and returned the net.",1.0
"First I like to say that I am not frustrated with Amazon or Insect Lore company.  My daughter received the Butterfly Garden for her birthday after doing a project at school and she wanted this as her only birthday present.  She was so excited to receive and I thought it would be something fun to do as school was letting out for the Summer. Plus, it would still keep her interested in something educational.  At first my daughter was a little disappointed as she thought the caterpillars came with the garden, so I had to explain that we needed to order them and it would take a couple weeks for them to arrive.  So I ordered the live larvae on May 15th, using the certificate that came in the box with the garden.  The certificate mentioned that it would take 2 to 3 weeks for the order to come in.  After 3 weeks and my daugther asking me when will they get here, I emailed the customer service email that appeared on the certicate but after a couple of days, I had no response so I decided to use the email address which showed up on my paypal transaction.  I received a response the next day saying how sorry they were and how they ""had a short delay with new hatches but now getting caught up and have scheduled the order to ship the week of 6/18/12."" They mentioned they would send me a shipment notification when shipped.  So I waited and waited until June 25th when I contacted them again since I was concerned that I was going on vacation and the caterpillars would come in but no one would be there to receive.  Since finding out my order still wasn't ready to be sent out, I asked the company to hold up sending my order until I came back from vacation.  I received a shipment notification on July 10th, which was after my vacation.  So I waited again until July 18th and said that I still haven't received my order.  I received no response from the company.  I emailed them again stating that if I didn't receive my order within the next day or two that I was going to dispute the charge through my credit card company.  Still no response.  Then I finally received the caterpillars and my daughter was so excited that they finally arrived.  A small carton (3 inch cup) came in with a lid and what looked to be lumpy sand, but thought it's larvae so we really won't see anything right away.  The instructions that came with the cup said that if you don't see anything moving, gently open the lid and blow lightly in the cup and you should see something move.  The only thing we saw was a little thing that looked like a piece of string, but no movement. So we waited again for days and everyday my daughter would peek at the cup to see nothing. I seriously doubt that anything will miraculously appear at this point.  So now I have a very nice net (garden) with nothing in it.  Great idea but so not worth the aggravation!  Wish I could rate this zero stars but the system won't allow anything less than one. I just can't imagine that I am the only one who had an issue with this compnay.  I would just hate to see anyone else's child be so disappointed like my daughter and that's the real reason why I am writing this review to avoid others from frustration and disappointment.",1.0

"I am very angry and feel like my hands are tied.
I just got off the phone with their customer service department and I am so upset!
I bought one of the Live caterpillar kits for my daughters birthday. The kit arrived 5 day AFTER I expected it with DEAD caterpillars and a clump of dirt or something. When I called today (a week after their delivery) I pretty much got this, ""It is too hot to ship them to your area this time of year"". Well that would have been nice to know. The only thing their website says about weather is that if it is too cold you cannot release the butterflies.
The CS agent sent us a voucher for 2 specimens of caterpillars, but will not be a good idea to ship until weather is below 80. That is rare in the south. They tried to make it right, but I am so upset I was not warned of this before my purchase. Kids grow out of phases so quick, I hope it will still interest her 2-3 months from now.",1.0
"The Product description does not say if it works on Windows7 - very important information. I would like to buy it but I need that information first. I have the game on CD for Windows Vista, but it is not compatible with Windows7.",1.0
"The Livestock company is a disappointing rip off. I had one of these as a kid and it was awesome. Times have changed.

I received this as a gift. It's the gift that keeps on taking. My complaint is mainly with the caterpillar distributor and the complete and total lack of legality and ethics with which the company packages and advertises its products. It's clear no attorney was consulted in any of this because they would have been dis-barred by now.  You have to pull teeth to get them to honor the $5 coupon in the box for caterpillars. If you ever get the caterpillars, it will be literally months later the first time. If they show up alive (mine did not after 2 months) it will be a miracle. If you ask to have them re-shipped and there's something in there (mine was empty) it will be an even bigger miracle.

I am also very bothered by how the distributor seems to ship just before the PayPal dispute is going to close if you have one open.  Maybe you think I'm being a little melodramatic? Try explaining this incompetency to your 3 year old son going on 4. It's been a constant disappointment for him. I can order live coral and fish and they get here alive and thriving and these guys can't get caterpillars here in one piece (or at all) in a clear plastic Dixie cup. Pathetic.",1.0
"Very disappointing. The product was damaged and it didn't come with butterflies.  It is misleading marketing and packaging as you think it is a butterfly garden equipt with butterflies, similar to the lady bug lands but your 5 year old nephew will quickly point out with a frowny face that there is nothing in the box worth his time :(",1.0
"I bought this for my classroom this past year. I sent in payment for the butterfly larvae in March by mid April had received no larvae from the company that makes this item. I wrote a complaint and they sent me the ""larvae"" in the mail which was just the food and NO larvae in a small container. I again sent a complaint to the company. They responded they would send me a replacement a week later. The replacement came and again no worms. I would have written a complaint on their website but there was no place for one. Beware of this company! My first graders and I were disappointed! I have a feeling this company sent me no worms purposely because of my complaint. I didn't even see a dead worm; only food.",1.0
"The first time I took this out for my one year old to play with it, he pulled off the top piece and banged it against the bottom piece.  The wood on the top piece immediately split, like 4 inches, so he can't play with it anymore because he will definitely get a splinter.  Disappointed because we generally love Plan Toys.",1.0
"The thing is so unbalanced and light that it regularly tips on its own without the help of any player. It really is not worth the plastic that
you have to put the stickers on. Nothing like the original.",1.0
Bummer!!!  Would of loved to try this out.  Just a warning to other island folk.  Hope to find something similar that's island approved.,1.0
"I was disapponted in this purchase. I remember playing this game as a kid, and thought my kids would enjoy it. When the game arrived, I realized that this was a smaller, cheaper version of the game I remembered. It's one thing to be smaller, but the mechanism that lets you turn the table from side to side is defective, and sticks, so it's impossible to control the movement of the table. That's very frustrating, of course, since the whole point of the game is to delicately guide the ball through the maze by controlling the slope of the table. Now, it only cost $8, so it's hard to expect too much, but I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this product. If I were to do it again, I would go to a store where you can test drive the toy and make sure it works the way it's supposed to.",1.0
"I had this game when I was a kid, and thought my kids would enjoy.  I was appalled to learn that Amazon is able and even *willing* to sell and distribute products of such low quality.  This is nothing like what I had as a kid although the photos on Amazon make it appear to be the same.  This one is virtually unusable given how poorly constructed it is.  This whole experience is just a waste of my time -- not sure if worth going through the process of returning it.  Will probably trash it or give it to charity (although they probably wouldn't want it either).",1.0
Thus was a cheap imitation of the real game.  I'm offended that this cheap product is sold on amazon.  Would not recommend this to anyone.,1.0
"Since Brio is no longer sold in the U.S., I chose this version of the classic toy as a gift. Sent it straight back, though. It's nothing like the original. Smaller (the balls are tiny!) very light and flimsy, and poorly manufactured. Pooled glue around the barriers on the playing surface. It's not even like the photo on Amazon or the one on the box it comes in! The proportions are smaller -- I checked by counting the dovetail tabs: 13 in the photo, 11 on the item. It feels like it's made of balsa wood. Humph.",1.0

"BUYER BEWARE!!

If you are reading these reviews then this will likely be IMPORTANT TO YOU!

I don't know what Amazon and/or Hasbro is trying to pull here. The majority of the reviews for the product pictured in the primary image and evidently being sold, pre-date this particular edition and are referencing the TRADITIONAL edition of Clue, most likely the last traditional version sold from 2002-2008 (the one with the miniature figurines as moving tokens). There is a separate product page for this exact same edition of the game currently being sold here, which has reviews specific to this edition of the game.

So the REVIEWS ARE MISLEADING. The product page established in 2008 FOR THIS GAME has the correct rating for it -- an average of THREE AND A HALF STARS and NOT the FOUR AND A HALF STARS given to the traditional game of Clue from 2002 this particular listing was originally set up to sell, and incorrectly depicted on the other three representative images for the edition being sold.

BOTTOM LINE -- READ THE REVIEWS FOR THE OTHER LISTING FOR THIS EDITION BEFORE BUYING!! THOSE ARE THE CORRECT REVIEWS which express many buyers disappointment in the horrible reinvention Hasbro tried to foist on an unsuspecting public. It represents a shallow, narcissistic, vain image, with emphasis on money, popularity, rumor, gossip, and tabloid sensationalism. The characters are egotistical socialites, with no redeemable qualities, stereotyping women as starlets and social butterflies, the men as celebrities and club hoppers, stressing the importance of material possessions, and social networking over deductive reasoning.  It's also unnecessarily complicated, includes baffling rules that allow for elimination of players well before the game is over. Unlike the traditional edition which is set in a different time, using farcical stereotypes of a bygone era, this reinvention places the action square inline with today's pop-culture and social mores, the line between acceptable behavior and pretend in a family game may be unacceptably blurred for younger players, and at a minimum tedious for adults.

The MOST HELPFUL REVIEW which comes up first for the game they will sell you on this listing, is for the TRADITIONAL version of Clue, beloved by millions worldwide and remained unchanged for over 60 years. It is by no means written for or endorsing the NEWER version they will ship you.

Again, I don't know what Amazon is doing here, because there are many third party sellers who most likely are selling the correct edition (the one with the miniature figurines as moving tokens) who are not able to sell their games because buyers can't find it. Amazon is doing a major disservice to their sellers here. Moreover, this shouldn't happen as each product should have a distinct identification number to prevent this from happening.",1.0
The picture shows the classic clue game with statues of each character...that is what I ordered. I was given the new version of clue! This is not the one pictured! So very unhappy...You should not show the picture of the clue game if that is not the one you are selling and shipping!!,1.0

"I purchased this version of Clue specifically because of the picture depicting the actual characters in the game. That is the version our family owns and I was purchasing it for my daughter and her husband. We've all been looking high and low for the version in the picture.

You need to change the picture that misrepresents the product!!!",1.0
"My expectations were probably too high because the quality of this game when I was a kid (40 years ago) was awesome.  I remember tons of beans, a stable game and set up for up to 4 people.

Customer service could not send out the actual product I wanted because they said the same might happen again. So now I am stuck. I would just opt for the cheaper version if interested in this game. Who knows they might send you the delux version.",1.0
"Insect Lore is un-truthful - The whole thing is neat and fun but Insect Lore, the manufacturer is full of butterfly gunk. They said on the box you get 5 butterfly larve. In reality you get ""3 to 5"" which in reality is 3. You talk to them and complain and they say even though the box says ""you get 5"" they reserve the right to mail out ""3-5"" instead.

Not at all - cheap imitation is an understatement. It is going back and I am going to keep looking for the real thing.",1.0
"If you like tons of tiny pieces to clean up... And tons of choking hazards this is the game for you.

Pros:
Idea is neat, balancing beans until the bowl tips over.

Cons:
Around 60 tiny plastic beans to clean up.
Surface of the bowl has very little traction so beans slide and tip off very quickly.
The game is too hard for children under 8, and not interesting for children over 8.

Suggestion:
Buy ""Don't Break the Ice"" instead... Kids love it and it is made by the same company and runs the same price.",1.0
"Who the hell would let a 3 y.o. play with this toy, with so many small and life-like plastic peas?  Particularly, the round and smooth shape make the peas easy to be stuck into the kid's nose and/or swallowed. There is a lawsuit waiting to happen.",1.0
"We bought this for our son for Christmas.  It is a total piece of junk.  It does not work well-spills the beans with only one bean on it, plastic is very poorly made and thin.  Not worth the money at all.  Very disappointing.",1.0
"The components are flimsy and the gameplay is almost non-existent. It's barely an activity, much less a game.  Pretty much my girls like twirling the pot in its cradle and spreading the beans across the floor.  Even the smallest of children find playing the actual game to be pointless.",1.0
"This is definitely not the same game I remember playing as a kid. This version is cheaply made junk. The bean pot is made of two thin plastic halves that snap together. It's supported by ""hands"" that are even flimsier and make the pot tilt in one direction before you even put any beans on it. Even if you try to load up the opposite side of the pot to balance it, it stays tilted and the beans all end up sliding down to that side and off the pot. My 4-year-old daughter and I tried playing it several times until we both got frustrated with it. Now it just sits boxed up in a corner of her playroom, because whenever I ask my daughter if she wants to play it she says ""No, it's no fun"".",1.0

I live in Canada so they sent the package with the butterfly container but cannot ship larvae to Canada.  You aren't told of this until you open the package.  I emailed the company twice and asked if they had any ideas or Canadian affiliates but no one responded to either email.  So, now I have a $36 butterfly holder that I could have purchased at the dollar store.",1.0
"I assume that this product would receive a 5 star educational value rating, but I don't know since it has been a month and a half since I ordered the the larvae and I have still not received it. Three weeks ago, I sent the Insect Lore an email letting them know the larvae hadn't arrive and the CEO and founder, Pat White, promptly replied with the shipment date (that it, not a hello or anything), which was almost a month ago. After sending Pat a follow-up email, she never replied. Since then I have sent two more inquiries and Pat has never replied, nor have I received the larva. My daughters are pretty sad about this. I am frustrated. Not sure if there is another company that sells butterfly larvae, but you may want to save yourself the money and hassle and order this kind of product somewhere else if you can.

Very disappointing.",1.0
"Someone gave me this as a gift a few years ago, and all I had to do was mail in a postage paid  postcard, and voila...they send you the critters.

I HAVE TO PAY AGAIN TO GET THIS THING GOING!!!.....hopefully when I get the caterpillars I don't have to send another check somewhere for something.....RUINED THE WHOLE THING FOR ME!!! I wish that they rolled all the b.s. postage & handling into one price.

"After my toddler son watched dozens of commercials for this product (at his mother's house) it was a must buy product. I had thought it would be educational, so why not. I am sorry I did though. It was supposed to come with a book detailing what would be going on during their transformation, a ""home"", food and a coupon for the caterpillars. There was no book included even though I paid extra for it, the ""home"" was a pop-up plastic and net container, the coupon had to be sent in with $5 extra and it took about 4 weeks for caterpillars to arrive. It will be interesting to see if they actually make it. Would not buy again.",1.0

"I got the Buttefly Garden for my 4 and 5 year old children. We followed the directions exactly.  The first butterfly to emerge from its cacoon came out with mangeled wings that never extended out from his body.  The rest of the butteflies emerged fine. After four days we set the other butterflies free. We were going to keep the damaged butterfly and care for him through his life-cycle, but when the others flew off, he crawled like a shot to the top of the garden and right out. He wanted to be free, so we let him go, though I don't know what chance he has out there.
My children were not traumatized in any way, still it was a bummer of an experience. They were so focused on the damaged butterfly that they barely noticed the others. Clearly, if I could do it over, I would not have ordered this product.
I don't blame the butterfly company; clearly nature trumps advertising. Still, I wanted to let others know that its not always all rainbows and sunshine with these butterflies. Things can go wrong.",1.0
"I purchased this item because I find the full-size Sequence game excellent. The travel version is USELESS.  There is only one card of each kind, which makes it almost impossible for either player to win, and there is absolutely no strategy involved. I would NOT RECOMMEND this game.",1.0
"I got this for an international trip I took with my kids.  I did not open it before.  I thought it was the regular sequence just small.  It is a version of sequence.  little pegs that are hard to pick up, tiny cards that remind me of something that came out of a gumball machine.  Very disappointed.  I would rather get a regular sequence game and take it out of the box for a trip.",1.0
I bouhgt a butterfly garden for my grandson. You have to order the catpillars separately using their special coupon code. I did this but the caterpillars never arrived.  I wrote & called the company for an explanation but they refused to help me because they had no record of the sale due to the fact that it was purchased through Amazon.  They did offer to ship more butterflies for $3.00 if I had the receipt but I had only my Amazon track record whicjh they did not accept.  As a result I paid another $21.00 for my caterpillars in addition to $15.00 for the original set.  Not a great bargain - their customer service could not have been less helpful!!,1.0
I was really disappointed because this is really not sequence - the directions are not clear and it does not have all the spaces and cards. Does not live up to the real game at all. I wanted a travel version of the real game not a crappy substitute.,1.0
We play the full sequence game and really enjoy it. This game basically has one location for each card and one deck of cards. There is little to think about and it's really not fun in anyway. The small pieces only make it more annoying. I would not suggest it to anyone for any purpose.,1.0
"My son for months has danced around whenever he sees the commercial for Live Butterfly Garden on T.V.  He looks at me and says ""Papa, please"" and ""Lots a fun!""  I finally ordered it.  When we opened it and he saw the box he literally squealed with delight.  After looking inside I quickly realized there were no caterpillars but a certificate that you have to mail in PLUS pay 5 dollars to get 3-5 caterpillars.  I tried to make it positive saying ""Oh, in a few weeks we will get the caterpillars to turn into butterflies!""  After a few more seconds of looking he frowned, tossed it on the floor and said ""Oh, man.""  He's two years old and knew he had just been ripped off.  Disclose that info in the commercial please!!!",1.0

Then it would take another week to get here.  The customer service woman was not helpful one bit and I am still without anything for my daughter.  Sneaky marketing is what it is to buy a product and then to spend more money to actually get the caterpillars.  Horrible customer service.  She did offer that I spend 40$ to overnight the stuff, but sorry we don't do anything extra.  Can you tell I am very frustrated!  I put one star because I don't have the actual toy to rate and that is a big deal in the quality of the product.",1.0

However you must purchase additional butterflies (and when you go to the Insect Lore website you see that this ""kit"" costs just over 8 dollars).  My enclosed coupon code for the ""free"" larvae (actually $3.00 for shipping) didn't work, either.  Extra cost and hassle.",1.0
This toy is more plastic then it is Steel.  It is not at all what I expected.  The value is not there and I am very diastisfied for the amount of money I paid for this.  Live and learn.  I feel that I would have been better off going to the store to purchase.,1.0

Inhumane treatment of animals! ""Insect Lore guarantees that at least three of the five caterpillars you receive will grow into adult butterflies."" That is a pretty high rate of butterflies not emerging. WOW! And you incurage butterflies to be raised in winter to live lives in tine cages?

""What is wrong with releasing butterflies at weddings and other events?
This well-meaning but misguided practice spreads diseases to natural populations, inappropriately mixes genetically distinct populations of the same species, may disrupt migratory behavior of native butterflies, confuses scientific studies of butterfly migrations, and usually results in the untimely death of the butterflies released. Please see Butterflies at Weddings for more about this subject.""

We followed the directions perfectly but did not have a single butterfly. All 5 caterpillars died at various stages.  My 6 year old granddaughter was very disappointed and cried each time one died.,1.0

It didn't work. Good thing Amazon has a great return policy.  I then tried to buy one off of ebay  and it had different problems but still had problems.  I went with a newer smaller one and it works great.,1.0
"My son got this for Christmas we'd only played it a few times and the electronics stopped working which makes the game completely useless.  I wish he'd gotten the one that didn't talk, at least games that don't talk aren't ""broken"" and unplayable if the electrical component dies.",1.0

"This was ordered for my 4-year old daughter, with all the details suggesting that this was a complete kit. She was so excited when we received it, but I had to explain to her that she couldn't see it now, because the moths had to be ordered separately (seeing her eyes water, without an explanation she could understand, made me very frustrated). So I go online to order it, and they now want a $3 fee for shipping. WTF??? Come on guys, that is not OK. I would have returned the whole thing to Amazon, but didn't because my girl really wanted to have it. This is deceiving and frustrating. Charge the extra few dollars on the front end, and don't ask people for more money!",1.0
"After having to pay an extra $3 to receive the larvae, they all died within three days of receiving them.  VERY disappointing to my grandchildren!  If they had lived and grown to their stated potential, this would have been an excellent review.",1.0
"Sure I loved my 70's battleship game, but this electronic take on it is utterly useless and horribly designed.
First off, there is a major factory flaw: You can't input the coordinates for your ships, the computer voice keeps saying ""incorrect.""
The internet verifies this. Everyone has this problem. Therefore, the whole purpose of having an electronic version of the game is null and void.
So now you can only play it ""traditional"" style. OK- That's fine. But wait, the product is wretchedly designed that it falls while you play it
and the covers for the peg storage compartments fall right off and the scatter little parts everywhere, ready for your baby to choke on
and your feet to step on. I just played this with my son and we now hate each other. Thanks a lot, Hasbro.",1.0

"Caveat Emptor...i.e. buyer beware. Dont get your kid excited by watching the video. Because you get the kit in a few days but then realize that it doesnt include the larvae...so you have to deal with a disappointed kid and a wait time for the larvae.

i realize the fine print kind of represents this however the video is very misleading.",1.0
"Yes, it's great to watch caterpillars grow, but this is NOT a kit to hatch them.  The price you pay is for a pop up butterfly tent and a plastic pipette.  The caterpillars cost you an additional $5.

"I am anicipating my kids enjoying this someday when they get the needed larvae.  You CANNOT order the larvae online despite them saying you can.  Try their [...]and you will see (maybe it will be fixed when you check which would be great but for the last month, never). The site just tells you to call because they are having problems (for 30 days - that is not technical difficulties that is NOT having web access).  I kept waiting and checking each day presuming they would fix it - NO.  Then I called the number (NOT a toll free number) and was told the wait would be in excess of 30 minutes.  So I guess I will mail it eventually - come on company, this is 2009 so at least your phones should work.

One star because when you buy something requiring the subsequent order then you 100% should expect the ordering system to work.  Based on other reviews, the thing itself may be very nice once we manage to get it.

Update Sept 17, 2009:  I had set this aside and forgot about it after checking for many days in a row to see if I could enter the coupon online.  Finally it looks like the web site is functioning so I entered address, coupon, number, billing info, credit card number, etc. then on screen 3 when the order is being finalized it says ""due to technical difficulties your coupon cannot be accepted"".  They stay one star.  I still cannot call since they do not open until noon Eastern time.  I will try later today and see if it is still a 30 minute plus wait on a toll number (no 800 number!).",1.0
"I got this for my son's 5th birthday.  He is very excited about getting the larvae to start his garden.  However, I don't know how to break it to him that the larvae aren't coming because the company doesn't ship them to Hawaii.  I found this out a bit late.  First I tried to register online but the site won't let you.  So I tried to call and fax but the lines are eternally busy.  Then I sent the application.  A week later I got it back with a rude note that they said...""Hawaii???""  ""We don't ship to Hawaii"".  Amazon says they don't ship to APO or FPO addresses but no mention is made about Hawaii.  I thought the company could have at least offered a coupon or credit in the value of the larvae or even a suggestion as to a way that I could get larvae here.  The container itself is well made and Amazon shipped quickly as always.  I love Amazon.  The educational value?  Let downs are a part of life???",1.0

"I have been trying to order the caterpillars for our kit for three weeks!  They are still not here!  I have waited for literally hours on their phoneline.  You cannot order the caterpillars online and the fax number comes back as invalid.  They do not answer emails. DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT THE CATERPILLARS ANYTIME SOON! I will never order this for my classroom again. School is going to be over before they even get here, let alone get through the lifecycle. I am giving it all one stars, I am sure it is fun, educational and sturdy but it doesn't help much if you don't have the butterflies.",1.0
First of all .... it should be noted how small the sizes of playdoh are.... very disappointed at that for the price.  Secondly it is advertised as a 10 pack case and there are only 8 in the one we just received.  So small and 2 short of tubs is a bad investment in my book.  You could at least be honest about your product.,1.0
"I received the butterfly garden over a week ago and have tried every day to contact the seller to get the caterpillars delivered. It is impossible to get through to them. The phone is always busy, their website doesn't work, and the do not respond to email. I am completely dissatisfied and would not recommend ordering from this company.

Also, if we are ordering online anyway, why not just send the caterpillars with the kit??",1.0

I sent away for this toy based on the description. But guess what? You get the habitat but no Caterpillars. You have to send away and PAY again. They should rewrite the copy so it's clear you are just getting the habitat and nothing else. A little disappointing for the kids when you open the box.,1.0
"This was advertised as the current version with a dvd, but that's not what I received. I got an old, dirty version with cassette tape.",1.0

Missing some of the dice. I ordered a new game but received a used game with missing pieces. This was a Christmas gift so I cant return it.,1.0

This game does not even work right.  The hippos mouths don't go up all the time which just makes the neck come out and push around the balls.  The balls get stuck everywhere and make it difficult to play.  It's just plain junk.  My son was very disappointed about it not working.,1.0

"If you had asked for my opinion of this toy when we first received it, I would have given you a four star review. It loses a star right off the bat for being over-priced. This toy has three features, a squeaker button, a star that clicks when you rotate it, and a clown that pops out of the box at the end of a musical performance when you twist the handle (jack in the box). I appreciated the basic color pattern and the fact the clown doesn't have a hinged door to hide in. I used to have a nice old fashioned jack in the box that could pinch your fingers on the hinge door. So this felt like an upgrade for my littlest guy.

So where did this item lose the next three stars? About 2 months of minimal play use from my 9 month old the star stopped clicking... it turned without resistance. I figured who cares? The clown is the star of this show anyways. Then the clown decided to enter his terrible twos and refused to go to bed. Well, he refused to get back in the box. My husband attempted to fix the toy but didn't have any success. He said at least whatever broke, broke inside and thus didn't give our little one pieces to choke on. So there's that at least!

I don't think I'm nit-picking. I have 3 little ones and I have tons of cool toys that we paid less than $20 for that have worked without fail since receiving or purchasing them back in 2012 for our first child. I don't think it's unrealistic to believe a $20 jack in the box should last for a long time.... now to dig through my parents attic and find that one with the pinching hinge.",1.0
Bad game. Not enough tiles. How will a child understand that you might have to swap rule out for a different one besides there's not enough letters to go around,1.0
